JWZ was nearly hit by a crazy driver while on his bike in San Francisco ; the driver then went on to hit his friend , and then took off .
JWZ caught up with him and said , " Hey !
You just hit that guy ! " and the driver said , " Really ?
That 's just terrible , " and drove away .
But there were witnesses , a paramedic 's report , and a photo of the driver 's license plate .
I was hit by a drunk driver on my bike when I was 21 , and still have knee problems because of it .
It was a hit - and - run , and the police caught him later with parts of my bike stuck to his grille .
He was a repeat offender , too .
But because of Ontario 's screwy no - fault insurance and crappy justice system , I was n't informed of the court date , did n't get to object to him entering a plea and merely losing his license for a few months and paying a $ 1000 fine .
I got a new bike , a change of clothes , and three physio sessions out of it .
I can't think of anything more cowardly and vile than hit - and - run driving .
I hope this guy loses his car , his license , and the respect and fellowship of his community .
Monday around 6 pm , [ info ] netik and I were biking West on Harrison on the right side when a car passed me on the left , within a few inches .
I had enough time to think , " Hey , that was close " , look forward , and yell " Look out ! " before the car 's mirror hit [ info ] netik 's handle bar from behind and sent him tumbling .
The guy kept driving .
I chased after the car , pulled up to his window and said , " Hey !
You just hit that guy ! "
He look at me and said , in a calm deadpan , " Really ?
That 's just terrible . "
And then he drove off .
[ info ] netik has a giant bruise , but is n't hurt badly , and his bike is ok .
Knowing him , had this guy stopped and been even slightly apologetic , there probably would n't even have been a police report .
But instead , the driver chose to turn it into a felony hit and run , with three witnesses , a paramedic report , and a photo of his license plate .
Enjoy your upcoming lack of a driver 's license , loss of insurance , $ 1,000 to $ 10,000 fine , and possible jail time , scumbag .
You have a nice day too , Sir .
A teenage Brazilian girl has admitted to embarking on a killing spree that left 30 men dead .
The 17 - year - old confessed her murders to police in Sao Paolo after being arrested for getting into a street fight in the Sao José de Rio Preto neighborhood .
The teen told police , " I do n't have enough courage to hold a gun , but I can hold a knife .
I am confessing because I promised I would do so before becoming 18 , to avoid upsetting my family . "
According to the local police , she confessed before she turned 18 to avoid being
prosecuted as an adult .
The young woman said that she started her killing spree back in 2006 , when she was just 15 .
After her admission , police began to check her story .
So far , 11 of the 30 murders she claimed responsibility for have been corroborated .
Other cases are still being checked in the Sao Paolo , Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais states .
Police sources told reporters that the teenager committed all the murders
with the same knife , and claimed that they were motivated by , " money , revenge and for bringing justice . "
Authorities suspect she may have been hired by criminal organizations to commit some of the murders .
In Sequoia National Park , $ 1 million has been spent since 2006 on marijuana plantation cleanup alone , and the damage done to Crystal Cave will be felt for years to come , said the park spokeswoman , Adrienne Freeman .
" We are continually discovering new species in that cave , and we are letting Mexican cartels threaten to wipe that out , " she said .
[ CNN ]
As a child , my folks took me to see the magnificent trees in Sequoia National Park and I 'll never forget it as long as I live .
It 's a precious ecosystem , housing the largest trees in the world as well as countless other unique plant - life not found anywhere else on earth .
Not surprisingly , it 's also a great place to grow marijuana and that could soon become its downfall :
She 's damn right we 're letting them do it .
We 've surrendered the fate of irreplaceable national treasures to these drug traffickers , simply because we wo n't allow responsible Americans to produce their own marijuana on private property .
The consequences of our failure are catastrophic , yet the solution is painfully simple .
It 's really amazing to watch the police , the forest service , and the press just cringing and whining about this awful problem , without uttering a word about how we 're going to save our forests from imminent destruction .
They seriously do n’t have a clue .
You can read any of the dozens of recently published stories on this topic without seeing anyone even attempt to figure it out .
Their only idea is to keep pulling up pot plants , as the growers plant ever more to ensure that some survive .
Fortunately , there exists one perfect solution to this problem .
And it offers far more than the salvation of our precious wilderness .
When we fix our marijuana laws , I guarantee you , we will solve problems we did n’t even know we had .
Mr Vahidi has served in Iran 's elite Revolutionary Guards regiment
Iranian MPs have strongly backed the defence minister - designate , in defiance of Argentine demands for his arrest over a 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires .
Ahmad Vahidi faced no opposition from MPs on the third day of a debate on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's choices for his new cabinet .
Interpol has distributed Argentina 's warrant for his arrest for an attack on a Jewish centre that killed 85 people .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's line - up will be put to a confidence vote on Wednesday .
During Mr Vahidi's speech to parliament , one MP who had been expected to object to his nomination interrupted to say he had changed his mind in the light of " Zionists ' allegations " .
The comment from Hadi Qavami was greeted by loud applause and shouts of " Death to Israel " , reports say .
Under parliamentary rules , two MPs can speak in opposition to ministerial appointments .
During two days of stormy debates , many of Mr Ahmadinejad 's nominees have faced bitter opposition on the grounds of their experience , qualifications or gender .
Red notice
Interpol says Mr Vahidi has been subject to a " red notice " - or international wanted persons alert - since 2007 .
The Argentine authorities are seeking his arrest along with that of five other suspects .
Israel and Argentina have condemned the nomination of Mr Vahidi , with Buenos Aires calling it " an affront to the victims " of the attack 15 years ago .
Iran has denied any involvement in the blast at the Israeli - Argentine Mutual Association ( AMIA ) and says the case against it is politically motivated .
Mr Vahidi is a long - serving member of Iran 's elite Revolutionary Guards and he served as deputy defence minister in Mr Ahmadinejad 's outgoing government .
He was the commander of a special Guards unit known as the Quds Force at the time of the 1994 attack .
The red notice informs Interpol 's 187 members that an arrest warrant has been issued by a judicial authority , and it is not an international arrest warrant in itself .
Argentine prosecutors allege that Vahidi " participated in and approved of " the decision to attack the Jewish centre .
VIDEO - The website of Hezbollah 's al - Manar television channel reported Thursday that the supposed missile in the IDF footage of weapons being smuggled out of a Hezbollah activist 's residence where an explosion occurred earlier this week is nothing more than a metal door being taken out to the garbage .
The site claimed that the door successfully threw off the sophisticated , top - of - the - line espionage equipment used by the Israel Air Force .
Blast Israel to UN : Lebanon ignoring Hezbollah armament Yitzhak Benhorin
In wake of Monday 's explosion at south Lebanon home of Hezbollah operative , Ambassador Shalev files official complaint with Secretary - General Ban calling for full implementation of Resolution 1701 Israel to UN : Lebanon ignoring Hezbollah armament
On Wednesday , the Israeli military released footage it said was shot by one of its drones in the area of the explosion .
It said the grainy , black and white video shows Hezbollah members sealing off the explosion site , recovering rockets from the home and driving them away in two covered trucks .
Hezbollah slammed the video as a " fabrication " by Israel and broadcast its own video on Thursday depicting what it said were the true events around the blast .
The video , aired on Hezbollah 's al - Manar TV and other local stations , shows two persons loading what appears to be a steel garage door onto a white covered pickup truck in front of the building where the blast allegedly occurred .
The video , which showed no actual aftermath of the blast , also shows two uniformed UN peacekeeper and a Lebanese soldier standing nearby as the pickup is being loaded .
The UN mission did not immediately comment on the Hezbollah video .
" The random explosion that occurred in Tayr Filsay in south Lebanon that made a stir in some of the Arab and Western media has returned to its natural proportions despite efforts made by the Zionist enemy to exploit it in its repeated claims that Lebanon and Hezbollah are violating Resolution 1701 , " wrote the al - Manar website .
The website posed the question : " What were the Israeli spy planes doing in the skies of Tayr Filsay when they shot the pictures that the occupation 's leadership was not ashamed of publishing in the media outlets , some of whom rushed to adopt the Israeli position and to exaggerate the event , speaking of casualties , wounded , and mass destruction ? "
According to the website , " The inflation is fundamentally unfounded , the Israeli footage is fundamentally unfounded , and whoever builds on this lie is also unfounded . "
The website issued criticism that " without any investigation or pre-examinatino , the television stations were quick to broadcast news flashes on the screens of Lebanese , especially those who live in the south of the country , and to publish a shower of items about casualties , wounded , and destruction . "
According to the article , tensions were only high the night the story broke , but that in the morning it became clear that only a small explosion took place that caused only light damage and no casualties .
" In the Israeli footage that was released , two people are seen transferring something from the site of the location .
According to the Israelis , this is a missile , but in the footage itself , one can clearly see that the people are moving quickly and carrying something light , which cannot logically be a missile , " wrote the website .
Sheila Bair has run out of options to seize banks because the FDIC ’s coffers are running dry .
Now she either needs to tap taxpayer money via a loan from the Treasury or she has to raise funds through a special assessment on banks , who are already capital - constrained .
Via Reuters :
U.S. bank regulators are considering tapping a line of credit with the U.S. Treasury Department and may explore other lesser - known options to replenish the dwindling fund that safeguards bank deposits .
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair said on Friday that the agency would meet at the end of the month to discuss options to rebuild the fund , which has been significantly drained by a sharp increase in bank failures .
" We are carefully considering all our options , including borrowing from Treasury , " Bair said , referring to the agency ’s $ 500 - billion line of credit with the Treasury Department .
She was speaking at a global finance conference in Washington .
But regulators are still reluctant to tap the line of credit because they want to avoid temporarily using taxpayer money to clean up the banking mess , she said .
Bair said the FDIC also had lesser - known alternatives for replenishing the fund , such as prepayments of assessments on banks and issuing a note .
She did not give further details on those options .
Other options include more special assessments on banks .
The FDIC has already charged the industry one emergency fee of $ 5.6 billion this year , and is authorized to levy two more .
There are some well - intentioned souls who say we should simply declare victory in our twin wars and immediately begin withdrawing American troops in contingents large enough to show that U.S. intervention is unequivocally winding down .
I ’d favor that idea , except for one crucial aspect .
We ’re up to our necks in sucking morasses in both places , and nothing even remotely approximating “ victory ” can legitimately begin to describe what we ’ve accomplished ( or , more appropriately , not accomplished ) .
My mother taught me that allegiance to the truth should always take precedence over blind religious faith or unquestioning fealty to nationalistic myths , so I ca n’t go along .
Let ’s bravely acknowledge , instead , that we got our butts whipped , and announce that we ’ll be getting our battered behinds back home , pronto !
If we did so , we ’d immediately find that the downward pull of the tar pits in which we ’re bogged would ease long enough to extricate ourselves .
It would n’t be a dignified removal , to be sure , but at least we ’d avoid getting swallowed entirely — as both the British and Soviets were in imperialism - killing Afghanistan — when their subjective pride was ultimately , lethally trumped by objective reality .
Getting out now , though far from pretty , would be much better than suffering a catastrophically history - shifting defeat along the aforementioned lines , or the abject humiliation that France endured at the hands of Vietnam at Dien Bien Phu .
Everyone understands that Afghanistan , from the U.S. perspective , is speedily going to Hell in an unraveling hand basket .
But so is Iraq .
Do you not think it ’s a sign of failure that our forces there have had to be withdrawn to secure bases beyond Iraqi population centers ?
A shameful absence of credible media coverage — or any coverage at all — ca n’t hide the fact that the last nails are presently being driven into the coffin of U.S. ambition in former Mesopotamia .
Attempting to remain in either country , when actual circumstances powerfully do n’t allow it , is an open invitation to disastrous folly .
Republicans argue that we should “ do whatever it takes to win . ”
What , pray tell , might that be ?
We could send to their deaths or terrible maimings just - graduated high school seniors from nearly every town in the USA for endlessly bloody years — at gargantuan monetary cost — and still have just a few blocks of downtown Kabul , or Baghdad , the only safe locations around .
Only during broad daylight at that .
Meanwhile , popular antagonism inspired by our heavy - handed occupations would generate fiercely anti-American recruits quicker and more numerously than rain and sunshine give rise to dandelions in springtime .
In other words , we ’d just be driving straight toward the ultimate American debacle .
Let ’s change the vehicle ’s direction , and hold the pedal to the metal as we retreat to rationality and reason .
Our country can save itself from eventual societal disintegration only by completely abandoning its insufferably arrogant , bullying , world - cop attempt to make the rest of humanity over in our corrupt image , by force of indiscriminately discharged arms .
We ca n’t kill our way to getting others to accept our political , economic , religious , and cultural “ values , ” which increasing numbers of folks even here at home are rejecting because they ’re seen as being hopelessly flawed , if not completely depraved .
Face it .
Hardly anyone actually wants to be “ just like us . ”
And they sure are n’t going to change their minds if we continue to kick down residential doors at midnight or blow up wedding parties with Predator drones , under the cruel assumption that they ’re al Qaida gatherings .
We ’ve lost .
We ’ve lost big time .
But nowhere near as massively , tragically , and irreparably as we will if we do n’t read the writing on the wall and completely sink beneath that tar , as our purpose suffocates entirely , under the weight of our unrelieved hubris and stupidity .
Obama administration shields CIA torturers
22 September 2009
In response to a public campaign by the CIA , the Obama administration has decided to further scale back an already narrow investigation of Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) torture during the Bush years that was announced last month by Attorney General Eric Holder .
In announcing the probe , Holder had made clear that it would be limited to CIA agents whose torture of alleged terrorists went beyond the bounds laid down by Bush administration directives .
It would target neither the Justice Department lawyers who drew up findings providing a pseudo - legal justification for waterboarding , hanging prisoners from walls , placing them in boxes for hours on end , and similar crimes , nor the top Bush administration officials who ordered and oversaw such practices .
The CIA — including the current director and Obama appointee , Leon Panetta — and former Bush administration officials , led by former Vice President Dick Cheney , have denounced Holder ’s token probe , claiming that it will hamstring US intelligence operations and give aid and comfort to the terrorists .
On Friday , seven former CIA directors sent a letter to President Obama demanding that he quash the Holder inquiry .
Signing the letter were directors under both Democratic and Republican administrations : Michael Hayden , Porter Goss , George Tenet , John Deutch , R. James Woolsey , William Webster and James R. Schlesinger .
The next day , the Washington Post , in an article headlined “ Inquiry into CIA Practices Narrows , ” cited two unnamed sources as saying Holder ’s investigation will “ focus on a very small number of cases … ”
The Post went on to report that only “ two or three ” cases would be investigated out of dozens of examples of torture cited in a declassified Bush - era CIA inspector general ’s report , which the Obama administration released last month on court order and in heavily redacted form .
Under consideration for investigation , according to the Post , are three cases in which prisoners were murdered while in US custody : the suffocation of Iraqi General Abed Hamed Mowhoush in November 2003 ; the killing the same month of Manadel al Jamadi , who was beaten by Navy Seals and died after a CIA agent ordered him hung from bars by his arms ; and the murder seven years ago of a young man at a secret Afghanistan prison known as the “ Salt Pit . ”
The youth , who had been abducted from Pakistan , was beaten and then chained to a concrete floor without blankets , where he froze to death .
The letter sent by the former CIA directors is an unabashed defense of torture and a public warning to the Obama administration .
“ Attorney General Holder ’s decision to re-open the criminal investigations creates an atmosphere of continuous jeopardy for those whose cases the Department of Justice had previously declined to prosecute , ” the letter declares .
It continues : “ Those men and women who undertake difficult intelligence assignments in the aftermath of an attack such as September 11 must believe there is permanence in the legal rules that govern their actions .
They must be free , as the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , Senator Lieberman , has put it : ‘ to do their dangerous and critical jobs without worrying that years from now a future attorney general will authorize a criminal investigation of them for behavior that a previous attorney general concluded was authorized and legal . ’ ”
In fact , Holder has already announced an amnesty for those “ men and women ” who inflicted torture on detainees in line with Bush administration guidelines , citing similar grounds for shielding these torturers as those propounded by the former CIA directors and other defenders of torture as an instrument of US policy .
In announcing the appointment of special prosecutor John Durham , Holder indicated he would limit the investigation to about a dozen so - called “ rogue agents ” who superseded the Bush administration ’s written guidelines allowing torture .
If Obama refuses to give assurances against criminal investigations , the CIA directors ’ letter continues , he “ will seriously damage the willingness of many other intelligence officers to take risks to protect the country .
The administration must be mindful that public disclosure about past intelligence operations can only help Al Qaeda elude US intelligence and plan future operations . ”
Since the end of 2001 , the US has imprisoned tens of thousands of people at such infamous prisons as Abu Ghraib , Bagram and Guantánamo , in addition to an unknown number of secret CIA jails in Iraq , Afghanistan , Eastern Europe and elsewhere .
These prisoners have been denied legal recourse to challenge their detention , as the Bush and Obama administrations have asserted that “ the war on terror ” is governed neither by domestic US laws nor by the Geneva Conventions and other international laws banning torture .
Among the documented forms of torture carried out by US agents are murder , rape and other forms of sexual abuse and humiliation ; threats to murder and rape family members of prisoners ; beatings , waterboarding , exposure to extreme temperatures , high - pain “ stress ” positions , forced nudity , deprivation of food , extreme isolation and mock executions .
From the outset , Holder ’s investigation was designed to protect the operations of the CIA and military in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere while , for public relations purposes , providing a show of opposition to torture .
To date , not a single CIA agent has been convicted of a crime relating to the abuse of prisoners .
The CIA agent who oversaw the freezing death of the young detainee at the Salt Pit in Afghanistan — it was “ one of his first big assignments ” the Post notes — was later promoted by the CIA .
The defense of basic democratic rights requires that there be a thorough and public criminal investigation of the torture regime built up during the Bush administration , including the role of Vice President Cheney and President Bush himself .
Obama is opposed to any such investigation .
In response to a question from CBS ’s Bob Schieffer during his appearance on Sunday ’s “ Face the Nation ” program , Obama reiterated his stock formula for opposing a serious investigation , saying , “ I want to look forward and not backward when it comes to some of the problems that occurred under the previous administration , or when it came to interrogations . ”
“ I do n’t want witch - hunts taking place , ” he added .
The Obama administration ’s protection of Bush administration torturers demonstrates that it is an accomplice to the crime after the fact .
It is one more example of the continuity of Obama ’s policies , notwithstanding his election campaign rhetoric about “ change , ” with those of his predecessor .
It must be taken as a warning that the CIA and the military under Obama are carrying out similar crimes as those which took place under Bush .
The power of the military - intelligence apparatus has grown continually since World War II , to the point where it constitutes a virtual “ state - within - a- state ” largely unaccountable to and independent of elected civilian officials .
The public campaign of the CIA to block a criminal investigation ordered by the government demonstrates the growing assertiveness of this apparatus .
The cowering of the Obama administration and Congress before it underscores the decay of American democracy and the growing threat to the democratic rights of the American people .

It 's time to get loud Giants vs. Dodgers Ramirez deserves every boo Bonds received in L.A .
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close
It 's time to get loud 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
When Barry Bonds was on the verge of breaking baseball 's career home run record , a record now recognized by 29.3 percent of all fans and experts , he and the Giants visited Dodger Stadium .
The fans booed Bonds , of course , although they did it with a certain L.A. mellowness .
The guess here is that San Francisco fans will be less kind to Dodgers outfielder Manny Ramirez when the teams meet at Third and King in a three - game series starting tonight .
For fans here , it 's payback time to the world .
The Giants harbored Bonds , baseball 's first true steroid villain , took untold grief for it , but hello ! , now we 're finding out that every team had guys up to their armpits in muscle drugs .
In serenading Ramirez , Giants fans will be sending the following message to the world : " Back at you , self - righteous twits . "
That 's merely one of the subplots to the series , which is very big to both teams , but it 's an important subplot .
Ramirez served a 50 - game suspension , and since his return , Manny has been hitting like Popeye on cauliflower .
The Dodgers flourished when Ramirez was away , and since he returned , they have come back to the pack .
Now it seems as if their fate is in Manny 's hands .
Ramirez is the Dodgers ' designated time bomb .
If he continues along his current .270 - ish groove , with so - so power , the Dodgers simply are n't going to run away with the division .
If he recaptures last season 's magic , when he came to the Dodgers and over the last two months , hit .396 with 17 homers and 53 RBIs , it becomes a different ballgame .
" Manny does n't have the same swing he had , " said someone close to the Dodgers .
" He 's out of whack a little .
He was out 50 games , and he got hit on the hand when he came back .
They say ( the hand ) is n't a factor , but he 's not close to what he was last year . "
To envision the impact Ramirez could have on the postseason race if he rediscovers his swing , think back to when the mighty Bonds was in his golden groove , when every plate appearance was a home run or an intentional walk with the bases loaded .
The Giants rode him like kiddies ride a merry - go - round .
The reason the Dodgers need the " Before " Manny is that the team has some holes .
Their confidence is down and there is concern in Dodgers camp that the team caught some really nice breaks the first half of the season and now the scales are tipping back .
The Dodgers ' pitching is thinning like a ' roid user 's hair .
They made a run at Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee and came up empty .
They 're getting little power production from catcher ( Russell Martin , three homers ) and first base ( James Loney , seven homers ) .
If the Dodgers were fat and confident in the first half , and that 's how they looked from afar , they now wear a lean and hungry look .
The Dodgers probably do n't know what to make of the Giants .
Who does ?
Who figured the Giants would be a factor in August , with two - fifths of a solid starting rotation and the offense powered since the All - Star break by an unknown wisp nicknamed Pharaoh .
If MLB knew Eugenio Velez was going to catch fire like he has , it would have spiced up the All - Star festivities with a contest among broadcasters to see who could most creatively mangle the pronunciation of " Eugenio . "
Against the Dodgers , the Giants will need more of Eugenio being Eugenio , because they have been inept on the road and they are desperate to squirrel away home wins .
The fans will have to summon up the same type of spirit and spunk they showed in an incident near the end of the 2006 season , when the Dodgers clinched a playoff berth with a win in San Francisco .
After the game , a Dodgers fan climbed the Willie Mays statue and used Willie as a urinal .
Giants fans responded , touching off a half - hour free - for - all in Willie Mays Plaza , broken up by cops in riot gear .
" It made me proud to be a Giants fan , " says John Epperheimer , general manager of the Acme Chop House , who witnessed the festivities .
He added , " You just do not pee on Willie . "
That phrase , in Latin , should be inscribed on the Giants ' team flag .
And that spirit , if it's in evidence in this series , might be the boost the Giants need .
Portugal has been the subject of a lot of attention lately over its decriminalization of drug possession .
Although decriminalization has been in place for eight years now , it is only this year that it has caught the world 's attention .
The success of Portugal 's approach was the subject of a piece by Salon writer Glenn Greenwald commissioned by the Cato Institute that was widely read and commented on earlier this year , and last week it earned kind words from a most unexpected place : the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , which could find little to complain about for its 2009 World Drugs Report .
But Portugal is n't resting on its laurels , and at least one political party there is preparing to take the country 's progressive approach to drug reform to the next level .
The Leftist Bloc ( Bloco de Esquerda ) is preparing legislation that would legalize the possession , cultivation , and retail sales of small amounts of marijuana , as well as providing for regulated wholesale cultivation to supply the retail market .
The Bloc is also now actively encouraging the participation of ENCOD , the European Coalition for Just and Effective Drug Policies , in developing new drug laws .
The alliance comes too late to influence the marijuana bill , but will provide an entree for drug reformers in the process in future drug legislation , or even revising the current marijuana bill if it does not make in through parliament this year .
" The contacts between ENCOD and the Bloc were arranged by common activists and members , " explained ENCOD steering committee member and Portuguese law student , journalist , and activist Jorge Roque .
Under the draft bill , a copy of which was made available to the Chronicle , marijuana consumers could purchase " the amount needed for the average individual for a 30 - day period , " as determined by the existing decriminalization law , or 15 grams of hashish and 75 grams ( almost three ounces ) of marijuana .
The average daily dose is a half - gram of hash and 2.5 grams of pot .
Individuals would be allowed to grow up to 10 plants , and could possess the 30 - day amount as well as up to 10 plants .
The draft bill calls for licensed retail sales outlets authorized by municipal councils .
Such retail establishments would not be allowed to sell alcohol or allow it to be consumed on the premises , would not be allowed within 500 meters of schools , and would not be allowed to have gambling machines .
No one under 16 would be allowed to enter , nor would people adjudged to be mentally ill .
The draft bill prohibits advertising , but requires that packaging for marijuana products intended for retail sale clearly reveal the source , the amount , and a statement giving the World Health Organization 's position on the effects and risks of consumption .
The bill also provides for the Portuguese National Institute of Pharmacy and Medicine to license the wholesale cultivation of marijuana to supply the retail trade .
And it provides for an excise tax on cannabis sales to be determined during the budgetary process .
People who traffic in marijuana outside the parameters set down in the draft would face four to 12 years in prison for serious offenses , and up to four years for less serious offenses .
Licensed retailers or wholesalers who breach the regulations could face imprisonment for up to three months or a fine of up to 30 days ' minimum wage .
The bill 's immediate prospects are uncertain .
The Leftist Bloc is a small party , holding only eight seats in the 230 - seat parliament .
But the government is controlled by left - leaning parties , and the Bloc has a reputation as a " hip " party in the vanguard of political change in the country .
" Honestly , at first I thought this would never pass , but with time and after discussing this with the deputies , I am much more optimistic , " said Roque .
" Of course , the Left Bloc alone can not get it passed , but as usual , they provoke the debate of ideas , and then , since they are seen as an intelligent and humane group , they can pick up support among other political parties . "
While it is too late for ENCOD to influence this legislation , the group can still play a role in the debate , said ENCOD coordinator Joep Oomen .
" ENCOD could contribute with information on the need to make consistent moves and no half - measures , as has been the case before with the decriminalization of possession .
Portugal should learn from the experiences in the Netherlands .
Here liberal cannabis policies that have proven successful during more than 30 years are now in danger of being abolished because of the pressure of Christian parties who continue blaming these policies for problems that in fact are caused by prohibition , " he said .
Oomen was alluding to Holland 's " backdoor problem , " where the sale of marijuana is tolerated , but there is no provision for legally supplying Dutch cannabis cafes .
That has led to the growth of organized crime participation in the pot business in Holland .
" It is quite simple , " Oomen said .
" When you allow people to use , you should allow them to possess , and if you allow them to possess , you should allow them to cultivate , produce , buy or sell .
If you only go halfway , and refuse to regulate the first necessary element in the process ( cultivation or production ) you create more problems than solutions . "
For Roque , Portugal 's experience with decriminalization was critical in laying the groundwork for the legalization bill .
" Decriminalization helped us lose the taboos and break the fear of being persecuted for drugs , and Portugal nowadays is much more ready to move forward , " said Roque .
One big remaining taboo is the UN drug conventions , but neither Oomen nor Roque appeared to be very concerned about them .
" Portugal does not need to openly challenge the UN conventions , " said Oomen .
" As long as the new bill is aiming at regulating cultivation of cannabis for personal use , it cannot be considered as a violation of international conventions , which leave it up to national authorities to deal with the status of drug use . "
Roque was a bit more combative .
" The international conventions and the Lisbon treaty do n't provide solutions in these matters , and the UN conventions were ratified by the specific will of one country , " said Roque .
" When the UN conventions do n't present any solutions that are good for the national interest , only a stupid country will follow them forever . "
Now , Portugal can put the conventions and their interpretation to the test , if its parliament so chooses .

When someone announces the discovery of a new oil field , most people rejoice .
There are exceptions .
Owners of existing oil wells do n’t .
Growth - hating environmentalists do n’t .
But for most people , a new oil field means an additional supply of a scarce resource .
It means slightly lower prices for the resource .
What is good for the person who owns the oil field is good for almost everyone else .
What about the discovery of a gold mine ?
The person on whose land the gold has been discovered is happy .
People who want to buy circuit boards with gold plating are happy .
People who own shares in the firm that discovered the gold are happy .
But should anyone else be happy ?
Today , yes .
Gold is not money , except for central bankers .
It has not functioned as money since 1933 in the United States and 1914 in Europe .
So , an increase in the supply of gold will benefit users of gold as an industrial metal or as jewelry .
What about fathers in India ?
Are they happy ?
Probably those who can now afford extra gold for their daughters ’ dowries are happy .
Perhaps married women will not be , since the value of their dowries will fall slightly .
But probably no one will care about the new mine , one way or the other .
What about in 1848 ?
In those days , gold was money .
The discovery of gold in California benefitted those people who owned land in the gold fields .
It helped those few people who were located nearby and went out and dug up a lot of gold in the first year .
It helped owners of real estate in San Francisco .
It helped the tiny number of gold miners who later hit pay dirt .
But did it predictably help anyone else ?
No .
It increased the money supply .
It raised prices .
It lured gold - seekers to California , where they dug in the earth fruitlessly for years .
Someone might argue that the gains to the minority of gold country land owners and the early gold - diggers were greater than the losses sustained by existing gold owners and existing money holders , whose net worth fell as the price of gold fell and the value of money fell .
But to argue this way , someone would have to be able to measure everyone ’s subjective value on an objective scale , and then compare gains and losses .
No such scale exists .
No such comparison is scientifically possible .
Still , we can make a crude estimate .
The beneficiaries in the California gold fields were in the tens of thousands .
Those who lost purchasing power were in the tens of millions worldwide .
This discovery was unique in history .
The gold fields of South Africa , Australia , and Alaska did not have a comparable effect on prices .
For most of history , the net increase in gold each year has been minimal .
There has been very little effect on prices .
The cost of extracting gold rises .
The quantity extracted is a small fraction of the gold already serving as money directly or indirectly .
Also , gold is used for jewelry and other consumer goods .
These uses confer benefits to buyers .
The existing owners of gold jewelry are barely aware of any decline in the price of their goods .
Labor costs as a percentage of gold jewelry are high for most gold - related goods .
Here is a strange conclusion .
An increase in the money supply conveys no verifiable social benefit .
Early owners and early users gain benefits .
Late - users experience losses .
There is no way of knowing whether there are net gains or losses from an addition of money .
But in times of mass inflation and then hyperinflation , the losses become obvious .
The increased money supply forces a society back to barter , which is inefficient compared to a money economy where the money supply is stable .
Zimbabwe has experienced this .
That nation has been impoverished .
A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY
An increase in the supply of consumer goods conveys a benefit to consumers .
There is a greater variety of goods to choose from .
Put another way , there has been an increase in choices with the same money supply .
This is the best way to define economic growth : increased choices .
In contrast , an increase in the money supply cannot be shown to increase the number of choices .
Those with early access to the new money do increase their available choices .
Prices have not yet risen .
But the advantages gained by the initial users of newly created money are offset by those participants who face rising prices without a comparable increase in money .
The new money spreads : from the fortunate few who gain early access to the large number of those who get their hands on this new money later .
This is an argument against counterfeiting .
The counterfeiters gain great advantages if their money is accepted by early sellers of goods and services .
But there are not many counterfeiters .
The mass of citizens find that the counterfeiter has bought up goods at yesterday ’s lower prices , while they face a market with fewer goods still available for purchase and more money in circulation .
The case against counterfeiting is the case against wealth - redistribution by fraud .
The counterfeiters did not offer goods and services for sale , thereby benefitting society because they made more choices available to society ’s members .
They merely bought paper and ink and then produced pieces of paper with politicians ’ pictures on them .
The additional supply of pictures of politicians conveyed no net benefit to society .
Given the political education effects of passing along pictures of politicians , dead or alive , society is probably poorer .
( This is an argument for digital money : no pictures . )
Then there are the distorting effects of unanticipated new money on the allocation of capital : the boom - bust cycle .
The new money lets users think that others have saved money — reduced their consumption — thereby providing new capital for the economy .
But there has been no increase in thrift , no increase in capital goods .
Entrepreneurs will be lured into starting new projects — the boom — that future consumers will not validate by purchases : the bust .
This leads to a counter - intuitive conclusion : society cannot be said to benefit from an increase in the money supply .
We cannot make scientific interpersonal comparisons of subjective utility .
We cannot measure subjective gains and losses .
But we can make informed guesses about the net effects .
The more fiat money that is spent into circulation by counterfeiters , the more obvious the net social loss is .
Think “ Zimbabwe . ”
Unlike an increase in the supply of consumer goods , an increase in the money supply does not make society richer .
Why not ?
Because it does not add to people ’s array of choices .
Early printers and users add to their range of choices , but this reduces the number of choices for late users .
Society penalizes counterfeiters .
It also penalizes anyone who is taken in by counterfeiters and then gets caught .
I know of no legal system that says that once counterfeit money comes into existence , it should be kept in circulation .
Counterfeit bills do appear from time to time .
The person who is caught trying to buy something with a counterfeit bill loses wealth , whether or not he is charged with counterfeiting .
Society has determined that , if a holder of the counterfeit bill was so naïve as to accept it in exchange , he is out whatever it was that he surrendered to the previous holder .
The store ’s manager does not honor the transaction .
Neither does the banking system .
The system does not reward ignorance .
It makes users of paper money responsible .
The legal system acknowledges that there is no right to use counterfeit money .
There are winners and losers from counterfeiting .
The legal system tries to make potential losers more alert to the risk .
It rewards those sellers who spot the phony money early and call a halt to the continuing circulation of this money .
The seller of goods is not only rewarded for not accepting the phony money , he is expected to call the police .
Are we agreed ?
First , counterfeit money does not benefit society as a whole .
Second , society rightly establishes penalties against counterfeiters .
Third , in order to reduce the spread of counterfeit money , society penalizes those people who unwisely accept counterfeit money .
The legal system concludes that , in order to reduce the spread of fraud , the last user of a counterfeit bill loses .
THE ECONOMICS OF COUNTERFEITING
Our attitude toward counterfeiting should govern our attitude toward fractional reserve banking , which is the most widely accepted form of counterfeiting .
The same economic objections to paper - and - ink private counterfeiting apply to the digital - entry private counterfeiting .
First , fractional reserve banking does not benefit society .
Second , society should establish penalties against fractional reserve banking .
Third , in order to reduce the spread of counterfeit money , society should penalize those people who unwisely accept counterfeit money .
The legal system should conclude that , in order to reduce the spread of fraud , the last user of a counterfeit digit loses .
With the exception of the followers of Murray Rothbard , no economists accept these conclusions .
Every school of economic thought refuses to apply the economics of counterfeiting to fractional reserve banking .
There is universal agreement on the following :
First , counterfeit money does not benefit society as a whole .
Second , society rightly establishes penalties against counterfeiters .
Third , in order to reduce the spread of counterfeit money , society penalizes those people who unwisely accept counterfeit money .
The legal system concludes that , in order to reduce the spread of fraud , the last user of a counterfeit bill loses .
First , fractional reserve banking does benefit society .
Second , society should not establish penalties against fractional reserve banking .
Third , in order to further the spread of counterfeit digital money , society should never penalize those people who unwisely accept counterfeit digital money .
The legal system should conclude that , in order to further the spread of digital counterfeit money , the last user of a counterfeit digit should not be penalized .
In other words , the economist ’s logic against counterfeiting by unlicensed private counterfeiters does not apply to counterfeiting by government - licensed counterfeiters .
Why not ?
They never say .
They never write about fractional reserve banking as counterfeiting , just as they never write about the central bank as the enforcing agent of a bankers ’ cartel .
In short , they are intellectually schizophrenic .
Ludwig von Mises had a word to describe this phenomenon : polylogism .
All modern schools of economic opinion except the Austrian School believe in the central planning of money .
All major schools support quasi- private central banking as the proper agency of central planning .
They debate over which plan the central bank should adopt .
Some argue for targeting interest rates .
Others argue for targeting the consumer price index .
Others argue for a fixed increase in the money supply , though there is no agreement on what rate of increase .
Ever since October 2008 , most economists have thought that the central bank has only one goal : keeping the largest banks in operation .
Think of a gang of counterfeiters .
The head of the gang is known as Leftie .
( Note : gangs are never led by someone named Rightie . )
Leftie oversees Milt , who sits at a ditto machine , which cranks out pieces of paper with politicians ’ pictures on them .
Leftie has a B.A. in economics from an Ivy League school .
He tells Milt , “ Consumer demand is about to get a much - needed shot in the arm . ”
Leftie is a Keynesian .
Milt , however , got his B.A. in economics from the University of Chicago .
“ I do n’t know , Leftie .
Maybe we should limit ourselves to a steady 3 % to 5 % increase in the money supply per annum . ”
Leftie then shoots
Milt in the back of the head .
This is what happens with University of Chicago economists who get into advisory positions at the Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors or the New York FED .
Either they keep their mouths shut or else it ’s cement shoes , career - wise .
Milton Friedman was successful in persuading his peers of only one idea : that the Federal Reserve System caused the Great Depression because it did not expand the money supply fast enough .
This is universally believed , except by Austrian School economists .
Summarizing his position :
“ Once the official counterfeiter and its local operatives successfully flood the economy with fiat money , it must do everything it can to make sure than this money supply grows .
If this means flooding the commercial banks with fiat money reserves , so be it .
The money supply must not be allowed to shrink to its pre-counterfeiting level . ”
This is why Bernanke was universally praised by economists and investment advisers .
Counterfeiting is universally regarded as scientific money management , when done by Ph.D. - holding bureaucrats who have no direct economic stake in the outcome of their policies .
CONCLUSION
The economics profession is as committed to the expansion of fiat money as Congress is .
To maintain this position , economists must avoid applying the standard treatment of counterfeiting to the banking system .
They praise the increase of money .
They condemn any policy that would allow the money supply to shrink as a result of large - bank bankruptcies .
They conclude that banks are too big to fail , too important to fail .
No one calls the police when someone uses his credit card to pass along newly counterfeit money .
And , when it comes to physical Federal Reserve Notes , the law is clear : “ THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS , PUBLIC AND PRIVATE . ”
A merchant who spots a counterfeit bill is expected to refuse the money and then call the police .
In contrast , a debtor who pays his creditor with Federal Reserve Notes is supposed to call the police if the creditor refuses this payment .
This is the topsy - turvy world of central banking .
Economists tell us that this is the best possible system .
Gold is barbaric .
Fiat money is rational .
Fractional reserve banking ’s digital fiat money is the best money of all .
They agree with their boss : Leftie .

Software developed by an academic at Goldsmiths , University of London could spell the end for future melody plagiarism .
Dr Daniel Müllensiefen , from the Department of Psychology and formerly working in Computing , has co-published research on how to predict court decisions on music plagiarism using cognitive similarity algorithms .
The study has recently been published by the European specialist journal Musicae Scientiae and results were presented publicly for the first time at the international conference of the European Society for the Cognitive Sciences in Music ( ESCOM ) in Finland in August .
Daniel worked alongside Marc Pendzich , an expert on cover versions and music re-mixes from the Institute of Musicology University of Hamburg , on the software which is based on modelling court decision for cases of alleged melodic plagiarism employing a number of similarity algorithms .
The two researchers used court cases from the US as a testbed for their software and 90 per cent of the court decisions were predicted correctly by the newly developed algorithms .
Tune plagiarism in pop music is a common and often feverishly debated phenomenon , so controversial due to the vast amounts of money involved in today ’s pop music industry .
Artists as high profile as Madonna , George Harrison and the Bee Gees have all been involved in music plagiarism cases .
The similarity between melodies is assumed to be a very important factor in a court ’s decision about whether a new tune is an illegitimate version of a pre-existing melody .
Under the current system , the jury is advised by expert witnesses to come to a decision – something both Daniel and Marc have indeed done – but they admit that one of the long term effects of their work could substantially alter the need for a jury and expert witnesses .
“ The most provocative question you could ask is whether this software could replace a jury and expert witnesses in court , ” Daniel said .
“ Also , on a very popular level you could claim that the software can detect melodic plagiarism in popular music automatically .
Thus , in principle we could develop this into a business where songwriters and music publishers submit songs and we test against a database whether there are any highly similar pre-existing melodies in it . ”
Currently these developments are hypothetical due to the sample of cases it has been tested on being so small ( 20 cases ) , but Daniel and Marc are working on a follow - up study to include more US cases and to test whether the prediction accuracy holds also true for British and German plagiarism suits .
Google announced this morning they would be acquiring reCAPTCHA .
This interesting acquisition makes a lot of sense .
One of the original reasons ( if not the original reason ) for developing CAPTCHA was to ensure the person on your website or application was in fact human .
BOTS would crawl through the internet and create posts and forum topics etc. , to distribute SPAM and BOTS across sites .
CAPTCHA would step in by displaying an image which only a human could decipher / respond to ( usually ) , and then ask them to type in a word or several words to ensure they were HUMAN .
This is where the brilliance of this acquisition from Google comes in .
As people are typing out these CAPTCHA images to register on Facebook or create a GMAIL account etc. , then reCAPTCHA can display old newspapers and books which need text conversion completed .
This essential process enables a free workforce to do easy ( but labor intensive ) work for the company that hires reCAPTCHA !
Since Google has been in the business of INDEXING the world , including old Books and Magazines , it will now have access to a FREE workforce to help translate and perfect it ’s OCR technology .
Like I said , brilliant .

A site which carries links to both live streaming sporting events and BitTorrent downloads has had the case against it kicked out by a judge .
Rojadirecta.com was initially reported for copyright infringement by sports rights holder AudioVisual Sports back in 2007 , but it 's been decided they have no case to answer .
In 2007 , Rojadirecta , which describes itself as one of the world ’s major Internet sports broadcast indexes ( linking to many soccer events plus NBA , MLB , NFL , NPB , IPL etc ) , was reported for copyright infringement by sports rights holder Audiovisual Sport .
The company , a subsidiary of Spanish communications group PRISA ( which owns Canal+ , SportMania , various satellite channels , radio stations and newspapers ) , accused Rojadirecta of facilitating copyright infringement on various sports broadcasts by providing access to them via the Internet .
Rojadirecta is a site that indexes http links to sports streams that can already be found on the Internet , and also carries links to . torrent files .
It does n’t host anything at all , it just carries links .
It does n’t operate a tracker and does n’t even host the .torrent files it links to .
The admin of Rojadirecta told TorrentFreak that they felt the case was brought to scare them into closing the site without due process .
“ In 2007 we publshed a press release where we interpreted the report as an intimidating tactic with which we thought the company believed we would give in to the interests of Audiovisual Sport without the need for justice to be handed down , ” he told us .
“ We decided to ignore them , continue with what we considered to be a legal service
and wait for the court ’s decision .
So we expected that outcome but we knew it was going to take a lot of time because Spanish courts are totally overloaded with work for many years now .
So finally two years later here is the outcome : case filled , ” he added .
This week , District Court No.37 in Madrid agreed to provisionally dismiss the complaint against Rojadirecta , after the claims made by Audiovisual Sport against it were undermined by expert police evidence .
“ Audiovisual Sport was basically saying that we provide software that allows our users to watch content that in Spain is broadcasted with a encrypted system – probably trying to use a law that was created to stop people using satellite TV decoders without paying , ” Rojadirecta ’s admin told TorrentFreak .
“ That law refers to software and hardware created to decode those signals without paying .
The police expert ’s report explained that this is not what P2P TV software does .
The expert explained that those events are broadcasted openly on International TV stations and that the use of those apps are free , open and universal and not created by us , ” he added .
Dismissing the case , the court went on to say that Rojadirecta merely offered links to software and links that enabled users to watch the events .
Even though the site carried advertising , no profits were made directly from any infringement .
“ We knew that it was a matter of time , because time , and especially logic showed we were right , ” Rojadirecta ’s admin told us .
A defiant and fully legal Rojadirecta says that sports broadcasts via the Internet of the Spanish soccer league will continue to be linked to via the site , along with many other sporting events from around the world including Champions League , Premier League , Serie A , NBA , MLB , NFL , NPB , IPL etc .
“ Of course they [ AudioVisual Sport ] can appeal but if the things were clear before , with the outcome of this decision they are even more clear , if that ’s possible , ” he concluded .

AROUND THE WEB
In the 1990s , several environmental writers began describing the agriculture scientist Norman Borlaug , who has died aged 95 , as the saviour of " more lives than anyone in history " .
However , such is the industrialised west 's indifference towards under - developed countries that it was only there that he achieved any popular fame , his Nobel peace prize of 1970 notwithstanding .
At the same time , other commentators pointed to the problems that had come in the wake of his " Green revolution " .
Borlaug had developed a new variety of wheat that was resistant to disease and infestation : by the 1960s , it was producing up to three times more grain than traditional species .
This , and his later introduction of high - yield rice in Asian countries , are credited with averting a predicted international crisis in food production that would have starved an estimated one billion people worldwide .
In 1944 , George Harrar , plant pathologist and the head of a new Mexican plant breeding research programme , and Dr Frank Hanson , an official of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York , invited Borlaug to leave his wartime laboratory job as a microbiologist with chemical and weapons company Dupont to go to Mexico and help poor farmers increase their wheat production .
It was highly demanding work .
Borlaug and his assistants made 6,000 individual crossings of wheat , and by 1954 had successfully bred what became known as " miracle seeds " of high - yielding dwarf varieties .
The new seeds did not in themselves produce greater yields , but were highly responsive to chemical fertilisers and other inputs .
By 1956 his disease - resistant varieties had helped Mexico double its wheat production and , for the first time , become self - sufficient in grain .
By 1963 , 95 % of Mexico's wheat crops used the semi- dwarf varieties developed by Borlaug , and the harvest was six times larger than in 1944 .
By the mid-1960s , Borlaug 's new varieties were being exported and developed in India and Pakistan , where yields were higher than any harvested in Asia .
In Pakistan , wheat yields nearly doubled , from 4.6 m tonnes in 1965 to 7.3 m tonnes in 1970 ; in India , from 12.3 m tonnes in 1965 to 20.1 m tonnes in 1970 .
By 1974 , India was self - sufficient in the production of all cereals , and the technology had spread to north Africa , the Middle East and Latin America .
But while Borlaug , along with MS Swaminathan and other young agronomists such as Gurdev Khush at the International Rice Research Institute , were feted for their contribution to eradicating postwar hunger , concerns steadily mounted over the long - term sustainability of the intensive chemical - based farming practices involved .
No one doubted that , in the short term , famines and food shortages were averted , but few people considered or tried to to counter the profound social and ecological changes that the revolution heralded among peasant farmers .
The long - term cost of depending on Borlaug 's new varieties , said eminent critics such as ecologist Vandana Shiva in India , was reduced soil fertility , reduced genetic diversity , soil erosion and increased vulnerability to pests .
Not only did Borlaug 's " high - yielding " seeds demand expensive fertilisers , they also needed more water .
Both were in short supply , and the revolution in plant breeding was said to have led to rural impoverishment , increased debt , social inequality and the displacement of vast numbers of peasant farmers .
Borlaug had a robust reply .
He acknowledged that his Green revolution had not " transformed the world into Utopia " , but added that western environmental lobbyists were often elitists .
" They 've never experienced the physical sensation of hunger , " he said .
" If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world , as I have for 50 years , they'd be crying out for tractors and fertiliser and irrigation canals , and be outraged that fashionable elitists were trying to deny them these things . "
He displayed remarkable personal stamina in his research , working 12 - hour days in harsh field conditions , and challenged younger researchers with the physical prowess he had developed through championship wrestling in his high school and university years .
When his wife Margaret received the Nobel prize call from Oslo , it was 4 am in Mexico where Borlaug was working , but he had already departed for the fields .
Borlaug was born into a fourth - generation family of Norwegian immigrants on a small farm in Iowa , where he worked as a small boy and through his teens .
After graduating from the University of Minnesota in 1937 in forestry , he lost his first job because of the Depression , and returned to obtain a master of science degree and a PhD in 1942 in plant pathology and genetics .
Once he had arrived in Mexico , he stayed for 30 years .
In 1964 , he established the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre , an autonomous international research training institute .
As director of its worldwide wheat improvement programme , he trained more than 2,000 young scientists from nearly 20 countries .
From 1984 until well into his 90s he taught at Texas A&M University , and lived in Dallas when not travelling .
Once again he became the bete noire of some environmentalists , this time over GM crops , which he tirelessly championed through the controversies of the 1990s as the best hope of the world to feed itself in the coming generations .
The UN has recently announced that more than one billion people will this year be malnourished .
Margaret , whom Borlaug had met in college , died in 2007 ; he is survived by their son and daughter .

It was while Marwa el - Sherbini was in the dock recalling how the accused had insulted her for wearing the hijab after she asked him to let her son sit on a swing last summer , that the very same man strode across the Dresden courtroom and plunged a knife into her 18 times .
Her three - year - old son Mustafa was forced to watch as his mother slumped to the courtroom floor .
Even her husband Elvi Ali Okaz could do nothing as the 28 - year - old Russian stock controller who was being sued for insult and abuse took the life of his pregnant wife .
As Okaz ran to save her , he too was brought down , shot by a police officer who mistook him for the attacker .
He is now in intensive care in a Dresden hospital .
While the horrific incident that took place a week ago tomorrow has attracted little publicity in Europe , and in Germany has focused more on issues of court security than the racist motivation behind the attack , 2,000 miles away in her native Egypt , the 32 - year - old pharmacist has been named the " headscarf martyr " .
She has become a national symbol of persecution for a growing number of demonstrators , who have taken to the streets in protest at the perceived growth in Islamophobia in the west .
Sherbini 's funeral took place in her native Alexandria on Monday in the presence of thousands of mourners and leading government figures .
There are plans to name a street after her .
Sherbini , a former national handball champion , and Okaz , a genetic engineer who was just about to submit his PhD , had reportedly lived in Germany since 2003 , and were believed to be planning to return to Egypt at the end of the year .
They were expecting a second child in January .
Unemployed Alex W. from Perm in Russia was found guilty last November of insulting and abusing Sherbini , screaming " terrorist " and " Islamist whore " at her , during the Dresden park encounter .
He was fined ¤ 780 but had appealed the verdict , which is why he and Sherbini appeared face to face in court again .
Even though he had made his anti-Muslim sentiments clear , there was no heightened security and questions remain as to why he was allowed to bring a knife into the courtroom .
Angry mourners at the funeral in Alexandria accused Germany of racism , shouting slogans such as " Germans are the enemies of God " and Egypt 's head mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy called on the German judiciary to severely punish Alex W .
" Anger is high " , said Joseph Mayton , editor of the English - language news website Bikya Masr .
" Not since Egypt won the African [ football ]
Cup have Egyptians come together under a common banner . "
In Germany the government of Angela Merkel has been sharply criticised for its sluggish response to the country 's first murderous anti-Islamic attack .
The general secretaries of both the Central Council of Jews and the Central Council of Muslims , Stephen Kramer and Aiman Mazyek , who on Monday made a joint visit to the bedside of Sherbini 's husband , spoke of the " inexplicably sparse " reactions from both media and politicians .
They said that although there was no question that the attack was racially motivated , the debate in Germany had concentrated more on the issue of the lack of courtroom security .
" I think the facts speak for themselves , " Kramer said .
The government 's vice spokesman Thomas Steg rebuffed the criticism , saying not enough was yet known about the details of the incident .
" In this concrete case we 've held back from making a statement because the circumstances are not sufficiently clear enough to allow a broad political response , " he said , adding : " Should it be the case that this was anti-foreigner [ and ] racially motivated [ the government ] would condemn it in the strongest possible terms " .
As hundreds of Arab and Muslim protesters demonstrated in Germany , and observers drew comparisons with the Danish cartoon row , Egyptian government representatives in Berlin said it was important to keep the incident in perspective .
" It was a criminal incident , and does n't mean that a popular persecution of Muslims is taking place , " Magdi el - Sayed , the spokesman for the Egyptian embassy in Berlin said .
But because it occurred just days after Nicolas Sarkozy gave a major policy speech denouncing the burka , many Egyptians believe the death of Sherbini is part of a broader trend of European intolerance towards Muslims .
The German embassy in Cairo has sought to calm the situation , organising a visit of condolence by the ambassador to the victim 's family and issuing a statement insisting that the attack did not reflect general German sentiment towards Egyptians .
There have been repeated calls by protesters for the German embassy to be picketed .
The Egyptian pharmacists ' syndicate said it is considering a week - long boycott of German medicines .
The victim 's brother , Tarek el - Sherbini , labelled Germany as a " cold " country when interviewed by a popular talk show host .
Media pundits such as Abdel Azeem Hamad , editor of the daily al - Shorouk newspaper , have attributed the western media 's disinterest in the story to racism , arguing that if Sherbini had been Jewish the incident would have received much greater attention .
Politicians in Egypt have been scrambling to ride the groundswell of popular feeling .
But some commentators have criticised reaction to the murder as a convenient distraction for the unpopular regime of President Hosni Mubarak , which is currently being challenged by a nationwide series of strikes and sit-ins .
" The tragedy of Marwa el - Sherbini is real , as is anti-Arab racism in Europe and elsewhere , but ... her death has been recruited to channel resentment of the west , Danish - cartoon style , " the popular blogger The Arabist said .
Sixteen months after stepping down as president and chief executive of HarperCollins Publishers Worldwide , Jane Friedman has formed a new company that will republish old titles by big - name authors including William Styron , Iris Murdoch and Pat Conroy in electronic form .
Together with Jeffrey Sharp , a film producer of features including “ Boys Do n’t Cry ” and “ You Can Count on Me , ” Ms. Friedman , 64 , has founded Open Road Integrated Media to focus almost exclusively on digital publishing .
The company will also seek new authors willing to be published in the electronic format first .
Electronic “ is going to be the center of the universe , ” said Ms. Friedman , a flamboyant and relentless booster of authors during her four - decade career in New York publishing .
“ We really think that what we ’re going to do is to help transform the industry , which is built on models that we all know are broken . ”
When traditional publishers reissue print editions , they tend to do so with little fanfare .
Ms. Friedman , by contrast , plans to push a torrent of online marketing on new readers in the hopes of reigniting the backlists of well - known authors in the digital world .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Republican Sen. Olympia
Snowe has shown throughout her career that when it comes to voting , it 's her principles and constituents that guide her , not her party .
Sen . Olympia Snowe has received overwhelming support from her constituents in past elections .
Those principles , analysts note , are guiding her to find a compromise on health care reform currently stalemated in Congress .
Jennifer Duffy , who follows the Senate for the Cook Political Report , said Snowe 's independent streak is " not new behavior for her . "
" I think they [ Republicans ] also realize that the only reason that the state of Maine has two Republican senators at all is the fact that they are very independent - minded and they vote their state , " she said , referring to Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins .
In fact , some estimates place Snowe as having voted with her party only 57 percent of the time in the current Congress .
While her moderate views are at odds with GOP opposition to several of President Obama 's economic plans this year , the senator 's constituents seem to agree with her .
In 2006 , she won re-election with 74 percent of the vote , compared to her Democratic opponent 's 21 percent .
In 2000 , Snowe received 69 percent of the vote .
In an interview with National Public Radio in 2006 , she said that while her views are moderate , Maine , like other New England states , has been " naturally independent "
" Oftentimes , I tell my leadership , do n't blame me , it 's just where I grew up , " she said at the time .
Snowe , 59 , was elected to Congress in 1978 at age 31 , and served Maine 's 2nd District for 16 years .
She ran for Senate in 1994 and won , " becoming the first woman in American history to serve in both houses of the state legislature and both houses of Congress , " her Senate Web site notes .
Her political career began in 1973 after her husband , Maine Rep. Peter Snowe , was killed in a car accident and she was elected to fill his seat .
After two years in the state Senate , she won the U.S. House seat held by William Cohen when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1978 .
Snowe was elected to the Senate with 60 percent of the vote during the Republican revolution of 1994 , filling the seat of longtime Democratic Sen.
George Mitchell , who retired .
She married then - Maine Gov. John McKernan in 1989 .
In 2006 , Time Magazine named her one of the top 10 U.S. senators , calling her " the caretaker . "
" Because of her centrist views and eagerness to get beyond partisan point scoring , Maine Republican Olympia Snowe is in the center of every policy debate in Washington , " the article read .
" But while Snowe is a major player on national issues , she is also known as one of the most effective advocates for her constituents . "
Duffy said that if Snowe and Collins started voting with the Republican leadership all the time , " They would probably both lose re-election . "
Part of the so - called " Gang of Six " on the Senate Finance Committee , which includes three Democrats and three Republicans , she has been actively negotiating with the White House .
The White House said that Sens. Chuck Grassley and Mike Enzi , the other two Republicans in the Gang of Six , have backed away from negotiations , although Enzi released a statement that said he is still willing to talk .
Snowe said it 's important to work with the other party despite criticism .
" I think sometimes , yes , I 'd find myself in that position , you know , with fewer and fewer ... people who are willing to reach across the political aisle and to create what I ... call the sensible center , " she told NPR last week .
" I mean , that 's where the majority of Americans are .
And I try to sort of build those ... bridges . "
Part of that bridge building was seen with her votes for the president 's $ 787 billion economic stimulus package in February .
For the past months , Snowe has been pushing the idea of a safety net plan , or " trigger , " for a public health care option as part of a key compromise .
A source familiar with her negotiations with Obama said that 's one of the things they 're talking about .

The idea would give insurance companies a defined period to make changes in order to help cover more people and drive down long - term costs .
But if those changes failed to occur within the defined period , a trigger would provide for creating a public option to force change on the insurance companies .
" This option would be available from day one in any state where -- after market and insurance reforms are implemented -- affordable , competitive plans still do not exist , " she said in a press release .
Her main concerns so far have been the high cost of health care proposals .
" What we have to do is develop a plan that 's going to be available to people on an affordable basis , and , secondly , containing costs both for the American consumer and the American taxpayer , " Snowe said in the NPR interview last week .
Cost has been a major part of her bipartisan efforts in the Senate .
" Given the gravity of our economic circumstances , I am pleased that our bipartisan negotiations have yielded a consensus solution that will create jobs , assist the displaced and invest in our economy , " she said at the time about the stimulus plan .
She added that it is not a " matter of labeling something as spending or as tax relief ; it 's finding and including in this package the vital provisions necessary for jump - starting our economy . "

All About Olympia Snowe • Republican Party
Eighteen states have critically underfunded unemployment insurance plans .
This issue has yet to come to a head , but it soon will .
Please consider Unemployment Insurance Buckles After Years of Underfunding .
[ Eighteen via latest updates ] states have simply run out of money to pay benefits and been forced to borrow from Washington a total of more than $ 8 billion .
That number is almost certain to grow as more states reach the brink .
If they are not able to pay that amount back before 2011 , which most will not be able to do , they face paying hundreds of millions of dollars in interest .
Meanwhile , many workers are struggling to get by on what the system pays them .
Where you live can make all the difference -- workers in the most generous states get twice the average benefits of workers in the stingiest ones .
The percentage of unemployed workers who even receive benefits varies greatly by state .
Unemployment insurance is also intended to be automatic stimulus during a recession , keeping people spending and businesses open .
" The idea is you accumulate reserves and then you can support spending when the economy goes south , " said Gary Burtless [ 3 ] , an economist at the Brookings Institution .
But many states have failed to do that , and they 're now paying the price .
Indiana , which ran out of reserves last year , just raised its unemployment taxes by 35 percent , right in the middle of a deep recession when businesses can least afford it .
Many have been maintaining close to zero reserves [ 4 ] for years , well before the economy headed south .
California , for example , got into trouble by raising benefits without increasing taxes .
Other states , like Michigan , lowered taxes to unsustainable levels and watched their reserves dwindle .
Now , these states will be forced to raise taxes or cut benefits in the middle of a recession -- just when those changes will do the most economic damage .
On average , workers who rely on unemployment insurance get about half as much as they earned while they were working .
In some states it is much less , and it may get lower as policymakers struggle to keep their unemployment insurance systems afloat .
There are also wide variations in the percentage of unemployed workers who collect benefits .
Nationwide , only about 30 percent of workers who lose their job ever see an unemployment check , but in some states it is as high as 80 percent .
Some of the variation is due to differences in who is allowed to collect benefits , some is because many workers -- particularly in states where unemployment insurance is considered a welfare program -- never apply .
Is Your State Flat Broke ?
States are free to choose the level of funding for their systems .
Over time , many states yielded to political pressure to increase benefits and lower taxes , allowing their reserves to dwindle .
Now , 17 states have run out of money altogether , forcing them to borrow money and increase taxes at the worst possible time : in the middle of a deep recession .
Who Is To Blame ?
34 Percent of Workers Have One Week or Less of Savings
Over a one week period beginning July 6 and running through July 13 , more than 16,000 visitors to Monster.com participated in the Monster Meter Poll question “ If you were laid off without severance , how long would your savings cover your living expenses ? ”
One Week or Less : 34 %
2 - 4 Weeks : 16 %
1 - 2 Months : 16 %
3 - 5 Months : 14 %
6 Months or Longer : 20 %
Creating three broad groups , 50 % have less than a month of savings , while only 20 % have 6 months or more .
The remaining 30 % are in between .
Although the Monster Poll is not scientific , I cannot help thinking it is reasonably accurate .
Role of the Fed and Congress
The more I play with Snow Leopard , the more it looks like it ’s designed to run Apple ’s upcoming tablet .
Look at Expose in the Dock — the new feature that reveals all an application ’s open windows when you click and hold the application ’s icon .
It ’s tailor - made for fingers .
Even more convincing is Stacks in the Dock .
Hit a folder icon in the dock , and up pops the folder and all its files .
Each icon is a big target for your finger , and the window has a big , fat slider for scrolling up and down ( no more fiddly little arrows at the top or bottom ) .
Both of these UI tweaks scream ‘ touchscreen . ’
And then today I discovered an unheralded feature that the minute I saw it , I thought , “ Game over !
Here ’s rock - solid proof that Snow Leopard is designed for touchscreens .
This is a tablet operating system . ”
The Mac OS has long contained a virtual keyboard , but previous versions were half - sized ( see below ) .
The old virtual keyboard was clearly not designed for actual typing , and was hidden away in the “ International ” tab of System Preferences .
( Yeah , the keyboard could be enlarged by hitting the green button in the upper left of the folder toolbar , but still , it expanded to only three - quarter size ) .
The new virtual keyboard in Snow Leopard now lives under “ Keyboard ” in System Preferences , and is clearly put there as an alternative input method .
The virtual keyboard can be made as big as your screen — 30 - inches wide , if you have a big Cinema Display — by dragging the window resizer at bottom left .
Of course , it ca n’t be used as a real virtual keyboard until Apple introduces a touchscreen device .
At the moment , it just records the keystrokes on your physical keyboard and shows the characters that will be typed when the Option key is held down , and so on .
Yeah , I know , this is n’t proof that Snow Leopard is designed for a touchscreen device — IE .
the tablet everyone knows Apple is working on — but I got pretty excited when I saw it .
It looks like a key touchscreen UI element to me .
Here ’s how to see it yourself :
* Go to System Preferences > Keyboard
* Click the box “ Show Keyboard & Character Viewer in menu bar ”
* Go to the menu bar at top right and click “ Show Keyboard Viewer ”
For comparison , here ’s the old soft keyboard in Leopard .
This is not a touchscreen keyboard .

It was browsing in a bookshop that got me started .
I was confronted by a bank of bestsellers on the brain : how it works and how we think .
There were the books which have attracted huge attention , such as Nudge and Blink , but there were others popularising the new insights of a range of academic disciplines – social sciences such as evolutionary psychology as well as neuroscience – which are radically challenging the most fundamental assumptions on which human beings operate .
Perhaps that sounds a little overblown , but it 's not .
Who , dear reader , do you think you are ?
Do you think your mind is capable of independent judgment and largely directs the course of your life ?
Do you think that most of your decisions in life have been the product of your rational , conscious self ?
Do you believe you are in control of your life ?
Do you cherish ideas such as self - expression , a sense of autonomy and a distinct , self - authored identity ?
The chances are that , albeit with a few qualifications , most of your answers are yes .
Indeed , given a pervasive culture which reinforces all these ideas , it would be a bit odd if you did n't .
But the point about this new explosion of interest in research into our brains is that it exposes as illusions much of these guiding principles of what it is to be a mature adult .
They are a profound misunderstanding of how we think , and how our brains work .
They are fairytales , about as fanciful and as implausible as goblins .
This is such dramatic stuff that Matthew Taylor at the Royal Society of Arts , which has pioneered public engagement with this new research , argues that we are on the verge of a new Enlightenment .
He argues that the 18th - century concept of the individual self has run its course and that a new paradigm of human nature is emerging .
Given that assumptions of an autonomous individual underpin every aspect of how we order society and our political economy , educate and tackle social issues , this kind of Big Idea tends to make you feel a tad dizzy .
It 's not an accident that many of the biggest bestsellers in this territory are about decision - making – Blink , Nudge and The Decisive Moment .
The image which comes to mind is that they are all sticks of dynamite dug in to explode the great sacred mythology of our time : namely that individual freedom is about having choices , and that progress is about the constant expansion of those choices .
Read these books and you discover that people are useless at making choices .
We are lazy , imitative , over - optimistic , myopic , and much of our decision - making is made by unconscious habits of the mind which are largely socially primed .
We are " not exactly lemmings , but we are easily influenced by the statements and deeds of others " , according to Nudge 's bleak view of human nature .
The thesis of Nudge which has attracted such keen interest from the Conservatives is that this information can be used to prime better decisions without compromising freedom of choice .
Nudge has appeared to offer a neat alternative to state intervention for all those intractable areas of private behaviour – from obesity and smoking to energy use and recycling – which have such damaging consequences .
It 's intriguing how much attention the thesis has attracted from many parts of the political establishment , such as policymakers in pensions , health and the environment , because often the gains from nudging seem pretty small – it is fanciful to think it can solve the environmental crisis .
This humbling evidence of our hopeless decision - making exposes consumer capitalism as not being about millions of independent decisions of individuals expressing unique identities , but about how social norms can be manipulated to create eager shoppers .
Or take the idea of introducing choice into public services ; some bizarre consequences will result , such as the popularity of a hospital being determined by whether it has a car park , not the skill of medical staff .
There are two other areas of this new brain research which are arguably more important .
First , we have much underestimated the social nature of the brain : how primed it is to recognise , interpret and respond all the time to the input of others and how that lays down patterns which govern our behaviour .
We are herd - like animals who show a strong tendency to conform with group norms ; what makes our brains so much bigger than other primates is this remarkable capacity for social skills such as empathy , co-operation and fairness .
Instead of the old metaphor of individuals as discrete entities like billiard balls , we need to think instead of them as nodes in a relationship network .
The second area of astonishing discoveries is in the plasticity of the brain .
We talk of " hardwiring " ( computers have generated many misleading metaphors for the brain ) but in fact , the brain can be changed .
Parts of the brain can learn entirely new tricks .
Neural pathways are not fixed , and even much of the damage done by deprivation in childhood can be repaired with the right circumstances of example , support and determination .
We can shape our own brains to create new habits that we might have thought we were not capable of – it's a long , hard process but it is possible .
This all may seem remote from politics , but it 's not .
Jon Cruddas has a habit of startling audiences by arguing that the regeneration of the left requires a convincing new account of what it is to be human .
Are human beings self - interested creatures or are they collaborative ?
The right 's argument for market capitalism is rooted in the former but the research on the social brain supports the latter .
Put crudely , we are social creatures with an inbuilt tendency to co-operate and seek out each other 's approval and that is probably more important in determining day - to - day behaviours than narrowly conceived self - interest .
In a thought - provoking pamphlet on the implications for politics to be published early next month , Matt Grist , who runs the RSA 's Social Brain project , concludes that both the right and the left have lessons to learn .
The rightwing emphasis on the individual 's capacity to triumph over their environment through willpower is undermined by the research which shows how childhood deprivation leaves such scarring on the brain .
While the challenge to the left is to recognise that the myopic tendencies of the brain to privilege the short term has been held in check by institutions and traditions which can safeguard longer - term interests .
Perhaps that requires greater understanding on the left of how such institutions operate and a revision of assumptions about why they restrict individual autonomy .
To add one more element to this potent brew of extraordinary ideas : what has been left out of the UK debate so far is how much of this new research maps on to Buddhism .
In the US , a group of researchers has been involved in an ongoing dialogue with the Dalai Lama to deepen understanding of the correlations between the new research and Buddhism .
Here is a system of thought which has maintained for several thousand years that the idea of a separate individual self is an illusion , which urges a set of practices to increase awareness of the processes of the mind in order to transform them and cultivate ethical habits such as compassion or courage .
Apologies if by now you are feeling giddy .
This is the kind of stuff which challenges almost everything you 're used to thinking about yourself .

In Remodeling , it is important to have an understanding of the original structure , the way it was meant to withstand external forces and how your work may affect that structure .
Suncoast has completed many remodeling projects , both residential and commercial .
Some have been mostly cosmetic but others have had serious structural modifications , such as removing a load bearing wall and re-supporting the above structure , in an active airport .
Here is a brief description of what some of our Most Recent Remodeling Projects included : Commercial Remodeling St Petersburg / Clearwater Airport -
At the St Petersburg / Clearwater Airport , our job was to remove a wall so that Gates 9 & 10 were more accessible .
This happened to be a load bearing wall which required careful preparation and well thought out safety precautions to temporarily support the structure above .
This project went smoothly and Suncoast even brought our own engineer in for a redesign that gave the project a better finished appearance .

Healthcare reform in the US : A key but controversial issue US President Barack Obama made reform of the American healthcare system his top domestic priority when he entered the White House .
On 21 March , after a weekend of intense debate , and last - minute appeals to Democrats from the president , the House of Representatives passed the biggest reform of health care in the country for 40 years .
But the House was deeply divided , with no Republicans voting for the bill , and a number of Democrats also opposing it .
What is the current situation ?
There is not a universal system of healthcare coverage .
US HEALTHCARE SYSTEM Medicare : government - funded healthcare for over - 65s Medicaid : government - funded healthcare for those on low incomes Employer - funded health insurance : paid by salary deduction Military veterans : receive healthcare via government - run scheme State Children 's Health Insurance Programme : coverage for children whose parents do not qualify for Medicaid Uninsured : treated in emergency rooms only
There are federally funded programmes , the biggest being Medicaid and Medicare .
But generally it is up to individuals to obtain health insurance .
Most get coverage through their employers , but others sign up for private insurance schemes .
Under the terms of most plans , people pay regular premiums , but sometimes they are required to pay part of the cost of their treatment ( known in the US as a deductible ) before the insurer covers the expense .
The amount they pay varies according to their plan .
So what are the problems with the US system ?
Firstly , cost .
As a nation , the US spent some $ 2.2tn ( £ 1.36tn ) on healthcare in 2007 .
That amounts to 16.2 % of GDP - nearly twice the average of other countries in the OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ) .
Second , coverage .
The US Census Bureau estimates that 46.3 million people in America , out of a population of 300 million , were uninsured in 2008 .
However , this includes 9.2 million non-citizens and 18 million people who earn more than $ 50,000 a year .
There are also millions of Americans who are deemed " under- insured " .
US HEALTHCARE AND WORLD COMPARISONS
Healthcare reform is a priority for Barack Obama .
The US spends about $ 2.2tn a year on its system - which includes private , federal or employer schemes .
US expenditure on healthcare is the equivalent of about 16.2 % of GDP - nearly twice that of some other OECD countries .
The US falls behind some OECD countries for life expectancy and has a higher rate of infant mortality .
Almost 46 m US citizens do not have health insurance .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
What are the effects of rising health costs ?
When someone without insurance ( or with inadequate cover ) falls ill , they are obliged to pay their medical costs out of their own pocket .
Half of all personal bankruptcies in the US are at least partially the result of medical expenses .
Rising costs also mean the government is spending more and more on Medicare and Medicaid .
US government spending on the two schemes is projected to rise from 4 % of GDP in 2007 to 7 % in 2025 and 12 % in 2050 , making rising healthcare costs one of the biggest contributing factors to the spiralling US budget deficit .
So what changes were proposed ?
The broad outlines of the House and Senate bills passed late last year were similar on many issues .
The bills : favour tougher regulations for insurers
establish an individual mandate - that is you must get health insurance
set up insurance exchanges for those who do not have coverage provided by employers
offer subsidies for the less well - off - although their exact size varies from committee to committee
pay for most of the reforms by cutting waste in the Medicare programme
The major points of disagreement were on the public option , that is a government - run insurance scheme , and how to pay for the remainder of reform .
What about President Obama ?
Mr Obama laid out a relatively broad plan for healthcare reform at the beginning of his presidency , saying he would leave Congress to hammer out the details .
But faced with stalled legislation and broad opposition from Republicans , he outlined a more detailed blueprint for healthcare overhaul in February .
Mr Obama said the proposals would make healthcare more affordable and health insurers more accountable .
The changes , he said , would help reduce the federal deficit by $ 100bn over the next 10 years , by tackling waste , fraud and abuse .
Why did healthcare reform stall in Congress ?
While there is broad agreement that the current system needs reform , there are deep differences over what changes are needed and how to implement them .
Many Republicans argue that the reform envisaged by Mr Obama and Democratic Party leaders will make healthcare " more bureaucratic and expensive " .
There are also some Democrats in Congress who are unhappy with the proposed changes , either because they go too far or do not go far enough .

At the annual Bioneers convention in 2007 , Van Jones described to an audience of scientists , activists and environmentalists how he had spent 20 years trying to get Americans to pay attention to the urban poor .
“ We would call newspapers , television stations , saying kids are dying , we ’re going to funerals every weekend .
‘ Not interested . ’
We ’d say we ’ve got kids going to school in Oakland , 30 kids in the classroom , six books , no chalk . ’
‘ Not interested . ’ ”
Finally , the Yale Law School graduate turned community organizer told the crowd , “ We said , ‘ Well , we want green jobs and not jails for our youth . ’
And they said , ‘ Green ? Green ?
Green !’
GIVE THAT MAN A MICROPHONE !’ ”
“ Green , ” at least in the beginning , was a marketing term to Jones , a means to an end .
But the deeper he got into it , he said , the more he realized that the environment was central to the kind of social justice he cared about .
For the affluent lefties in the audience , he teased , environmentalism might be about polar bears and other “ charismatic megafauna . ”
But “ in the poor part of town , when they say , ‘ Oh , the environment is terrible , ’ they ’re talking about air pollution , asthma , cancer clusters and birth defects . ”
Working with inner-city residents required a new approach .
“ If I go and knock on the door in West Oakland , or Watts , or Newark , and say , ‘ Excuse me , I got a big problem here .
... WE GOTTA SAVE THE POLAR BEARS !’ are they going to join my group ?
No .
Because in the poor part of town ... if they ’re talking about global warming , they ’re not talking about polar bears drowning .
They ’re talking about people drowning -- that ’s Katrina . ”

Soon , the crowd was on its feet , applauding .
I was in the audience for that speech , and I remembered it last spring when I heard Jones had been named special advisor to President Obama on green jobs .
And I remembered it again last weekend when I heard he had resigned from that job under pressure .
Jones ’ resignation came in the wake of reports that he had once used an expletive to describe Republicans , and that he had signed a petition in 2004 asking Congress to investigate whether the Bush administration had failed to prevent the 9/11 attacks in order to justify war .
In the end , both liberals and conservatives condemned him .
But Jones ’ departure is a big loss .
He should be judged not by a few missteps but by his long history of working toward a highly desirable but elusive goal : an environmental movement that crosses boundaries of place , skin color and class .
By working to bring green jobs to “ the poor part of town ” and involving mainstream environmental leaders in the cause of fighting poverty , Jones has made a huge contribution .
The takedown of Van Jones was openly orchestrated by Americans for Prosperity , an Arizona - based conservative organization that rallies people who can barely afford to drive a car to the free clinic to press for offshore drilling and oppose healthcare reform .
In an editorial for the Fox News website , the group ’s policy director , Phil Kerpen , crowed that his attempt to ruin Jones was “ one of the most significant things I ’ve ever had the honor of being involved in . ”
I suspect Kerpen did n’t really care whether Jones was a 9/11 truther or a socialist , or which naughty words he used .
What he cared about was that Jones might actually succeed in getting the federal government to put people to work installing solar panels and insulating houses -- the “ green jobs scam , ” as Kerpen called it .

These days , Jones is far from the wild - eyed radical Kerpen described .
In fact , he has been moving to the center , where the power is , for years .
He has spent his time writing grants , appealing to city councils and working with legislators such as Nancy Pelosi on green - jobs bills .
He sat on the board of the Apollo Alliance , a group more - radical environmentalists have criticized as a mainstream sellout for its work linking industry with a greener agenda .
And his nonprofit advocacy group , Green For All , recently launched a program to involve the private sector in building an “ inclusive green economy . ”
Jones has embraced a truly practical kind of environmentalism , one that moves people not with pictures of melting ice caps but with relief from poverty and despair ; one that ca n’t be shoved off to the margins as elitist or extremist .
And perhaps that is why Americans for Prosperity viewed him as such a threat .
For the environmental movement , Jones ’ resignation is a setback .
One can only hope that his unwelcome celebrity of the past week will have the positive side effect of galvanizing support for his work ; that it will call attention to urban poverty , pollution and his ideal of a green economy .
To the extent Jones ’ agenda succeeds , it will benefit all of us .
Even the polar bears .
In Rolling Stone ’s new comedy issue , prominent comedians are asked to name the “ funniest movie ever ” and the “ funniest TV ever . ”
Robin Williams makes the best choice for funniest film ( “ Dr. Strangelove ” ) ; Gilbert Gottfried ( “ Duck Soup ” ) , Tina Fey ( “ Election ” ) and Billy Crystal ( “ Some Like It Hot ” ) also make good selections ; and Jimmy Fallon chooses what you might expect Jimmy Fallon to choose ( the “ Naked Gun ” movies ) .
As for television , Chris Rock goes for “ The Simpsons ” ( excellent pick ) , Eric Idle opts for “ Flight of the Conchords ” ( very good ) , and Larry David cites “ The Phil Silvers Show ” ( hilarious ) and “ Amos ‘ n ’ Andy ” ( huh ? ) .
All of which raises the question : what ’s the funniest novel ever ?
There ’s a difference , of course , between the greatest comic novel ( “ Don Quixote ” ?
“ Tristram Shandy ” ?
“ Ulysses ” ? ) and the novel you find the funniest .
“ Da Ali G Show ” certainly is n’t the best TV comedy ever , but no program makes me laugh harder .
Likewise , “ A Confederacy of Dunces ” may not be great literature , but Ignatius J. Reilly cracks me up .
Here are some nominees from editors at the Book Review : “ Lucky Jim ” ( which got the most votes ) , David Lodge ’s “ Small World , ” “ The Code of the Woosters , ” “ Leave It to Psmith , ” “ Bech : A Book , ” “ Sabbath ’s Theater , ” Carl Hiaasen ’s novels , Jim Harrison ’s early novels ( “ Warlock , ” “ A Good Day to Die ” ) , Richard Russo ’s “ Straight Man , ” Michael Chabon ’s “ Wonder Boys , ” “ Catch - 22 ″ and “ Candy . ”
Waugh , Gogol and John Mortimer received votes , too , and one colleague who is usually not given to laughing out loud while reading said , “ ‘ Portnoy ’s Complaint ’ and ‘ The Anatomy Lesson ’ both made my stomach hurt . ”
I would add , in reverse chronological order , Wilfrid Sheed ’s “ Max Jamison , ” Henry Fielding ’s “ Tom Jones ” and the “ Satyricon . ”
The last one may be cheating , since , well , the novel as such did n’t exist yet , but many critics have pointed to Petronius ’ laugh - riot as one of the earliest examples of the genre .
Sarah Palin would n’t care for it .
Obviously , 18th - and 20th - century literature has it all over the 19th - century variety when it comes to comedy .
( In 1957 , Kingsley Amis wrote in the Book Review that Fielding ’s humor was “ closer to our own than that of any writer before the present century . ” )
More interesting , where are the female nominees ?
Someone here mentioned Jane Austen , but only halfheartedly and only after I pointed out that not a single novel by a woman had been proposed .
What gives ?
KABUL —
It is the open secret no one wants to talk about , the unwelcome truth that most prefer to hide .
In Afghanistan , one of the richest sources of Taliban funding is the foreign assistance coming into the country .
Virtually every major project includes a healthy cut for the insurgents .
Call it protection money , call it extortion , or , as the Taliban themselves prefer to term it , “ spoils of war , ” the fact remains that international donors , primarily the United States , are to a large extent financing their own enemy .
“ Everyone knows this is going on , ” said one U.S. Embassy official , speaking privately .
It is almost impossible to determine how much the insurgents are spending , making it difficult to pinpoint the sources of the funds .
Mullah Abdul Salaam Zaeef , former Taliban minister to Pakistan , was perhaps more than a bit disingenuous when he told GlobalPost that the militants were operating mostly on air .
“ The Taliban does not have many expenses , ” he said , smiling slightly .
“ They are barefoot and hungry , with no roof over their heads and a stone for their pillow . ”
As for weapons , he just shrugged .
“ Afghanistan is full of guns , ” he said .
“ We have enough guns for years . ”
The reality is quite different , of course .
The militants recruit local fighters by paying for their services .
They move about in their traditional 4x4s , they have to feed their troops , pay for transportation and medical treatment for the wounded , and , of course , they have to buy rockets , grenades and their beloved Kalashnikovs .
Up until quite recently , most experts thought that drug money accounted for the bulk of Taliban funding .
But even here opinion was divided on actual amounts .
Some reports gauged the total annual income at about $ 100 million , while others placed the figure as high as $ 300 million — still a small fraction of the $ 4 billion poppy industry .
Now administration officials have launched a search for Taliban sponsors .
Richard Holbrooke , U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , told a press conference in Islamabad last month that drugs accounted for less of a share of Taliban coffers than was previously thought .
“ In the past there was a kind of feeling that the money all came from drugs in Afghanistan , ” said Holbrooke , according to media reports .
“ That is simply not true . ”
The new feeling is that less than half of the Taliban ’s war chest comes from poppy , with a variety of sources , including private contributions from Persian Gulf states , accounting for much of the rest .
Holbrooke told reporters that he would add a member of the Treasury Department to his staff to pursue the question of Taliban funding .
But perhaps U.S. officials need look no further than their own backyard .
Anecdotal evidence is mounting that the Taliban are taking a hefty portion of assistance money coming into Afghanistan from the outside .
This goes beyond mere protection money or extortion of “ taxes ” at the local level — very high - level negotiations take place between the Taliban and major contractors , according to sources close to the process .
A shadowy office in Kabul houses the Taliban contracts officer , who examines proposals and negotiates with organizational hierarchies for a percentage .
He will not speak to , or even meet with , a journalist , but sources who have spoken with him and who have seen documents say that the process is quite professional .
The manager of an Afghan firm with lucrative construction contracts with the U.S. government builds in a minimum of 20 percent for the Taliban in his cost estimates .
The manager , who will not speak openly , has told friends privately that he makes in the neighborhood of $ 1 million per month .
Out of this , $ 200,000 is siphoned off for the insurgents .
If negotiations fall through , the project will come to harm — road workers may be attacked or killed , bridges may be blown up , engineers may be assassinated .
The degree of cooperation and coordination between the Taliban and aid workers is surprising , and would most likely make funders extremely uncomfortable .
One Afghan contractor , speaking privately , told friends of one project he was overseeing in the volatile south .
The province cannot be mentioned , nor the particular project .
“ I was building a bridge , ” he said , one evening over drinks .
“ The local Taliban commander called and said ‘ do n’t build a bridge there , we ’ll have to blow it up . ’
I asked him to let me finish the bridge , collect the money — then they could blow it up whenever they wanted .
We agreed , and I completed my project . ”
In the south , no contract can be implemented without the Taliban taking a cut , sometimes at various steps along the way .
One contractor in the southern province of Helmand was negotiating with a local supplier for a large shipment of pipes .
The pipes had to be brought in from Pakistan , so the supplier tacked on about 30 percent extra for the Taliban , to ensure that the pipes reached Lashkar Gah safely .
Once the pipes were given over to the contractor , he had to negotiate with the Taliban again to get the pipes out to the project site .
This was added to the transportation costs .
“ We assume that our people are paying off the Taliban , ” said the foreign contractor in charge of the project .
In Farah province , local officials report that the Taliban are taking up to 40 percent of the money coming in for the National Solidarity Program , one of the country ’s most successful community reconstruction projects , which has dispensed hundreds of millions of dollars throughout the country over the past six years .
Many
Afghans see little wrong in the militants getting their fair share of foreign assistance .
“ This is international money , " said one young Kabul resident .
“ They are not taking it from the people , they are taking it from their enemy . ”
But in areas under Taliban control , the insurgents are extorting funds from the people as well .
In war - ravaged Helmand , where much of the province has been under Taliban control for the past two years , residents grumble about the tariffs .
“ It ’s a disaster , ” said a 50 - year - old resident of Marja district .
“ We have to give them two kilos of poppy paste per jerib during the harvest ; then we have to give them ushr ( an Islamic tax , amounting to one - tenth of the harvest ) from our wheat .
Then they insisted on zakat ( an Islamic tithe ) .
Now they have come up with something else : 12,000 Pakistani rupee ( approximately $ 150 ) per household .
And they wo n’t take even one rupee less . ”
It all adds up , of course .
But all things are relative : if the Taliban are able to raise and spend say $ 1 billion per year — the outside limit of what anyone has been able to predict — that accounts for what the United States is now spending on 10 days of the war to defeat them .

Reflections on the Revolution in Europe : Immigration , Islam and the West .
By Christopher Caldwell .

IN APRIL 1968 Enoch Powell , a Tory cabinet minister , destroyed his political career when he denounced mass immigration as a disaster ( “ like the Roman ” , he said , “ I seem to see ‘ the river Tiber foaming with much blood ' ” ) .
Today Powell 's arguments , if not his classical allusions , are becoming dangerously mainstream .
Christopher Caldwell is an American journalist who writes for the liberal Financial Times as well as the conservative Weekly Standard .
He has spent the past decade studying European immigration , travelling widely and reading voraciously in an impressive variety of languages .
His controversial new book repeatedly echoes Powell 's warnings all those years ago .
Mr Caldwell argues that “ Western Europe became a multi-ethnic society in a fit of absence of mind . ”
European policymakers imported people to fill short - term job shortages .
But immigrants continued to multiply even as the jobs disappeared : the number of foreign residents in Germany increased from 3 m in 1971 to 7.5 m in 2000 though the number of foreigners in the workforce did not budge .
Today immigrants account for about 10 % of the population of most west European countries , and up to 30 % in some of Europe 's great cities .
Policymakers were even more mistaken about culture than they were about numbers .
They assumed that immigrants would quickly adopt the mores of their host societies .
But a surprising number of immigrants have proved “ unmeltable ” .
Mr Caldwell argues that the reason why so many immigrants failed to assimilate can be summed up in a single word : Islam .
In the middle of the 20th century there were almost no Muslims in Europe .
Today there are 15 m - 17 m , making up about half of all new arrivals in Europe .
For the most part European countries have bent over backwards to accommodate the sensibilities of the newcomers .
A French law court has allowed a Muslim man to annul his marriage on the ground that his wife was not a virgin on their wedding night .
The British pensions department has a policy of recognising ( and giving some benefits to ) “ additional spouses ” .
But European public opinion is tiring of such bending .
Mr Caldwell cites a poll that shows that only 19 % of Europeans think immigration to be a good thing for their country ; 57 % think that their country has “ too many foreigners ” .
Such numbers have recently forced politicians to adjust their policies .
Many countries are tightening their immigration laws , shifting to a skills - based immigration system and setting citizenship tests for would - be immigrants .
The French have banned girls from wearing veils in schools .
British politicians , such as Tony Blair and Jack Straw , have denounced the veil as a symbol of separation .
The old welcome - mat seems to have been replaced by a “ Love it or leave it ” sign .
For Mr Caldwell this is all a matter of too little too late .
Europe 's indigenous population is ageing fast , with a quarter of it over 60 .
Immigrants have large families .
Moreover , Europe is no match for Islamic self - confidence : “ When an insecure , malleable , relativistic culture meets a culture that is anchored , confident and strengthened by common doctrines , it is generally the former that changes to suit the latter . ”
Mr Caldwell 's unremitting pessimism about Europe raises all sorts of questions , both large and small .
Are Europeans really as feeble as he asserts ?
They have discovered that some principles are non-negotiable in their relations with Islam , particularly women 's rights .
And is Islam really as self - confident ?
The willingness of so many Muslims to take offence at any slight — a cartoon here , a novel there — could be a sign of profound cultural anxiety .
Mr Caldwell is also worryingly selective in his use of evidence .
He all but ignores the multiple examples of upward mobility and successful integration .
He dwells on the fact that many Muslim men feel emasculated by the success of their women without bothering to wonder why so many of the women are successful .
That said , this is an important book as well as a provocative one : the best statement to date of the pessimist 's position on Islamic immigration in Europe .
Supporters of liberal policies need to sharpen their arguments if they are to prevent neo-Powellism from sweeping all before it .

Phobos - Grunt and Yinghuo 1 are due for launch together Less than two months before the scheduled launch of Russia 's flagship planetary spacecraft , officials are set to recommend a delay until 2011 .
The Phobos - Grunt mission aims to land on the Martian moon Phobos to collect soil samples and return them to Earth .
Sources within the Russian space industry gave RussianSpaceWeb.com details of the likely postponement .
The Russian space agency Roskosmos is expected to announce the mission 's fate within a week .
The agency 's decision will be based on results of testing which the spacecraft has been undergoing since July at its assembly facility at NPO Lavochkin in Khimki , near Moscow .
A delay for Phobos - Grunt would also affect China 's first Mars probe Yinghuo 1 , as the two craft are due to be launched together on the same Zenit rocket .
Tight schedule According to its latest increasingly tight schedule , the Phobos - Grunt spacecraft had to be shipped to the launch site in Baikonur Cosmodrome on 26 September 2009 in order to catch a narrow astronomical launch window to Mars in October of this year .
A previously announced timeline called for the shipment of the spacecraft to Baikonur in August , only to be pushed back to the middle of September 2009 .
The decision to roll out the vehicle to Baikonur would mean a commitment to launch this year , while failure to do so would postpone the mission to 2011 .
Industry sources said that despite all efforts , the probe 's flight control systems are likely to need more tests before they can be considered reliable enough to survive a complex multi-year mission .
Complex demands
The systems will need to be robust enough to cope with complex manoeuvring in Martian orbit , landing on the surface of Phobos , the takeoff of the return vehicle and the landing of the capsule containing the soil samples on Earth .
A further argument to postpone the mission to 2011 would be lack of duplicate failsafe systems at Russian mission control to guide the spacecraft into deep space .
Currently Russia 's only operational deep space antenna capable of sending flight control commands to Phobos - Grunt is in Ussuriyisk near Vladivostok .
Any serious problems there would doom the mission .
A second antenna , in Medvezhi Ozera , near St Petersburg , could be capable of controlling the mission - but only after an upgrade , which is not expected to be completed until sometime next year .
Launching the spacecraft with only a single operational flight control antenna would endanger the mission , experts said .
Roskosmos recently reached an agreement with the European Space Agency , Esa , to use its facilities in the Phobos - Grunt project .
But European ground control stations would only be capable of receiving data rather than controlling the spacecraft .
Those in favour of postponing the mission to 2011 argue that Russian scientists have not conducted a deep space mission for more than two decades , and available time to prepare the launch in 2009 was inadequate .
In 1988 , a pair of Soviet probes was sent to Mars but one failed on its way to the red planet and the other soon after entering orbit .
Flight control error was blamed for at least one failure .
Russia 's latest probe to Mars , launched in 1996 , crashed back to Earth when the launch vehicle failed .
Lack of Russian ground control facilities meant the exact cause was never pinpointed .
Despite many previous unofficial reports that the beleaguered project would have to be delayed to at least 2011 , the Russian space agency and NPO Lavochkin , the probe 's primary developer , have always insisted that the mission would launch in 2009 .
Knock - on effect According to latest reports , the launch of Phobos - Grunt was pushed to the beginning of November 2009 , essentially beyond the available launch window to Mars .
It was unclear how such a move would affect the mission , since launching outside of the astronomical window would limit the mass of the payload to be carried to Mars .
Delaying Phobos - Grunt from 2009 to 2011 might also have a knock - on effect on future Russian missions into deep space .
Experts say Phobos - Grunt is relatively well prepared for flight , so it would need little extra money to be ready for 2011 .
However the same personnel and facilities employed in the preparation of the Phobos - Grunt project , at NPO Lavochkin and the IKI space research institute in Moscow , will be needed to design subsequent missions such as the Luna - Glob probe , which - according to the official schedule - is due to enter orbit around the Moon in 2011 .

The scandal surrounding the left - wing activist organization ACORN has spread to New York , with employees at its Brooklyn office caught on video helping supposed ladies of the night get loans for their dream houses of ill repute .
Rather than reminding the women that prostitution is dangerous and illegal and advising them to change their careers , counselors at the social - services group shockingly offer suggestions on how they can launder their earnings .
“ Honesty is not going to get you the house , ” a loan counselor at the offices told two activists posing as a mortgage - seeking pimp and prostitute .
“ You ca n’t say what you do for a living . ”
ACORN workers in two other cities , Baltimore and Washington , DC , had already fallen hooker , line and sinker for the hidden - camera sting operation by two conservative activists .
Four ACORN employees have been fired as a result of the earlier videos , and last Friday the Census Bureau severed its ties with the group , whose members had been hired to do canvassing during the 2010 census .
Mayor Bloomberg spoke out on the controversy today .
“ Prostitution is illegal in this state and I do n’t know why they would — why an organization like ACORN , who ’s trying to encourage voter turnout and voter registration , why they ’re getting involved in any of that stuff , ” Bloomberg said .
“ But clearly it ’s not appropriate and they should n’t have been doing it .
Whether they broke a law or not I do n’t know .
You ’ll have to talk to the legal ( authorities ) . ”
The Brooklyn DA ’s office announced today it would be investigating the group .
In an unrelated outrage , ACORN was accused of widespread voter fraud during the 2008 presidential election by helping unqualified voters to register .
As in prior videos released by the filmmaking team of James O’Keefe , 25 , and Hannah Giles , 20 , employees of the group — which specializes in housing and voter activism — were eager to dispense advice on gaming the system and skirting the law .
“ You know , what goes on in the house we do n’t care , ” one counselor said .
“ We just help you with the mortgage . ”
O’Keefe and Giles were garishly dressed as a stereotypical pimp and prostitute .
O’Keefe was decked out in excessively snazzy flesh - peddler couture , and Giles , going by the name “ Eden , ” wore almost nothing .
The ACORN workers were not the slightest bit judgmental or put off by the request for help in getting financing for a brothel .
Counselor Volda Albert freely offered financial advice to the young couple , and held back on giving out any life advice .
“ I ca n’t tell you do n’t do it , because you wo n’t listen to me , ” Albert said .
For tax and banking purposes , and to establish a legitimate income and credit history , Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a “ freelancer . ”
“ Do n’t say that you ’re a prostitute thing or whatever , ” she said .
Albert also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks , depositing no more than $ 500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised .
As for the rest of the money she earned from turning tricks , Albert told her to hide it away .
“ When you buy the house with a back yard .
You get a tin . . . and bury it down in there , and you put the money right in , and you put grass over it , and you do n’t tell a single soul but yourself where it is , ” she said .
Albert even had advice on protecting O’Keefe from getting tied by authorities to Giles ’ prostitution .
Her illegally obtained revenue could be given to O’Keefe through an intermediary , and then he could use it for a down payment on the house by applying for a “ no doc ” loan .
In the earlier videos , counselors offered similar suggestions to a “ prostitute , ” telling her to list her occupation as “ performance artist , ” and even offering advice on how to claim as dependants underage girls recruited for the business .
Milagros Rivera , the Brooklyn office administrator advised Giles , “ do n’t get caught — it ’s against the law what you are doing , and there ’s a chance you ’ll get caught . ”
Before bidding them good luck , Albert offered two final suggestions .
“ Save for a rainy day , ” she said .
“ And live well . ”
O’Keefe , who majored in philosophy at Rutgers University , said he and Giles funded the project themselves .
This kind of undercover , guerrilla tactic is the “ future of investigative journalism and political activism , ” he said .
Inspired by “ Rules for Radicals , ” Saul Alinsky ’s bible for rabble - rousing , more often associated with the left , O’Keefe said he has been targeting and exposing the “ absurdities of the enemy by employing their own rules and language . ”
“ If you can make impossible demands on your enemy , you can destroy them , ” he said .
So he began using a hidden camera “ in a location I ’d rather not disclose ” and started visiting ACORN offices around the Northeast .
As with a series of videos O’Keefe made in 2008 , in which Planned Parenthood employees agreed to earmark his donations for the abortions of African - American babies , he said he expected ACORN would yield maybe “ a few gotcha moments . ”
“ But we never imagined they would all comply — it ’s just disgusting they did n’t just throw us out of the office , ” he said .
In a statement released Saturday , ACORN said that it could not defend the actions of its employees but that what O’Keefe and Giles did was criminal .
“ And , in fact , a crime it was — our lawyers believe a felony — and we will be taking legal action against Fox and their co-conspirators , ” the statement said .
Fox News aired the Baltimore and Washington tapes .
O’Keefe said , “ ACORN wants it both ways . ”
“ You ca n’t fire the employees and then say I have defamed them , ” he said .

Iran 's International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) ambassador Ali Asghar Soltaniyeh briefs the media after a meeting on the Iranian nuclear issue in Vienna with EU , Russian and U.S. diplomats at Vienna 's UN headquarters October 21 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Herwig Prammer
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran declined on Friday to endorse proposals by the U.N. nuclear watchdog to help reduce Iran ’s stockpile of low - enriched uranium .
It said it was awaiting a “ positive and constructive ” response from world powers to its proposal on providing nuclear fuel for a Tehran reactor producing medical isotopes , state television reported .
“ Now we are awaiting a positive and constructive response on Iran ’s proposal from the other party on providing nuclear fuel for Tehran ’s reactor , ” TV quoted a member of Iran ’s negotiating team , who attended the Vienna meeting on October 21 , as saying .
“ The other party is expected to avoid past mistakes in violating agreements ... and to gain Iran ’s trust , ” the unnamed official said .
The U.N. nuclear watchdog on Wednesday presented a draft deal to Iran and three world powers for approval within two days to reduce Tehran ’s stockpile of low - enriched uranium , seen by the West as a nuclear weapons risk .
The three powers -- Russia , the United States and France -- have all signaled approval of the draft .
Western diplomats said the plan would require Tehran to send 1.2 tons of its known 1.5 - tonne reserve of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) to Russia and France by the end of the year .
The material would be converted into fuel for the Tehran medical reactor .

In 1998 , usability expert Rolf Molich ( co-inventor with Jakob Nielsen of the heuristic evaluation method ) gave nine teams three weeks to evaluate the webmail application www.hotmail.com.
The experiment was part of his series of Comparative Usability Evaluations ( CUEs ) , through which he began to identify a set of standards and best practices for usability tests .
In each segment of the series , Molich asked several usability teams to evaluate a single design using the method of their choice .
Article Continues Below
From the documented results of the second test , called CUE - 2 , a surprising trend appeared .
Contrary to claims that usability professionals operate scientifically to identify problems in an interface , usability evaluations are at best less than scientific .
In an interview with Christine Perfetti published in User Interface Engineering , Molich said :
The CUE - 2 teams reported 310 different usability problems .
The most frequently reported problem was reported by seven of the nine teams .
Only six problems were reported by more than half of the teams , while 232 problems ( 75 percent ) were reported only once .
Many of the problems that were classified as “ serious ” were only reported by a single team .
Even the tasks used by most or all teams produced very different results — around 70 percent of the findings for each of these common tasks were unique .
In CUE - 4 , run in 2003 , 17 teams evaluated the Hotel Penn website , which featured a Flash - based reservation system developed by iHotelier .
Of the 17 teams , nine ran usability tests , and the remaining eight performed expert reviews .
Collectively , the teams reported 340 usability problems .
However , only nine of these problems were reported by more than half of the teams .
And a total of 205 problems — 60 % of all the findings reported — were identified only once .
Of the 340 usability problems identified , 61 problems were classifed as “ serious ” or “ critical ” problems .
Think about that for a moment .
For the Hotmail team to have identified all of the “ serious ” usability problems discovered in the evaluation process , it would have to have hired all nine usability teams .
In CUE - 4 , to spot all 61 serious problems , the Hotel Penn team would have to have hired all 17 usability teams .
Seventeen !
Asked how development teams could be confident they are addressing the right problems on their websites , Molich concluded , “ It ’s very simple : They ca n’t be sure ! ”
Why usability evaluation is unreliable #section2
Usability evaluations are good for a lot of things , but determining what a team ’s priorities should be is not one of them .
Fortunately , there is an explanation for these counterintuitive outcomes that can help us choose a more appropriate evaluation course .
Right questions , wrong people , and vice versa#section3
First , different teams get different results because tests and research are often performed poorly : teams either ask the right questions of the wrong people or ask the wrong questions of the right people .
In one recent case , the project goal was to improve usability for a site ’s new users .
A card - sorting session — a perfectly appropriate discovery method for planning information architecture changes — revealed that the existing , less - than - ideal terminology used throughout the site should be retained .
This happened because the team ran the card - sort with existing site users instead of the new users it aimed to entice .
In another case , a team charged with improving the usability of a web application clearly in need of an overhaul ran usability tests to identify major problems .
In the end , they determined that the rather poorly - designed existing task flows should not only be kept , but featured .
This team , too , ran its tests with existing users , who had — as one might guess — become quite proficient at navigating the inadequate interaction model .
Usability teams also have wildly differing experience levels , skill sets , degrees of talent , and knowledge , and although some research and testing methods have been homogenized to the point that anyone should be able to perform them proficiently , a team ’s savvy ( or lack thereof ) can affect the results it gets .
That almost anyone can perform a heuristic evaluation does n’t mean the outcome will always be useful or even accurate .
Heuristics are not a checklist , they are guidelines a usability evaluator can use as a baseline from which to apply her expertise .
They are a beginning , not an end .
Testing and evaluation is useless without context#section4
Next , while usability testing is perhaps no more reliable a prioritization method than an expert - level , qualitative evaluation performed by a lone reviewer or a small group of reviewers , testing is like any other evaluation or discovery method :
It must be , but frequently is not , put in context .
Page views and time - spent - per - page metrics , while often foolishly considered standard measures of site effectiveness , are meaningless until they are considered in context of the goals of the pages being visited .
Is a user who visits a series of pages doing so because the task flow is effective , or because he can’t find the content he seeks ?
Are users spending a lot of time on a page because they ’re engaged , or because they ’re stuck ?
While NYTimes.com surely hopes readers will stay on a page long enough to read an article in full or scan all its headlines , Google ’s goal is for users to find what they need and leave a search results page as quickly as possible .
A lengthy time - spent metric on NYTimes.com could indicate a high - quality or high - value article .
For Google ’s search workflow , it could indicate a team ’s utter failure .
I suspect that the teams Rolf Molich hired were asked to do their evaluations without first going through a discovery process to reveal business goals and user goals , or to determine success metrics .
This lack of information may have been responsible for the skewed results .
Regardless , these indications of the unreliability of evaluation methods allow us to identify more appropriate research and testing solutions .
What testing is really good for #section5
Malcolm Gladwell ’s bestselling book Blink begins with a story about a seemingly ancient marble statue .
When several experts in Greek sculpture evaluated it , each pronounced the artifact was a fake .
Without a shred of scientific evidence , these experts simply looked over the object and saw that it could n’t possibly have been created during the time period its finders claimed .
These experts could n’t , in most cases , explain their beliefs .
They just knew .
The experts were able to do this because they had each spent thousands of hours sharpening their instincts through research and practice .
They had studied their craft so much that they spotted the fraud almost instantly , though they were often unable to articulate what gave away the object as a fake .
Usability testing informs the designer and the design #section6
A good usability professional must be able to identify high - priority problems and make appropriate recommendations — and the best evaluators do this quickly and reliably — but a good designer must also be able to design well in the first place .
This is one area in which usability testing has real power .
It can hone designers ’ instincts so they can spot potential usability problems and improve the designs without the cost of formal testing on every project .
And interestingly , many of the most compelling usability test insights come not from the elements that are evaluated , but rather those not evaluated .
They come from the almost unnoticeable moments when a user frowns at a button label , or obviously rates a task flow as easier than it appeared during completion , or claims to understand a concept while simultaneously misdefining it .
The unintended conclusions — the peripheral insights — are often what feed a designer ’s instincts most .
Over time , testing sessions can strengthen a designer ’s intuition so that she can spot troublesome design details with just a glance .
Simply put , usability tests can provide huge insight into the patterns and nuances of human behavior .
This notion alone , however , is unlikely to justify the expense of testing to organizations struggling with profitability .
It ’s usually only after a company has become successful that testing becomes routine , so designers and usability professionals must rely on other justifications .
Fortunately , there are several .
Usability testing justified # section7
First , usability testing has high shock value .
Teams invariably conclude their initial sessions surprised to learn they had not noticed glaringly obvious design problems .
This shock alone is often enough to drive a team toward a more strategic approach in which it reverts to what should have been the earliest phase of the process :
Determining the project ’s goals and forming a comprehensive strategy for achieving them .
In short , it convinces teams that something is wrong and motivates them to take action .
As the saying goes , knowing is half the battle .
Second , testing helps establish trust with stakeholders .
For an internal project , testing helps quell management and stakeholder concerns about the validity of a design team ’s findings and recommendations .
It ’s not enough , in other words , to hire experienced practitioners — those practitioners must then prove themselves repeatedly until teams begin to trust their expertise .
Testing offers a basis for that trust .
Finally , while testing alone is not a good indicator of where a team ’s priorities should lie , it is most certainly part of the triangulation process .
When put in context of other data , such as project goals , user goals , user feedback , and usage metrics , testing helps establish a complete picture .
Without this context , however , testing can be misleading or misunderstood at best , and outright damaging at worst .
This is also true for non-testing - based evaluation methods , such as heuristic reviews .
Adapting to the reality # section8
There is a catch to all of the preceding arguments , however :
They revolve around the notion that testing should be used primarily to identify problems with existing designs .
This is where teams get into trouble — they assume testing is worth more than it truly is , resolve to address problems based purely on testing data , and revise strategies based entirely on comments made by test participants .
None of these things reliably lead to positive outcomes , nor do they ensure a team will emerge from the process any wiser than the day before .
As we ’ve seen , test results and research can point teams toward solutions that are not only ill - advised , but in direct conflict with their goals .
It ’s only natural that existing users perform tasks capably and comfortably despite poor task design .
After all , the most usable application is the one you already know .
But this does n’t mean poor designs should not be revamped .
Rather , to adapt to and harness the power of usability testing , current users should be brought in to test new ideas — ideas that surface from expert evaluation and collaboration with designers to create new solutions .
What they should have done#section9
The team that ran the card - sort in the earlier example should have devised a new set of terms and used testing to validate them , rather than ask users to determine which terms to apply in the first place .
The team that decided to feature poorly - designed task flows because its existing audience could proficiently use them should have prototyped new task flows and run test sessions to validate usability with existing and first - time users .
To identify problems on which to focus , these teams , and yours , can take a variety of approaches .
Consider a revised workflow that begins with an expert - level heuristic evaluation used in conjunction with informal testing methods , followed by informal and formal testing .
More specifically , consider using online tools and paid services to investigate hunches , then use more formal methods to test and validate revised solutions that involve a designer ’s input .
Here are several tools that can be used with a heuristic evaluation to identify trouble spots :
Five - second tests :
Show a screen to a user for five seconds and ask her to write down everything she remembers .
In task - focused screens , ask the user how to perform a core task , and then show her the screen and ask her to tell you her answer .

Click stats on screenshots : Chalkmark offers essentially the same service as Crazy Egg , but uses screenshots rather than live pages .
This way , you can analyze a screen ’s usability before the design goes live , which is , of course , the best time to do it .
In handling usability projects in this way , teams will identify priorities and achieve better outcomes , and can still gain all the benefits of being actively involved with usability tests .
The major caveat to all of these methods is that users who are invested in completing a task act very differently than those who are not .
A test participant who really wants to buy a digital camera will behave differently on a commerce site than a participant whose only motivation is to be compensated .
Those who are invested in the tasks will persevere through far more problems than those who are not .
When using any of these methods , it ’s important to try to find participants who actually want to complete the very tasks you wish to evaluate .
Obviously , not every team or organization can bear the expense of usability testing .
In the end , you can do only what ’s most feasible in your particular situation .
But if testing is an option — whether as a one - time experiment or already part of your regular routine — be sure to use the tool for the right job , and be sure to approach the process with clear expectations .
Usability professionals may prefer that Molich ’s story be kept quiet .
Not because it delegitimizes the profession , but because it can be easily misunderstood if told outside of its context .
While usability testing fails wholly to do what many people think is its most pertinent and relevant purpose — to identify problems and point a team in the right direction — it does provide a direct path for observing human behavior , it does a brilliant job of informing a designer ’s instincts over time , it builds trust with stakeholders , and it ’s a very effective tool for validating design ideas .
Test for the right reasons and you stand a good chance of achieving a positive outcome .
Test for the wrong ones , however , and you may not only produce misleading results , but also put your entire business at risk .
Wrongly Convicted Texas Inmate Freed after 15 years
Yesterday , a Texas court freed Richard Miles , who was serving 40 years for a murder committed in 1994 .
Prosecutors admitted that Miles ' trial had been tainted by failure to notify Miles or his attorney of another man 's confession , and that Miles is likely innocent .
Miles ' attorneys will press on -- with the aim of a formal finding of innocence , which would entitle him to compensation for the 15 years he spent behind bars .
The Dallas Morning News reported that Miles was released straight from the courtroom -- with the court and prosecutors forgoing the usual trip back to jail for release processing .
Miles had been convicted for a shooting that left one person dead .
After spending one year in custody before being tried , he spent 14 more years behind bars .
What was wrong with his trial ?
Most importantly , the defense was never informed of a call received by a woman reporting another man 's confession to committing the crime .
The Morning News cites the Dallas County District Attorney as stating that police ( rather than prosecutors ) failed to report the call .
Beyond the other confession , the trial 's key piece of evidence -- the testimony of an eye witness -- was also laden with problems .
According to the Morning News , the witness identified Miles after having seen police escort him out of a squad car in handcuffs .
She picked him out of a photo line up in which Miles was the only man wearing a white tank top ( which the gunman was described as wearing ) .
After being released , Miles ( who was convicted when he was 19 ) hugged his mother , who immediately cut off his jail ID bracelet .
So what happens now with Mr. Miles ?
Though he 's been released with no indication that he 'll be retried for the offense , it will require a formal finding of innocence for him to pursue compensation for the year of his life spent in jail .
In Texas , this means $ 80,000 per year plus an annuity worth at least $ 40,000 .
As described by The Innocence Project , Texas ' new compensation law ( which went into effect in September ) is the most generous amongst the 27 states which have passed laws to compensate those convicted of crimes but later found to be innocent .
In addition to wrongly served jail time , it covers time spent on parole .

On the day President Obama addressed the nation 's schoolchildren , a middle school student donned an anti-abortion T - shirt to protest Obama 's proposed overhaul of the nation 's health care system .
The student wore the " Abortion is not Healthcare " T - shirt without incident until his fifth - period teacher sent him to the principal 's office .
He was ordered to turn the shirt inside out because it might offend other students .
The boy 's father , William Boyer of New Cumberland , Pa. , filed suit last Monday against the West Shore School District , alleging that his son , E.B. , was unfairly censored by school officials on Sept .
8 . Neither district officials nor their lawyer wanted to comment on the lawsuit because they had not seen it , said Rob Cox , an attorney with Eastburn & Gray , the law firm that represents the school district .
Valerie Burch , a staff attorney with the Pennsylvania chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union , said the student 's T - shirt represented political speech , the most protected form of speech , even inside schools .
If the district does not have a dress code that prohibits wearing T - shirts , then it has to permit this one , she said .
" Student - speech law has developed a lot ... but one thing that is still plain and clear as day is that political speech like the T - shirt ... is highly protected , even within schools , " Burch said .
" I do n't see how they can prohibit this . "
Boyer 's suit claims the district 's policies regarding student expression , dress and grooming are unconstitutional and that the censorship of religious and political speech violates the First and 14th amendments to the Constitution .
The district 's dress - and - grooming policy prohibits clothing " which creates a hostile educational environment or evidences discriminatory bias or animus " or displays " inappropriate words . "
Boyer is seeking to have the district 's policies struck down and to remove any references to disciplinary action from his son's record .
He also is seeking damages such as court costs and attorneys ' fees .

Re : check out forth
There is quite a bit of similarity ( in principle ) between LISP and other ( mostly monadic ) languages .
FORTH is an amazing language , but there 's something about it which prevented its adoption .
I have a love / hate relationship with it .
It allows nearly free - form syntax , the solving of problems by constructing a solution vocabulary , interactivity second to none and can be implemented in a small amount of assembler code .
On the other hand , the semantics of using a stack as your primary data structure can become quite strange and easily gets out of hand .
I know there are ways around it , but ...
List ( or more generally treap / hash ) based languages provide a powerful and universal data structure that encourages general tool development , much as the author explains .
There are parallels with unix pipe scripting as well .
Personally I like to use one powerful , general - purpose compiled language ( currently D ) , write short utilities with a great scripting language ( Python or Lua - both list / treap based ) and play with a promising new language .
My favorite new language to learn is Haskell .
It 's very closely related to Scheme , though the syntax is easier on the eye .
Its interactive , compiles to highly efficient machine language and it natively supports multi-core , multi- threading expressions / algorithms .
Quicksort can be expressed elegantly in a short , single , understandable line of code . (!!)
I have an neural net / AI project which I think would be wonderfully suited to it .
Check them all out .

I had the same experience ; the CIO in my case was Jay Lark , and he was n't a CIO quite yet .
( And I had read Wilensky 's Lispcraft years before , which opened my eyes quite a bit , too , but it was really SICP that changed my outlook .
I wrote an essay about my evolution as a programmer which you can find if you are interested . )

My current preferred Lisp - equivalents are Python and JavaScript .

Not wanting to be contrarian / annoying , but I do n't know if I 'd call Python lisp - like .
Well , you 're entitled to your opinion , of course , but you should read Norvig 's before you make up your mind completely .
Do n't worry about being annoying .
There are some similarities , but I think the code is data thing is not there in Python .
No , it 's not , except in the trivial senses that you can eval or exec a string , and there 's a module for parsing Python code so you can e.g. analyze Python programs for errors .
In particular there are no macros .
( But there were no macros in Lisp until sometime around 1970 , either , and in some Lisps until well after that . )
If it 's embedded DSLs you want , you can do quite a bit in that direction by overriding __getattribute__ and operators .
Python is , however , reflective .
Are functions first class objects in Python ( I 've not looked into it ) ?
Yes , to the same extent as in a statically - scoped Lisp , and therefore to a greater extent than in older dynamically - scoped Lisps ( elisp , any Lisp before 1976 , most Lisps before Common Lisp ) .
There 's a minor syntactic annoyance , which is that Python distinguishes expressions from statements , and if you want to create a closure that contains statements , you can't do it in the middle of an expression ; you have to do it in a def statement , which assigns it a name that you can then use inside an expression .
But that 's a purely syntactic constraint ; it does n't affect the power of the language .
On SICP : do n't rush yourself .
If it 's going slowly , you may not be ready to go fast through a certain part of it yet .
SICP is like a sushi dinner prepared by one of the world 's best chefs : you can enjoy it enormously , but if you force it down your gullet as fast as it will go , you will be missing out on a lot .
Worse , it may not stay down .
Wait until your appetite has had a chance to recover before ordering another plate of uni .
Maybe come back tomorrow .

Grandson of Pascal - Oberon 2 and Component Pascal I 've found Oberon 2 and the commercial ( though now open source ) BlackBox Component Pascal to have a lot of the organismic qualities of Lisp .
They were developed by Wirth and some of his grad students .
See oberon.ch/blackbox.html for more info ( auf Deutch , but the docs in the downloadable ( Windows only ) version are in English ) .
Component Pascal has also available compilers for .NET and JVM , with an IDE available from CFB Software : http://www.cfbsoftware.com/cpide/cpide.aspx

Looking forward to have my say Hey - I am definitely delighted to discover this .
great job !
BACK during the Obama transition , the newly designated chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , enunciated what I ’ll call the Emanuel Principle : “ You do n’t ever want a crisis to go to waste , ” he said .
“ It ’s an opportunity to do important things that you would otherwise avoid . ”
He was right .
But I fear that the Emanuel Principle is about to be violated in the case of financial reform .
We are barely emerging from the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s .
From last September to March , it was downright frightening .
Yet by the time Congress left town for its summer recess , financial reform appeared to be losing steam .
Monday is Labor Day , the psychological end of summer .
So , starting on Tuesday , it ’s up to the administration and the Congressional leadership to breathe some life into what ’s left of the reform concept .
After all we ’ve been through , and with so much anger still directed at financial miscreants , the political indifference toward financial reform is somewhere between maddening and tragic .
Why is the pulse of reform so faint ?
I see five main reasons :
IT ’S YESTERDAY ’S PROBLEM
People have an amazing capacity to forget .
Our financial system is now functioning much better than it was in March or last fall .
So the Alfred E. Neuman Principle ( “ What , me worry ? ” ) threatens to displace the Emanuel Principle .
Fighting For The Rights Of Car Accident Victims Throughout Minnesota
A motor vehicle accident can leave you with many hardships , but an experienced personal injury attorney can be your key to a brighter future .
After a serious motor vehicle accident , your life will change drastically .
In addition to facing daily decisions involving your family and work , you must now schedule countless doctors ’ appointments , figure out how to pay for your medical expenses , and consider how to take care of your family if you cannot work .
With challenges as big as these , you cannot move forward without help – from family and friends , medical specialists , and experienced personal injury lawyers .
At the Law Office of Jeffrey A. Jones , P.A. , in Minneapolis , our attorneys are highly experienced in personal injury litigation , and we focus solely on auto accident claims .
Over the course of our careers , we have secured favorable compensation in every type of motor vehicle accident and for a wide range of corresponding injuries .
One thing I could n’t get into in today ’s column , both for the sake of space and comprehensibility for a broad audience , was an explanation of exactly what I meant when I wrote
But we should n’t be too hard on Mr. Beck .
Similar — and similarly false — claims about the cost of Waxman - Markey have been circulated by many supposed experts .
So let me do that here .
Basic economics says that if we want to discourage a negative externality , like pollution , we need to put a price on that externality .
One way is through an emissions tax ; an alternative , with very similar economic results , is a system of tradable permits .
All this goes back to Pigou ; Greg Mankiw has urged economists to join his Pigou Club of those who support externality taxes .
Now , a key point in all this is that the emissions tax or , equivalently , the rent on emissions permits , does not represent a net loss to society .
It ’s just a transfer from one set of people to another — from the emitters , and ultimately those who buy their products , to whoever collects the taxes or gets the permits , and ultimately whoever benefits from the revenue or rents thus generated .
The only net loss is the Harberger triangle created by the reduction in emissions — which has to be set against the benefits of reduced pollution .
And the burden on households from cap and trade depends on what ’s done with the rents .
In the original Obama plan , the rents would be used to pay for middle - class tax cuts ; in Waxman - Markey , many of the permits are initially granted to utilities — but since these utilities ’ profits are regulated , many of the rents would end up being passed on to consumers through lower prices .
Enter Glenn Beck .
He picked up on a calculation by a conservative blogger who took a guess about the rents on emissions permits and assumed that all of this would amount to a tax on families .
( Beck then added his own special sauce by misreporting the blogger ’s speculations as a “ buried ” Obama report . )
Bad stuff .
But here ’s the thing : how different is this from what , um , Martin Feldstein did a few months ago in an op -ed ?
Here ’s the relevant passage :
The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the resulting increases in consumer prices needed to achieve a 15 percent CO2 reduction — slightly less than the Waxman - Markey target — would raise the cost of living of a typical household by $ 1,600 a year .
Some expert studies estimate that the cost to households could be substantially higher .
The future cost to the typical household would rise significantly as the government reduces the total allowable amount of CO2 .
Americans should ask themselves whether this annual tax of $ 1,600 - plus per family is justified by the very small resulting decline in global CO2 .
There ’s lots of other stuff wrong with that column , but focus on this part .
Feldstein knows basic economics , and is well aware that the $ 1600 number from that report was n’t an estimate of the net cost to families — and strictly speaking , he did n’t say that it was .
But he certainly created that impression , obviously deliberately .
I ’d say that Feldstein was channeling Glenn Beck , except that since the Feldstein piece came first , it ’s the other way around .
So as I said , maybe we should n’t be so hard on Mr. Beck .
I mentioned last week how dear my cast iron skillet is to me .
I ’ll let you in on a little secret .
When I ’m not eating the ridiculous baked goods that come out of my oven , I ’m eating eggs .
Eggs inside of fried corn tortillas .
I eat eggs because , as a baker , I always have eggs in the fridge and they ’re super easy to fry up and call dinner .
Eggs , always eggs , with salt , pepper and tortillas .
There , now you know .
I cook my eggs and fry my tortillas in the same cast iron skillet day after day .
This skillet is always riddled with the evidence of some sort of cooked egg .
But with a little hot oil , some salt and a paper towel , it ’s as good as clean .
If you have a cast iron skillet that could use some love , here ’s how to season and care for that bad boy .
Cast iron skillets are too bad ass to waste away in your cupboard .
Get to it !
Cast iron , in all of its natural cast iron goodness is a not a nonstick pan .
It becomes a nonstick delight through a process called seasoning .
Seasoning is basically oiling and baking your cast iron skillet .
I ’ve seen some cast iron pans sold pre-seasoned in stores .
These pans already have their shiny black seasoned finish and you can cook in them immediately .
You still may need to re-season these beauties as they go .
You may also need to re-season your cast iron if you burn something into the pan and have to scrub it out with soap and water .
It ’s certainly not the end of the world .
A bit of oil and a hot oven will bring your cast iron right back to life .
How to Season Cast Iron
1 . Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Position one rack in the top third of the oven .
Position another rack in the bottom third of the oven and place an empty foil lined backing sheet on the bottom rack .
This sheet will catch any dripping from the cast iron .
2 . Open your windows or turn on your stove hood fan .
There may be some smoke , but I ’ve never had this issue .
3 . Over a medium flame , rub a thin layer ( about 1 Tablespoon ) of vegetable shortening , like Crisco , or oil — bacon grease works great , too — all over the inner bottom and sides of the pan with a paper towel and tongs .
4 . Place the oiled pan upside down in the heated oven over the foil lined baking sheet .
5 . Bake the cast iron for 1 hour .
Turn the oven off and allow the cast iron to cool to room temperature in the oven .
Repeat this process 3 or 4 times for best results .
When the pan is perfectly seasoned , the inside with be smooth and shiny .
Sometimes after seasoning my pans come out a bit sticky .
This usually clears up with a bit of cooking .
I usually make sure that the first few things I cook in a newly seasoned cast iron are either fried or sauteed in a bit of oil .
Note : Never cook tomatoes in cast iron .
The acid from the tomatoes will break down the seasoned pan .
Another Note : Hardcore cast iron people have different cast iron for different purposes .
For example , they season their dessert cast iron with vegetable oil , but their savory cast iron with bacon grease .
They have certain cast irons they use for cornbread and other they use for fish dishes .
I stay safe and just season all of my cast iron with a tasteless oil so they can go either way .
How to Clean Cast Iron
1 . When you ’re finished cooking in cast iron , scrape out the pan , while still warm , with a wooden spoon .
Wipe it down with a bit of oil on a paper towel .
I usually use the canola oil I have on hand .
2 . If scraping the pan with a spoon does n’t get off all the grime , melt a tablespoon of vegetable shortening in the pan , turn off the flame and add a tablespoon of salt .
Use a paper towel in tongs to scrub the pan .
Wipe salt out with clean paper towel .
Run under hot water , dry it well , and follow the re-seasoning directions above .
3 . If the wooden spoon and the salt technique were n’t to your liking you can use a mild , diluted soap and a soft sponge to clean the pan .
You just want to avoid strong soaps and super scrub pads .
Dry the pan with a clean dry dish towel and set in a warm oven to dry completely .
Follow the seasoning directions above to re-season cast iron .
Note : Never put your screamin’ hot cast iron skillet into water .
It could crack .
Another Note :
Yes , all this work to season and re-season your cast iron is totally worth it !

Soggy pollen is of little use
The humble raindrop may have played an important role in the evolution of flowers , scientists in China have discovered .
A study of 80 species has revealed that flowers evolve different shapes and structures in part to prevent their pollen getting wet .
Other flowers get round the problem by evolving waterproof pollen .
The finding may help explain why so many species in rainy areas either have droopy flowers or close their petals .
Many researchers , including Charles Darwin , have speculated that flowers may have evolved certain traits or structures to protect themselves against the damaging effects of rain , which can wash away pollen grains and dilute nectar .
But few have experimentally tested the idea .
So Yun - Yun Mao and Shuang - Quan Huang of Wuhan University in China decided to do just that by studying the response to rain and water of 80 species of flower living locally around the University 's campus and in the nearby Wuhan Botanical Garden .
" Animals as well as ourselves like to be sheltered when it rains .
We were wondering how flowers reduce rain effects on pollen grains , given that plants are immobile , " says Huang .
A hole at the flower 's base allows water to drain away Firstly , they recorded how the flowers of each species respond to rainfall , including whether the pollen becomes wetted or washed away and whether the flower moves or closed its petals .
They also measured the effect of rain on pollen performance , by determining how long pollen produced by each species remains viable in water .
What they found confirmed a strong link between rainfall and flower design , the researchers report in the New Phytologist .
For example , of the 80 species studied 20 produce flowers that completely protect their pollen .
As a result , none of these ' waterproof ' flowers produce pollen that is resistant to water .
That supports the idea that the flowers have evolved certain structures that can keep their pollen dry and viable and prevent it being washed away before it can be picked up by pollinators .
" Some plants shelter their pollen grains through a change in floral orientation or closing their corolla on rainy days , " explains Huang .
" For example , tulip flowers close their petals rapidly when rains come . "
Others have flowers that droop downward , while Araceae species have outlets in the base of the flower that let water quickly drain away .
Drooping flowers make good umbrellas
But 44 species expose their pollen completely , giving it no protection .
Of these species , 13 produce pollen that is highly resistant to water , suggesting they have evolved an alternative way to deal with the rain .
" We were surprised that some plants without pollen protection structures develop water resistant pollen , " says Huang .
" The finding of a high proportion of resistant pollen in no-protection species suggests that selection by rain contact favours pollen resistance to water . "
Previous research has also suggested that places which have high levels of rain are home to a higher than normal proportion of flowers that nod downward , droop or are able to close their petals .
Mao and Huang hope to investigate this further , and also whether flowers also protect their nectar from the rain .

House of cards ?
Too easy !
Here 's a hotel made from plastic keys ( 200,000 in fact )
If you ’ve ever wondered what to do with unwanted hotel key cards , then think no more .
Because , providing you 've somehow amassed 200,000 plastic slips , the solution is simple – use them to build your own guest house .
That , at least , is what one hotel chain decided to do .
Plastic palace : Bryan Berg sits in the hotel bedroom he made from key cards
Relaxing
A woman takes a rest on a sofa in the hotel , and is if she plays her cards right she might get room - service
Holiday Inn ’s Key Card Hotel , which opened yesterday in New York , includes a guest bedroom , bathroom and lobby , all fully equipped with life - sized furniture all made out of , yes , well , you get the point .
The 400 sq ft , two - ton construction in Manhattan , which will be in business until September 21 , was built by world record - holding ' card - stacker ' Bryan Berg .
He said : ‘ This is my largest card - stacking challenge to date and the only card creation I have ever made at full human scale . ’
During the five day event , Mr Berg will build a freestanding 9ft replica of New York ’s Empire State Building in the lobby using Holiday Inn playing cards .
' You 'll slot in nicely here ' : Manhattan 's Key Card Hotel reception
' Your card , madam ' :
The hotel is made from 200,000 cards weighing two tons
It marks the relaunch of the chains 1,200 hotels around the world .
Kevin Kowalski , senior vice president of global brand management at Holiday Inn , said :
‘ The Key Card Hotel is a fun and interactive way to showcase the changes happening at our hotels and is the only structure of its kind to ever be created by a hotel brand . ’
Mr Berg first broke the world record for World 's Tallest House of Freestanding Playing Cards in 1992 at the age of 17 , with a tower 14ft 6in .
Since then , he has been commissioned to break his own record ten times .

His most recent tallest record was a 25ft 9in inch tall tower built at the African - American Museum at Dallas , Texas .
For this record , he tried a new technique involving stacking cards vertically instead of horizontally , which reduced the number of cards needed by nearly half .
MELBOURNE'S population will grow to almost 7 million by 2049 , federal Treasury has projected , doubling in the space of 50 years as an unending mining boom brings more and more migrants into Australia .
But revealing the figure yesterday , Treasury secretary Ken Henry voiced fears that Australia might be unable to handle another 13 million people by 2049 without serious environmental losses .
'' With a population of 22 million , we have n't managed to find accommodation with the environment , '' Dr Henry told an audience in Brisbane .
'' Our record has been poor , and in my view , we are not well placed to deal effectively with the environmental challenges posed by a population of 35 million . ''
In a speech of outspoken frankness , optimism and gloom at the same time , Dr Henry argued that Australia was poised to ride a minerals boom that would last for decades , as India and China grew inexorably towards achieving Western standards of living .
But the Treasury chief , who is passionate about Australian wildlife and the bush , warned that the changes ahead '' will test the limits of sustainability : economic , social and environmental ' ' .

" In the spring of 1999 , the Family Learning Channel commissioned animator
Don Hertzfeldt to produce promotional segments for their network .
The cartoons were completed in five weeks .
The Family Learning Channel rejected all of them upon review ,
and they were never aired ... "
Production began on March 3 , 1999 with the final cut completed and sent to the lab in June 2000 .
While not his longest running production , at the time " Rejected " ( 2000 ) was Don 's most behind - schedule and wildly out of control project .
The movie went through drastic changes straight through the end of post - production , growing stranger and more experimental until it finally bore little resemblance to its original outline .
The cartoon 's big finale was n't conceived until midway through production , while individual scenes were redesigned , shuffled around , and significantly reconstructed right up to the last day of sound mixing .
Making things difficult on a technical level , " Rejected " was meanwhile the first film produced at Don 's then - new 35 mm studio .
Most of Don 's animation was completed before the camera gear was purchased and the movie was then photographed before any of the editing equipment was in place .
A projector was purchased in an attempt to be able to view and edit the film in - house , but the idea crashed and burned quite literally in impressive plumes of white smoke - the projector was broken on delivery .
With no way to view any of the finished footage , the entire movie was instead spliced together blind , with proper editing sessions later taking place in the dead of night on the Warner Bros lot when nobody was looking .
The film 's first cut - clocking in at over twelve minutes - was radically retooled and fine - tuned down to one and two frame edits .
A finished scene was cut many weeks after picture was locked , the order of commercial sequences was constantly shuffled around , more was cut out , more was reshot , and every moment of dead time was thrown out the window .
Don believed the first cuts of the film to be an abject failure and approached editing and sound design on a " rescue mission . "
Over eighty hours were spent mixing and recording sound for the 9 1/2 minute cartoon , reworking scenes several times over .
Don had animated the lip synch of the characters before any dialogue was recorded - and in many cases before dialogue was even written - allowing for vocal improvisation for nearly every scene .
The growing experimental nature of the production left the door wide open for an almost infinite number of creative choices , and trial and error required many extra days to rework certain scenes over and over again until they seemed right .
Many sequences were recorded and mixed one way and then torn down and rebuilt from scratch , often with entirely different dialogue - other times a scene played funnier when the dialogue was simply played backwards .
Other scenes contain a mess of experimental layers of music , noise , and effects .
A chunk of the sound mix was also concentrated around the film 's finale , for which " the world 's greatest crash - box " was created - a sound effects box filled with broken bottles , concrete , glass , lightbulbs , and giant rocks that was thrown down stairs , against walls , and from great heights .
There was much drinking involved .
Don created other sound effects for the finale by distorting his guitar amp or sampling and severely manipulating industrial sounds , engines , and motors .
Like all of Don 's films , no computers were used in the picture 's production .
All the finale 's special effects were captured in - camera : Don performed experiments with the animation camera 's motor to create the desired camera and motion blurs , whereas the crumple and paper effects are a simple blend of stop - motion - animated paper and traditional animation , not unlike Genre .
The final result of all this in the film 's conclusion is really something on the big screen .
The film premiered in the Spring of 2000 at the San Diego Comic Convention to an audience of over 1,000 .
Don totalled his car on the freeway on the way home from the premiere but escaped unharmed .
In 2001 , " Rejected " was nominated for an Academy Award .
To date it has received twenty - seven other awards .
During the film 's theatrical release a small but growing confusion surfaced over whether " Rejected " was " real . "
Urban legends circled around the film , particularly fueled whenever a film critic would reprint a synopsis of the film in lieu of actually watching it , going to press with false descriptions of the film as a documentary reel .
The legends later found new life when " Rejected " was due for its American television premiere , uncut and commercial free , on the Cartoon Network in 2001 .
The air date was delayed for a year due to internal trouble with the network 's standards and practices department , who finally gave the film a green light to premiere in November 2002 .
After a week of promoting the film , the network then pulled it 48 hours before its scheduled time , for reasons still unknown .
So " Rejected " became truly rejected and more confusion over its true history grew .
Unfortunately the film has still never aired on American television , despite having played on international networks now for years .
The short currently enjoys a strong cult following and is probably Don 's most recognizable film .

the Screening Room
" ... the real prize in this year 's selection ...
On the surface , Hertzfeldt 's work looks like a crude laugh , and thus the Oscar nomination this piece received is a strange honor for a cruel cartoon .
Still , Hertzfeldt 's film should have won .
The cartoons here purport to be rejected ad spots for the fictional Family Learning Channel on cable , shorts done with such violence and horrible ineptness that only a maniac would have considered them salable .
Hertzfeldt scores the film to some especially turbulent Beethoven , to reflect the crisis of the artist at last bowing down to sell out and finding himself incapable .
Here , the animator is a mirror of Kafka 's hunger artist , who would have eaten like anyone else , if he only could have found something he could have choked down his throat .
What 's at stake in Rejected is nothing less than the spirit of animation , resisting the attempt to keep it in marketplace bondage .
With his evil little drawings , Hertzfeldt tries to flail the cuteness and commercial potential out of animation , for once and for all .

The maths of the credit crunch
More or Less BBC Radio 4 and iPlayer Subscribe to the podcast
As the downturn takes hold , BBC Radio 4's More or Less programme looks at the maths behind the credit crunch .
Since 2007 , presenter and economist Tim Harford has been exploring and explaining the numbers which have contributed to - and have characterised - the global economic downturn .
He met the mathematicians at the heart of the City - and found out why some say they are to blame for the financial crisis .
He uncovered the flaws of the bankers ' bonus system , and discovered a mathematical error which might have led the banks into trouble .
He interviewed quantitative finance expert Paul Wilmott and The Financial Times journalist Gillian Tett .
And he met the guardians of what could be the financial world 's most important number .
You can listen to all of Tim 's reports here .
PAUL WILMOTT , QUANTITATIVE FINANCE EXPERT
Paul Wilmott is a lecturer in financial mathematics and runs the profession 's most popular website .
He is a fan of quantitative finance - but he thinks that its misuse has played a part in creating the current banking crisis .
In November 2007 , More or Less asked whether the financial mathematicians known as " quants " - short for quantitative analysts - were to blame for what was then being termed " the credit squeeze " .
WHO ARE THE QUANTS ?

Paul Wilmott discussed his concerns with Professor William Perraudin of the Tanaka Business School at Imperial College London .
Tim Harford chaired the discussion .
The risks of risk management In December 2008 , Tim invited Paul Wilmott back to talk about the problems in more detail .
Banks and hedge funds rely on highly - paid mathematicians and economists - " quants " - to evaluate risk .
So why did they not they see the credit crunch coming ?
Paul Wilmott says some mathematicians have a tendency to get fixated on the numbers , failing to think about the big picture .
RISKY RISK MANAGEMENT
Please turn on JavaScript .

He posed a scenario .
Imagine you are at a magic show .
The magician takes an ordinary pack of 52 playing cards , and gives it to a man in the audience to shuffle .
He then asks a volunteer to think of a card .
" The ace of spades , " she replies .
The magician turns to the man with the pack of cards and removes a single card from the deck .
What is the probability that the card is the ace of spaces ?
To hear the answer listen to the interview , or read Paul Wilmott 's article on the risks of risk management .
A fundamental mathematical error Paul Wilmott says an additional cause of the credit crunch is that people simply got their sums wrong .
GETTING THE SUMS WRONG Please turn on JavaScript .

He told More or Less these errors might have contributed to the mispricing of financial derivatives , and thus to the travails of the banks , the credit crunch , and the economic downturn .
The maths of the bonus system Many traders were paid bonuses if they made money .
And yet , collectively , their trades bankrupted some banks and nearly bankrupted many more .
THE TRADER'S DILEMMA Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Why did traders , paid for performance , all make the same mistake at the same time ?
Paul Wilmott considered this question .
He set out the trader 's dilemma .
AT HOME WITH THE QUANTS In October 2007 , Tim Harford got a glimpse into the world of the quants .
The most successful of these talented mathematicians will come up with mathematical formulae that make them and their bank or hedge fund employers millions of pounds per year .
They are highly secretive about their work , not wanting others to know the details of their systems .

A trader 's apology William Hooper has since left the world of finance to start his own business .
He has been reflecting on the global economic problems and the question of who is to blame - read A trader 's apology .
GILLIAN TETT , THE FINANCIAL TIMES Gillian
Tett is an assistant editor of the Financial Times and oversees the global coverage of the financial markets .
Five years ago , she was shocked to discover what she says could best be described as an iceberg in the middle of the City .
The role of the media
She was studying media coverage of the City and began to realise journalists were doing lots of stories on stocks and shares , mergers and acquisitions , but nothing on what had become a much bigger part of finance - the credit and derivative markets .
She says business journalists were simply not covering the City in a representative way .
THE FINANCIAL ICEBERG Please turn on JavaScript .

You had a small part of the financial system bobbing above the water but a vast shadowy mass of activity pretty much hidden beneath the waves .
And hidden not just from ordinary people , but hidden from politicians , from many regulators , and unfortunately from much of the media too .
UNDERSTANDING LIBOR
The London Interbank Offered Rate - LIBOR - has been dubbed the financial world 's most important number .
Published each day in the UK , it is the rate at which the banks lend to each other and it influences over $ 150 trillion ( £ 100 trillion ) of funds worldwide .
The Libor number is compiled by putting together the estimates of the cost of borrowing from at least eight banks , and then discarding the highest and lowest of the sample to leave an average rate which then becomes the daily ' Libor Fix ' .
LIBOR Please turn on JavaScript .

But the figure 's validity has been questioned , with critics dubbing it " the rate at which banks wo n't lend " .
Tim Harford went behind the scenes at the operations centre where the daily rate is compiled .
Huge numbers
On January 23 2009 , Paul Wilmott returned to explain how the value of the global derivatives market could possibly be three times that of the world economy - a figure amounting to $ 150 trillion .

BioLogic FreeCharge
Apple devices are getting quite a bit of attention when it comes to renewable energy lately .
Just yesterday we showed you the new solar power skin that is coming out later this month .
But if you ’re needing a charge on a cloudy day , there ’s a solution coming out in a few months – you ’ll be able to hook your phone up to your bike and pedal your way to a full battery .
Bike Hugger ( um..we * really * like that name for a blog ) pointed out this great charger coming out next March .
It ’s the BioLogic FreeCharge from Dahon and it can charge iPhones , GPS units or other gadgets with USB connections .
The device is fairly standard from what we ’ve seen on bike chargers before .

A federal judge approved a civil - court settlement requiring the Social Security Administration to repay $ 500 million to 80,000 recipients whose benefits it suspended after deeming them fugitives .
The supposed fugitives include a disabled widow with a previously suspended driver 's license , a quadriplegic man in a nursing home and a Nevada grandmother mistaken for a rapist .

The volunteers were taught to juggle with three balls Complex tasks such as juggling produce significant changes to the structure of the brain , according to scientists at Oxford University .
In the journal , Nature Neuroscience , the scientists say they saw a 5 % increase in white matter - the cabling network of the brain .
The people who took part in the study were trained for six weeks and had brain scans before and after .
Long term it could aid treatments for diseases like multiple sclerosis .
Diffusion MRI
The team from Oxford 's Department of Clinical Neurology used a diffusion MRI which is able to measure the movement of water molecules in the tissues of the brain .
It 's extremely exciting to see evidence that training changes human white matter connections
Professor Cathy Price , Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging
The signal changes according to how many bundles of nerve fibres there are and how tightly packed they are .
Changes in grey matter , where the processing and computation in the brain happens , have been shown before , but enhancements in the white matter have not previously been demonstrated .
Three ball cascade
The scientists studied a group of 24 healthy young adults , none of whom could juggle .
They divided them into two groups .
One of the groups was given weekly training sessions in juggling for six weeks and was asked to practice 30 minutes every day the other 12 continued as normal .
After training , the 12 jugglers could perform at least two continuous cycles of the classic three ball cascade .
The red area shows the part of the white matter of the brain that is enlarged by learning to juggle
It is in the intraparietal sulcus at the back of the brain Both groups were scanned using diffusion MRI before and after the training .
At the six week point , a 5 % increase in white matter was shown in a rear section of the brain called the intraparietal sulcus for the jugglers .
This area has been shown to contain nerves that react to us reaching and grasping for objects in our peripheral vision .
There was a great variation in the ability of the volunteers to juggle but all of them showed changes in white matter .
The Oxford team said this must be down to the time spent training and practising rather than the level of skill attained .
Dr Heidi Johansen - Berg , who led the team , said : " MRI is an indirect way to measure brain structure and so we cannot be sure exactly what is changing when these people learn .
" Future work should test whether these results reflect changes in the shape or number of nerve fibres , or growth of the insulating myelin sheath surrounding the fibres .
" Of course , this does n't mean that everyone should go out and start juggling to improve their brains .
" We chose juggling purely as a complex new skill for people to learn . "
Clinical Applications
Dr Johansen - Berg said there were clinical applications for this work but there were a long way off .
She said : " Knowing that pathways in the brain can be enhanced may be significant in the long run in coming up with new treatments for neurological diseases , such as multiple sclerosis , where these pathways become degraded . "
Professor Cathy Price , of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging , said : " It 's extremely exciting to see evidence that training changes human white matter connections .
" This complements other work showing grey matter changes with training and motivates further work to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects . "

For the first time since the great depression ( and possibly even then ) , US wage earners suffered through A Decade With No Income Gains .
The typical American household made less money last year than the typical household made a full decade ago .
To me , that ’s the big news from the Census Bureau ’s annual report on income , poverty and health insurance , which was released this morning .
Median household fell to $ 50,303 last year , from $ 52,163 in 2007 .
In 1998 , median income was $ 51,295 .
All these numbers are adjusted for inflation .
In the four decades that the Census Bureau has been tracking household income , there has never before been a full decade in which median income failed to rise .
( The previous record was seven years , ending in 1985 . )
Other Census data [ Historical Income Tables ] suggest that it also never happened between the late 1940s and the late 1960s .
So it does n’t seem to have happened since at least the 1930s .

The streak probably wo n’t end in 2009 , either .
Unemployment has been rising all year , which is a strong sign income will fall .
Early last year , Variety reported Warner Bros. was hard at work trying to adapt the ridiculously popular anime “ Akira ” into two live - action feature films .
Rumors were everywhere that Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon Levitt were going to star in the picture and it seemed like any moment we were going to read about production commencing .
It ’s now September 2009 and …nothing .
The “ Akira ” movie ’s gone quiet and when that happens , it usually means a project is troubled or it ’s in development hell .
But thanks to a trusted source , I ’ve got an update that should make fans anxious to see a big - screen “ Akira ” happy .
You do n’t need to expand you psychic field to find out what I know .
Just hit the jump .
According to my source , screenwriters Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby , guys whose work I like , are about to turn in their version of an “ Akira ” movie and the reason why the project has been so quiet is they ’ve been hard at work trying to get the script right .
For those that are n’t familiar with their work , they wrote the amazing adaptation of “ Children of Men ” and they ’re also credited with “ Iron Man ” ( although a lot of that movie was written on the set ) .
But my point still stands that I like their work and I ’m happy they ’re taking a crack at it .
Also , while I could n’t get a lot of info about what changes are being made from the anime to make the feature film work , I did confirm the story is still set in post - apocalyptic Manhattan in the near future .
I also confirmed the famous motorcycle is definitely a part of the film , but that bit of info should n’t surprise anyone .
From what I could gather , the movie is still a priority for the studio , and if the script meets with approval from key people , the movie could go into production in 2010 with a release date in 2011 .
Also , this is n’t going to be some mid-range budget movie .
If the film goes into production , it ’s going to be one of those BIG event movies .
Of course , everything I just wrote is based on a lot of factors , but that ’s where the project currently stands .
Anyone hoping for an “ Akira ” live - action movie should cross their fingers that Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby ’s screenplay is great and everyone involved gets excited .
I ’ll have more on this story as I hear it .
a dashing pair of spies .
What she uncovers there is that which many historians have missed : a secret beginning with a letter dated 1803 and introducing the Pink Carnation - the most elusive spy of all time who single - handedly saved England from Napoleon 's invasion .

Everyone knows healthcare in America is a bloated , chaotic , diseased nightmare in dire need of massive overhaul and reform .
We have almost 50 million without insurance , and millions of those with insurance are constantly dropped or denied coverage for absurd reasons like “ preexisting conditions ” ( as though life itself was not a preexisting condition worthy enough for proper healthcare ) .
America spends about $ 2.5 trillion on healthcare every year ( two and half times as much per person as most developed nations ) , and ranks near the bottom of all industrialized countries when looking at infant mortality , life expectancy and immunization rates .
The state of healthcare in this country is sickening .
And now President Obama and Congress have their stethoscopes set to find a proper cure for our ailing system .
Unfortunately , this is America , and we do n’t cure anything here ; rather , we prefer to find treatments that make the present conditions tenable – and profitable .
And so it is with healthcare reform .
Obama laid the groundwork for what his administration would like to see in a healthcare bill and then Congress quickly got to work botching the job as usual .
My tentative prediction is that , after the congressional recess , some kind of healthcare reform bill will eventually pass – that is , if the bills in the House and Senate ever make it out of the committees holding them up .
And I think if it does pass , some good things will no doubt be accomplished : ten of millions currently without coverage will get access to basic health insurance , and insurance companies will see some regulation making it more difficult for them to deny or drop coverage for those who need it .
Yet these reforms do far too little to overhaul this failing system , like trying to save the Titanic with a roll of duct - tape .
There has been much talk of a so - called “ public option , ” a government - run insurance plan , like Medicare , that millions of Americans could access which would also compete with the private insurance companies and negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies to bring overall prices down .
But mark my words : there will be no public option such as this if this bill ever passes .
It ’s a pipedream ; it ’s not going to happen .
Why wo n’t it happen ?
It ’s for the same reason this healthcare bill stinks : America is the only country in the world that treats people ’s lives as a market commodity .
No other nation lets the marketplace dictate their healthcare system , but that is exactly what we do in America .
We treat healthcare not as a social service , but as a money - making endeavor .
We distribute care not according to those who need it most ( those coughing up a lung ) , but to those with the most ability to pay ( those coughing up the money ) .
The healthcare industry is a business , and their main goal , like every other business , is profit maximization .
And that ’s exactly why many in the healthcare industry are actually supporting this potential bill by Congress , because contained in this reform are government mandates that will require people to purchase health insurance or face being fined .
That means people will be legally obligated to obtain health insurance , which , in turn , means millions of new customers for the private health insurance companies .
And that would be acceptable – if there was also a public option .
The healthcare industry has more lobbyists by far in Washington than any other group , and the industry is bitterly opposed to a public option .
They do not want to compete with a cheaper , more efficient , government - run health insurance program because that would force them to have to lower their premiums and reduce their overhead costs .
And guess which congressmen are the ones most opposed to a public option ?
If you guessed the ones who have received the most money from the healthcare industry then you get a lollipop .
The only real solution to the healthcare problem in this country is to start slowly dismantling the current system from the outside in .
I ’m not suggesting we outlaw private insurance companies altogether and nationalize the entire industry , but I am suggesting we begin to make the ubiquitous presence of private health insurance unnecessary .
And the only way to do that would be a public option – a massive non-profit Medicare - like government - run health insurance program that would not just compete with the private insurance companies , but would dramatically undercut the competition .
If we can trust the government to run the post office and the military , then we can trust them to run part of the health insurance industry .
They already do a completely acceptable job with Medicare .
If you do n’t believe me , ask someone on Medicare if they would like to have their service replaced with a private insurance plan ( by the way , the overhead costs for Medicare are around 3 percent while the average overhead costs for private insurance companies is about 30 percent ) .
And I would like to remind everyone that it is being called a public “ option ” for a reason , because it would be just that – an option .
While there will be mandates for people to have health insurance , you would have the option of choosing the government plan or a private plan .
This idea that the government will take over the healthcare industry altogether and begin making important medical decisions for American families is an absolute paranoid absurdity .
Even if a massive public plan goes into place , you will always have the option in this country to choose private doctors and private insurance .
So , I hope I ’m wrong and that Congress will actually include some sort of reasonable public option in this healthcare reform package , but I have my serious doubts .
It looks like all we ’re willing to do with our appalling healthcare system is trim off a little of the fat , while also pumping more money and more people into the status quo .
And until we stop viewing people ’s lives as just another product in the market place , we will be fated with a diseased healthcare system befitting of such a sickening concept .
Last week Rep. Pete Stark of California introduced the Every Child Deserves a Family
Act which denies federal funding to states with adoption programs that discriminate on the basis of marital status , sexual orientation or gender identity .
From the Washington Blade :
Stark said in an interview that he introduced the legislation , H.R. 3827 , in part because thousands of children each year “ age out ” of the child welfare system without finding homes .
“ We got 25,000 kids a year maturing out of the welfare system without permanent foster care or adoptive care , and the prospects of those children having a successful adult life are diminished greatly , ” he said .
“ These are kids who end up in the criminal justice system , or end up homeless . ”
States with explicit restrictions on adoption that the pending legislation would affect are Utah , Florida , Arkansas , Nebraska and Mississippi .
Florida , for example , has a statute specifically prohibiting gays from adopting , and in Arkansas , voters last year approved Act 1 , which prevents unmarried co-habitating couples , including same - sex partners , from adopting children .
The legislation , Stark said , also would restrict funds for states where restrictions are put in place by agencies , individual social workers or judges , or where restrictions are part of the common law of the state .
For states that do n’t comply with the law , federal officials could withhold from the states funds provided to them for child welfare services .
The bill also calls .
There were over 900,000 foreclosures in the third quarter as Foreclosures rise 5 percent from summer to fall .
The number of households caught up in the foreclosure crisis rose more than 5 percent from summer to fall as a federal effort to assist struggling borrowers was overwhelmed by a flood of defaults among people who lost their jobs .
The foreclosure crisis affected nearly 938,000 properties in the July - September quarter , compared with about 890,000 in the prior three months , according to a report released Thursday by RealtyTrac Inc .
That puts foreclosure - related filings on a pace to hit about 3.5 million this year , up from more than 2.3 million last year .
" The sheer scale of the problem is preventing the loan modification programs from having the kind of impact we 'd all like " said Rick Sharga , Realty Trac 's senior vice president for marketing .
Some homeowners are in such a massive financial hole that it's hard to design a modification that will actually provide lower payments .
And some have avoided paying their monthly bills for a long time .
According to the RealtyTrac report , there were nearly 344,000 foreclosure - related filings last month , down 4 percent from a month earlier but still the third - highest month since the report started in early 2005 .
It was the seventh - straight month in which more than 300,000 households receiving a foreclosure filing , which includes default notices and several other legal notices that homeowners receive before they finally lose their homes .
Banks repossessed nearly 88,000 homes in September , up from about 76,000 a month earlier .
On a state - by - state basis , Nevada had the nation 's highest foreclosure rate in the July - September quarter .
Arizona was No. 2 , followed by California , Florida and Idaho .
Rounding out the top 10 were Utah , Georgia , Michigan , Colorado and Illinois .

So imagine my surprise when I read this :
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...
HAMMOND , La. —
A Louisiana justice of the peace said he refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple out of concern for any children the couple might have .
Keith Bardwell , justice of the peace in Tangipahoa Parish , says it is his experience that most interracial marriages do not last long .
As compared to , say , Britney Spears ?
Guess my 18 year marriage does n't qualify , nor does the Loving 's marriage ( the SCOTUS decision about which I imagine , is about to rain a boat load of trouble on Judge Bardwell ) which lasted from 1958 until Richard Loving 's accidental death in 1975 .
Who knows how much longer it might have lasted had he not died in a car accident ?
Now of course Judge Bardwell is going to be the first to say he 's not a racist .
Who did n't see that coming ?
" I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house , " Bardwell said .
" My main concern is for the children . "
Bardwell said he has discussed the topic with blacks and whites , along with witnessing some interracial marriages .
He came to the conclusion that most of black society does not readily accept offspring of such relationships , and neither does white society , he said .
" I do n't do interracial marriages because I do n't want to put children in a situation they did n't bring on themselves , " Bardwell said .
" In my heart , I feel the children will later suffer . "
If he does an interracial marriage for one couple , he must do the same for all , he said .
" I try to treat everyone equally , " he said .
I just love that this man appoints himself arbiter of what most of black society thinks about anything .
Of course it's for the children .
They do n't turn out right .
I mean next thing you know one of those bi-racial children might grow up to be President of the United States .
Or and of the people featured in stories likethis one or accomplished athletes like Derek Jeter , or that guy ... what 's his name ?
He plays golf .
Or the kid across the street , or my son .
Nope they all turn out bad so it 's good we have Judge Bardwell looking out for things .
The ACLU is working on how to remove Judge Bardwell from office .
He 'll then have time to go on Rush Limbaugh 's show to talk about how both of those well known non-racists are being mistreated .
Just checked my calendar again .
It 's still 2009 and Loving v VA was still decided in 1967 .
Oh yeah , and Judge Birdwell is still an idiot .
UPDATE : Rec List ?
WOW .
Thanks .
UPDATE 2 playtonjr has provided the contact information for the " good " Judge in the linked comment
UPDATE 3 Since there 's a question as to whether a Justice of the Peace is a Judge , I 've amended the title .
He is referred to as both in various articles , and the state website makes it sound like " Justice of the Peace " courts are a type of court in the judicial hierarchy .
A CYCLIST who was left blind and brain - damaged after allegedly being knocked off his bike by a hit - and - run driver on Southern Cross Drive is seeking millions of dollars in damages from the Roads and Traffic Authority .
The legal team representing Peter Beileiter , of Lane Cove West , has told the Supreme Court that the section of the road south of Wentworth Avenue , where the accident occurred in February 2001 , was unsuitable for bicycle traffic .
There was no designated cycle lane south of the junction , and the volume and speed of the traffic made it unsafe for cyclists to use the vehicle lanes .
Mr Beileiter 's lawyers argued the RTA was negligent in failing to warn cyclists that the cycle lane in place north of Wentworth Avenue did not continue on the southern side of the off - ramp .
It is also alleged the RTA failed to prohibit cyclists from travelling further south on Southern Cross Drive .
The latest viral wingnut e-mail , sent early on Tuesday , reveals that teabaggers ( with the help of the G0P ) are organizing a nationwide " Keep Your Kid Home From School Day " to protest President Obama 's upcoming address to schoolchildren on the importance of studying hard and getting a good education .
Read it for yourself and have a good laugh :
Word is traveling fast on the internet , between bloggers and twitter , the choice is clear :
No school for kids on September 8th due to the beginning of Socialist Indoctrination of Americas children .
Keep your kids home September 8th

Take a day of vacation .
Go to the zoo .
Anything that would save your offspring from what I will bluntly say is just the quasi- fellating the executive branch .

Picture 4
President Obama ’s Address to Students Across America September 8 , 2009
I would n’t have such a problem with the Department of Education were this presented in a non-Orwellian fashion .
Oh yes , it is , as the lesson plan directs , to listen to what t he president , the mayor , et al. says , to respect their " authoritah " </ Cartman > , but there is no emphasis in here on why the president and other elected officials should listen to US .
The focus is solely on authority .
There is no consideration given to the authority of the American people .
That ’s what concerns me .
There is this mindset that those in Washington are the " elite , " that we should mind our Ps and Qs and blindly follow their directives .
That ’s not the manner of governance upon which this country was founded – it is quite the opposite ; even the hobbyist Constitutional aficionado appreciates this .
So yes , keep your kids home on September 8th and teach them that the power of America rests in the hands of its people , no one else .
NOTE TO OBAMA : LEAVE OUR KIDS ALONE !!!!
Funny thing is , you did n't hear a peep from these nutjobs when the first President Bush delivered a 15 minute speech to the nation 's classrooms on the importance of avoiding drugs .
You did n't see any of them blowing a gasket when teachers were supplied with guides to help student 's interpret President Reagan 's Challenger Speech .
And you certainly did n't see Democrats pulling their kids out of school over either of those events .
Unless these people do n't want their kids to be encouraged on studying hard , there 's only one reason for them to have their children play hooky : an irrational fear of President Obama .
Their outrage over this speech is being fueled by the likes of Matt Drudge and Michelle Malkin and even the Republican Party itself , each of whom represent the crazy behind the crazies .
They 've completely lost their minds .
Insane to the core .
Maybe if they spent more time in school instead of skipping it , they 'd learn how to spell words like " oligarchy . "
CATO Institute Finds $ 180 Billion Benefit to Legalizing Illegal Immigrants
Created : August 14 , 2009 15:31 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
A new study from the libertarian CATO Institute concludes that legalizing the more than eight million undocumented workers in the United States would have significant economic benefits for the country , while simply enhancing border enforcement and applying restrictive immigration laws would actually hurt the U.S. economically .
The new report , written by Professor Peter B. Dixon and Research Fellow Maureen T. Rimmer at the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University in Australia , relies on an economic model used by the U.S. Departments of Commerce , Agriculture , and Homeland Security , as well as International Trade Commission .
Weighing public spending and revenues , U.S. employment rates in various occupations , and price levels for imports and exports , among other things , the authors conclude that “ increased enforcement and reduced low - skilled immigration have a significant negative impact on the income of U.S. households . ”
The minimal savings in public spending on immigrants now “ would be more than offset by losses in economic output and job opportunities for more skilled American workers . ”
A policy that reduces low - skilled immigration to about a third less than projected levels , then , over ten years , “ would reduce U.S. household welfare by about 0.5 percent , or $ 80 billion . ”
In contrast , “ legalization of low - skilled immigrant workers would yield significant income gains for American workers and households , ” the study found .
Legalization would eliminate the costs of smuggling illegal immigrants , would allow immigrants to be more productive and openly participate in the economy , and it would “ create more openings for Americans in higher skilled occupations . ”
The overall positive impact for U.S. households of legalizing these workers over ten years would be “ 1.27 percent of GDP or $ 180 billion . ”
The findings are consistent with previous studies that show economic benefits from the legalization of illegal workers .

A DISGRUNTLED state Labor MP has attacked his own Premier , saying Twitter makes him behave like a ' ' 12 - year - old with Tourettes ' ' .
Paul McLeay 's extraordinary comments extended to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , whom he accused of '' perpetually spamming everyone on Facebook ' ' .
His cyber spray has not only astonished party insiders but angered Tourette Syndrome Association president Robyn Latimer , who said such comments stigmatised sufferers .
A senior State Government source said the ' ' stupid ' ' comment illustrated why Mr McLeay had never made the frontbench .
A spokeswoman for Premier Nathan Rees said Mr McLeay owed an apology to anyone he had offended .
'' Other than that , this is so far down the list of the Premier 's priorities that it does n't warrant any response , '' she said .
Zombies : A Record of the Year of Infection offers a detailed account of the zombie outbreak , recording the behavior and anatomy of the undead .
It 's a survival story , but one in which the dead are more interesting than the living .
Advertisement
Zombies : A Record of the Year of Infection , actually written by Don Roff and illustrated by Chris Lane , purports to be the account of Dr. Robert Twombly , a physician who was working in a hospital during the first wave of the zombie outbreak .
In addition to chronicling his weeks of improbably survival , Twombly also tries to understand the zombies , keeping careful records of their decay , behavior , and abilities , while trying to figure out what caused the outbreak in the first place .
The back of the book bills Twombly 's diary as " a unique record of the time of infection in that its author sought to understand the undead by living among them . "
It 's not entirely true , and it probably would have made for a better book .
Twombly could have easily been an obsessive enough researcher that he would be willing to sacrifice his life in the hopes of leaving behind a helpful account of the outbreak .
Advertisement
For the zombie aficionado , the most fascinating parts of Twombly 's diary are the most clinical .
Twombly describes the symptoms infected people experience before turning , describes the gradual decay of zombies he observes over a period of several days , compares the behavior of zombies he once knew to that of their living selves , and observes anomalies in their behavior such as self - cannibalization .
They 're fantastic little moments of world - building , and Roff successfully tweaks traditional zombie characteristics enough to make the usually one - note undead mysterious and intriguing .
Why do the zombies occasionally eat their own body parts ?
Why do some zombies group with the same people they knew in life while others follow their own path ?
And Lane 's pencil and watercolor illustrations — which are lovely even when they depict decaying and mutilated bodies — become , in those clinical instances , more than mere corpse porn , and are almost more horrifying than his depictions of zombie attacks .

Unfortunately , much of A Record of the Year of Infection is a survival story , and one that we 've seen before .
Once Twombly escapes the hospital where he had been making so many wonderful and insightful observations on undead anatomy , he attempts to find safe haven from the brain chewers .
We encounter plenty of the stock characters these sorts of apocalypses bring on : the average Joe who thinks his gun will save him , the outdoorsy girl and her dog , the sadistic zombie hunters , the survivalist you prefers the quiet of the undead world to the chattering of people .
We never meet any of these folks long enough to get much of a sense of them .
They simply slip into Twombly 's life until they part ways or end up zombie chow .
Despite their abilities to walk , talk , and wield a machete , the living are simply never as interesting as Roff 's undead .
It 's only at the end that we get the hint of something truly intriguing and sinister , and characters with shades of dimension , that we are abruptly cut off , as if at an especially riveting part of a ghost story that hinges on suspense .

Hardcore zombie fans will probably appreciate the occasional in - depth looks into zombie life , as well as Roff 's eerily plausible explanation for what caused the zombie plague ( it 's not your typical rage virus or biological weapon , though corporate greed is certainly involved ) .
But those looking for a novel take on zombie survivalism will find that this ultimately feels more like a supplement to a larger story than a stand - alone work .

Chemical analysis of the warrior 's bones show he was mostly vegetarian
A late Roman period body unearthed in Gloucester has stunned experts after tests suggested it was a Goth warrior from eastern Europe .
The man , aged 25 to 30 , who was dug up north of Kingsholm Square in 1972 , had always baffled archaeologists .
His elaborate silver belt fittings , shoe buckles and inlaid knife were believed to be from an area between the Balkans and Southern Russia .
Chemical tests now prove he was from east of the River Danube .
This has led historians to suggest he was a Goth mercenary in the Roman Army .
Pirate warden ?
The large bones date to about 400AD , just 10 years before Rome itself fell to Visigoth invaders , and tests showed he was mostly vegetarian .
They were discovered in a mausoleum , suggesting he was a man of high social status .
David Rice , archaeology curator at Gloucester City Museum , said : " Archaeologists have always wondered who he was and what he was doing in Gloucester .
" We 've discovered he came from way outside of the Roman Empire , from the other side of the Danube . "
It was possible to detect he lived in very cold regions as a child , before moving west , he said .
Mr Rice added : " To have such an unusual person in this city means that Gloucester was a more important place in Roman times than we 've previously thought .
" Perhaps there were pirates coming up the River Severn ? "
Yep , the Baucus bill amendments are in .
If you want to take a look , here they are :
The Friday 5 p.m. deadline has passed for filing amendments to the health care legislation in the Senate Finance Committee , and aides to Senator Max Baucus have finished tallying them : 543 in all , from both Democrats and Republicans .
Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia will propose the creation of a government - run insurance plan .
So will Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , but with careful rules to make sure that the public plan competes with private insurers on a level playing field .
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon will propose a requirement that employers offer at least two different choices of health insurance , or provide vouchers that would let their workers shop for alternatives in a new , government - regulated insurance marketplace .
Mr. Wyden has another amendment that would expand eligibility for subsidies to help people buy insurance , by raising the income cutoff to 400 percent of poverty from 300 percent of poverty , which for a family of four would be $ 88,200 , instead of $ 66,150 .
Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington will propose increasing the income cutoff for Medicaid to 200 percent of poverty , or $ 44,100 for a family of four .
And Ms. Cantwell also has an amendment that would revamp Medicare payments to doctors , hospitals and other providers to reward high - quality , lower - cost care .
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey will push to lower a cap on the amount moderate - income families will have to pay in health insurance premiums to 10 percent of income , down from 13 percent .
Senator Debbie Stabenow wants to push the cap even lower , to 6.5 percent of income .
Aides in the office of Senator Max Baucus , Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee , are still trying to tally up all the amendments ahead of next week ’s committee mark - up .
Google says the deal would give new access to out - of - print books
The US Justice Department has urged a New York court to reject a deal that would allow internet company Google to publish millions of books online .
The deal raised copyright and anti-trust issues , the department said , and should be rejected in its current form .
The court is due to rule on the issue early next month .
Under the deal - the product of a legal suit - Google would establish a $ 125 m ( £ 77 m ) fund to compensate those whose works it published online .
It would establish a Book Rights Registry so that authors whose work it digitised were paid when their material was viewed online .
The deal was agreed in October 2008 with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers ( AAP ) after they sued Google for copyright infringement .
Companies including Microsoft , Amazon and Yahoo have all objected to the deal .
' More talks needed '
The US justice department said that the breadth of the settlement raised " significant legal concerns " .
HAVE YOUR SAY Speaking as a researcher , I find Google Books a practical way to obtain information from rare books .
But I do not want to read a novel online Shelia , USA
In its present form it would , it said , give Google sole authority for books whose copyright holder could not be found and provide inadequate protection to foreign rights holders .
It also seemed to give publishers the power to restrict price competition and drive other digital distributors from the market , it said .
The court " should reject the proposed settlement in its current form and encourage the parties to continue negotiations to modify it " , the department said in its submission .
In a statement , Google , the Authors Guild and the AAP said that they were " considering the points raised by the department and look forward to addressing them as the court proceedings continue " .
Google says the deal would give readers unprecedented access to books that have been out of print for years .

Will there by a Blu - Ray version ?
There are currently no plans to author a Blu - Ray version due to the overall quality of the source footage .
While most of the footage is HD , a lot of it is also in Standard Definition , thus making an HD version would diminish the quality .
However , like previous ThisOneIsOnUs releases , the feature was edited in Full HD , making it possible for us to author a Blu - Ray , should someone manifest interest to do the job .
Why is this thing out so soon , whilst " Another Version Of The Truth " , almost a year later , still has n't been released ?
There are two major reasons .
The first one , is obviously because TDS : Live is a MUCH shorter feature ...
The full 3 discs version of AVOTT will run for overs six hours ...
This one clocks in just past 60 minutes .
Also , we had much fewer angles to work with this time around ...
We received about 11 sources for this project whilst on The Gift , we had 17 angles , and on Vegas , around 40 sources were received .
Secondly , AVOTT has a HUGE post - production team .
Around 30 people , each working on a seperate task .
Making it all happen and having to deal with everybody 's lifes , computer crashes , jobs , ( and yes ) laziness is basically the main reason why it has been pushed back for so long .
On this release though , only three people were involved in the actual post - production process .
Aaron
Short mixed / mastered the audio , Joël Lehmann color corrected it the video .
I edited the video , authored the DVD , prepared distribution .
Much easier to deal with , even though the job is much more demanding .
The images are blurry / shaky / shitty ...
There 's a guy screaming in my left ear ...
You are right .
Remember this is a fan - shot project .
What surprises me is how well it still all holds together ...
Keep in mind that everybody filming the project were n't necessarily filming specifically for the purpose of an edited DVD .
The tapers are all unexperienced cameramen AND over - excited fans witnessing their favourite band playing its most critically acclaimed / commercially successful album from beginning to end , for the first time ever .
The fact that we still managed to get this much footage for the whole show is surprising and says a lot about NIN fans commitment ... As for the audio ...
It was matrixed by Aaron Short using two sources ( ScreamingSlave and NINSlave 's recordings ) .
He did the best mix possible with what we had .
Should a better source ever pop up ( say , like a soundboard feed ) we 'll most likely release a second version .
However , do n't hold your breath : it 's not happening anytime soon .
Can I get a physical copy ?
No plans either for us to create and distribute physical copies , However , you 're welcome to print your own using one of the included cover arts ... or any other .
If anyone wants to organize a physical distribution , be sure to post about it on the ETS discussion thread .
If anyone ever spots some asshole selling it for profit though , be sure to contact us so we can put a price on his head .
Who can I contact about the project ?
Press inquiries can be directed to Pier - Philippe de Chevigny Le Blanc via email or at twitter.com/ash512 .

by an anonymous NICU nurse
There is a medical controversy brewing over in England that is threatening to invade the United States .
Ms. Capewell , a 23 - year old British mother , is claiming English doctors let her 21 5 / 7 week infant die , only because they were following national perinatal guidelines .
If only he was born at 22 weeks , she insists , they would have tried everything to save him and admitted him to the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) .
According to British perinatal guidelines , the age of viability of infants is set at 23 weeks gestation .
Ms. Capewell states the guidelines had robbed her son of a chance of life .
Following her experience , she has set up a web page called Justice for Jayden , urging a change in the British legislation .
She is petitioning that all infants born before 22 weeks gestation be afforded the opportunity of full resuscitation measures .
My heart goes out to this mom who lost her infant and suffered multiple miscarriages .
I ca n’t imagine the pain she must have felt when she lost her child .
As a NICU nurse , however , I must disagree with her on her assumptions of care for an infant born with such extreme prematurity .
The doctors were just in their actions .
It would have been an extreme injustice to Jayden to attempt to resuscitate one so premature .
Infants born at 22 to 23 weeks gestation have a 1 to 10 percent chance of survival , with the high end requiring the most advanced NICU care possible .
Of those survivors , greater than 95 percent will suffer profound neurodevelopmental impairment .
By this , I do not mean the child will have a learning disability , or need to walk with canes , or have mild cerebral palsy .
I mean the child may suffer from intractable seizures , need a feeding tube because of an inability to swallow , have varying degrees of blindness and deafness , have spastic quadraplegia and be wheelchair bound , never speak , never crawl , never walk , or never run .
I have cared for many infants at the edge of viability .
It is always emotionally draining .
There is no justice to it .
The intensive measures involved to keep a 22 to 23 week - old infant alive is staggering , and it is ugly .
I once cared for an extremely premature infant who had an IV placed on the side of her knee due to such poor IV access .
When that IV infiltrated , I gently pulled the catheter out , and her entire skin and musculature surrounding the knee came with it , leaving the patella bone exposed .
I have seen micro-preemies lose their entire ear due to scalp vein IV’s .
I have watched 500 gram infants suffer from pulmonary hemorrhages , literally drowning in their own blood .
I have seen their tiny bellies become severely distended and turn black before my very eyes , as their intestines necrose and die off .
I have seen their fontanelles bulge and their vital signs plummet as the ventricles surrounding their brains fill with blood .
I have seen external ventricle drains placed in their brains , and watched as the collection containers filled with blood that looked like crude oil .
I have seen these tiny infants become overwhelmingly septic as we pump them full of high powered antibiotics that threatened to shut down their kidneys , while fighting the infection .
I have seen many more extremely premature infants die painful deaths in the NICU , then live .
Trying to save babies as young as Ms. Capewell ’s is an experiment in futility .
An experiment on an actual human life .
Many , including pundits in the United States , are trying to twist this story as a fight against health care reform and that not attempting to save a 21 - weeker is rationing care .
Comparing not saving a 21 week fetus to rationing health care is a ludicrous argument .
It has nothing to do with trying to save money .
It has everything to do with humanity , and morality , and justice .
Letting Jayden die was a Justice for Jayden .

The Grumpy Editor 's hugin experience

The free software community has produced a wealth of tools for the manipulation of image data .
For simple changes , such as cropping , resizing , or basic contrast tweaking , any of a number of programs can be used .
More complex changes will require falling back to tools like the GIMP , krita , or cinepaint .
Anybody who has tried to join together two or more independent images in those tools will have discovered , however , that certain manipulations fall into a class of their own .
For that kind of work , hugin would appear to be the only choice .
Your editor has long intended to play with hugin ; the threat of having somework to do finally provided the necessary motivation .
The problem with just gluing two images together is simple to understand : lenses distort .
Even the best lens will transform light differently toward the edges of the image than it does in the middle .
Multiple images also suffer from parallax problems , even if the camera is mounted on a tripod .
The result is that two overlapping images will not normally join together in a straightforward way - the pieces simply do not fit .
Resolving this problem requires distorting the images in fairly tricky ways .
The key to the value of a tool like hugin is not in putting images together ; it is , instead , in the process of stretching and remapping those images ( along with some other details like exposure matching ) so that they can be put together .
As an added bonus , the ability to correct lens distortion makes some other interesting applications possible .
The classic use of a tool like hugin , though , is the creation of panoramic images which cover a field larger than the camera can capture .
A photographer wanting to create the best panorama should do a number of things to ensure that a set of images can be combined easily : the camera should be mounted on a tripod , and all settings should be manually selected and should be the same for every component image .
A camera set for automatic exposure , for example , will vary that exposure as the camera is rotated to take the pictures ; that will create differences from one image to the next .
Changes in focus or depth of field will also complicate the task of properly stitching the images together .
That said , hugin does an impressive job of joining images which were not taken in optimal conditions .
Feed it a set of handheld cellphone photos and you 'll get something reasonable out .
To test hugin , your editor took a series of pictures of the continental divide from the eastern Colorado plains .
They are not great pictures - it was not a particularly clear day - but they are sufficient to show what hugin can do .
The individual images are :
These images present some challenges ; among other things , the tripod was not entirely level , so the horizon appears to tilt from one to the next .
Putting them together is clearly going to require some complex manipulations .
The nice thing is that hugin manages to hide that complexity from the user - most of the time .
For beginning users , there is an " assistant " mode which will step through the process relatively easily .
There 's also a nice set of tutorials which should really be required reading for any new user .
The first step is to bring the images into hugin ; that is done with the usual GTK file - chooser dialog .
Depending on the distribution being used , there may be an unpleasant surprise once the files have been selected .
Your editor , testing the Fedora hugin package , got a dialog containing the following :
If you see this message then your version of hugin has been configured without support for automatic generation of control points .
Probably your system administrator or Linux distribution did this because the SIFT algorithm used by autopano - sift and autopano - sift - C is encumbered by software patents in the United States of America .
Did your editor ever mention that software patents are a pain ?
The message goes on to say that hugin remains a useful tool , even without the forbidden algorithm .
And , indeed , it does , though the amount of work required is higher .
The next step in the process is the assignment of " control points " which tie the images together .
The tool presents a pair of images , and the user has the task of identifying points in each which correspond to the same location .
The process can be a little painful , depending on the images involved , but it 's not that bad , especially if there are a lot of easily - identified , small features to line up .
It 's just a matter of clicking on one image , adjusting the point , then doing the same thing on the other image .
Hugin creates a small , high - resolution window surrounding the selected points which makes it easy to align control points with single - pixel accuracy .
Once a couple of points have been fixed , hugin will do its best to automatically find the corresponding point for a location picked in one image .
Often the process works quite well ; other times , not quite so well .
Sometimes hugin's guess is simply wrong ; other times it will conclude that it cannot find a matching point and put up an obnoxious dialog which must be dismissed .
In the latter case , it would be better to just pick a nearby point ( as it does anyway ) and be done with it .
Beyond that , though , the process is pretty smooth .
Then , one must go into the " optimize " area .
This is where the friendliness of hugin comes closest to falling apart .
" Optimizing " is the calculation of a set of parameters describing how the component images are related to each other and how they have been distorted by the camera ; it is , essentially , a set of magic algorithms generating magic numbers .
A user who does n't really understand the math behind what hugin is doing ( and , remember , we 're dealing with photographers here ) will have no clue what 's happening or how to judge whether the process has worked properly or not .
And it does n't always work properly .
The help from the tutorials can make things worse :
If you are lucky you will be able to select Optimize Positions , View and Barrel ( y , p , r , v , b ) , hit Optimize Now ! and finish the optimisation process in one go .
Otherwise , if the optimiser reduces the field of view to zero , you will find that you have to just Optimize Positions first , before you can optimise the other parameters .
How does one know if the optimizer has reduced the field of view in this way ?
The screen will not actually say that .
So the optimizer is the place where a somewhat naive user ( your editor , say ) is likely to grope around blindly in the hopes of getting something done .
After that , one can pull up the preview window to see what hugin plans to do with the images .
The preview , too , can be confusing ; mouse clicks on the image shift it around in ways which are entirely predictable ( and even useful ) , but disorienting to a new user .
Sometimes the program comes up with bizarre values for the actual area of the image , leading to a mostly black preview with the useful image data crammed into a corner somewhere .
Solutions can include redoing the optimization process or going to the " stitcher " window and asking it to recalculate the image size parameters - including a couple of " field of view " numbers which do n't have any clear meaning to the uninitiated .
Things usually work , but it can be discouraging when they do n't .
Once the preview looks good , the stitcher is invoked to create the final image .
That process can take a while , but the end results tend to be good .
Usually all that 's required afterward is a quick cropping pass in a more traditional image editor to come up with something presentable .
Here is your editor 's final panorama ( please note that the larger version is a 9MB image - and that 's after reducing it considerably ) :
Your editor , being a daring sort of person , decided that he wanted to find out just what sort of functionality is being denied to hugin users by the oppressive US software patent regime .
As it happens , Fedora users can get around patent - based repression by installing the autopano - sift - C package from the rpmfusion repository and tweaking the program preferences to use the real autopano tool .
The difference is striking : with autopano - sift - C installed , the program proceeds immediately from image selection to a preview window ; the whole " control points " and " optimization " process just sort of goes away .
This package does a great job of finding control points , at least on your editor 's sample image set .
Software patents have cost Linux users a highly useful tool here ; fortunately , users who are not affected by the American software patent regime can still obtain the autopano - sift - C package .
Your editor would highly recommend doing so .
Beyond panoramas
Hugin 's uses are not limited to the creation of panoramic images .
The image distortion logic built into the program can be put to other uses as well .
Consider this image from the 2008 Kernel Summit :
Your editor was constrained to take the picture from an off - center point of view - the professional photographer who was hired to do a proper picture had , naturally , taken the best spot .
One might be tempted to point out that your editor 's picture got out into the world , while the professional 's has never really been seen , but your editor would never think of being so petty .
What is worth pointing out here is that the off - center perspective , combined with lens distortion , results in a bit of a strange view ; look at the visible bend in the beam at the top of the stage opening over the group of assembled kernel hackers .
The sides of the opening also appear to not be parallel .
It 's a fairly classic case of distortion caused by the combination of an off - center perspective and a zoom lens being pushed to its wide - angle extreme .
It turns out that hugin can fix problems like this .
To use hugin in this mode , the user feeds a single image to the application .
The process of creating control points is now done a little differently ; the task is to identify points in the same image which make up a horizontal or vertical line .
Your editor indicated that the border around the stage really should be level and plumb , and picked a couple of other lines as well .
Hugin then does its magic and comes up with a new image :
The lines have been straightened and the photograph looks more rectilinear in general .
It 's still not perfect , of course , and not even hugin can make Al Viro smile , but it 's a step in the right direction .
This technique can be used for fixing up the perspective on any of a number of pictures which are taken from a less - than - optimal location .
In summary : hugin would appear to be unique in the free software community .
Despite the occasional glitch , hugin makes the execution of non-trivial image manipulations easy to the point that even your editor can do it ; your average professional photographer should have even less trouble .
It is an impressive piece of work , even though it has not yet reached its 1.0 release ( version 0.8 came out in July ) .
It definitely belongs on any Linux - using photographer 's system .
( CNN ) -- Soccer mom Meleanie Hain , who made national headlines last year by having a loaded , holstered handgun at her 5 - year - old daughter 's soccer game , has been found shot dead in her home along with her husband , police said Thursday .
Meleanie Hain was found shot dead in her home along with her husband Thursday .
Information from 911 calls shows that it took a SWAT team nearly an hour and a half to gain entry to the Lebanon , Pennsylvania , home Wednesday evening .
Inside , they found the bodies of Hain , 31 , and her husband , Scott , 33 , police Capt .
Daniel Wright said .
Police have avoided labeling the incident a murder - suicide .
However , they do not believe that another person was involved , Wright said .
A full investigation is under way , he added .
" Who [ Meleanie Hain ] is does not change the course of this investigation , " he said .
The autopsies are scheduled for Friday .
Watch why Hain caused controversy »
Meleanie Hain 's attorney , Matthew B. Weisberg , said she told him a few months ago that she and her husband were separating .
It was not immediately clear whether they were still living together .
The couple 's three children were unharmed and took refuge at a neighbor 's house before police arrived , Wright said , and the children remain in a neighbor 's care .
During the incident , police told neighbor Ann DiJohnson to avoid rooms with windows in fear of a possible shootout .
" It was frightening , " DiJohnson said .
" I 'm still shaking . "
Thomas Shaak , who lives a block from the Hains , said the couple hardly socialized with neighbors .
The avid gardener said he occasionally saw Scott Hain working on his yard , but the two did not greet each other .
He said Hain worked as a security officer and often kept odd hours .
Meleanie Hain became an overnight celebrity and , to some , a steward of Second Amendment rights when she carried a Glock strapped to her belt to her daughter 's soccer game September 11 , 2008 .
Days later , on September 20 , her permit to carry a gun was revoked by Lebanon County Sheriff Michael DeLeo , who claimed that she showed poor judgment at the child 's game .
County Judge Robert Eby later reinstated the permit .
Weisberg , Hain 's attorney , said the sheriff 's action violated Hain 's First , Second , Fourth and 14th Amendment rights .
A lawsuit was filed against DeLeo on Hain 's behalf for compensatory damages .
She sought punitive and statutory damages , Weisberg said , along with reimbursement of attorneys ' fees and lost wages .
Although Weisberg called the Hains a " loving " and " unified " couple , he said that about four months ago , Meleanie Hain told him that they were separating and that she wanted to remove his name from the $ 1 million lawsuit .
Although there was no indication of abuse , Weisberg said , Meleanie Hain was contemplating getting a " stay - away order . "
" It 's shocking , " Weisberg said of the shooting .
" And sadly ironic . "

French psychologist Nicolas Gueguen is fun .
He ’s the guy who asks the pressing questions we ’d all like answered , whether we admit it or not :
Does makeup really make a woman more attractive to men ? ;
Are dog owners more likely to get dates ? ;
How much does cup size really matter ? ; and How does priming men to think about love change their behavior ?
And now Gueguen strikes again , this time with a study on courtship and “ foot - in - the - door - technique . ”
The latter is an actual term in psychology .
“ Foot in the door ” is a compliance tactic in which an initial , small difficult - to - turn - down request is made ( as in a solicitor asking passers - by on the street for their signature ) .
Once people acquiesce to an easy request , they are likelier to agree to a larger request ( to donate money , time , etc. ) .
Kids seem to implicitly know the foot - in - the - door effect , as when they ask for a small treat , followed immediately by a request for a larger one .
But what about men looking for love ( or sex ) ?
Gueguen wanted to know if the foot - in - the - door technique would work in a pick - up context , so he recruited a nice - looking guy in his twenties to solicit young , hot women in the street .
Over a series of days the man approached 360 different ladies , and asked them if they ’d like to have a drink with him .
Some of the time he approached them , greeted them , and made the drink offer right away .
In the foot - in - the - door condition , however , he asked them for directions or requested a light for his cigarette before inviting them to have a drink with him .
Turns out , the technique works .
Women were significantly more likely to say yes to a drink with the guy if he made a minor request immediately beforehand .
That ’s how foot - in - the - door works , by fostering compliance .
It ’s easier to say no when the no has n’t been preceded by a yes .
( Incidentally , it ’s also more difficult to say no after nodding your head . )
Of course , for most men the aim is to get much more than a foot in the door .
For that , I suspect the actual nature of the second , larger request counts a lot .
Ask too much , guys , and you ’ll get a door - in - the - face .

Extremely Sorry David Gonzales Bonus Footage
The assault case involving two Oakland Raiders coaches is reportedly going back into the hands of the Napa , Calif . , police department .
The National Football Post is reporting that Oakland defensive assistant Randy Hanson will cooperate with police and tell them who is responsible for his broken jaw .
He was allegedly assaulted by another member of the Raiders staff .
AOL's Fanhouse reported that Hanson was assaulted by Oakland head coach Tom Cable .
This week , listening to the Guardian science podcast , I had a treat .
Caspar Melville , editor of New Humanist magazine , leader of something called the Rationalist Association , had been to see two films at the Cambridge film festival .
One was a dreary creationist movie that famously misrepresented the biologists interviewed for it .
This was obvious bad science , he explained .
But the other was different : House of Numbers , a new film about Aids , really had something in it .
I have now seen this film .
It presents itself as a naive journey by one young film - maker to discover the science behind HIV .
In reality , it 's a dreary and pernicious piece of Aids denialist propaganda .
All the usual ideas are there .
It 's antiretroviral drugs themselves that are the cause of symptoms called Aids .
Or it 's poverty .
Or it 's drug use .
HIV does n't cause Aids .
Diagnostic tools do n't work , Aids is simply a spurious basket diagnosis invented to sell antiretroviral medication for a wide range of unrelated problems – and the drugs do n't work either .
It would take two months of columns to address all the bogus claims of this film , and that blizzard , perhaps , is the point of making it , with all the classic rhetorical devices that have been honed by Aids denialists and creationists over decades .
It engages , for example , in repeated overstatement of marginal internal disagreements about the details of HIV research , to the extent that 18 doctors and scientists interviewed for the film have issued a statement saying that the director was " deceptive " in his interactions with them , that it perpetuates pseudoscience and myths , and that they were selectively quoted to make it seem as if they are in disagreement and disarray , when in fact they agree on all the important facts .
At one point there is an extended sequence explaining that you can't take a picture of the HIV virus : or maybe you can , but if you can , different scientists disagree on how , and whether their method is best .
This is an infantile world view where stuff only exists when you can easily take a photograph of it , and where the internet , compound interest and magnetism do n't exist either .
There is a memorable skit on diagnostic tests , where the film - maker manages to find one woman working in a marquee in a shopping centre in Africa giving HIV tests , who accidentally misinforms him about why she is asking for information on his health risk behaviours .
In the film , this becomes a dramatic expose : the HIV diagnosis is a tautology , they suggest , a basket diagnosis for sick people of any kind who engage in risk behaviours , the blood test is unreliable , a piece of theatre , and the diagnosis is only made because the tester has asked if you are gay or inject drugs .
But people working on the frontline of HIV testing are often told to ask about risk behaviours during a test , because testing is also a great opportunity for education about prevention .
Furthermore , as an interesting statistical aside , knowledge about your pre-test likelihood of having a condition also helps the tester to correctly interpret any diagnostic test .
In any case , HIV tests are so reliable that in 2007 an HIV - negative woman won $ 2.5 m in damages after she was treated for Aids without a proper diagnosis , because there was no excuse for the mistake that her doctor made .
But am I protesting too much ?
As you read these words , is doubt creeping in ?
So tests are n't so good ?
So there is controversy ?
It 's all so complicated .
So many details .
Maybe there 's no smoke without fire .
And so , maybe , I should ignore this film : but it 's so profoundly misleading that you can't stop yourself .
There is an interview with Christine Maggiore , who talks about her difficult decision to go against medical advice by declining to take Aids medication , and how much better she felt as a result .
What the film does n't tell you , as you shout at the screen , is that Christine Maggiore 's daughter Eliza Jane died of Aids and PCP pneumonia three years ago , at the age of three , and , as I reported nine months ago , Christine Maggiore herself died two days after Christmas 2008 of pneumonia , aged 52 ( the film finally acknowledges her death in the last 2 seconds of the film , at the end of the lengthy credits , in small letters ) .
We see Neville Hodgkinson , the Sunday Times health correspondent who drove their denialist reporting in the 1990s .
There is Peter Duesberg , who you will remember from a recent column , when academic publishers Elsevier forcibly withdrew an article by him in one of their journals .
I could go on .
Do you give idiots a wider audience when you respond to them ?
Are they marginal and irrelevant ?
I 'd like to believe that they are .
But the duping of Caspar Melville ( who has since recanted from his uncritical response to the film , albeit only on his blog ) , and the attention - seeking smugness of Cambridge film festival in putting on such a moronic film , both suggest otherwise .
I will never know the right way to deal with any of these people , and I will always welcome advice .

libvirt : an “ embedded ” QEMU driver mode for isolated usage Since the project ’s creation about 14 years ago , libvirt has grown enormously .
In that time there has been a lot of code refactoring , but these were always fairly evolutionary changes ; there has been little revolutionary change of the overall system architecture or some core technical decisions made early on .
This blog post is one of a series examining recent technical decisions that can be considered more revolutionary to libvirt .
This was the topic of a talk given at KVM Forum 2019 in Lyon .
Historical driver architecture Historically the local stateful drivers in libvirt have supported one or two modes of access “ system mode ” – privileged libvirtd running as root , global per host
“ session mode ” – unprivileged libvirtd , isolated to individual non-root users Within context of each daemon , VM name uniqueness is enforced .
Operating via the daemon means that all applications connected to that same libvirtd get the same world view .
This single world view is exactly what you want when dealing with server / cloud / desktop virtualization , because it means tools like ‘ virt - top ‘ , ‘ virt - viewer ’ , ‘ virsh ‘ can see the same VMs as virt - manager / oVirt / OpenStack / GNOME Boxes / etc .
There are other use cases for virtualization , however , where this single world view across applications may be much less desirable .
Instead of spawning VMs for the purpose of running a full guest operating system , the VM is used as a building block for an application specific use case .
I describe these use cases as “ embedded virtualization ” , with the libguestfs project being a well known long standing example .
This uses a VM as a way to confine execution of its appliance , allowing safe manipulation of disk images .
The libvirt - sandbox project is another example which provides a way to take binaries installed on the host OS and directly execute them inside a virtual machine , using 9 p filesystem passthrough .
More recently the Kata project aims to provide a docker compatible container runtime built using KVM .
In many , but not neccessarily all , of these applications , it is unhelpful for the KVM instances that are launched to become visible to other applications like virt - manager / OpenStack .
For example if Nova sees a libguestfs VM running in libvirt it wo n’t be able to correlate this VM with its own world view .
There have been cases where a mgmt app would try to destroy these externally launched VM in order to reconcile its world view .
There are other practicalities to consider when using a shared daemon like libvirtd .
Each application has to ensure it creates a sensible unique name for each virtual machine , that wo n’t clash with names picked by other applications .
Then there is the question of cleaning up resources such as log files left over from short lived VMs .
When spawning KVM via a separate daemon , the QEMU process is daemonized , such that it disassociated from both libvirtd and the application which spawned it .
It will only be cleaned up by an explicit API call to destroy it , or by the guest application shutting it down .
For embedded use cases , it would be helpful if the VM would automatically die when the application which launched it dies .
Libvirt introduces a notion of “ auto destroy ” to associated the lifetime of a VM with the client socket connection .
It would be simpler if the VM process were simply in the same process group as the application , allowing normal OS level process tree pruning .
The disassociated process context means that the QEMU process also looses the cgroup & namespace placement of the application using it An initial embedded libvirt driver A possible answer to all these problems is to introduce the notion of an “ embedded mode ” for libvirt drivers .
When using a libvirt driver in this mode , there is no libvirtd daemon involved , instead the libvirt driver code is loaded into the application process itself .
In embedded mode the libvirt driver is operating against a custom directory prefix for reading and writing config / state files .
The directory is private to each application which has an instance of the embedded driver open .
Since the libvirt driver is directly loaded into the application , there is no RPC service exposed and thus there is no way to use virsh and other tools to access the driver .
This is important to remember because it means there is no way to debug problems with embedded VMs using normal libvirt tools .
For some applications this is acceptable as the VMs are short - lived & throw away , but for others this restriction might be unacceptable .
At the time of writing this post , support for embedded QEMU driver connections has merged to GIT master , and will be released in 6.1.0 .
In order to enable use of encrypted disks , there is also support for an embedded secret driver .
The embedded driver feature is considered experimental initially , and so contrary to normal libvirt practice we ’re not providing a strong upgrade compatibility guarantee .
The API and XML formats wo n’t change , but the behavior of the embedded driver may still change .
Along with the embedded driver mode , is a new command line tool called virt - qemu-run .
This is a simple tool using the embedded QEMU driver to run a single QEMU virtual machine , automatically exiting when QEMU exits , or tearing down QEMU if the tool exits abnormally .
This can be used directly by users for self contained virtual machines , but it also serves as an example of how to use the embedded driver and has been important for measuring startup performance .
This tool is also considered experimental and so its CLI syntax is subject to change in future .
In general the embedded mode drivers should offer the same range of functionality as the main system or session modes in libvirtd .
To learn more about their usage and configuration , consult the three pages linked in the above paragraphs .
Further development work During development of the embedded driver one of the problems that quickly became apparently was the time required to launch a virtual machine .
When libvirtd starts up one of the things it does is to probe all installed QEMU binaries to determine what features they support .
This can take 300 - 500 milliseconds per binary which does n’t sound like much , but if you have all 30 QEMU binaries installed this is 10 - 15 seconds .
The results of this probing are cached , avoiding repeated performance hits until something changes which would invalidate the information .
The caching does n’t help the embedded driver case though , because it is using a private directory tree for state and thus does n’t see the cache from the system / session mode drivers .
To deal with this problem the QEMU driver startup process was significantly refactored such that probing of QEMU binaries is delayed until the data is actually needed .
This massively helps both the new embedded mode and existing system / session modes .
Unfortunately it is fairly common for applications to query the libvirt host capabilities and the returned data is required to report on all QEMU binaries , thus triggering the slow probing operation .
There is a new API which allows probing of a single QEMU binary which applications are increasingly using , but there are still valid use cases for the general host capabilities information .
To address the inherent design limitations of the current API , one or more replacements are required to allow more targetted information reporting to avoid the mass QEMU probe .
Attention will then need to switch to optimizing the startup procedure for spawning QEMU .
There is one key point where libvirt uses QMP to ask the just launched QEMU what CPU features it has exposed to the guest OS .
This results in a huge number of QMP calls , one for each CPU feature .
This needs to be optimized , ideally down to 1 single QMP call , which might require QEMU enhancements to enable libvirt to get the required information more efficiently .
One of the goals of the embedded driver is to have the QEMU process inherit the application ’s process context ( cgroups , namespaces , CPU affinity , etc ) by default and keep QEMU as a child of the application process .
This does not currently happen as the embedded driver is re-using the existing startup code which moves QEMU into dedicated cgroups and explicitly resets CPU affinity , as well as daemonizing QEMU .
The need to address these problems is one of the reasons the embedded mode is marked experimental with behaviour subject to change .
libvirt : split of the monolithic libvirtd daemon
Since the project ’s creation about 14 years ago , libvirt has grown enormously .
In that time there has been a lot of code refactoring , but these were always fairly evolutionary changes ; there has been little revolutionary change of the overall system architecture or some core technical decisions made early on .
This blog post is one of a series examining recent technical decisions that can be considered more revolutionary to libvirt .
This was the topic of a talk given at KVM Forum 2019 in Lyon .
Monolithic daemon
Anyone who has used libvirt should be familiar with the libvirtd daemon which runs most of the virtualization and secondary drivers that libvirt distributes .
Only a few libvirt drivers are stateless and run purely in the library .
Internally libvirt has always tried to maintain a fairly modular architecture , with each hypervisor driver being a separated from other drivers .
There are also secondary drivers providing storage , network , firewall functionality which are notionally separate from all the virtualization drivers .
Over time the separation has broken down with hypervisor drivers directly invoking internal methods from the secondary drivers , but last year there was a major effort to reverse this and re-gain full separation between every driver .
There are various problems with having a monolithic daemon like libvirtd .
From a security POV , it is hard to provide any meaningful protections to libvirtd .
The range of functionality it exposes , provides an access level that is more or less equivalent to having a root shell .
So although libvirtd runs with a “ virtd_t ” SELinux context , this should be considered little better than running “ unconfined_t “ .
As well as providing direct local access to the APIs , the libvirtd daemon also has the job of exposing remote access over TCP , most commonly needed when doing live migration .
Exposing the drivers directly over TCP is somewhat undesirable given the size of the attack surface they have .
The biggest problems users have seen are around reliability of the daemon .
A bug in any single driver in libvirt can impact on the functionality of all other drivers .
As an example , if something goes wrong in the libvirt storage mgmt APIs , this can harm management of any QEMU VMs .
Problems can be things like crashes of the daemon due to memory corruption , or more subtle things like main event loop starvation due to long running file handle event callbacks , or accidental resource cleanup such as closing a file descriptor belonging to another thread .
Libvirt drivers are shipped as loadable modules , and an installation of libvirt does not have to include all drivers .
Thus a minimal installation of libvirt is a lot smaller than users typically imagine it is .
The existance of the monolithic libvirtd daemon , however , and the fact the many apps pull in broader RPM dependencies than they truly need , results in a perception that libvirt is bloated / heavyweight .
Modular daemons
With all this in mind , libvirt has started a move over to a new modular daemon model .
In this new world , each driver in libvirt ( both hypervisor drivers & secondary drivers ) will be serviced by its own dedicated daemon .
So there will be a “ virtqemud “ , “ virtxend “ , “ virtstoraged “ , “ virtnwfilterd “ , etc .
Each of these daemons will only support access via a dedicated local UNIX domain socket , /run/ libvirt / $ DAEMONNAME , eg /run / libvirt / virtqemud .
The libvirt client library will be able to connect to either the old monolithic daemon socket path / run / libvirt / libvirt - sock , or the new per-daemon socket .
The hypervisor daemons will be able to open connections to the secondary daemons when required by requested functionality , eg to config a firewall for a QEMU guest NIC .
Remote off - host access to libvirt functionality will be handled via a new virtproxyd daemon which listens for TCP connections and forwards API calls over a local UNIX socket to whichever modular daemon needs to service it .
This proxy daemon will also be responsible for handling the monolithic daemon UNIX domain socket path that old libvirt clients will be expecting to use .
Overall from an application developer POV , the change to monolithic daemons will be transparent at the API level .
The main impact will be on deployment tools like Puppet / Ansible seeking to automate deployment of libvirt , which will need to be aware of these new daemons and their config files .
The resulting architecture should be more reliable in operation and enable development of more restrictive security policies .
Both the existing libvirtd and the new modular daemons have been configured to make use of systemd socket activation and auto - shutdown after a timeout , so the daemons should only be launched when they actually need to do some work .
Several daemons will still need to startup at boot to activate various resources ( create the libvirt virb0 bridge device , or auto - start VMs ) , but should stop quickly once this is done .
Migration timeframe
At the time of writing the modular daemons exist in libvirt releases and are built and installed by default .
The libvirt client library , however , still defaults to connecting to the monolithic libvirtd UNIX socket .
To best of my knowledge , all distros with systemd use presets which favour the monolithic daemon too .
IOW , thus far , nothing has changed from most user ’s POV .
In the near future , however , we intend to flip the switch in the build system such that the libvirt client library favours connections to the modular daemons , and encourage distros to change their systemd presets to match .
The libvirtd daemon will remain around , but deprecated , for some period of time before it is finally deleted entirely .
When this deletion will happen is still TBD , but it is not less than 1 year away , and possibly as much as 2 years .
The decision will be made based on how easily & quickly applications find adaptation to the new modular daemon world .
Future benefits
The modular daemon model opens up a number of interesting possibilities for addressing long standing problems with libvirt .
For example , the QEMU driver in libvirt can operate in “ system mode ” where it is running as root and can expose all features of QEMU .
There is also the “ session mode ” where it runs as an unprivileged user but with features dramatically reduced .
For example , no firewall integration , drastically reduced network connectivity options , no PCI device assignment and so on .
With the modular daemon model , a new hybrid approach is possible .
A “ session mode ” QEMU driver can be enhanced to know how to talk to a “ system mode ” host device driver to do PCI device assignment ( with suitable authentication prompts of course ) , likewise for network connectivity .
This will make the unprivileged “ session mode ” QEMU driver a much more compelling choice for applications such as virt - manager or GNOME Boxes which prefer to run fully unprivileged .

The fortuitous lighting of Saturn 's equinox has revealed the planet 's famously smooth , flat rings are actually corrugated .
During the days immediately after the August 11 equinox , the sun 's rays struck the rings at very low angles , bringing their topography into high - relief .
For scientists studying the rings , the event happening once every 15 years provided an unprecedentedly dimensional view of the rings .
They were thought to be about 30 feet thick — and they are , generally speaking — but the Cassini spacecraft has revealed regions that are nearly two miles high .
" Like the seas of Earth , this wide icy expanse has settled into a mathematically precise cast that , here and there , froths and churns , not by wind but by the convulsive forces of Saturnian moons , " Carolyn Porco , Cassini imaging team leader at the Space Science Institute in Boulder , wrote in her Captain 's Log .
" This famous adornment , impressed deep in the human mind for four centuries as a pure , two - dimensional form , has now , as if by trickery , sprung into the third dimension . "
There are several different types of clumps and corrugations and walls within the rings .
Scientists have different theories about how the structures might form .
Some of them , they know , are caused by Saturn 's moons .
" It turns out that as the orbits of the moons are a little inclined relative to the ring plane , they pull the particles out of the plane , " said Linda Spilker , Cassini deputy project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
In the picture above , the ring mountains can be seen at the upper right casting a shadow on the gray ring to the right .
They were pulled up out of the ring plane by the moon Daphnis .
Other structures seen in the rings are more mysterious .
Corrugationsacross the C and D rings could have been caused by a collision with some kind of space object , but Spilker said the Cassini team is n't sure about that .
In general , the scientists were surprised by the amount of height variation within the rings , most of which they were only able to see because of the good timing of the mission .
" It was very lucky that we had Cassini at the rings at the right time , " Spilker said .
The image at the top of the post shows Saturn a day and a half after the equinox .
It has been enhanced to increase the drama of the view , and Porco provided a wonderfully detailed explanation of how the image was created .
" To improve their visibility , the dark ( right ) half of the rings has been brightened relative to the brighter ( left ) half by a factor of three , and then the whole ring system has been brightened by a factor of 20 relative to the planet , " Porco wrote .
" So the dark half of the rings is 60 times brighter , and the bright half 20 times brighter , than they would have appeared if the entire system , planet included , could have been captured in a single image . "

The folks behind “ Family Guy ” have been saying some of the most alarming things .
Like “ sweet and funny ” and “ sense of family . ”
They are using these words to describe “ The Cleveland Show , ” a “ Family Guy ” spinoff that premieres Sunday night .
Coming from Seth MacFarlane ’s crew , such descriptions are like tiny time bombs disguised as rubber ducks , or festively wrapped birthday gifts filled with fake vomit and itching powder .
Because while executive producer Rich Appel may be sincere when he says “ The Cleveland Show ” is “ kinder and gentler ” than its predecessor , he is working from the same warped palette that gave us Stewie , the erudite and profane baby who most recently beat his dog to a bloody pulp for laughs on the Emmy broadcast last Sunday .
So while “ kinder and gentler ” may squeeze through the door -- in an early episode of “ The Cleveland Show , ” a dog is also killed , but humanely , by a car -- sweet ai n’t going to make it .
Because “ sweet ” is n’t , at least in the current vernacular , synonymous for scatological .
Or sophomoric .
Or surprisingly slow .
All of which “ The Cleveland Show ” most certainly is .
Following his divorce , Cleveland Brown ( voiced by “ Family Guy ” producer Mike Henry ) announces to his friends on “ Family Guy ” that he is taking his son , Cleveland Jr. , and heading west to become a minor league baseball scout .
But first he makes a stop in his hometown of Stoolbend , Va .
There Cleveland gets sidetracked by his high school sweetheart , Donna ( Sanaa Lathan ) , now divorced from the man she chose over Cleveland .
Before long , Cleveland and his son have moved in with Donna , her teenage daughter , Roberta ( Reagan Gomez - Preston ) , and 5 - year - old son , Rallo ( also Henry ) , who is a foul - mouthed stand - in for Stewie , channeling blaxploitation films rather than a British accent .

There ’s a crazy hillbilly neighbor on one side and , on the other , a couple of Germanic bears ( the male is voiced by MacFarlane , the female by Arianna Huffington , and I do n’t even know what to say about this ) .
No one is safe from ridicule .
Not Cleveland , who sounds just like a white guy voicing a black guy ( because that ’s what he is ) and spends way more time naked than any cartoon human should .
Not Cleveland Jr. , who is heavy and therefore stupid .
Not Donna , who is so desperate for a man she ’ll take Cleveland .
And certainly not Kathleen Turner , who turns up in a randomly mean aside .
Even Kurt Cobain is resurrected in order to make fun of Courtney Love ( is anyone else even still talking about Courtney Love ? ) .
“ The Cleveland Show ” follows a more typical plot formula than “ Family Guy ” -- a problem arises , messes are made solving the problem , but in the end things seem to be better than before .
Jokes about genitalia and pedophilia , about sex and urine and marijuana use abound , none of them funny enough to remember mere moments after they have been made .
An extended riff about “ playing with Cleveland Jr. ” as well as a sight gag involving a possum that attaches itself to Cleveland ’s crotch do linger , however , and much longer than they should , but humor is , alas , not the reason .
For those who love and admire “ Family Guy , ” “ The Cleveland Show ” offers another version , slightly watered down and , at least it seems to someone who has seen but does not regularly watch “ Family Guy , ” much less smart .

In trying to infuse their trademark raunchy and outrageous humor with something approximating family values , Appel and his team have wound up with something that is neither fish nor fowl .
“ The Cleveland Show ” is neither sweet nor particularly funny , neither a family comedy nor a true satire .

Researchers at The Wistar Institute have identified a key gene ( KLF17 ) involved in the spread of breast cancer throughout the body .
They also demonstrated that expression of KLF17 together with another gene ( Id1 ) known to regulate breast cancer metastasis accurately predicts whether the disease will spread to the lymph nodes .
Previously , the function of KLF17 had been unknown .
Deaths of most breast - cancer patients are the result of metastasis , a complex , multi-step , and poorly understood process .
“ Identifying the gene that suppresses the spread of tumor cells and the mechanisms by which this suppression occurs can lead to the discovery of new markers of metastasis and potential targets for cancer prevention and treatment , ” says Qihong Huang , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant professor at The Wistar Institute and senior author of the study .
In this study , which appears in the October on - line issue of Nature Cell Biology , Huang and colleagues introduced a genetic screen targeting 40,000 mouse genes into mammary tumor cells that do not usually spread , and then transplanted those cells to the mammary fat pads in mice where they would be expected to remain .
Through RNA interference ( RNAi ) technology , they then reduced the expression of a metastasis - suppressor gene in five mice , one of which developed lung metastases in seven weeks .
RNA retrieved from the metastasized cells corresponded to KLF17 .
To determine whether KLF17 played a similar role in human breast - cancer metastasis , the researchers knocked down KLF17 expression in a tagged human - breast - cancer cell line and then transplanted these cells — along with a control group still expressing KLF17 — into mammary fat pads of mice .
Within eight to 10 weeks , lung metastases developed in the KLF17 - deficient cells , whereas the control cell set did not metastasize , demonstrating that knockdown of KLF17 expression also promotes the spread of human breast - cancer cells .
The researchers also were interested specifically in genes whose expression were increased in KLF17 knockdown cells but decreased in KLF17 overexpressing cells or vice versa .
In collaboration with Professor Louise C. Showe , Ph.D. at the Wistar Institute , they found the significant genes that met these criteria .
Among them , the gene Id1 was found to be up - regulated in KLF17 knockdown cells and down - regulated in KLF17 overexpressing cells .
Recent findings suggest that Id1 is deregulated in various types of cancers and is important in the development of embryonic stem cell–like phenotypes in cancer cells .
To further investigate the interactions of KLF17 and Id1 , the Huang lab scanned a DNA segment of mouse Id1 and found two potential KLF17 binding sites .
To examine the effect of Id1 upregulation in tumor metastasis in vivo , the team generated tagged mouse and human cell lines expressing mouse or human Id1 , respectively .
Following transplantation back into the mice , lung metastasis developed from Id1 - upregulated cells but not in controls , demonstrating that Id1 expression promotes tumor metastasis in vivo .
Further characterization of KLF17 is an ongoing subject of study for Wistar researchers .
“ We are continuing to examine ways to activate KLF17 and the methods by which that process slows or prevents cancer metastasis , ” Huang says .

Klein- Szanto , M.D. ; from Fox Chase Cancer Center ; and Phyllis A.

A new way of storing and ‘ echoing ’ pulses of light has been discovered by a team from The Australian National University , allowing bursts of laser to work as a flexible optical memory and potentially assist in extending the range of quantum information systems .
Technologies like quantum cryptography are being developed to send secure information coded onto light beams from one point to another .
Yet at present these systems are unable to extend beyond a distance of 50 to 100 kilometres because , beyond that range , too much of the information is lost .
But a team based at the ARC Centre of Excellence in Quantum - Atom Optics at ANU has demonstrated how photon echoes can be used to create a quantum memory device – meaning that pulses of light can be captured , stored and then released on demand .
Such a device would be an important part of a quantum repeater , which could extend the range of secure quantum communication .
“ Light can be a fantastic medium for transferring lots of information very quickly , but it does n’t like to stay in one place for long , ” explains team member Dr Ben Buchler .
“ This is the problem of optical memory – how to keep the information coded on light in one place so you can access it again later .
One method is to slow the light down so it ’s as good as frozen in place for a while .
The way we ’ve explored is to absorb the light in a cloud of atoms , which you can then manipulate to release the light at will . ”
In experiments performed by PhD candidate Mahdi Hosseini , the ANU research team developed a method where pulses of laser light are absorbed into a cloud of atoms surrounded by a coil of wire .
The coil creates a magnetic field that shifts the frequency of the atoms .
After absorbing the laser pulses , the atoms all begin to spin at different speeds , depending on their frequency .
If the magnetic field is reversed , the atoms all change direction and spin the other way .
When the spinning atoms return to the state they were in when they absorbed the light , the laser pulses are released as a photon echo .
“ But we take it a few steps further , ” explains Dr Buchler .
“ We can also stretch , compress and split the pulses when we let them out .
Best of all , we can recall the pulses in any order , just like a random access memory in a computer can recall electronic information in any order .
To do this we use a second control laser beam that can turn the photon echo on and off .
In a regular photon echo system , once the atoms all re-align the stored light just comes out – you ca n’t stop it .
In our system , the combination of control beam and magnetic field switching makes it possible to choose exactly when to recall any one of the stored pulses , how much of it to recall and how fast to recall it . ”
The research , published in Nature , outlines how the team have managed to store laser pulses with efficiencies above 40 per cent using its technique .
The team includes Dr Ben Buchler , Ben Sparkes , Gabriel Hetet , Mahdi Hosseini , Dr Jevon Longdell ( now at the University of Otago ) and Professor Ping Koy Lam from ANU .

Titus was said to have overcome many hardships to rise to the top of the pack
Titus - the most famous silverback in Africa known as " The Gorilla King " - has died in Rwanda at the age of 35 .
He was the subject of a BBC documentary last year , and was studied by naturalists throughout his life - including US expert Dian Fossey .
Rwandan officials described him as " possibly the most remarkable gorilla ever known " , referring to his long life and his rise to dominance in his group .
Titus was one of only about 700 mountain gorillas left in Africa .
The highly endangered animals are found only on the slopes of the Virunga mountains on the borders of Rwanda , Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo .

The plight of the mountain gorilla was brought to the attention of the world by Fossey , who lived in the Virunga until her murder in 1985 .
" He was born on 24 August 1974 and has been observed closely by researchers throughout his entire life , " a statement from the Rwandan national parks office said .
" Tragically , he succumbed to old age on September 14 . "
The life expectancy of a healthy gorilla is about 40 .
The silverback 's story was featured last year in a BBC documentary called Titus : The Gorilla King .
He rose to become the dominant male in his group despite losing family members and being born underdeveloped .
" Every gorilla death recorded is not only a great loss , but a major setback to conservation efforts of removing the mountain gorillas off the endangered species list , " tourism officials said .
Gorilla tracking is now the mainstay of tourism in Rwanda and Uganda .

He maintained that the girl was sexually experienced and had consented .
This week Lily Allen 's views on file - sharing have been the hot topic .
While some agree with her calls to ' save ' the industry from a fate worse than death , others did not subscribe to the doomsday scenario .
One of those is UK musician Dan Bull who has written a brilliant song - come - open letter to Miss Allen .
We hope you enjoy it .
Say what you like about Lily Allen .
Agree with her .
Disagree with her if you like .
Whatever the position , it ’s difficult to take it away from her – she has done more in the last week to raise the online debate over illicit file - sharing than any other artist in recent months .
Lily has managed to capture the imaginations of both sides – people are talking about this issue and that is always a good thing .
Debate , discussion and hopefully understanding will bring this file - sharing ‘ war ’ to an end one day but in the meantime let ’s not forget what this is ultimately all about – the music .
We all love it and that ’s why you ’ll love this too ;
“ After Lily ’s hectic week I ’ve made a pro-filesharing song and video calling her up on a few of the claims she ’s made , ” UK musician Dan Bull explains to TorrentFreak .
“ I ’ve also tried to outline some of the main moral arguments for filesharing in the lyrics .
Hope you enjoy , and hope the readers do too . ”
The song is brilliant in my opinion , and , ironically I suppose , i’d like to give Dan some money for his work , he deserves it .
Let ’s hope this song gets to Internet # 1 this weekend and he reaps the benefit .
Now if I can just get the chorus out of my head …..
… or if you prefer , download the MP3 here .

Beginner Crochet Afghan Patterns Afghan crochet ( also known as Tunisian crochet ) has regained popularity recently .
Many like the afghan crochet stitches because it combines the look of knitting and the ease of crochet .
Upon the completion of a project , you have a solid fabric with excellent drape .
Afghan crochet is similar to knitting as this method of crochet “ carries ” the stitches along as you progress across a row .
You are essentially “ picking up ” stitches as you move forward and then you complete the stitch on the return row .
As a result , crochet hooks for afghan crochet are much longer than standard hooks and have a stopper at the end , similar to a knitting needle .
While using such a long hook may feel awkward at first , you will quickly adjust to the change and you will just love what you can create when using the afghan stitch !
The Basic Afghan Stitch
If you are comfortable with the single crochet stitch ( sc ) , you will have no problem with the basic afghan stitch .
The only “ adjustment ” you may have is using a longer hook .
To complete the basic afghan stitch ( foundation row ) : Complete a row of chain ( ch ) stitches , the same way any crochet pattern would start .
To begin the “ forward row ” for the basic afghan stitch , insert hook into second ch from hook , yarn over ( yo ) and draw up a loop ( just like the beginning of a sc ) .
Instead of completing a sc , keep the loop on the hook , insert the hook into the next ch , yo and draw up a loop ( you now have two loops on the hook ) .
Continue to “ pick up ” loops until you have reached the end of the row .
This completes the first half of the afghan crochet row .
You should have the same number of loops as your starting chain .
On the “ return row , ” do not turn your work , like you would when completing a standard crochet project .
turn your work , like you would when completing a standard crochet project .
Working from left to right , yo and draw up one loop .
Yarn over ( yo ) and pull through one loop .
Yarn over ( yo ) and draw through two loops .
Continue to yo and pull through two loops until only one remains on your crochet hook .
That loops remains on your hook and counts as the first stitch of the next row .
To continue the basic afghan stitch ( remainder of project ) , known as the Tunisian Simple Stitch ( tss ) : Insert your hook behind the next vertical bar in the row below .
Do not work directly into the vertical bar directly below the loop on your hook .
Yarn over ( yo ) and draw through the stitch , pulling up a loop
Continue to repeat in each vertical bar of the row below across until you have reached the next - to - last stitch .
On the return row , yo and pull through one loop .
Yarn over ( yo ) and on the next stitch , pull through two loops .
Continue to yo and pull through two loops until one loop remains ( this will be the first loop of the next row )
From Making Salad to Getting Dressed -- What Are Drivers Doing Behind the Wheel ?
Drivers continue to engage in risky behavior behind the wheel .
Oct. 15 , 2009  --
Talking on a cell phone , changing the radio station -- these driving distractions are in the minor leagues for Kathy Smith .
The 57 - year - old said she has routinely put on nylons behind the wheel and drives with her knees so she can balance both her cell phone and note - taking .
When her daughter was young , Smith said she was often running so late she 'd leave the house in her pajamas and exit her car dressed for work .
" I 'm really good , " she told ABCNews.com .
Her proudest driving while distracted moment ?
Making an entire salad behind the wheel with all the accoutrement of a stocked kitchen -- cutting board , knife , veggies , pasta and mayo -- on her way to a funeral several years ago .
" I grabbed everything I had , and whenever I came to a signal I did that , " she said .
Once the ingredients were chopped and in the bowl , " I just flipped it when I could and would hold the bowl with one hand . "
East Coasters can breathe a sigh of relief -- Smith lives in California .
The issue of distracted driving -- long touted by lawmakers and transportation researchers as a major cause of car accidents and fatalities -- has been thrust into the public eye once again with paparazzi photos of California first lady Maria Shriver chatting on her cell phone as she cruised the streets of Brentwood , Calif .
Tom Vanderbilt , author of the best - selling book , " Traffic : Why We Drive the Way We Do , " said people have been concerned about distraction ever since radios were installed in cars .
But newer forms of distraction -- including cell phones and texting -- consume significantly more " mental resources . "
" People are not always effective managers of their own distraction , " he wrote in an e-mail to ABCNews.com , " and the traffic environment can shift in a heart - beat from relatively ' safe ' to a complex , hazard - avoiding moment in which one 's cognitive abilities may be otherwise occupied . "
He called texting the " perfect storm " because it involves visual , tactile and cognitive distraction .
" One psychologist mentioned to me he was surprised it would even be the source of a study , " Vanderbilt wrote .
" ' What next , ' he joked , ' studying the effects of driving while blindfolded ? ' "
Distracted Driving Blamed on Thousands of Car Crashes Each Year
While cell phone use still is considered to be one of the most dangerous distractions for drivers , according to a 2006 study by the National Transportation Highway Safety Administration and the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute , reading and eating behind the wheel both were found to increase the likelihood of a crash by three times .
" Visual inattention " was the cause of 93 percent of all rear - ended crashes , the study found .
And 80 percent of all crashes and 65 percent of near - crashes involved drivers looking away within three seconds of the incident .
Vanderbilt , whose first teenage crash happened after he looked away to change the radio dial , said his favorite example of inattentiveness at the wheel came from a Canadian government official who used his cell phone to film a nearby motorist shaving in the driver 's seat -- while the government official was behind the wheel himself .
" The official waited until a red light to film , but the interesting point here is that it's the minister that would have gotten the ticket , " Vanderbilt said , " as there 's no law against shaving while driving per se . "
While some drivers apparently have gotten more brazen -- the Internet abounds with anecdotes about drivers buried in a novel or even practicing the trumpet -- motorists have been admitting to less - than - attentive driving for years .
A 2002 NHTSA survey of distracted driver behaviors reported that 12 percent of people admitted to reading a map or directions behind the wheel and 8 percent reported taking part in " personal grooming " while in motion .
Nearly half , 49 percent , reported eating or drinking at least some of the time , while a whopping 81 percent reported chatting with fellow passengers .
Smith said she never once has been in an accident while multi-tasking in the car , though she sometimes worries what would happen if she were hit by someone else and did n't have her hands on the wheel .
Her daughter , now 27 , however , was less than thrilled with her mother 's habits .
" She always used to think , ' Mom , that 's crazy ! ' "
Smith said .
Distracted Driver Stories Range From the Amusing to the Heartbreaking
Several states have cracked down on distracted driving , and proposals for stricter regulations and harsher punishments have cropped up regularly .
Six states and the District of Columbia ban handheld phones for all drivers , while 18 states and D.C. ban text messaging while driving .
Yet some states , including Alabama , Idaho and North Dakota have no laws on the books regarding distracted driving , according to the Governors Highway Safety Association .
Still , there have been numerous cases of deaths blamed on distracted driving .
Lora Hunt , a suburban Illinois mother , pleaded not guilty to six counts of reckless homicide this month in connection with a March crash in which she smashed into motorcycle at a red light while painting her nails .
The motorcyclist , Anita Zaffke , died from multiple internal injuries and a spinal fracture .
In 2007 , text messaging was thought to be behind a crash that killed five cheerleaders in western New York .
While distracted driving has been blamed for causing motorists to weave or drive at slower speeds , crashes are the biggest consequence to worry about , Vanderbilt said .
Vanderbilt himself admits to using his iPhone in the car to change songs or check his e-mail , but only at a red light .
" There is always going to be a bit of ' distraction ' in driving , " he said .
" As we get good at it , it typically consumes less of our mental workload . "

Angela Garbarino after Beating by Police Officer Wiley Willis
A police officer who was terminated for brutally beating a woman in his custody has been reinstated because the polygrapher who interrogated him as part of an internal investigation failed to make a recording of the polygraph examination .
Shreveport , Louisiana Police Officer Wiley Willis ' brutalization of Angela Garbarino on 17 November 2007 became national news in 2008 when video from the incident was released .
In the video , shortly after Willis handcuffs her , Garbarino asks , " Is this on the record ? "
She then looks into the camera and says , " Good . "
However , Willis later turns off the video camera , and when he turns it back on , Garbarino lies on the floor in a pool of blood :

Board reinstates Willis , says city violated his rights
Panel says Shreveport violated Wiley Willis ' rights
By Loresha Wilson  ljwilson@gannett.com  August 13 , 2009
The Shreveport Municipal Fire and Police Civil Service Board 's seven members made the ruling Wednesday in the case known nationally for video footage of the handcuffed woman lying in a pool of her blood in a police interrogation room .
The ruling means Wiley Willis can return to duty once his in - service and firearm requirements are met .
" He 'll get a year and a half of back pay , benefits , retirement , everything , " said Michael Carter , president of the Shreveport police officers union .
And as far as he knows , Carter added , Willis intends to continue working for the Shreveport Police Department .
The Civil Service Board ruled that Willis ' rights , under the Police Officer Bill of Rights , were violated because an expert failed to record a polygraph examination Willis took as part of the Police Department 's investigation into Garbarino 's injuries , including a broken nose .
Shreveport Police Chief Henry Whitehorn called the panel 's finding a technicality and said he is " disappointed with the board 's ruling . "
The police chief said he is moving forward with the city 's legal department to pursue an appeal .
" This is not a technicality , this is the law  the Police Bill of Rights , " Michael Carter , president of the Shreveport police officers union , said after a news conference Wednesday evening .
Carter also said Willis was fired for failing to administer first aid  a detail the Police Department never has released and would not confirm .
Carter pointed out that police officers have n't been trained in first aid since 1996 and are not equipped with any type of medical supplies .
Wayne Nissen , who administered the polygraph , testified before the board that he was aware the Police Department was investigating Willis ' actions .
He said he was n't given a line of questions to ask during the exam but was told to ask questions about the night of Garbarino 's arrest .
However , Nissen said , he was unaware of the Police Officer Bill of Rights , which provides a certain level of protection for officers during investigations and personnel matters .

This unfortunate situation could have been avoided had Mr. Nissen been in the habit of routinely recording all polygraph examinations .
Just as there is no excuse for Officer Willis having turned off the video camera in the detention room , there is no excuse for any polygraph examination not to be recorded in its entirety .

Prevén que próximo jueves emita un criterio para que los farmacodependientes sean considerados enfermos
[ email protected ] La Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación ( SCJN ) se perfila para emitir un criterio en el sentido de que los farmacodependientes no deben ser tratados como delincuentes , sino como enfermos .
La ausencia de un ministro y “ el puente ” por los festejos de la Independencia generó que la decisión en torno a este tema se aplazara para el jueves próximo , debido a que el pleno del máximo tribunal no laborará 14 , 15 y 16 de septiembre .
En dicha fecha se prevé que , en una votación cerrada de seis contra cinco , que la mayoría de ministros del máximo tribunal del país declare inconstitucional el artículo 199 del Código Penal Federal , vigente hasta el 19 de agosto pasado , y que trataba como delincuentes a los farmacodependientes , algunos de ellos aún bajo proceso .
En opinión de la mayoría de los ministros dicho artículo era generador de un trato discriminatorio , porque a los farmacodependientes se les sometía a un juicio si eran encontrados con una cantidad de droga para su consumo — aunque al final se les dejaba en libertad — ; mientras que a quienes decían que no eran adictos se les dejaba en libertad y sólo se les mandaba a tratamiento .
El artículo 199 del Código Penal Federal impugnado fue reformado recientemente .
El 20 de agosto pasado entró en vigor un paquete de reformas para combatir el narcomenudeo , que incluyó , entre otras medidas , la despenalización de la posesión , por parte de adictos , de drogas en cantidades consideradas de consumo personal .
Prioridad a tratamientos A la par de que se estableció que se le debe dar prioridad a los tratamientos para farmacodependencia que quedarán a cargo de la Secretaría de Salud .
Es decir , mediante la reciente reforma constitucional se dejó de criminalizar a los farmacodependientes y se les comenzó a tratar como enfermos .
En este contexto , la importancia de la sentencia que dictará la Corte estriba , en la práctica , en que se convertirá en un aval a la nueva reforma y en un criterio que cierre la posibilidad de que en el futuro se vuelva a tratar como delincuentes a los adictos .
Además de que lo que diga la Suprema Corte servirá para ayudar a otros farmacodependientes que estén siendo juzgados todavía bajo la ley anterior .
La Corte se manifestará sobre este tema al amparar a un farmacodependiente que fue detenido hace un par de años con una cantidad de cocaína para consumo personal y que fue procesado y tratado como delincuente , conforme a la legislación que estaba vigente hasta el mes pasado .
Durante la revisión de su caso , el 10 de septiembre pasado , cinco ministros se manifestaron por declarar inconstitucional el artículo 199 del Código Penal Federal , mientras que otros cinco lo hicieron por avalar la disposición que contenía dicho artículo , por estimar que era necesario someter a un juicio a las personas que se decían farmacodependientes y que eran detenidas con una cantidad de droga exclusiva para su consumo , a fin de corroborar que efectivamente eran adictos .
Dicha votación generó un empate , debido a la ausencia del ministro José Ramón Cossío , quien , se dijo , se encontraba “ en una comisión oficial ” , y ahora tiene la responsabilidad de emitir el voto que genere el desempate .
The Pegasus Mail Thousand - an open letter .
For twenty years , I have been writing and maintaining Pegasus Mail and Mercury ; indeed , they have become such a core part of what I am that I sometimes have trouble distinguishing the boundary between them and me .
I would like to believe that during those twenty years , I have provided something that people have enjoyed using and which has enriched their lives .
Twenty years is a long time though , and in that time the Internet has changed dramatically - it has gone from being something that most people had n't even heard of when I began , to being so pervasive that most people now can't imagine a world without it .
As the Internet has grown and changed , so have the attitudes of the community of people who use it : phenomena such as YouTube and FaceBook have changed the way people interact with each other , but have also engendered a common expectation that everything should be free .
Now , as someone who has always given his software away to the maximum extent possible , I 'm clearly not against the idea of things being free , but I also believe it's not unreasonable to expect that things requiring as much work , investment and ongoing effort as Pegasus Mail and Mercury should be able to generate a modest living income .
Unfortunately , for the last three years they simply have not done so , where prior to that they did .
We 're not talking about huge numbers here - all it would take to secure the indefinite existence and support of these programs would be for a thousand people to commit to a donation of US $ 50 each year .
When I raised this as a suggestion earlier this year , the response from you all was so positive and morale - boosting that I 've set up The Pegasus Mail Thousand , an initiative where people committed to keeping Pegasus Mail and Mercury alive and flourishing can do so through a simple annual payment - you can sign up at http://hera.pmail.gen.nz/TheThousand.
I would really like to see my " babies " to endure into their twenties and beyond : as long as we can find a way of providing a basic level of ongoing financial support for them and me , I am willing to keep working on them and making them freely available .
It 's up to you .
Cheers ! -- David Harris --
January 23rd 2010 .
Update - August 2010 : I 've put up a new Developer News Page , detailing the things we 're working on .
The aim is to update this each month or so , to keep you abreast of developments .
We also hope that those of you who were kind enough to join The Thousand last year will consider renewing your support in September - we 'll send out notifications closer to the time .
Thank you all !

Introduction
In most countries , political leaders and bosses are using the global economic crisis to once again unleash an attack on workers and the poor .
As part of this , we have seen corporations around the world trying to make workers pay for the crisis by retrenching tens of millions of people .
In the most extreme cases , workers arrive at their companies in the morning and are told they no longer have a job .
With all these retrenchments , corporations are not just taking away jobs but they are also attacking people ’s dignity .
They are literally throwing people into a very uncertain world where it is getting harder and harder to even get the basics of life such as food and shelter .
Of course , the corporate elite are not worried if people starve or live in misery , what they care about is their profit margins and bottom lines .
Through retrenchments , therefore , the elite are waging a war on workers and the poor in the name of corporate survival and profit prospects .
Fortunately , workers around the world have started resisting .
Strikes against retrenchments have occurred from France to China and from Greece to South Korea .
In some cases , workers have even kidnapped their bosses and occupied factories and offices to stop being made ‘ redundant . ’1
It is through this type of direct action that the workers involved are winning concessions from the elite .
Indeed , workplace occupations seem to be one of the most effective ways for people to win their demands and reclaim their dignity back from the elite .
Worker Occupations Are Spreading
A few years ago , it would have seemed crazy to even suggest that workers across the world would be starting to once again occupy their factories to stop closures and retrenchments .
The only place this seemed to happen up until recently was in Argentina .
With the crisis in Argentina in 2001 hundreds of workplace occupations occurred .
In the end , over 200 factories were recovered by workers and in many cases they became democratically run by the workers themselves .
2
Nonetheless , few even imagined that factory occupations and self - management would become a possibility in many other countries .
Certainly , in every country around the world retrenchments have been rife over the last 20 years , but staging direct action to stop this through occupations did not look like a realistic option .
For example , in South Africa hundreds of factories have closed since the 1990s , but trade union leaders did not even consider occupations as a viable strategy to combat this .
Within the last several months , however , factory occupations have occurred in at least a dozen other countries besides Argentina .
Once again direct action and even talk of worker self - management are back on the agenda of many workers .
Even in Britain and Northern Ireland , where Thatcher ’s brutal attack on the coal miners in 1984 left lasting scares amongst workers and the poor , workplace occupations have occurred .
When the car parts manufacturer Visteon informed workers that the company would be shutting its doors , the workers decided to occupy the company ’s plants .
They were furious as they had only been given 6 minutes notice and a severance package that was paltry .
For over a month , the workers occupied Visteon ’s buildings despite the threat of arrest .
3
In the end , even though they could not save their jobs , they won a severance package that was worth ten times the original offer .
In the process , the Visteon workers regained the dignity that the management tried to strip them of .
Similarly , when workers at Prisme Packaging in Dundee were told that the company was shutting its doors , they staged a 51 - day sit-in .
They had decided that they were not willing to lose their jobs and said that they wanted to re-open Prisme as a co-operative under self - management .
For them , victory came when they managed to secure funding for their co-operative venture .
4
Similar stories of workplace occupations have also occurred in the Republic of Ireland .
Earlier this year , workers at the Waterford Crystal factory were informed by the companies liquidators — Deloitte and Touch — that they no longer had jobs and that they would not even receive severance pay .
The workers decided to defend their livelihoods by staging an occupation .
In response Deloitte and Touch sent in a private security force to threaten and intimidate the workers .
Eventually , however , 10 million Euros was made available for a severance fund and negotiations are now underway for some of the workers to keep their jobs .
5
Factory and workplace occupations have also been taking place in several countries on continental Europe .
When the current crisis first struck , in late 2007 , 300 workers at Frape Behr in Spain occupied their workplace to stop retrenchments .
As part of this , community activists and supporters surrounded the building and protested in solidarity with the workers inside .
6
At the same time as this was occurring , workers in Serbia were occupying their factory , Shinvoz , to prevent it being privatized .
7
In France , workers under the threat of retrenchments have also charged into the offices of their bosses and held them until their demands have been met .
For example , at FM Logistics 125 workers invaded a managers meeting and held the bosses hostage .
The reason the workers did this was because the company had formulated a plan to retrench over 470 workers due to the current economic crisis .
After only one day of ‘ captivity , ’ the managers of FM Logistics agreed to re-examine their retrenchment plans .
Similar ‘ bossnappings ’ have also occurred at the French holdings of Sony , 3 M , and Cattepillar .
The majority of the French public have supported these ‘ bossnappings . ’
This support has meant that the French state has not been able to move against the workers involved .
8
Over the last few months , factory occupations have also been taking place in Turkey .
Workers in Turkey have been hit extremely hard by the crisis with over 500,000 people losing their jobs since September 2008 .
In order to stem this , workers in a number of factories — such as MEHA textiles and Sinter Metal — embarked on workplace occupations .
The Turkish state , however , has reacted harshly and used security forces to drive the workers out .
Nonetheless , the workers then camped outside of the factories and their resistance has continued .
Recently , the workers at Sinter held a celebration to mark their 100th day of resistance .9
North America has also seen a string of workplace occupations .
Due to the collapse of the auto industry in Canada , workers have occupied 4 different plants because they had been refused any compensation .
Reportedly , the workers were occupying the plants in order to prevent machinery being removed by the liquidators .
In fact , they were using this tactic in order to force the bosses and the liquidators to the negotiating table .
Likewise , in the United States , there have also been a number of occupations .
The most well know was the Republic Windows and Doors occupation .
The occupation occurred because the workers at the plant were given just 3 days notice that it was to be shut .
To add insult to injury , it turned out that Republic was closing because the Bank of America — which had received billions of dollars of public money in bailouts — refused to extend the company ’s credit .
Again the occupiers received massive public support .
Subsequently , the workers won severance pay and the company has opened under new ownership — meaning some jobs , but certainly not all — have been saved .10
With the current global economic crisis , Argentina has once again been taking the lead in occupations and turning occupied factors into worker self - managed institutions .
Under the threat of downsizing and pay cuts , 10 factories have been occupied in Argentina since 2008 .
The workers have taken this action to stop the owners from declaring bankruptcy .
Indeed , it has been a strategy of the Argentine business elite to use crises to declare insolvency , then fraudulently liquate assets and suddenly open the business under a new name a few months later .
A number of the newly occupied factories have also received major support from the older self - managed factories .
11
Already , workers at least one of the 10 occupied factories — Arrufat Chocolate — have elected to take over the factory permanently and operate it on a democratic basis .
They have already gone into production using generators and are turning Arrufat into a viable worker self - managed operation .

Conclusion
The current economic crisis has seen corporations unleash a series of attacks on workers .
This has included retrenchments , wage freezes , and in some cases closers .
In many parts of the world , workers have responded with their own actions .
These have included workplace occupations and even in some instances complete factory takeovers with the aim of embarking on self - management .
As such , these workers are finding their own solutions to the crisis .
The actions of these workers are inspirational .
It seems likely that more and more workers will begin adopting and adapting the idea of factory occupations as a viable way to save jobs and reclaim the dignity that bosses have tried to take away from them .
Perhaps what we are also seeing through the occupations , takeovers , and self - management is a glimpse of what a post - capitalist world , created by the workers and the poor themselves , would look like .
Indeed , hopefully the factory occupations that we are beginning to see are an embryo of a different world — a world where there are no bosses , where workers manage themselves , where the economy is democratically planned through worker and community assemblies , where there are no hierarchies , where the environment is not raped , and where the goal is to meet peoples ’ needs and not make profits .

One day last week I took the train , economy - class , from Sawah Besar in Central Jakarta to Depok in West Java .
It was 11:30 a.m. , the sun was beating down and it was hot , all the train passengers were sweating heavily in the airless carriage .
I was standing near two mothers sat with their babies aged about 12 - 18 months old , who were enjoying the breeze coming in through the carriage windows .
Twenty minutes went by , it was getting hotter , and one of the toddlers , looking tired , started crying .
The wailing baby grasped her mother *s shirt and tugged , fussing and wriggling , throwing her body from right to left in her mother 's arms .
Maybe because of the hot weather , or due to hunger , or tiredness .
Standing around the mother were several male passengers .
Endless minutes later , the howling baby was still struggling and grasping at her mother *s shirt .

Albino people live in fear in Tanzania and Burundi A court in north - western Tanzania has sentenced three men to death by hanging for killing a 14 - year - old albino boy .
They were found guilty of attacking Matatizo Dunia and severing his legs in Bukombe district in Shinyanga province .
In the past two years there has been a huge rise in murders of albino people .
Witchdoctors use their body parts in potions they claim bring prosperity .
Dozens of people have been arrested , but the justice system is notoriously slow and this is the first conviction .
In July a court in neighbouring Burundi sentenced one person to life in prison and eight others to jail for the murder of albino people whose remains were sold in Tanzania .
Lucrative business
The three men attacked and killed the young boy last December - one of a string of more than 50 albino murders that have taken place in Tanzania over the past two years .
Living in fear : Tanzania 's albinos
In hiding for exposing witchdoctors
They have the right to appeal against the death sentence - a punishment their lawyers described as unexpected .
Albino people are killed because potions made from their body parts are believed to bring good luck and wealth .
Witchdoctors in Tanzania and other parts of East Africa - especially Burundi - have made tens of thousands of dollars from selling potions and other items made from the bones , hair , skin and genitals of dead albino people .
Witchdoctors pay a lot of money for body parts .
The Tanzanian government has publicly stated its desire to end the killings .
In March , President Jakaya Kikwete called on Tanzanians to come forward with any information they might have .
Officials banned witchdoctors from practising , however many have continued to work .
Some correspondents say it is possible that Wednesday 's death sentence will deter people from killing albino people .
But BBC Africa analyst Mary Harper says in a country as poor as Tanzania , it is likely that some murders will continue because so much money can be made from selling the body parts .
There are estimated to be about 17,000 albino people living in Tanzania .
They lack pigment in their skin and appear pale .

It 's both a sad and a disturbing trend , this " 2 - D love " thing .
It seems like a natural step from the hikikomori phenomenon , where thousands of boys afraid of the outside world shut themselves in their bedrooms for years on end .
What 's driving Japanese men to these extremes of isolation and anti-social behavior ?

Django ponies : Proposals for Django 1.2
I ’ve decided to step up my involvement in Django development in the run-up to Django 1.2 , so I ’m currently going through several years worth of accumulated pony requests figuring out which ones are worth advocating for .
I ’m also ensuring I have the code to back them up — my innocent AutoEscaping proposal a few years ago resulted in an enormous amount of work by Malcolm and I do n’t think he ’d appreciate a repeat performance .
I ’m not a big fan of branches when it comes to exploratory development — they ’re fine for doing the final implementation once an approach has been agreed , but I do n’t think they are a very effective way of discussing proposals .
I ’d much rather see working code in a separate application — that way I can try it out with an existing project without needing to switch to a new Django branch .
Keeping code out of a branch also means people can start using it for real development work , making the API much easier to evaluate .
Most of my proposals here have accompanying applications on GitHub .
I ’ve recently got in to the habit of including an “ examples ” directory with each of my experimental applications .
This is a full Django project ( with settings.py , urls.py and manage .py files ) which serves two purposes .
Firstly , it allows developers to run the application ’s unit tests without needing to install it in to their own pre-configured project , simply by changing in to the examples directory and running ./ manage .py test .
Secondly , it gives me somewhere to put demonstration code that can be viewed in a browser using the runserver command — a further way of making the code easier to evaluate .
django - safeform is a good example of this pattern .
Here ’s my current list of ponies , in rough order of priority .
Signing and signed cookies
Signing strings to ensure they have not yet been tampered with is a crucial technique in web application security .
As with all cryptography , it ’s also surprisingly difficult to do correctly .
A vulnerability in the signing implementation used to protect the Flickr API was revealed just today .
One of the many uses of signed strings is to implement signed cookies .
Signed cookies are fantastically powerful — they allow you to send cookies safe in the knowledge that your user will not be able to alter them without you knowing .
This dramatically reduces the need for sessions — most web apps use sessions for security rather than for storing large amounts of data , so moving that “ logged in user ID ” value to a signed cookie eliminates the need for session storage entirely , saving a round - trip to persistent storage on every request .
This has particularly useful implications for scaling — you can push your shared secret out to all of your front end web servers and scale horizontally , with no need for shared session storage just to handle simple authentication and “ You are logged in as X ” messages .
The latest version of my django - openid library uses signed cookies to store the OpenID you log in with , removing the need to configure Django ’s session storage .
I ’ve extracted that code in to django - signed , which I hope to evolve in to something suitable for inclusion in django.utils .
Please note that django - signed has not yet been vetted by cryptography specialists , something I plan to fix before proposing it for final inclusion in core .
Improved CSRF support
This is mainly Luke Plant ’s pony , but I ’m very keen to see it happen .
Django has shipped with CSRF protection for more than three years now , but the approach ( using middleware to rewrite form HTML ) is relatively crude and , crucially , the protection is n’t turned on by default .
Hint : if you are n’t 100 % positive you are protected against CSRF , you should probably go and turn it on .
Luke ’s approach is an iterative improvement — a template tag ( with a dependency on RequestContext ) is used to output the hidden CSRF field , with middleware used to set the cookie and perform the extra validation .
I experimented at length with an alternative solution based around extending Django ’s form framework to treat CSRF as just another aspect of validation — you can see the result in my django - safeform project .
My approach avoids middleware and template tags in favour of a view decorator to set the cookie and a class decorator to add a CSRF check to the form itself .
While my approach works , the effort involved in upgrading existing code to it is substantial , compared to a much easier upgrade path for Luke ’s middleware + template tag approach .
The biggest advantage of safeform is that it allows CSRF failure messages to be shown inline on the form , without losing the user ’s submission — the middleware check means showing errors as a full page without redisplaying the form .
It looks like it should be possible to bring that aspect of safeform back to the middleware approach , and I plan to put together a patch for that over the next few days .
Better support for outputting HTML
This is a major pet peeve of mine .
Django ’s form framework is excellent — one of the best features of the framework .
There ’s just one thing that bugs me about it — it outputs full form widgets ( for input , select and the like ) so that it can include the previous value when redisplaying a form during validation , but it does so using XHTML syntax .
I have a strong preference for an HTML 4.01 strict doctype , and all those < self - closing - tags /> have been niggling away at me for literally years .
Django bills itself as a framework for “ perfectionists with deadlines ” , so I feel justified in getting wound up out of proportion over this one .
A year ago I started experimenting with a solution , and came up with django - html .
It introduces two new Django template tags — { % doctype %} and { % field %} .
The doctype tag serves two purposes — it outputs a particular doctype ( saving you from having to remember the syntax ) and it records that doctype in Django ’s template context object .
The field tag is then used to output form fields , but crucially it gets to take the current doctype in to account .
The field tag can also be used to add extra HTML attributes to form widgets from within the template itself , solving another small frustration about the existing form library .
The README describes the new tags in detail .
The way the tags work is currently a bit of a hack — if merged in to Django core they could be more cleanly implemented by refactoring the form library slightly .
This refactoring is currently being discussed on the mailing list .

Improved HTML discussion on the django - developers mailing list
Logging
This is the only proposal for which I do n’t yet have any code .
I want to add official support for Python ’s standard logging framework to Django .
It ’s possible to use this at the moment ( I ’ve done so on several projects ) but it ’s not at all clear what the best way of doing so is , and Django does n’t use it internally at all .
I posted a full argument in favour of logging to the mailing list , but my favourite argument is this one :
Built - in support for logging reflects a growing reality of modern Web development : more and more sites have interfaces with external web service APIs , meaning there are plenty of things that could go wrong that are outside the control of the developer .
Failing gracefully and logging what happened is the best way to deal with 3rd party problems — much better than throwing a 500 and leaving no record of what went wrong .
I ’m not actively pursuing this one yet , but I ’m very interesting in hearing people ’s opinions on the best way to configure and use the Python logging module in production .
A replacement for get_absolute_url ( )
Django has a loose convention of encouraging people to add a get_absolute_url method to their models that returns that object ’s URL .
It ’s a controversial feature — for one thing , it ’s a bit of a layering violation since URL logic is meant to live in the urls .
py file .
It ’s incredibly convenient though , and since it ’s good web citizenship for everything to have one and only one URL I think there ’s a pretty good argument for keeping it .
The problem is , the name sucks .
I first took a look at this in the last few weeks before the release of Django 1.0 — what started as a quick proposal to come up with a better name before we were stuck with it quickly descended in to a quagmire as I realised quite how broken get_absolute_url ( ) is .
The short version : in some cases it means “ get a relative URL starting with / ” , in other cases it means “ get a full URL starting with http :// ” and the name does n’t accurately describe either .
A full write - up of my investigation is available on the Wiki .
My proposed solution was to replace it with two complementary methods — get_url ( ) and get_url_path ( ) — with the user implementing one hence allowing the other one to be automatically derived .
My django - urls project illustrates the concept via a model mixin class .
A year on I still think it ’s quite a neat idea , though as far as I can tell no one has ever actually used it .

Editorial : Earth will be OK , but for us it ’s not so good
WHEN Nobel prize - winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen coined the word Anthropocene around 10 years ago , he gave birth to a powerful idea : that human activity is now affecting the Earth so profoundly that we are entering a new geological epoch .
The Anthropocene has yet to be accepted as a geological time period , but if it is , it may turn out to be the shortest – and the last .
It is not hard to imagine the epoch ending just a few hundred years after it started , in an orgy of global warming and overconsumption .
Let ’s suppose that happens .
Humanity ’s ever - expanding footprint on the natural world leads , in two or three hundred years , to ecological collapse and a mass extinction .
Without fossil fuels to support agriculture , humanity would be in trouble .
“ A lot of things have to die , and a lot of those things are going to be people , ” says Tony Barnosky , a palaeontologist at the University of California , Berkeley .
In this most pessimistic of scenarios , society would collapse , leaving just a few hundred thousand eking out a meagre existence in a new Stone Age .
Whether our species would survive is hard to predict , but what of the fate of the Earth itself ?
It is often said that when we talk about “ saving the planet ” we are really talking about saving ourselves : the planet will be just fine without us .
But would it ?
Or would an end -Anthropocene cataclysm damage it so badly that it …
Uncharted : Drake ’s Fortune has already had the privilege of receiving a PlayStation Home space with Sully ’s Bar .
The sequel , Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves however , has n’t gotten any news on a space – until now .
Plus , Ratchet & Clank make their long awaited debut in the PS3 application .
With two AAA PS3 titles launching alongside each other in October , it makes sense that PlayStation Home would like to put them in the spotlight as much as possible .
First , the Ratchet & Clank space will feature several mini-games , plus some music that sounds like it ’s from an actual title .
There is also a firing - range in the space , and enemies change depending on range you are playing on – Past , Present , or Future .
An apartment is also launching alongside the space , disappointingly though , it is not Ratchet & Clank ’s actual apartment from the series .
The apartment though does have three spaces , and a great view of space from the basement .
Oh , and did we mention there ’s also a Ratchet costume for your avatar ?
The Uncharted 2
Home space closes in on Nepal , one of the star points of the title .
This space also has several mini-games to choose from , but one of the best games to appear is called “ Fortunate Thieves ” .
This game is centered around terrain changes , with treasure being hidden on certain tiles .
Players are allowed to choose which terrain they can start on , and each player gets a card that could the terrain drastically .
These cards can stall players , and give you a chance for the treasure .
Of course , with usually every space in PlayStation Home comes a reward of some sort .
Look back on PlayStation LifeStyle for all incoming Home news .
And while you ’re waiting , take a look at these screenshots from the Ratchet & Clank space .
Unfortunately , no Uncharted 2 shots were available .

Oct. 12 , 2009  --
For six years , Lauren Book - Lim was tortured by the woman she both feared and trusted -- her nanny .
Waldina Flores ruled the little Florida girl 's life , alternately showering her with affection and then beating and raping her .
The molestation began when Book - Lim was 11 .
Angry that she was chewing gum , the woman whom the little girl affectionately called " Waldy " stuck her tongue in the little girl 's mouth to remove it .
The abuse escalated from there , whenever the little girl did not cooperate .
" She used objects or hands or whatever she could get , " Book - Lim , now 24 , told ABCNews.com .
" She pushed me down the stairs .
And at one point she defecated on me . "
In 2002 , at the age of 17 , she broke away from Flores , who was ultimately sentenced to 25 years for her sex crimes .
But today , Book–Lim has come face to face with her demons and her conscience , helping homeless sex offenders at Miami 's notorious Julia Tuttle Causeway find a legal place to live .
There , scores of convicted molesters live in rat - infested squalor because of child protection laws Book - Lim helped to enact -- ordinances that prohibit sex offenders from living within 2,500 feet of schools and playgrounds .
Advocating For Children , Not Predators
Book - Lim is convinced that if sexual predators live in inhumane conditions , they are an even greater danger to children .
" We do n't want anyone living under a bridge to be so desperate they reoffend , " said Book - Lim .
" She wants to heal as many people as she possibly can , " said her father , Ron Book , who shares his daughter 's work as a board member of the Miami - Dade Homeless Trust .
" She is so special , she makes me cry . "
The first day volunteering on the job , Book - Lim said she felt " smacked in the face " when she met a man had molested an 8 - year - old .
" I had a hard time reconciling this in my head , " said Book - Lim .
" But I want to prevent it from happening to other children .
Yes , they are sex offenders , but that does n't mean they have to live like this . "
" I grew up to trying to help others , " she said .
" My Dad used to say , the least , the last and forgotten of our society -- it 's our job to take care of them . "
Nanny Preys on Docile Daughter
Book - Lim knows first - hand about those who are vulnerable .
The oldest and most docile of three children , she was targeted by the Honduran nanny who came to live in their family 's Miami home .
" I was a people pleaser , " she said .
" I always eat my peas and make everyone quiet and happy . "
While Flores ignored her feistier younger sister , who is now 22 , she preyed on Book , forcing her to have sex in bathrooms and closets as the other children slept .
" I was beaten every day , " she said .
" Waldy was very smart , like all predators are .
She hit me and bruised me where my parents would n't look .
When you are 13 and 14 , parents never look at their children 's stomachs or lower backs or butts or upper thighs . "
Like many victims of sexual abuse , Book was afraid to tell her parents .
Yet they worried about her increasing withdrawal and depressive mood , sending her to a therapist .
The abuse escalated when Book found a boyfriend – now her husband Kris Lim -- and Flores became fiercely jealous .
The nanny even threatened to kill him .
Boyfriend : ' Tell Nanny or I Will '
When they were seniors in high school , Lim saw the bruises and learned the truth .
He gave her an ultimatum -- tell her parents or he would .
" He believed in me and was on my side , " she said .
" I knew I needed to tell them , but I did n't know how .
She was an adult and much bigger , and it had gone on so long , I did n't know if I could do it . "
Book 's father was a prominent Florida lobbyist and she worried about publicly embarrassing him .
And Flores ' psychological pull was strong .
" I was scared and confused , " said Book - Lim .
" She provided a shower curtain around my life .
I did n't have to see any terrible things because she took care of the problems , which made her seem really appealing because you have someone who is listening to you , someone who loves you , who is there for you and has not left . ''
Flores even gave the girl an engagement ring and promised they would marry .
" I was delusional at the time , " said Book - Lim .
" You are on another planet , just to survive it . "
Nanny Molester Found Coaching Girls ' Soccer
In 2002 , Book - Lim confessed to her therapist who , in turn , called in her parents .
Her father immediately fired Flores , who absconded to Oklahoma .
She was apprehended a month later while coaching soccer to 10 - year - old girls .
" She was a true pedophile grooming another child to be abused , " said Book - Lim .
While in prison , Flores violated a court order and wrote love letters to Book - Lim and asked for money , earning her another 10 years on top of her 15 - year sentence .
In the aftermath of the arrest , Book became anorexic , dropping to 85 pounds and suffering near organ failure .
" Other than death or your kid disappearing and you do n't find them again , sexual abuse is the worst nightmare a parent can endure , " said her father Ron Book , who burst into tears when he learned of molestation .
" To this day , I have never read the police reports all the way through . "
" You can choose to cripple yourself or you can be strong and take control of the situation , " he said .
" You 've got to be strong , get some backbone and lead . "
Slowly , in new therapy and with the legislative clout of her father , Book - Kim began to heal .
Ron Book introduced his daughter to every state legislator in his rolodex .
Together they fought for the right to get 48 - hour access to HIV test results on predators , as well as a protection act banning molesters from ever contacting the victims or their families .
Victim Heals Through Helping Others
In addition to passing residence restrictions and extending cyber sex laws , they established a funding mechanism for a state - wide network of treatment centers .
" I think that fact that she got involved was critical to her recovery , " said Stephen Levin , the therapist who broke the shocking news to Book - Lim 's parents .
" She does n't feel like only a victim and she is doing something positive to help other people . "
" She had the support of her parents and she was able to talk about it , and her boyfriend was so supportive and encouraged her , " he told ABCNews.com .
Last summer , she married Kris Lim , a professional golfer .
While he travels , she runs her foundation , Laurens ' Kids , teaching sex abuse prevention to children in grades K - 2 and reinforcing the message , " It 's OK to tell . "
" It took a lot of guts to do what she did and what she is doing now , " said Lim .
" I have been there the whole time and seen the worst of the worst psychologically to helping children every day . "
" Now she is under the bridge with sex offenders , " he told ABCNews.com .
" She could never do that before .
She could n't even leave the house .
I am amazed at how much progress she has made . "
" She is a true survivor to have gone through that at such a young age and yet wake up every morning and relive that bad stuff just to help kids , " said Lim .
" No matter how she tries to forget , it 's still a part of her . "
Her father is also impressed , although at first he was opposed to his daughter working with sex offenders .
Since last August , they have found housing for 42 of the 100 men at the Julia Tuttle Causeway and more placements are underway .
" She wants to make sure this place is closed down , " said Book .
" She has taken this personally and she is the one who went through this .
Far be it from me to tell her as an advocate that she should n't feel that way . "
Both still strongly support registration of sex offenders and residency restrictions , saying they work , even if the homeless men at Julia Tuttle resent their work .
" They know who we are and do n't like use very much , " she said .
" I would n't consider myself advocating for them .
These people harmed children , and I do n't think they can dictate where they get to live . "
" Some of them say they are victims and it's not their fault , " said Book - Lim , who admits she 'll be in therapy for the rest of her life .
" But guess what ?
I was given a life sentence .
This person murdered my childhood .
I walk through a life that is broken . "
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have found three new major genetic links to Alzheimer ’s , affecting up to 20 percent of people with the brain - wasting disease , and said on Sunday it was the most significant such discovery in 15 years .
Two large studies found that the three new genes join the better - known APOE4 gene as significant risk factors for the most common cause of dementia .
“ If we were able to remove the detrimental effects of these genes through treatments , we could reduce the proportion of people developing Alzheimer ’s by 20 percent , ” Julie Williams , a professor of Neuropsychological Genetics at Britain ’s Cardiff University , told a news conference in London .
Alzheimer ’s disease affects more than 26 million people globally , has no cure and no good treatment .
The need for effective remedies is pressing , with the number of cases forecast to go beyond 100 million by 2050 .
Current drugs can only delay the symptoms endured by patients , who lose their memories , the ability to find their way around and to care for themselves .
Williams , who led one of the two studies published in Nature Genetics , said that in Britain alone , eradicating the effects of the three new genes would mean almost 100,000 people could avoid the disease .
She said the findings were the most significant genetic discoveries for Alzheimer ’s in the 15 years since APOE4 was found to be linked , and said drug companies had shown a keen interest in their research .
MORE GENES OUT THERE TO CATCH
Williams and colleagues at Cardiff ’s Medical Research Council Center for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics carried out a genome - wide association study -- a scan of the entire genetic map -- involving more than 16,000 people from eight countries .
They identified two new genes -- called Clusterin and PICALM -- that increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s .
A second genome - wide study conducted by Philippe Amouyel and colleagues at the Institut Pasteur de Lille in France , studied more than 6,000 people with Alzheimer ’s and nearly 9,000 healthy people in France , Belgium , Finland , Italy and Spain .
They identified Clusterin and a third gene called CR1 .
Amouyel said the disease risks associated with each gene were difficult to quantify , and said all three genes were relatively common .
The scientists also stressed that an as yet unknown combination of many genetic and other environmental factors cause Alzheimer’s .
The researchers said Clusterin may explain 10 percent of Alzheimer ’s cases , PICALM around 9 percent and CR1 4 percent .
By comparison , 20 to 25 percent of Alzheimer ’s cases are linked to
APOE .
Three gene variations have also been associated with rare , early - onset forms of Alzheimer ’s that run in families .
Identifying the genes can help researchers understand the underlying causes of a disease and design drugs to fight them .
Michael Owen , director of the Cardiff center , said their study also found evidence that other genes could play a role in the risk of developing Alzheimer’s .
“ It ’s a bit like we have been fishing with a fishing net and we ’ve pulled out some fish .
We know there are more fish there , and with a finer mesh net we can catch them , ” he said .
The Cardiff team now plans a further study involving 60,000 participants to look deeper into genetic causes of Alzheimer’s .
year ago , everyone was all but certain that the C++0 x standard was just around the corner , and that it would include concepts ( see Danny Kalev 's earlier interview with Bjarne Stroustrup , the creator of C++ , from August 2008 ) .
However , In July 2009 the C++ standards committee decided to remove concepts from the C++0 x by an unprecedented move .
Danny 's recent controversial editorial was among the first to report that decision and its possible consequences .
Despite vociferous disagreements over the removal of concepts themselves , nearly everyone agrees that the committee 's decision left open many questions not only about concepts , but also about the committee 's charter , and even the future of C++ itself .
Therefore , Danny has interviewed Bjarne Stroustrup again , this time to capture his thoughts about concepts , their removal , and the impact of that decision , along with his take on other pressing questions that currently concern the entire C++ community .
Danny Kalev ( DK ) : Which conclusions do you draw , if any , from the failure of concepts ?
How do you feel about this whole affair ?
Might it dissuade you from proposing innovative features in the future ?
Bjarne Stroustrup ( BS ) :
You mean from the decision not to ship concepts more or less as is for C++0 x ?
I am not of the opinion that concepts have failed .
My position was that we needed only a few weeks to " fix " what in my opinion were serious usability problems .
Obviously , a majority of the committee did n't agree with that timescale .
But just about everyone I talked to expressed support for the idea of concepts and I had to warn against over - optimism about the timescale to get concepts back once they were removed from the working paper .
There is a significant difference between " failure " and " not being ready to become the standard for millions of programmers . "
The power needed to propel a pebble across town will barely move a boulder .
However , moving the boulder may have huge benefits , whereas nobody cares where the pebble lands ( unless it is in your shoe ) .
In other words , making a change to C++ , which is large and in major real - world use , is hard but offers the possibility of helping millions of programmers .
Thus , I consider trying to improve C++ worthwhile despite the required effort and occasional setbacks .
Bjarne Stroustrup : I think that concepts were — and will again — become " a big deal . "
How do I feel ?
Disappointed , but not crushed .
Things could have been much worse .
In particular , we could have made the seriously flawed " concepts " part of the standard .
DK : The specification of concepts has taken seven years .
By contrast , the standardization of the entire STL took about half that time .
What is so complicated about concepts ?
BS : I count the concepts work as started in 2002 ; I presented my first design papers in 2003 .
In 1994 Alex Stepanov presented a complete implementation of the STL to Andrew Koenig and me , but 2002 - to - 2009 and 1994 - to - 1998 are not comparable time lines .
Alex had been working on the STL from at least 1976 .
But to answer your specific question : Concepts are hard to design because they represent a formalization of the C++ type system .
Doing concepts right implies a more formal specification of much of C++ , and requires reaching a new level of precision in the description of the C++ standard library .
In other words , doing concepts right implies clearing up many dark corners of the C++ specification .
Doing concepts right also implies using them does not mean significant increases in compile time , decreases in run-time performance , or erecting new barriers to effective generic programming .
My worry about concepts as present in the pre-Frankfurt working paper was the last point .
Others worried about the first .
I suspect that quite a few readers have only the vaguest idea of what concepts are and should be , so let me give a couple of examples .
With concepts , we can declare the four obvious versions of sort ( ) like this :
template < Container C> void sort ( C& c ) ; template < Container C , Comparator Cmp > void sort ( C& c , Cmp cmp ) ; template < RandomAccessIterator Iter > void sort ( Iter p , Iter q ) ; template < RandomAccessIterator Iter , Comparator Cmp > void sort ( Iter p , Iter q , Cmp cmp ) ;
Most people will find this pretty obvious — and then proceed to wonder why we did n't do that in C++98 .
After all , we say that sort ( ) takes a pair of random access iterators plus , optionally , a comparison function .
Furthermore , most of us would like to have the simpler way of specifying a sort ( ) for a whole container .
Here — using concepts to specify what is required for the template arguments — we simply say what we mean .
The result of doing so is to allow overloading , and get error messages for bad template arguments right away .
For example , if we call sort ( lst.begin ( ) , lst.end ( ) ) and lst really is a list then the error messages in C++98 are late ( link time ) , and typically obscure .
With concepts , they are instant and precise .
Note that only declarations are required for type checking and overload resolution ; just as for ordinary functions , the definitions ( function bodies ) can be " elsewhere . "
Why is this difficult to implement ?
This particular example is simple to specify and to implement , but people write templates that depend on really obscure details of types ( e.g. the template argument type must have a trivial destructor , the template argument type must be move - constructible , or the template argument type must be a union ) .
They do so because those details are important to them in their application domain .
My experience is that there is hardly any aspect of C++'s type system that is n't important to someone .
Representing all these possibilities as concepts is a lot of work — and has in fact helped us discover ill - defined details that would eventually have caused problems for someone .
Concepts do n't just help template users , they also have a major role in supporting template implementers .
Consider :
template < ForwardIterator Iter , class V ) requires Comparable < Iter:: value_type , V > Iter find ( Iter first , Iter last , V x ) { while ( first ! =last && * first !=x ) first = first + 1 ; return first ; }
This looks quite plausible .
The standard find ( ) does indeed require a pair of forward iterators , and the value does have to be compared to a value of the iterator 's value_type .
That is , concepts have been used simply to formalize the text in the standard .
However , the snag with that code is that a forward iterator does n't provide + , just ++ .
Given the code above , the compiler correctly rejects first = first + 1 .
Using only C++98 , finding that error would have required testing and / or a clever programmer .
Here , I presented only what I consider uncontroversial .
The discussions have been about design issues far more obscure than this .
Someone might insist " But better error messages are not such a big deal ; why should I care ? "
Well , they are a big deal , but only one of the beneficial effects of " concepts . "
The major effects are on programming style and code quality .
Try imagining the days before I added function argument type specification , argument type checking , and overloading to C as part of creating C++.
There was no shortage of people who objected to the verbosity of … :
double sqrt( double ) ;// modern function declaration
… as compared to the ( then ) familiar … :
double sqrt ( ) ;// pre-prototypes C function declaration
Some worried about compile - time overhead ; others about run-time overhead ( yes , really ; after all , you might get an undesired conversion from int to double ) , others about complexity ( can we really teach average programmers to use function declarations well ? ) , and still others about compatibility ( how does " old code " interact with code using function declarations at compile and link time ? ) .
Now , even the most die - hard C programmer wonders how people ever managed without function prototypes .
DK : So perhaps the conclusion is that concepts were doomed to fail because they try to fix so many things at once , by transforming C++ into an almost new language ?
After all , the whole notion of templates is a bit problematic in C++— what the programmer writes or reads is quite different from the actual ( unseen ) code that the compiler generates and parses when it processes a template instance .
In other words , maybe it would be better to leave C++ as - is in spite of the well - known limitations of templates ?
BS : No .
I do n't think that concepts were doomed to fail .
Also , I do n't think concepts were trying to fix many things or to transform C++ into an almost new language .
They were introduced to do one thing : provide direct language support to the by - far dominant use of templates : generic programming .
They were intended to allow direct expression of what people already state in comments , in design documents , and in documentation .
Every well - designed template is written with a notion of what is required from its arguments .
For good code , those requirements are documented ( think of the standard 's requirements tables ) .
That is , today most templates are designed using an informal notion of concepts .
The reason we need direct language support for concepts is that an informal notion is not good enough : Compilers do not read comments , design documents , or standards and " informal " in the hands of most programmers ( I do n't except myself ) means " imprecise . "
That is , the lack of formal , language supported concepts is a source of bugs as well as poor error messages .
I think the analogy between concepts in template declarations and arguments in function declarations ( function prototypes ) are more relevant than many like to believe .
I do not think that templates are " a bit problematic . "
For starters , they are not macros .
Programmers should no more worry about the transformations a compiler performs on template code to produce executable code than they do about the transformations compilers do for non-template code to produce executable code .
One reason that some people do worry ( and that some people do think of templates as macros ) is exactly because the requirements on template arguments are informal ; they 're not checked at the call point .
If you worry about such " transformations " you should be very keen on concepts .
If you do n't , maybe you should write in C without using prototypes .

Advertisement Havana has hosted the biggest open - air concert since the 1959 revolution , featuring some 15 top Latin American , Spanish and Cuban performers .
An estimated one million people - many wearing white - attended the free event in Revolution Square , Havana .
Colombian singer Juanes , who organised the Peace without Borders concert , received death threats from Miami - based critics of the Cuban regime .
But he had the support from 20 high - profile jailed dissidents inside Cuba .
The BBC's Michael Voss , who was at the five - and - a - half hour concert , said there was a mood of excitement as many residents of the isolated , music - loving island had never seen anything like it before .
AT THE SCENE Michael Voss , BBC News , Revolution Square
It 's absolutely packed here .
There 's never been a free open - air concert like it ever before .
When Pope Jean Paul II celebrated his historic Mass in this same place just over 10 years ago , there were about 250,000 people here .
We estimate there is double that number here now .
This is the centre of power here in Cuba .
Normally when I come here , it is to cover the big May Day parades and there are red flags everywhere .
Now , everyone is wearing white .
There are white flags , white shirts .
That 's the message - Peace without Borders .
He said people had travelled from across the island to attend .
But our reporter said heat was a problem , with many people being carried away on stretchers after fainting .
" We are here for the music and it is a message of peace and unity , not only for Cuba , but for the entire region , " said Latin Grammy winner Juanes .
Among the other artists taking part on Sunday were Spain 's Miguel Bose , Olga Tanon from Puerto Rico , the Cuban performers Silvio Rodriguez and Los Van Van .
" Together , we are going to make history , " said Tanon , as she opened the concert with the love song , Es Mentiroso Ese Hombre ( That Man is a Liar ) .
" It was really complicated to get here but I just could n't miss it , " a Havana resident , Maria Antonia , who was in a wheelchair , told BBC Mundo .
" We are going to stay as long as we have the strength , " Cristina Rodriguez , a 43 - year - old nurse who came with her teenage son , Felix , told AP .
' Farce '
While critics have complained that Juanes is endorsing the island 's communist system , the dissidents say the concert is an opportunity for reconciliation .
In pictures : Cuban peace concert Juanes said the show was about peace and tolerance , not politics , telling the audience that " the important thing is to swap hate for love " .
But at the end of the show , he caused some surprise by shouting " Cuba libre ! " ( Free Cuba ! ) and " One Cuban family " , slogans associated with the Cuban exile community .
In Miami , where the concert was broadcast by Spanish language TV stations , there were protests among some Cuban - Americans , with one group crushing Juanes CDs using a small steamroller .
" There has been a lot of blood spilled in Cuba and people executed by firing squad , " said 77 - year - old Hernan Gonzalez , who said he spent six years in a Cuban prison for his opposition to Fidel Castro in the 1960s .
" He [ Juanes ] is singing over dead bodies . "
Ninoska Perez , spokeswoman for the Cuban Liberty Council , told BBC Mundo : " It 's a farce ... that overlooks Cuban reality by conveniently describing it as ' an apolitical concert ' . "
The location of the Havana concert was highly symbolic .
The headquarters of the communist party is in Revolution Square , along with a giant metal sculpture of Che Guevara 's head .
The square was used by Fidel Castro to give five - hour speeches , and is also where Pope John Paul II celebrate a historic open air Mass in 1998 .
Speaking in an interview broadcast on Sunday , US President Barack Obama said he understood Juanes to be a " terrific musician " , but he was cautious about the impact of the concert .
" I certainly do n't think it hurts US - Cuban relations , " he said .
" These kinds of cultural exchanges - I would n't overstate the degree that it helps . "

4 . What 's New in Accessibility GNOME has a passion for making software available to everyone , including users and developers with impairments that can make it harder to use their computers .
To help , GNOME created the GNOME Accessibility Project and an accessibility framework that is now a standard on libre desktops .
GNOME 2.28 continues to build on its prior accessibility credentials with several improvements .
4.1 . Orca Screen Reader
Orca Screen Reader 4.2 . WebKit Accessibility Support 4.1 .
Orca Screen Reader
The Orca screen reader has had significant work done to reduce program bugs and improve performance , with over 140 bugs fixed for GNOME 2.28 .
Some of the improvements include : new support for different progress bar " verbosity levels " to allow you to control whether progress bar updates should be spoken even if the progress bar is not in the active window
ability to move the mouse without performing a click
support for mouseovers , including the ability to interact with an item displayed in the mouseover
presentation of misspelt words when editing text
completely rewritten speech and Braille generators , now with the ability to play sounds in the speech generator 4.2 .
WebKit Accessibility Support Significant effort has been done to improve WebKit accessibility , in particular the addition of caret navigation and the initial implementation of ATK 's accessible text interface .
Once the accessible text interface has been fully implemented , users will be able to access content without using the mouse and have it presented to them in speech and / or braille via the Orca screen reader .
5 . What 's New for Developers
The following changes are important for developers using the GNOME 2.28 developer platform .
If you 're not interested in changes for developers , you can skip forward to Section 6 ― Internationalisation .
As well as the GNOME Desktop , GNOME 2.28 is the latest release of the GNOME Developer Platform , a set of API - and ABI - stable libraries available under the GNU LGPL which can be used for the development of cross-platform applications .
Fixing Usage of Deprecated Libraries Starting with GNOME 3.0 , various deprecated parts of GNOME will be removed .
These deprecated components include libraries such as libart_lgpl , libbonobo , libbonoboui , libglade , libgnome , libgnomecanvas , libgnomeprint , libgnomeprintui , libgnomeui and libgnomevfs .
For applications that ship as part of the GNOME Desktop , a number of cleanup tasks have been carried out to ensure no deprecated code is used .
This will ensure the smooth transition to GNOME 3.0 .
Developers are strongly urged to follow this example in their own applications too .
Furthermore , for any developers ( or potential developers ) who wish to help us out , the GNOME goals wiki page lists the various tasks that are yet to be completed .
An automatically created and updated status overview of remaining work for modules that are supported by the JHBuild build tool can be found here .

A dependency on libgnomevfs was removed from three modules ( dasher , gnome - mag and gnome - utils ) .
Many modules now provide a nicer and cleaner build output when compiling them by using AM_SILENT_RULES or Shave .
For more information see http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/NicerBuilds
Some modules started using GIntrospection — see http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/AddGObjectIntrospectionSupport for more details .
Many applications have also removed the usage of deprecated GTK + and GLib symbols and have applied the new policy to only include top - level headers of GTK + and GLib. 5.2 . GTK + 2.18 GTK + 2.18 is the latest release of the GTK + toolkit , which is at the heart of GNOME .
GTK + 2.18 includes new features for developers , as well as extensive bug fixing and housecleaning for the upcoming GTK + 3.0 .
The file chooser has a number of improvements .
It now remembers its sorting state and has better defaults , such as hiding backup files and showing the Size column .
It also has improved ellipsisation in the path bar .
GTK + has also seen a number of other improvements , including : GtkEntry widgets can now also be used to display a progress bar .
GtkEntry has a model - view separation .
GtkLabel can show embedded URIs .
Printing supports printing a selection .
Page setup controls can be embedded in the print dialogue .
Status icons have a title property , for improved accessibility .
A new widget , GtkInfoBar , has been added to display messages in the main window instead of in a dialogue .
GTK + can be compiled with a modern automake version ( automake 1.7 is not needed any more ) and in silent mode with " make V=0 " command .
5.3 . GLib GNIO has been merged into GIO , and APIs are now included for working with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses , resolving hostnames , reverse IP lookup , low - level socket I/O and working with network connections and services .

5.4 . GNOME Documentation Support for Mallard , the new GNOME Documentation XML language , has been added to Yelp and gnome - doc- utils .
For documentation writers , Mallard is a full - featured XML markup language designed explicitly for topic - oriented help , with an easier learning curve than DocBook .
The Empathy help is the first GNOME documentation to be written in Mallard , and is also the first documentation to move to a Creative Commons Share - Alike 3.0 licence , which all GNOME documentation will be moving to in the future .
5.5 . GNOME Bluetooth Plugin support has been added and is available during device setup , adding support to GNOME applications to use Bluetooth devices .
Modern Bluetooth device selection widgets , including a button and chooser , have been added .
5.6 . Epiphany Web Browser With Epiphany 's change to WebKit , a number of enhancements are available for developers in Epiphany .
WebKitGTK + includes extremely fast Javascript processing , a smaller footprint , a GObject API and a built - in web inspector .
Epiphany also includes new support for Seed ( JavaScript ) extensions , and with this addition Python support has been removed .
Epiphany also uses libsoup for its HTTP implementation , and proxies now work the same way across GNOME .
Missing features in libsoup include HTTP cache and content encoding .
Lastly , the context menu in the web view is not customised for Epiphany yet , though the default WebKit view is used .
5.7 . Time Tracker Applet

Translating a software package as large as GNOME into a new language can be an overwhelming task for even the most dedicated translation team .
For this release a stellar effort has been done by the Bengali team , increasing the completeness of their translation by more than 25 points , passing the 80 % mark with 83 % of the user interface translated .
The Welsh , Breton and Serbian teams are also to be congratulated as they raised their translation status 10 points or more .
Detailed statistics and more information are available on GNOME 's translation status site .
7. Installing GNOME

BOSTON - A key state legislative committee gave a favorable recommendation Tuesday to a bill that would require drivers 75 and older who are renewing their license to pass tests to prove they can safely operate a vehicle .
The action comes after a spate of fatal accidents recently involving elderly drivers in Massachusetts .
" This is a starting point to bring the bill to the public and say , ' Hey , what do you think ? ' " said Rep. Donald F. Humason Jr. , D - Westfield , who is a member of the Committee on Transportation , which recommended the bill .
" Sadly , these bills only seem to gain a lot of attention after a tragedy .
Now we have to take some of the passion out the discussion and start to look dispassionately at the issue , " he said .
The bill would also let doctors and police officers report to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles if they believe a driver is unable to safely operate a car .
The operator 's license would then be suspended and reviewed by the registrar within 30 days , although drivers would have the right to appeal .
Critics say the tests should be given to all drivers , not just older drivers .
John W. Bennett , of Agawam , president of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council , said the bill is discriminatory because it singles out people 75 and older .
" We need something much broader than that for real highway safety , " Bennett said .
Bennett also questioned if the state would provide alternative transportation for elderly people who could lose their licenses .
Rep. Joseph F. Wagner , a Chicopee Democrat and the co-chairman of the Committee on Transportation , called the bill " an appropriate response " to the situation .
By 2025 , people over 65 will make up 25 percent of all drivers , according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
And accidents increase after a certain age , research shows .
According to the institute , during 2001 and 2002 , 60 - year - old women drivers were in three crashes per million miles traveled , while 80 - year - old women drivers were in seven crashes per million miles , and drivers 85 and older were in 13 crashes .
According to police , in June , in Stoughton , an 89 - year - old woman driver killed a 4 - year - old crossing the street .
Also in June , in Danvers , a 93 - year - old man drove his car into the entrance of a Wal - Mart , injuring six people , after mistaking the gas pedal for the brake .
The next day , in Plymouth , seven people were injured after a car driven by a 73 - year - old woman jumped a curb and ran into a crowd at a war memorial .
It was the woman 's third accident since turning 70 .

“ We know that people hesitate more when they lie and some companies already use this fact to see how long it takes people to tick boxes when filling in surveys online , ” he said .
So much for working 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree into the mix slowly .
Josh Morgan was informed Monday that Crabtree will be taking his place in the starting lineup opposite Isaac Bruce , according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat .
Morgan stuck around the 49ers facility during the team ’s bye week to help Crabtree assimilate into the offense .
Morgan leads San Francisco wideouts in receiving yards , yards per catch , and touchdowns .
( Well , touchdown to be precise .
He ’s the only 49er wide receiver to catch one . )
Mike Singletary did n’t confirm the move , but said it was a “ strong possibility ” that Crabtree would start , even though he ’s sensitive to how it will hinder Morgan ’s development and the message Crabtree ’s ascension sends to the rest of the team .
That message , loosely translated , is that it takes a week to make up for missing nearly the entire offseason , training camp , and five games if you are talented enough .
Or if you are getting paid enough .
The decision runs counter to all expectations and reports about what kind of immediate impact Crabtree could have .
The idea is to win games , though , and the move shows how confident the 49ers staff is in Crabtree ’s ability to help them now .
Crabtree has more pressure than ever to prove the 49ers right .
Robert Shiller defends financial innovation :
In defense of financial innovation , by Robert Shiller , Commentary , Financial Times : Many appear to think that the increasing complexity of financial products is the source of the world financial crisis .
In response to it , many argue that regulators should actively discourage complexity .
...
They do have a point .
Unnecessary complexity can be a problem ... if the complexity is used to obfuscate and deceive , or if people do not have good advice on how to use them properly .
...
But any effort to deal with these problems has to recognize that increased complexity offers potential rewards as well as risks .
New products must have an interface with consumers that is simple enough to make them comprehensible , so that they will want these products and use them correctly .
But the products themselves do not have to be simple .
The advance of civilization has brought immense new complexity to the devices we use every day .
...
People do not need to understand the complexity of these devices , which have been engineered to be simple to operate .
Financial markets have in some ways shared in this growth in complexity , with electronic databases and trading systems .
But the actual financial products have not advanced as much .
We are still mostly investing in plain vanilla products such as shares in corporations or ordinary nominal bonds , products that have not changed fundamentally in centuries .
Why have financial products remained mostly so simple ?
I believe the problem is trust .
...
People are ... worried about hazards of financial products or the integrity of those who offer them .
...
When people invest for their children ’s education or their retirement , they ... may not be able to rebound from mistaken purchases of faulty financial devices ...
Thus , to facilitate financial progress , we need regulators who ensure trust in sophisticated products .
...
They must ... be open to ... complex ideas ... that have the potential to improve public welfare .
Unfortunately , the crisis has sharply reduced trust in our financial system ... , people do not trust some good innovations that could protect them better .
... I have proposed ... “ continuous workout mortgages ” ...[ to ] protect against exigencies such as recessions or drops in home prices .
Had such mortgages been offered before this crisis , we would not have the rash of foreclosures .
Yet , even after the crisis , regulators seem to be assuming a plain vanilla mortgage is just what we need for the future .
...
Another innovation that is underused is retirement annuities ...
There are ... annuities that protect people against outliving their wealth , ... that protect against inflation , ... that protect against having problems in old age ... and generational annuities that exploit the possibilities of intergenerational risk sharing .
But most people do not make use of any of these .
Ideally , all of these protections for retirement income should be rolled into a unified product .
Such products are not generally available yet .
Certainly , people might be mistrustful of committing their life savings to such a complex new product at first even if it were available .
So , such products are not offered and people often do nothing to protect themselves against most of these risks .
Behind the creation of any such new retail products there needs to be an increasingly complex financial infrastructure ...
It is critical that we take the opportunity of the crisis to promote innovation - enhancing financial regulation and not let this be eclipsed by superficially popular issues .
...
Regulatory agencies need to be given a stronger mission of encouraging innovation .
...
Something has to assure people that these product are safe before they will purchase them .
We might have expected the market to regulate risk not so long ago , and trusted it to do so , but that seems like a bad bet now .
An " interface with consumers that is simple enough to make [ the products ] comprehensible " could build trust if people could believe that the person doing the simplifying had considered and understood every possible risk that is attached to the product , but did anybody really comprehend the big picture in our most recent crisis ?
If there were such people , there were n't very many of them , not enough to inspire confidence and trust more generally .
Another method of building confidence is ratings agencies , but they wo n't be trusted again any time soon .
Regulators that make the public confident that nothing can go wrong would help too , but building that kind of trust in regulators after what just happened is a tall order .
Private insurance of some sort is an option , but absent some sort of government guarantee , can private insurance companies be trusted with your life savings if there is a severe financial meltdown ?
People have even lost faith in government 's ability to insure people against medical and financial calamity in old age , so when it comes to providing financial insurance , government is not the solid , trusted institution it was not so long ago .
As you tick down the list of ways trust might be restored , you find one failure after another in terms of providing reliable information on the risks of particular financial products or strategies , and no matter what regulators or anyone else tries to do to rebuild the trust in financial institutions and products that has been lost , recent track records make it likely that this will be a long , drawn out process .
Given that forgetting about such risks over time seems to be an ingredient in the development of bubbles , I 'll let you decide whether that 's good or bad .
Intrauterine Cannibalism in Sharks
Sandtiger Shark ( Carcharias taurus )
Two forms of within - the - womb cannibalism are known in sharks .
The most extreme form of intrauterine cannibalism  in which the largest and strongest embryo actually consumes its lesser womb - mates  is termed " embryophagy " or , more colorfully , " adelphophagy "  literally " eating one 's brother " .
It was discovered accidentally in 1948 , when a researcher probing the uteri of a late - term Sandtiger Shark ( Carcharias taurus ) was startled by a bite on the hand .
To date , adelphophagy is known only in the Sandtiger .
The less extreme and by far more common form of intrauterine cannibalism  in which developing embryos feed on a steady supply of tiny , unfertilized eggs  is termed " oophagy " ( sometimes called " oviphagy " )  meaning " egg- eating " .
The earliest documented case of oophagy dates back to 1907 , in the Porbeagle ( Lamna nasus ) .
Both forms of intrauterine cannibalism continue throughout embryonic and fetal development , so that at birth each pups often has aa conspicuously swollen abdomen known as a " yolk stomach " .
Until quite recently , intrauterine cannibalism was thought to be restricted to lamnoid sharks .
This grisly form of within - the - womb nutrition is now known from two carcharhinoids and even one orectoloboid .
Following is a list of all sharks in which intrauterine cannibalism has been documented , or for which exists strong circumstantial evidence :
Order Orectolobiformes
Family Ginglymostomatidae
Tawny Nurse Shark ( Nebrius ferrigineus )

The number of people with dementia and Alzheimer 's disease is soaring around the world and will nearly double in the next 20 years , according to a report published today .
The report , by a team of researchers led by Professor Martin Prince of the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College London , says that by next year there will be 35 million people globally with dementia .
By 2030 , that will have risen to 65.7 million and the steep rise will continue to more than 115 million by 2050 .
The burden on those with the disease , on their carers and on society is immense , according to the report , which is published by Alzheimer 's Disease International ( ADI ) .
It calls on the World Health Organisation to make dementia a world health priority in the hope that this will spur countries to produce national plans for coping with the disease and encourage research into treatments .
The true scale of dementia around the world is hard to establish because many low - and middle - income countries do not keep good statistics .
The figure of 35 million is a revised estimate , and 10 % higher than that stated in a review in the Lancet medical journal in 2005 .
The proportion of older people affected has risen in three regions of the world – in south Asia ( up to 5.7 % from 3.4 % ) , Latin America ( up to 8.5 % from 7.3 % ) and western Europe ( up to 7.3 % from 5.9 % ) .
The biggest increase in future years is expected to be in low - and middle - income countries , as people start to live longer .
Prince emphasised the enormous indirect toll dementia can take on carers , who are often unpaid family members .
" Caring is a full - time job – an average of around eight hours per day for a relative with moderate to severe dementia , " he said .
" In all parts of the world , carers – who are most commonly female and the spouses or children of the persons with dementia – often experience high levels of strain .
" Studies reviewed in the new report suggest that half to three - quarters of carers have significant psychological illness , while up to a third have clinical depression . "
He said that given these statistics , " current investment in research , treatment and care is actually quite disproportionate to the overall impact of the disease " .
Marc Wortmann , ADI 's executive director , said much more could be done by governments to alleviate the burden of the disease on patients and their families .
" The crisis of dementia and Alzheimer 's can no longer be ignored .
Unchecked Alzheimer 's will impose enormous burdens on individuals , families , healthcare infrastructures and the global economy , " he said .
" There is hope yet , if action is taken now to fund improvements in dementia care services , and to increase investment in research . "
The Falkland Islands government has accused Argentina of waging a campaign of " economic warfare " against it .
Speaking on the 27th anniversary of the end of the Falklands war , Mike Summers , a member of the Falkland Islands legislative assembly , said Argentina is deliberately hampering the islands ' three main industries of fishing , tourism and oil and gas exploration .
He said the British overseas territory 's economic development is being held back by Argentinian policies aimed at forcing the islands to accept claims of Argentinian sovereignty .
The Falkland Islands , or Las Malvinas , as the archipelago is known in Argentina , has a population of around 3,000 people and an annual income of £ 75 m .
But the islands ' government believes the affluence of its inhabitants is being deliberately held back by Argentina .
Summers complained that Argentina has withdrawn from a commission to manage fisheries , which provide the bulk of the island 's income , which means fish stocks may be seriously damaged ; that Argentina has stopped charter planes travelling from Chile to the Falklands by banning them from using Argentinian airspace which has damaged the cruise ship industry ; and the hydrocarbon business has been hit by a presidential decree from Buenos Aires that prevents anyone who works in the hydrocarbon industry in Argentina from doing the same in the Falklands .
" We do n't have good relations , " Summers said .
" They are taking an economic warfare approach .
It has created tension between the Falklands and Argentina .
Economic development could be improved if we got on better .
While the clear stated intention of the Argentines is to take over the Falklands whether we like it or not , we can't cooperate better . "
The block on charter flights from Chile to the Falklands means cruise ship passengers and crew cannot easily reach the islands and this is hampering the ability of the islands to capitalise on the growing south Atlantic cruise ship business .
A spokesman for Argentina 's foreign ministry said the measures would remain in place until Britain agrees to resume talks over Argentina 's claim of sovereignty .
" We have taken these measures because we have to preserve our position and our resources in the region , " the spokesman said .
" We are not intending to harm the islanders . "
Uh-oh .
Now that a terrorist has tried unsuccessfully to blow up a Saudi prince with a bomb shoved up his ass , the TSA is obliged to perform rectal exams on every flier for the rest of time .
After all , once a jihadi failed to blow up a plane with his shoe , we all needed to start taking our shoes off .
Then some knuckleheads believed they could blow up a plane with energy beverages and hair gel , so now we have to limit ourselves to 100 ml of all liquids and gels , unless they 're for babies or are prescription ( because no mass - murderer would be so evil as to forge a doctor 's note , which , as every junkie knows , cannot possibly be forged ) .
Now we found someone who was made to believe he could kill people with an asshole bomb , and so it follows that the TSA will have to ban — or at least inspect — our assholes .
They 're like opinions , you know , everybody 's got one .
Except , of course , most of us got to keep our assholes to ourselves .
Not anymore .
Let 's just be thankful that no one has yet convinced a suicidal murderer that he could blow up a plane with his mind , because once that happens , we 're all in for mandatory airport trepannations .
Because , you know , you can't be too safe .
Every little bit helps .
If an unhinged suicide bomber believes it 's possible , we must take it seriously .
To do less would be irresponsible .
For years , I have made the joke about Richard Reid : " Just be glad that he was n't the underwear bomber . "
Now , sadly , we have an example of one .
Lewis Page , an " improvised - device disposal operator tasked in support of the UK mainland police from 2001 - 2004 , " pointed out that this is n't much of a threat for three reasons : 1 ) you can't stuff a lot of explosives into a body cavity , 2 ) detonation is , um , problematic , and 3 ) the human body can stifle an explosion pretty effectively ( think of someone throwing himself on a grenade to save his friends ) .
But who ever accused the TSA of being rational ?
Ass Bomber
Sometimes , missing school can be unavoidable .
There are many reasons a student can miss school , whether excused or unexcused .
If you are a concerned student or a parent who have found themselves in a situation whereby they will have to miss school for certain period of time , this article is for you .
Read more to find out the number of days you can miss school , the reasons you can miss school , and the consequences of missing school for a certain period of time .
How many days of school can you miss ?
The number of days you of school you can miss will depend on the school and the state you live in .
For instance , in California , you can miss 10 days of school with excuse .
Excuse here means a funeral with literature from the event , a doctor ’s appointment with note , or a sick day for the student with a note from a parent .
Excuse does n’t mean the student ’s dad ’s car broke down and he or she could n’t make it to school .
Excuse here is a legal term .
After being absent for ten days , your school starts to get concerned .
There is not certain number of days you miss and actually get into trouble .
However , if you do n’t go to school for 40 days and you are a senior , you will not graduate .
If a poor student has many absences , the school administration will be more concerned that if it were an A student missing school .
Either way , though , the district will be concerned .
Keeping the admin in the know can prevent problems , but those pesky letters wo n’t stop .
If a student does n’t go to school and goes on a vacation , the reason is not an excuse , but if you notify the school , your teachers can give you homework and also keep you updated .
The school personnel are aware that things happen , so that will not let you get into any trouble .
However , if you have been absent for about 13 days , whether excused or unexcused , you will begin to get truancy letters from the school .
These letters are automated letter sent from the software .
The number of students that show up determine the school ’s pay and they are audited every year , so if you are marked as being absent with excuse , a note has to come with it so that they can get paid .
The school loses money for each excused absence , hence their strictness .
Your excuse absence and that of others can add up and your school will never have enough money .
Why Going To School Regularly Is Important
Going to school regularly is the single most essential part of your education .
You will learn a lot of new things at school every day .
Attending regularly and participating in school activities will help you develop :
important skills and knowledge that will help you learn
Emotional and social skills such as resilience , good communication , and team work .
People who go to school every day and complete 12 years will have :
Better job opportunities
better health
Higher income throughout their lives .
There is actually no “ good ” number of days to miss school .
For each day you do n’t go to school , you lag behind .
How Many Days Of School A Child Can Miss In Middle School
Most parents usually find it difficult getting their child to school on time every day , and if you are like these parents , you may be worried about how many days your child can miss school .
You may even find out that your child has been skipping classes for some days , or maybe you are planning a vacation or you have a family wedding or burial to attend .
Whatever the issues is , here is everything you need to know about missing school in middle school .
About missing school in middle school , you will have to check with the kid ’s school and / or the education code of the state you live in to find out the number of absences from school they allow in a school year .
While the school may not have a certain number of limit on excused absence from school , it is likely that the school will have a number of unexcused absence allowed .
In the state ’s education code , the state will set the number of unexcused absences they allow in a school year .
Typically , for government owned schools , the number of absences without excuses they can allow before they issue a penalty are three to five .
For instance , in California , the education code of the state states that if a student misses school for 3 full days in a year without a valid reason , that child will be classified a truant .
The child will be reported to the attendance supervisor or district supervisor .
Valid reasons include , but are not limited to the situations set out in the states education code as an absence with excuse .
What the state considers as an excused absence allows the school administrators some discretion that is based on the circumstance of the student .
In California , a tardy student , who is absent for over a 30 - minute period on a school day three times in the school year may be classified a truant .
However , in Georgia , if a student has five or more absences without excuse , that student is considered a truant .
Just like in California , Georgia also allows the school administrators to consider tardiness and period absences , such as a student skipping some classes as an unexcused absence .
Why Is School Attendance So Important ?
Data shows that skipping school has a negative effect on students ’ academic performance .
The more classes and / or school days you miss , the more likely it is that you will lag behind academically .
The consequences of Truancy are even bigger .
Strategies for Youth , a nonprofit organization , says that truant youths usually have emotional issues , which include low self - esteem , and most of them face social isolation .
Truant youths are also usually easily pressured by peers to engage in certain types of behaviours that prevent them from being successful in life .
Truancy is one of the predictors of teen substance abuse , teen pregnancy , and the child dropping out of school .
Children below twelve years old who are truants are very likely to become involved in criminal activities .
What To Do If Your Child Ca n’t Make It To School
If your child would n’t be able to make it to school that day , call the school and let them know immediately .
Explain to them why your child ca n’t make it to school .
Every school will have a way this is done .
It may be by email or phone call .
If you fail to call the school , the school will contact you that day to make sure their student is fine .
The school may also call the people on your emergency contact list .
Let the school know if your child needs to take some time off or a long period off .
The school might have flexible notions to make sure your child does not fall behind .
Examples Of Situation That May Keep Your Child From Going To School
1. Sickness
Your child does not have to go to school if he or she is sick .
It is important that that child is only absent on the days that he or she is really sick .
The school might give them some home work so that they wo n’t lag behind .
2. Medical appointment
You should make medical appointments during holidays , before , or after school periods .
If you cannot do this , let your child ’s school know before the appointment .
3. Family holidays
You should take family vacations during school holidays and not when the school is in their term time .
The school will decide it your child can miss any school day for the holiday .
They might also give the student some work to do so that they can learn what their mates are leading .
If the school does n’t not approve and you decide to go , the school might send you a warning or ask you to pay a fine .
4 . A death in the family
If there is a death in the family and your child needs to be away from school , let the child ’s school know and let them know how long your child will be away .
Your child ’s school can offer counselling and help monitor your child ’s wellbeing when they resume .
5. Truancy
Truancy is when a child misses school without his or her parents knowing or giving permission .
The child ’s school can help improve their attendance at school .
How To Improve Your Child ’s Attendance At School
Find time to talk to your child about school and it ’s importance .
Ask the child how he or she feels about going to school , what he or she likes about school , and if they are facing any problems at school .
Do not reward bad behaviour .
For example , if they chose not to go to school , deprive them of their access to their phones , iPads , or the internet .
Encourage them to take on hobbies that they enjoy such as games , sports , and clubs .
Taking on hobbies will help your child develop positive relationships outside the school .
Set a time for their home works and time to go to bed .
Make sure all their gadgets are not in their bedroom .
Ensure their school bag is packed the night before .
The bag should contain everything they need .
Let them travel to school with a friend .

Pros And Cons Of Child Labor
Bowing his head outside the Georgia Capitol on Tuesday , Gov. Sonny Perdue cut a newly repentant figure as he publicly prayed for rain to end the region ’s historic drought .
“ Oh father , we acknowledge our wastefulness , ” Perdue said .
“ But we ’re doing better .
And I thought it was time to acknowledge that to the creator , the provider of water and land , and to tell him that we will do better . ”
Hundreds of Georgians -- ministers and lawmakers , landscapers and office workers -- gathered in downtown Atlanta for the prayer vigil .
Some held bibles and crucifixes .
Many swayed and linked arms as a choir sang “ What a Mighty God We Serve ” and “ Amazing Grace . ”
As Perdue described it , “ We have come together , very simply , for one reason and one reason only :
To very reverently and respectfully pray up a storm . ”

“ It ’s got to be worth a shot , ” said David Mais , 34 , an Atlanta resident who is worried his carpet cleaning business could suffer from the drought .
“ I do think we need to do a lot more , but hopefully prayer will unite us . ”
As metropolitan Atlanta ’s water supplies drain to record lows , many across the Southeast have criticized Perdue and other Georgia officials for failing to introduce more stringent conservation measures .
Perdue , who wore a green suit and brown cowboy boots , seemed to acknowledge that the drought afflicting Georgia was a man-made , as well as natural , problem .
Georgians , he said , had not done “ all we could do in conservation . ”
While many hoped that a miracle could end the drought , repentance was a recurring theme .

“ We ’ve been so busy industrializing that we ’ve forgotten how to spiritualize , ” Gil Watson , senior minister at Northside United Methodist Church in Atlanta , told the crowd .
“ We ’ve been so busy with our economy and what we can have and what we can possess that we ’ve forgotten that you possess it all .
Great God , this is your land .
We till it for you .
We are entrepreneurs for you , dear God . ”
Gary Tacon , a businessman who had traveled from New York for the prayer vigil to promote a product called the Wataire Atmospheric Water Generator , was moved .
His product creates pure , filtered drinking water from moisture in the air .
“ The governor sounded good , ” he said , pausing briefly from handing out leaflets to congregation members .
“ I do n’t put a lot of store in prayer , but if it helps to unify , that ’s great .
People need to be informed . ”
More than a few people who attended seemed skeptical that prayer would end the drought .

Lance Warner , 22 , a history student at Georgia State University , smirked as members of the crowd stretched their arms to the heavens and cried “ Amen ! ” and “ Hallelujah ! ”
“ You could n’t make this up , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t make up for years of water mismanagement with a prayer session .
It ’s lunacy ! ”
About a block way , more than 20 protesters -- some carrying placards saying “ All hail Sonny Perdue ” and “ Is it raining yet ? ” -- joined a rally organized by the Atlanta Freethought Society .
The vigil , they said , violated the principle of separation of church and state .
“ The governor is exceeding his constitutional authority , ” said Ed Buckner , an atheist and treasurer of the group .
“ He has no right to set up prayer services on behalf of the people of Georgia , particularly not on the grounds of the state Capitol . ”

As the state ’s drought has intensified , Perdue , a Baptist , has repeatedly urged Georgians to pray for rain .
In June , he prayed for rain in Macon as part of the Georgia Farm Bureau ’s day of prayer for agriculture .
Perdue is not the first Georgia governor to pray for an end to drought .
In 1986 , Gov. Joe Frank Harris joined hundreds of worshipers at Roswell Street Baptist Church in Marietta to pray for rain .
More than 20 years later , however , a significant number of Georgians appear to be uncomfortable with such prayers .
Throughout the day , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution ’s blog filled with recriminations from readers who said Perdue should plan , rather than pray .
“ God is not an ATM machine you can go to and get whatever you need whenever you ask for it , ” said one reader .
“ Stop developing , seed the clouds , think of some other useful solution . ”
Another said : “ I ’m praying for a new GOVERNOR !!!!! ”

Gil Rogers , an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center , said he worried that hoping for miracles could detract from more practical efforts to conserve water .
“ We should n’t look at it as ‘ Once the rains come we ’ll be fine , ’ ” he said .
“ We ’d all like to see rain , but this does n’t get us any closer to sustaining water management in Georgia . ”
But Rogers could find one point of agreement with Perdue .
“ If he ’s saying that Georgians are wasteful , we certainly agree , ” he said .
“ I hope he is truly sorry we ’ve been so wasteful .
. . .
If you look at the way Georgia is growing -- paving over 50 acres a day in the Atlanta area , choking out streams and cutting down forests , we ’ve got a long way to go . ”

So tonight I was walking my dog and thinking about what I should blog about this week because most of the posts in my draft folder are kinda half - written and do n’t really have an ending and I was thinking that maybe I should throw myself in front of a car because that would at least give me something to write about and then I thought “ Wow .
There ’s something really wrong with me .
Maybe I need more meds ” , but then I did n’t even have to maim myself because
I FOUND A MUSHROOM SHAPED LIKE A BOOB .
Fucking for real , y’all .
It ’s like God was all “ Damn , what ’s with the deathwish , bitch ?
I already gave you rheumatoid arthritis .
That ’s not enough for you ?
So selfish . ”
And then He ’s all “ You know what ?
Fine .
Just throw yourself in front of a car .
I ’m out , dumbass . ”
But then
He remembered my granny who is awesome and God-fearing and prays for me all the time and He probably sighed all grudgingly , like “ Damn it .
I totally owe Granny .
Fine .
I ’ll give you this one . ”
Then , BAM !
Boobie mushroom .
And now I do n’t even have to throw myself in front of a car .
In fact , I think I could probably never post again and this blog would still considered successful just on the merit of this one boob God left on my lawn .
PS .
I took like 18 photos of the boobie mushroom and the whole time my neighbor was giving me this look like “ The fuck ? ” and so I started also taking pictures of my kid and the mailbox and random shit to throw him off because I did n’t want him to notice the boobie mushroom because I was afraid he might have a blog too and post about it first .
So yeah … I do think there ’s probably something wrong with me .
I mean , my neighbor does n’t even speak English so even if he does have a blog we probably have a different audience .
There could be some cross -over with my bilingual readers though so I do n’t think I ’m completely overreacting .
PPS .
You know what ?
Fuck him .
His granny did n’t go to church every Sunday for 70 years so her granddaughter could find this boobie mushroom .
I am totally going out to smash it right now so he ca n’t put it on his blog , which may or may not exist .
PPPS .
Okay , I did n’t do it .
Partially because it felt wrong to destroy a boobie mushroom that God made .
And also because when I was little I heard that if you squash mushrooms , fairies will attack you .
Mostly that second one .
I ’ve probably revealed too much about myself here but you know what ?
Does n’t even matter : Magical .boobie. mushroom .
It ’s kind of so awesome I could write anything here and no one would even notice .
It ’s like peeing behind the Pope .
Most of the people there are too into the Pope to notice and if they do notice it ’s probably because they were n’t paying enough attention to the Pope .
It ’s like a Pope test .
If you ’re distracted by a little urine you lose your turn with the Pope and have to go to the back of the line .
If I was the Pope I ’d have someone peeing behind me all the time .
That would be awesome .
PPPPS .
This may be my last post ever because where do you go from here ?
I ’m totally like Eva Peron right before she got cancer .
Comment of the day :
You should totally throw a thin white t- shirt over it and water it .
Oh , wait , I forgot .
I ’m a lady .
Do n’t do that .
That ’s offensive .

It was nine years ago that University of Maryland School of Medicine researchers discovered that a mysterious human protein called zonulin played a critical role in celiac disease and other autoimmune disorders , such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes .
Now , scientists have solved the mystery of zonulin 's identity , putting a face to the name , in a sense .
Scientists led by Alessio Fasano , M.D. , have identified zonulin as a molecule in the human body called haptoglobin 2 precursor .
Pinpointing the precise molecule that makes up the mysterious protein will enable a more detailed and thorough study of zonulin and its relationship to a series of inflammatory disorders .
The discovery was reported in a new study by Dr. Fasano , published the week of September 7 , 2009 in the online version of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Dr. Fasano is a professor of pediatrics , medicine and physiology and director of the Mucosal Biology Research Center and the Center for Celiac Research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine .
Haptoglobin is a molecule that has been known to scientists for many years .
It was identified as a marker of inflammation in the body .
Haptoglobin 1 is the original form of the haptoglobin molecule , and scientists believe it evolved 800 million years ago .
Haptoglobin 2 is a permutation found only in humans .
It 's believed the mutation occurred in India about 2 million years ago , spreading gradually among increasing numbers of people throughout the world .
Dr. Fasano's study revealed that zonulin is the precursor molecule for haptoglobin 2 — that is , it is an immature molecule that matures into haptoglobin 2 .
It was previously believed that such precursor molecules served no purpose in the body other than to mature into the molecules they were destined to become .
But Dr. Fasano's study identifies precursor haptoglobin 2 as the first precursor molecule that serves another function entirely — opening a gateway in the gut , or intestines , to let gluten in .
People with celiac disease suffer from a sensitivity to gluten .
" While apes , monkeys and chimpanzees do not have haptoglobin 2 , 80 percent of human beings have it , " says Dr. Fasano .
" Apes , monkeys and chimpanzees rarely develop autoimmune disorders .
Human beings suffer from more than 70 different kinds of such conditions .
We believe the presence of this pre-haptoglobin 2 is responsible for this difference between species . "
" This molecule could be a critical missing piece of the puzzle to lead to a treatment for celiac disease , other autoimmune disorders and allergies and even cancer , all of which are related to an exaggerated production of zonulin / pre-haptoglobin 2 and to the loss of the protective barrier of cells lining the gut and other areas of the body , like the blood brain barrier , " says Dr. Fasano .
" The only current treatment for celiac disease is cutting gluten from the diet , but we have confidence Dr. Fasano 's work will someday bring further relief to these patients .
Zonulin , with its functions in health and disease as outlined in Dr. Fasano 's paper , could be the molecule of the century , " says E. Albert Reece , M.D. , Ph.D. , M.B.A. , dean of the School of Medicine , vice president for medical affairs of the University of Maryland and John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor .
Dr. Fasano , as a physician scientist , fulfills two of the core missions of the University of Maryland School of Medicine : making basic science discoveries that can impact human health , and finding ways to translate those discoveries into treatments and diagnostic tools . "
People who suffer from celiac disease have a sensitivity to gluten , a protein found in wheat , and suffer gastrointestinal distress and other serious symptoms when they eat it .
In celiac patients , gluten generates an exaggerated release of zonulin that makes the gut more permeable to large molecules , including gluten .
The permeable gut allows these molecules , such as gluten , access to the rest of the body .
This triggers an autoimmune response in which a celiac patient 's immune system identifies gluten as an intruder and responds with an attack targeting the intestine instead of the intruder .
An inappropriately high level of production of zonulin also seems responsible for the passage through the intestine of intruders other than zonulin , including those related to conditions such as diabetes , multiple sclerosis and even allergies .
Recently , other groups have reported elevated production of zonulin affecting the permeability of the blood brain barrier of patients suffering from brain cancer .
" We hope pre-haptoglobin 2 will be a door to a better understanding of not just celiac disease , but of several other devastating conditions that continue to affect the quality of life of millions of individuals , " says Dr. Fasano .
" This is quite a remarkable molecule that was just flying under the radar .
We would have never have thought it would be the key .
Now that we have identified this molecule , we are able to replicate it in the lab to use for research purposes .
We hope to learn much more about it and its potential for treating and diagnosing celiac disease and other autoimmune conditions .
This molecule has opened innumerable doors for our research . "
OS / Forth
OS / 4th
The Complete Operating System .
" Microsoft - Breakfast of Champions "
Presented by : Christopher Passauer
You hold the tools and future in your hands ... so ... succeed !
The tenet : Forth when used to implement , and be , an Operating System can displace all other current offerings of ( Microsoft , OS / 2 , UNIX based ) operating systems on the PC single user desktop platform , and farther .
Statement
This paper presents the concept , history , direction and foundation to make Forth the next PC platform operating system to come into wide scale use .
It is fully realized that some may have trouble grasping such a lofty concept , but , to dispel that parallax view is the exact purpose of this writ .
I will include as little connotation and equivocation as possible .
Through the words presented within , the concept no longer is lofty , but instead at hand .
Preface
During the hearings held in Washington , D.C. during the first weeks of March this year ( 98 ) , Bill Gates stated , as part of his position on including Explorer in all OS offerings , that " Microsoft is rewriting all its ' application offerings to use an advanced HTML interface and no longer the current windows based system . "
This tells us simply that , and by looking at the advances in web browser / viewer technology , everything will be HTML based .
Simply examine X - Windows on top of UNIX and derivative platforms .
This document is in a form of HTML just as all word processor documents are and have been , remember ' ^B ' and the like under WordStar .
Even a text file is ' marked - up ' with simple CR / LF and Tab characters , basically , format .
Forth is , by definition of its ' nature in execution , the perfect string processing language creation tool yet .
What is HTML but a simple grouping of text with visual display markers and graphical object pointers contained within a document .
A Forth generated application could literally execute an HTML document , unlike the process used in HTML browsers and the Forth derived PostScript language .
Did anybody ever tell you PostScript was originally slated to be what HTML has become , a textual , graphics and format language for all output devices , that 's right , for the video monitor also .
At the time it was just too cumbersome to generate so much output given the severe limitations on working storage .
Apple Computers having a fast graphics display ability on the newly introduced MacIntosh needed some way to get that to a print device and chose PostScript as the output language of choice .
Thus in their regular open system manner provided print device vendors universal method to connect with their new graphical system .
Point I Convey
This document will at most times be in conversational mode - until it becomes truly technical by revision , your revision .
Given the short time available for this effort a dissertation format is not followed here , or great effort towards literary style , we do write one way and speak another , thus direction is towards sharing of concept and not the mechanics of writing .
Sections in this Version ( that follow )
Audience
This document is written at the level of persons with an experienced software and hardware background .
This effort in no way addresses the uninitiated .
No spoon feeding here .
Concepts and information presented here in are from one perspective and associated resources , there can be many in both , alignment and quality of content will occur with substantiative peer and participant review cycles .
Document Direction
It is understood and directed that this , to become a working document , will become more and more technical , with that , many sections will eventually be edited out .
It should be noted that the best document editing , including for this section , should be done by striking - out and not by actual deletion .
This allows the history of change to be noted and roll - back to occur in need .
It should also be noted that a statement of intent be included with all material changes so that no one need figure out something that should be obvious , and hidden agendas are eliminated .
The Authors ( not so carefully worded ) Forward
It is rare that I write a document that contains my direct and personal views on things , I normally write in a presentation format from a technical , executive or investment perspective .
I do fully express my opinions and views here in , but in constructive criticism format as possible .
Those of you that know me or of me will no doubt see my forward and righteous manners rear in the words trailing off before you .
Yes !
I unleash my heart felt passion of the subject as guide .
I do not place my ego or vanity in this so that the true artistic nature of my heart and logic may speak , and I hope through revision yours also .
If you find I move across multiple subjects yet bind them together , surprise , it 's the way I think .
I feel now , after others have shown me , that I have three gifts : 1 ) I am able to see , and continue to see , the big picture even while concentrating on the smallest detail .
2 ) I inspire others to think differently , be challenged and then act .
3 ) I naturally think in a totally abstract , yet logical , manner .
I do rely on my intuition .
Hey , spelling errors are inherent , expect some , however , I respect and accept all input as to format , spelling and content .
Your input is not only accepted but expected , speak up please , or do n't complain later .
That 's right get involved or Bite - It .
And expect that I will not let this go the way of committees , the warm - n - fuzzys , or anything similar .
Why ?
Because OS / Forth accommodates anything , truly , just as its ' parent Forth does , as Chuck intended .
So remember extensions are a fact and a design premise , not required in the heart of it .
Chuck took time and great pains to allow me my freedom of thought without rebuke , all the while instilling in me the beauty of minimalism , may you find that beauty in the concepts here .
Premise for the Design
Let 's face it , there are a large number of people in the world today that resent being forced to use an 85 % functional solution called Windows .
I admit I am one .
I will say that Windows has its ' place ( just like UNIX , OS - 9 and even MacIntosh , Sun , or Silicon Graphics does ) but to the exclusion of all else - I object .
I will cover many of these points in more depth later on , perhaps scattered , so bare with me .
On the television program Uncommon Knowledge , # 207 , created by the Stanford Hoover Institute and produced by KTEH channel 54 PBS Station San Jose , hosted by Hoover Institute Fellow Peter Robinson , points out that the Monopoly called Microsoft sells 90 % + of all operating systems world wide and 80 % + of all desktop operating systems .
The cost to the manufacturer for those operating systems has risen , not decreased , from ~ $ 4.00 per to over $ 50.00 per .
The manufacturers do not give a component cost breakout so the increases are hidden from the consumer .
My father , Buzz , a new friend of mine , stated to me , and I had to laugh - at myself - because it was absolutely true , 'every software manufacturer out there today wants a new operating system because it helps them do nothing more than generate more revenue - it 's another opportunity to them . '
This points out that most software vendors will create versions of existing software applications for any new Operating System that catches on .
I ask you - would they convert software over if was really easy to do so ?
Software vendors can not thrive unless you continue to purchase something from them .
If they create the perfect program they would go out of business after the initial sales were over , thus their continued program of bugs and improvements .
Microsoft almost seems to have invented the strategy , 85 % completed , so purchase the next release for only $ 69.95 and so forth .
It is interesting to note that TurboPascal and most all versions of MS - DOS sold generally at $ 69.95 , seems to be the magic figure for painless sales .
Today most CD based games sell for within a few dollars of this amount and sales are brisk .
I fully believe that if this new operating system is to be offered for free - it will fail and we will all lose .
Forth in general , even today , is still looked upon as Hobby Time , and even treated as such by most of you whom will read this document .
I implore you with all that sings out from your creativity to stop playing and get really , really serious .
Professional software is not free , when it is it gains and holds no real respect in the world market .
Free will not help us all retire .
$ 69.95 a copy can and will .
Lots of people , read firms , have made a reasonable living offering Forth products , but with on going difficulty because of FREE .
Let us all drive forward into the future together and make Forth pay us , we have paid into it long enough , we have supported it too long as members of our own non-profit organization , we have cuddled , petted , cherished and loved it all too long , now lets reap the rewards of all Forth has to offer from what we have made it .
Look how much Bill Gates has made with Microsoft , even 1/10 of 1 % of that would set us all up beyond our wildest expectations .
IT CAN BE DONE - LETS DO IT !
We need one solid Operating System core to build upon , not twenty different ones , we must be of one mindset , with all the personally derived extensions one wishes to create , or can imagine , to follow .
The Concept " Operating System "
Simply stated an operating system is " an interface between some hardware , an application program and a user . "
It 's interesting that back in the day , when CP / M was the common operating system , I could load and run an application on any system vendors offering , while every vendors offering was a completely different hardware configuration , even disk format , except , for the processor and Operating System .
As an applications creator I had to generate no extra code to accomplish this .
I could query the display device to determine if it could perform graphics and / or color .
Simple .
All the display routines worked regardless .
The hardest part was to copy my application code to the appropriate format diskette the customers hardware required , this really was never a big issue .
In reality all applications , especially under Windows anything , is nothing more than an extension to the operating system .
With the exception of communications programs , and a few utilities , no application ever connects directly with either the hardware or the user devices .
Bill Gates maneuvered all applications programmers into having reliance on the operating system to such an extent , in the form of DLLs - also know as code you do not have to create we provide you - that Windows became entrenched .
All of us have seen graphics panel based programs that run fine under DOS with no Operating System extensions , and almost every one is smaller than its '
Windows counterpart , and easier to write I will say .
During the CP / M days MS - DOS was in wide usage in Europe , and unlike CP / M running in under 2KB , required 48 KB memory for the Operating System and all the resident utility code , leaving only 16 KB for applications .
The CP / M approach of " load only what you need at the time " was disparate in the MS - DOS memory pig world .
Already the writing was on the wall about poor code design resulting in using lots of memory .
Microsoft operating systems designs have continued this glutinous trail right to the present where unimaginable amounts of memory and storage are in use today for even simple applications .
Remember MP / M and Cromix , four users running just fine on a 4MHz Z - 80 with 48 KB of bank switched memory each .
CP /M - 86 , aka Concurrent
Dos or CDOS , came out for the PC platform just as Clone Turbo PCs were unveiled , a single user version of MP/M , I still have a copy , which allowed you to run four things at once and hot switch between them , two years before windows existed .
Interesting that CP / M always accessed disk faster than MS - DOS .
Until Windows NT
Microsoft products did not really do true multi-tasking , event driven background tasks just do not qualify .
Why did it take Microsoft ten years to catch up to the technology Digital Research was using , still not being as fast or compact even yet ?
Just for clarification :
Tasks are user or application initiated , while processes are O.S. initiated .
When Novell introduced their first version of Netware , version 1.01a on about thirty 5.25 " diskettes , I installed it on a 6 MHz true AT with 640 KB memory .
That network server with 10 MHz Ethernet interface cards could get data to my PC - AT workstation faster than I could load it off the local hard disk , while supporting seventeen users , nine doing accounting functions .
These are our roots .
Imagine that same operating system on a 300 + MHz Pentium .
This does point out a special thing I am trying to get you to notice - that all processors are I /O bound , and that more code does not mean better .
All Microsoft did was use the extra processor time to draw pretty panels , until the panels became so complex that the processor became the bottle neck , so they revised it and called it Windows 3.0 , newly rewritten in 16 - bit code .
It was the newest innovation for non-Mac users , and so it took off as everybody wanted the new interface toy .
Now where would we be if I did not bring mainframes and minicomputers into the picture ?
Lets cover UNIX and similar operating systems first .
In 1980 when the new UNIX was just being turned out for nothing or close to that to the universities , the new IBM PC came with only 64 KB of memory and a cassette port , the Apple II + was a big hit in educational circles , up popped a little operating system called Qunix , which Bell Labs later insisted was named too close , and thus QNX .
When first released this Operating System was multi-tasking with all the standard directory capabilities , networking and device driver shuffling of its ' big brother , however , it did not suffer from disk partitions at that time .
It did lack a " C " compiler at that point , which slowed its ' introduction for about a year .
Unfortunately the two partners residing in Canada decided to screw the one in the U.S. and shut down the operation just as it was taking off , right after two Americans wrote the " C " compiler for it - investing and losing everything they had , it has never regained any real market share since .
Today QNX in used embedded .
We hit 1981 - 83 .
At this time , also , several Motorola 68000 based Bell Labs licensed UNIX machines came out like C.C.C. and the Venture Systems single user unit for accounting .
CP /M - 86 and MP /M - 86 were just introduced about this time , just before Godbout started sinking , Digital Research had just laid off about seventy percent of its ' staff , about eleven hundred people , a tragic dead end , cast so into the dirt .
SCO introduced Xenix running on a custom box , and at that time it was a screamer .
Banyan , 3 - COM and others joined the network market with dedicated servers running proprietary multi-tasking operating systems .
HP. , DEC , Wang , Perkin Elmer and Sperry / Univac all had proprietary operating systems that will not be talked about , all had their place .
So where are we now ?
Well , we have Sun Solaris , the HP .
9000 flavor , Linux , Bell Labs UNIX versions on various platforms like UniSys and Silicon Graphics , and even Amdahl 's version .
So you are now saying ' what 's so wrong with UNIX '?
Well let 's see , besides its ' cryptic naming conventions , file oriented everything , lousy disk partioning with slow access , impossible utilities , the ability to create circular directory paths , the carry over of its ' original design of being an Operating System for multiple people on terminals , perhaps nothing .
It has a place , just not on my desktop .
It should interest you to know that most UNIX based engineering software vendors have been converting everything over to NT .
The great following for Linux points out the fact that people want something other than what is available .
Note that Linux is successful because it is not completely free .
Just try to download enough Linux stuff with directions to boot and install it , good luck , not a task for the feint of heart .
Linux was written largely by UNIX oriented people whom wanted something else or newer , and also saw that existing and low cost equipment could be leveraged .
This effort , however , is to be admired .
I must talk of the Burroughs Medium Systems Operating System called MCP ( Master Control Program ) , the main writer of which implemented the Operating System for the HP .
1000 and 2000 series and its ' derivative is still in use today on HP .
9000 series machines .
The MCP runs in 100 KD ( kilo digits , nibbles ) or 50 KB of memory .
The concept and execution here is pure beauty .
The MCP and the machine are very tight in operation .
The medium series , 4700 , 4800 , 4900 , V , mainframes were , in essence , state machines with just enough operating system to invoke task switches and deal with the operator , funny Intel processors run in protected mode almost the same way .
The MCP did not directly swap code to disk , sort files or interact with IOPs ( Input Output Processors ) or DLPs ( Data Link Processors ) .
By the way , there are almost 400 commands available to the operator .
Lets look at this a little deeper .
This is a little bit hard based on the fact that the 4000 series Burroughs was designed for a specific purpose - record processing .
This specific machine was , and to quite an extent is , the mainstay of the banking world and the military back office accounting operations .
Though dated , this line of machines designed in the early sixties , is very functional through an ongoing maintenance and upgrade program .
The CPU runs at a blinding 8 MHz , with a possible 4000 KD memory , yeah 2,000 KB , and is able to process up to 60 jobs at once .
A miracle ?
No , just good engineering .
The machine can move a sustained 60 MB per second across its ' main buss , yes , it 's a 64 bit machine with parity for a total of 72 bits on the buss .
Can a Pentium do that , even close ?
Imagine seeing 16 GCR 200 MB 12 inch tapes spinning , 30 or 40 jobs active in the mix accessing 80 GB of diskpack and head - per - track drives , and four 2000 line per minute chain printers loaded with 132 column green - bar , all running full tilt , connected to this one machine .
RESPECT !
At 8 Mhz .
Here is the real trick to this - when an application , with a task clock running against it , does any access of any kind a task switch occurs while that access request is performed .
The CPU turns control over to the MCP which then switches to the next application and its ' last point of execution .
Processing continues for the application when the access request is completed .
Ahh , you see the ghost in the machine , the DLP .
When a program executes say for instance an ' Open File ' statement , that instruction is literally passed to the DLP to be executed , a program branch to MCP occurs , and another process takes over until the DLP is done .
A disk , printer or tape controller is a DLP , one of many , each with a 4MHz 8080a and dual port RAM on board .
If the clock runs out the task switch is forced .
By the way the hardware has a sort intrinsic done by the DLP , and no accumulator , calculations are done in program memory .
An DLP is very much like modern co-processor interface cards of today , like the Intel Ethernet LAN cards , each which has an 805286 at 10 MHz , handling most all aspects of LAN communications of either 10 or 100 MHz .
SCSI is another example , a block mode device setup , multiple master capability as a tape drive can backup a storage device with no host interaction , that normally uses the likes of an 80186 embedded .
Even the keyboard interface is an embedded processor on the motherboard communicating over a serial LAN to an embedded processor in the keyboard , both usually 8048s .
If you watch a statistics screen on a server for a time you will find that eighty percent of overhead is dealing with the LAN , unless you have a smart LAN card , almost all are today by employing a 10 MHz 80186 co-processor doing the overhead .
An IDE port is a simple parallel port , the embedded controller on the disk drive itself doing the interface .
If we view these smart devices in a little different way , then we can start to really use them better , and the OS benefits greatly , leveraged multi-processing , code size reduction and I/O bandwidth improvement .
One unique feature of the medium systems , that IBM still may need to figure out , is that when a job finishes its ' memory is released and all the jobs below it ( address 0 is at the top on this machine ) are rolled out to disk and back in to fill the gap .
No checker - board memory .
All done through hardware , and embedded processors .
I helped a friend develop the method of doing this under program control .
We went through the MCP source listing and found the instruction that does the roll out , and thus I introduced COBOL to the concept of heap , that can be resized during run time .
COBOL has the need to have all data space predefined and sized at compile time , imagine being able to examine the data and then get only the needed amount of memory , never the always - the - maximum scenario .
One of these machines with an SRI supplied HP .
1000 Front - end can support over 1,000 TDI ( Terminal Data Interface ) serial loop , block mode transfer terminal users across local and single - point or multi drop analog or digital lease lines .
Remember all data to this machine is a record .
Is n't all data on any machine ?
A byte or a thousand bytes , is there really any difference ?
Still just a record , yes ?
Since I have used all the various types of operating systems I can draw parallels between them .
Most of you have also , so you will see what I am describing .
On a PC running DOS or CP / M you interact with a single process on the display , the same for UNIX with no graphics interface .
The fact that things , such as daemons , are running in the background does not fully constitute a multi- tasking environment .
A good example of this is a mouse driver , its ' running , scanning a port and feeding information to an application , as an extension to the Operating System , but it has no user interface .
On a main frame you never interact with a process directly , you instead are always viewing a systems log on the display and issuing commands to guide those processes , everything is running in a batch mode .
What a windowed or multiple view environment provides is the ability to interact with running processes , see simultaneous updates .
Humans are serial in action .
Yet in all this we can , and do , only really deal with one process at a time , either by inference or bringing it to the foreground .
I believe that every process should have a display that can be viewed by the user , no blind daemons or drivers or other processes , but you do not have to view .
The fact that processes can be made to display provides the ability to interact , which provides the ability to stop or realign runaway or undesired situations .
As you can see from all this , in its ' many forms , operating systems are implemented in many yet very similar ways , always for the same purpose , always to solve the same problems .
All are oriented to servicing one , or multiple , users , or tasks , interacting with one , or more , applications and / or storage and / or communications devices .
I believe that I can state without rebuke that portability is not even a question .
What program or application since the beginning of the industry has been moved to a different processor or operating system without serious modification ?
I can't think of one .
So I state that the term portability not be used while the operating system resides on one processor platform .
With some careful planning and much research OS / Forth could be designed to have continuity with the application program interface , much like COBOL , allowing a recompile on the new processor in order to port an application .
Perhaps this is acceptable based on current processor speeds .
But , I will mention what is known , that to gain real performance processor specific code must be written , and thus , the application is no longer portable .
Operational Modes
It is important to mention Real , UNReal , Protected and Virtual mode differences in here some place , pretty much an Intel specific issue , though other processors have differences such as Standard and Virtual modes , all similar to each other in concept and function .
In relation to Intel processors
Real mode , not the natural or power - up mode , of the iAPX86 line of processors is what most people are used to dealing with when in MS - DOS .
In this mode the processor can only address the lower 1 MB of memory , without special extensions .
The processor has default address ranges set when you enter into this mode .
We have lived with this situation because the system BIOS is a real mode program , setting and leaving the processor in this state .
Most of us are quite familiar with this mode of operation .
Most memory managers , Expanded Memory Services ( EMS ) in particular , switch into protected mode and page or copy a block of extended memory into the 1 MB range for application access .
Remember High Memory is relocated on most motherboards in hardware , not software , recovering the address range overlapped by interface card start - up ROMs in the address range of 640K - 1000 K .
Real mode does not allow the processor to do its ' task table magic , thus the application must do any tasking , if any .
Real vanilla DOS .
UNReal mode , is very much like Real mode , with one exception - memory availability .
To get into UNReal mode the application , or O.S. , switches to protected mode , sets all the memory limit registers to their maximum , which should be the physical memory size , and then re-enters Real mode .
This leaves the application or O.S. with full directly addressable access to all memory in the system , no more 1 MB limit , if the BIOS does not get in the way .
This is pretty much how processors like Motorola 's offering operate , all of memory available , or as much as allocated , a linear or virtual space directly addressable , without the protected mode switching troubles for start - up .
Protected mode , is the ' 386 32 bit mode of Windows , which did start with the iAPX286 , and continues today in all Microsoft offerings .
The application or process is loaded into an allocated memory segment (s ) and run .
The descriptor tables , explained in the following section , used by the processor and loaded by the O.S. control the access , task switching , memory usage and exception handling for each task , process or application .
O.S. service requests branch to the appropriate service code while invoking a task switch .
This could of course be a single application utilizing the entire machine with no operating system .
Ninety percent of the multi-tasking process is performed by the processor with no O.S. intervention .
Virtual mode , V86 or VME is a fall back extension to protected mode .
If you are running Windows NT and open a DOS box session , that session or task is running in an emulated lower 1 MB address space .
The DOS shell that comes up is only a partial DOS , with access rights and restrictions to most I/O and devices having been lifted .
Stable DOS applications work fine , even accessing networks , all the protected mode service code is still running , and task switching continues in the standard protected mode manner .
The normal DOS function requests are redirected to protected mode code .
Other types , are what the rest of the world does .
It is interesting that even the 6809 operated in the linear address fashion .
An early version of OS - 9 ran on this processor and provided multi-tasking .
Intel seems to have gotten stuck on the 8080 address method , it 's still with us .
Motorola , like others , provides nice processors with linear addressing , which provides a task with an offset base address , and perform multi-tasking just fine .
An assigned address range is still assigned , even when in a linear space .
Multi-tasking , Really
This is a fun area , given so many different ways it can be done .
Initially we must address things from an Operating System perspective , then from that of an application .
Without going into jargon , there is so much of it , lets list the various common low level tasking methods .
Specifically the point control is passed ( remember we are dealing with Intel processors only at this point in the discussion ) .
It is well know that table driven systems perform at the highest levels .
The least number of times data is handled the faster things run , and less total code is required .
That 's right , you got it , we are right back to square one with a record processing environment .
It should be no surprise therefor that the Intel processors use a table driven system to maintain task switching and memory management functions , other processors have similar schemes .
The functional areas covered by each hardware and software overlap , the intersection set in set theory , which is the common inter - operable area between the two .
The Core or Kernel software sets up the task , privilege , interrupt , exception and memory usage tables used by running , or to be run , applications and processes and then turns actual tasking over to the processor which uses those tables in a state - machine style of operation .
So the Core or Kernel software deals with memory allocation , task load - start - stop - flush and exceptions .
Driver , service and process code run like application code but with higher privilege and access level .
I will not go into great depth here as all this information is conveyed in the Intel reference material and various books on the subject .
Intel designed in a four level hierarchical protection system , privilege levels 0 to 3 , zero being the highest or most privileged level .
The processor farther provides control as to which level of privilege can perform hardware I/O instructions .
Diagram follows .
There are several Descriptor Tables defined each with its ' own location register .
These are the Global Descriptor Table ( GDT ) , Local Descriptor Table ( LDT ) and the Interrupt Descriptor Table ( IDT ) .
These tables and the Task State Segment ( TSS ) are the core of the hardware portion of the tasker .
The descriptor table size can change based on the number of task descriptors contained there in .
These decriptors contain the segment base address and length assigned , flags as to task gate switching and activity semaphores , privilege level , I/ O permission bit maps and the content of the registers if the task is inactive .
A table driven system , privilege based , orchestrated by hardware , administered by the Operating System Kernel .
Diagram follows .
The CPU also handles a memory page table scheme and an address facilitator cache called the Translation Lookaside Buffer ( TLB ) which holds the 32 most used memory segment and offset in the processor to improve task switching times .
Also , there are memory access privilege flags held in each tasks Descriptor record .
The normal methods of using a segment register and an offset in a second register , with all the common addressing modes , still works normally .
The CPU actually is translating segment + offset addresses into linear addresses for physical memory access .
In protected mode you can not use the Segment Register increment trick to move through a buffer in chunks , this will cause an address exception , you must use the Offset Register and mess with the Segment Registers as little as possible .
Diagram follows .
So this is where the Operating System Kernel comes in , the only software on the system that executes in ring ' 0 ' , the highest privilege level .
The number of times per period that any particular task is executed is the reason for a kernel .
The simplest way to execute a task more times is to place it in the task table more times , preferably interleaved .
In all truth loading an application , setting memory up for it and locating it in the task table are mundane executions for the Kernel not any more difficult than scanning a directory tree .
The CPU performs a task switch based on any of the following instructions or occurrences : CALL , JMP , RET , IRET , INT , a trap , fault , abort or external interrupt condition .
The application enters pause condition .
During application calls to a library or routine outside its ' memory partition or privilege .
During or after any hardware or software interrupt occurrence .
Expiration of any task time slice clock .
Operating System forced .
There are several instructions , not found in many vended assemblers , that facilitate access of the Descriptor Segment content and CPU control , some are LGDT , LDS , LIDT , LLDT , LMSW , LTR , SGDT , SIDT , SLDT , SMSW , STR , WBINVD , and ARPL .
It really is interesting how we have come to accept the strange operation of software and hardware as either a user or developer .
Different applications switching modes or screen display formats , and we do n't really notice or care - given the transition time is short .
The Intrinsics of an Operating System
The intrinsics are basically the services that are provided , the actual interface options to the hardware , the basic machine presented to the applications programmer .
All this comes together more or less as the personality of an operating system , the way it feels , the freedoms or constraints enforced , its ' ability to help one complete work , the actual interface presented to the user .
All in all more than look and feel , even the exact same models of automobile feel different in some incommunicable way .
Most of us have written assembly language , dumped programs in hex , been through the guts of both CP / M and MS - DOS , even Windows , and spent untellable hours in front of debugger and blue ice boxes .
This stuff is pretty generic as far as code goes , 32 bit is the only really different aspect , though not even that anymore .
I remember the first Forth system I had , still have .
It was MVP Forth , which Glenn Hayden had come to my house and personally installed .
I remember he had to make three trips , the first to get things started , the second to accommodate the 128 KB provided for CP / M - 3.0 , and the last to allow access to my 10 MB hard disk .
It booted on a floppy and used sector based blocks .
He did this all for the very low price of $ 39.00 , the price of the package I purchased .
This is a text book example of personal integrity .
My gratitude and respect to you Doctor Hayden , although , I may not thank you for this strange path you long ago dumped me upon .
How many sleepless , restless and heart felt frustration wrought nights have I spent tinkering , creating , implementing , dreaming , planning , seeing the clarity of concept , at 3 am finding myself yelling at an empty room , having visions with no words for expression , image of concept others never seem to see , artistic expression .
The Punch Card way - Eighty columns , key it wrong and start over , many boxes full , read 'em in , compile , test run , print them out , scratch head , punch changes , collate , repeat .
The Teletype way - Supervisory Process Operator ( SPO )
Log running on , page after page , read , enter direction commands , transmit , more SPO output , repeat .
The CP / M way - Because UNIX serial terminals were widely available , had standard control codes , and did not use a very fast interface they became the choice .
TeleVideo , Adds , Beehive , etc .
The 8080 , and shortly the Z80 , microprocessors operating at 4MHz could easily handle 9.6 and 19.2 Kbps data rates with hardware or x - on / x - off handshake .
The screen scrolled off the top , like DOS still does , like a teletype SPO log .
Soon programs started to use direct cursor addressing and so the birth of formatted screens with line character panels .
Some terminals had multiple screen buffers and display screens could be preloaded and switched to in a refresh clock time .
Worst case the screen could be rewritten or drawn in about one second .
Later CP / M versions had a scroll - back feature so one could look at commands or listed items that had scrolled off the top already .
Some terminals had graphics capabilities and thus the foundations of Windows .
What you did n't need you did n't load ; so why does MS - DOS keep all the utilities loaded ?
With an Operating System that normally fit in 2 KB of memory it is easy to see how simplicity works , and there were just as many I/O ports and storage devices then as now .
The MS - DOS way -
On the PC platform , larger programs but not really any different than CP / M in fit , function and form .
The display speed improved as it was parallel and operated at peripheral buss speeds .
Some of the functions of the serial terminals got lost in translation and all the display functions take main processor time , a trade off for interface speed .
The Concurrent DOS way -
This was a nice mix of CP / M and MS - DOS commands with the ability to have multiple sessions display on one screen or on several serial terminals .
I used CDOS on a single display system and ran background sessions that could be hotkeyed to the foreground , or tiled .
I could compile , copy to diskette , print and edit all at the same time on a 4.77
Mhz machine with no problem whatever .
In the last version Windows could also be run , excellent memory and processor time management , a smooth fast environment .
Too bad about DRI .
The Windows way - You know this one .
The screen is laced with a background , then the application panels are laid on top .
Panel , icon , .gif or .bmp .. there is really no difference , the screen is the main panel and everything is laid on top .
Some items invoke action , icons for example , some are interfaces to running processes or applications .
Enough .
The OS - 9 way - I can't say much here .
My short exposure was on a GIMIX system that had multiple terminals , it acted and felt very much like a terminal serving UNIX box , just different commands .
All the programming languages were re-entrant resulting in very good memory utilization .
The UNIX way - In operator , or super user , mode this is a cross between DOS and a mainframe , a single scrolling screen , task lists with the ability to control , mainframe mode .
Direct execution of an application places it in the foreground and the operator interacts with only it , DOS mode .
X - Windows was the big leap , being able to interact with panels representing multiple running applications or processes .
Windows is as Windows does , panels .
Users can still be connect by terminal via serial or LAN and run in terminal or X - Windows modes , display device capability dependent .
The command set is still script or batch oriented when in command mode , it still rubs me wrong , so much ability traded for cripticism .
The Plan - 9 way - Very X - Windows like environment but with the underpinnings of a true multiple processor or distributed processor environment .
All things are broken down into client or server parts and flung about .
I question this approach with today 's cheap and very fast processors , it seems this approach would have been better suited in the age of slow processors , oh well a day late and a dollar short .
I can see this approach working in very heavy processing environments that are doing heavy calculations and graphics displays while looking up data , and the technique is part of how OS / Forth works on a single CPU , but LAN limitations could quickly show up .
Functionally impressive but expensive .
The MCP way - A teletype on a screen with the ability to scroll back as far as you like between log roll - outs .
Commands are directed at the MCP or jobs in the mix .
A rich command set , about 400 , makes for excellent control , but this is a batch machine with no direct interaction between the keyboard and applications .
Terminals that are connected to the system interact with an application , in semi batch mode one block transmission at a time , typically CANDE , the terminal services application .
The OS / Forth way - I should comment ... but instead I suggest you keep this thought and read on .
All is revealed a page or two from here following .
Programming Languages
Unlike other languages Forth takes time to learn , really learn .
If you are proficient in one of the common languages , you can become good with another in two , three months on the outside .
But , Forth takes a year , truly , to grasp the real nuances , the true capabilities available , the freedom .
Forth - highly data - typed , yet unstructured , with complete freedom of syntactical expression , uses unhindered data passing and access models , is truly extensible , and is result oriented .
It must be stated , however , that a Forth program becomes , in a unique way , very structured from the perspective of the data being dealt with as once the data handling interactions are described they must be closely followed .
It takes time to unlearn the ways of wagon pulling and invent the rocketship .
If going back to the common languages , where one writes for a complier , you constantly search for and invent Forth like things to end or reduce the constraints ever present .
The mind is the forge that melds concept , machine , data , form and process into a salient solution through the use of Forth as hammer and anvil .
Adding words to the compiler itself is true extensibility - not the act of calling function or code libraries .
If examining all the programming manuals , references and book offerings it becomes very clear that all programming languages , completely independent of the physical processor type , refer to creating code for a specific operating system .
Even books on specific subjects , such as EGA and VGA programming , constantly refer to the operating system interface to perform functions or gain access .
Does this not then point out all that is really ever done is creation of code that runs under the operating system ?
Which really means that all applications really only are extensions to the operating system .
It is commonly referenced that the application runs on top of the operating system , but in actuality it runs under the operating system .
The concept is simple - if a program runs on top of the operating system then it is superior and does not need the operating system .
This is to say , as example , the operating system runs on top of or around a device driver , an application also runs inside or under an operating system , merely doing something different than a device driver .
Most embedded applications have built in device drivers and do not need an operating system , just operating system like extensions , a reversal and the reason most programmers never fathom embedded concepts .
Look at all the programming languages that you know , except assembly flavors , and then tell me the percentage of function extensions available that do not deal with the operating system .
Following I use the DOS version 5.5 of TurboPascal , not including the overlay , graphic or object functions , as an example for clarity .

What About JAVA
Lets discuss some about Java , and other languages as well , comparison is needed .
Because of the subject matter at hand this was not included in the ' Programming Languages ' section .
So I ask and answer " what is Java " !?
A new version of ' C ' that compiles to a non-processor specific output and has standardized service library interface .
Java can not be executed as Forth is , but almost , only after target compilation , but that 's true about any language code fragment .
The term ' Java Script ' continues to pop up in all forms of communications , and I find humor there in , as any computer veteran will tell you : a script runs like a batch file , it is source text that is interpreted and executed .
Java is not a script language , it is a diminished pseudo code or p-code , having been compiled , to be interpreted by a host application .
Funny , to think Forth can be processor targeted , p-coded , scripted , interpreted , linked and even assembled , or all of these , based on the requirements of the application .
P - code compiler output can be arranged such for efficient interpretation , but we are back to the question ' are we writing code for the compiler and libraries or for the user , application and data !?'
Another of Forth 's strengths in this situation is the ability to create and test code interactively , then save same in a compiled format for later use , graphically speaking - not unlike a graphical button face in .GIF format .
The beauty of OS / Forth is that you can embed any language or instruction constructs in the display pages and have them still work fine .
To that , you can have application code written in any language , with a services interface library .
To make it all work only requires the correct execution module be loaded or available .
Forth just happens to be best for such display formatting as the code layout is almost completely linear , there is very little execution overhead , whether interpreted , compiled , indexed or address threaded - all of which means more time being devoted to actual application generation and execution , not compiler pleasing .
Languages such as Java , and any ' C ' flavor , Pascal or even Basic , if interpreted , could never execute as fast because of their structure , all of these languages were designed to be compiled .
That code oriented structure is the impediment , while Forth is data oriented and processing flows around the data stream .
I would rather see Open Firmware executed than Java based on its ' linear design , not that it is of Forth heritage .
It can be read on any platform , it is p-code like , can be reverse compiled , is compact and executes quickly ... well it 's Forth , right ?
This all points out that we need to restructure existing languages , or create new ones , that are more linear in design .
Forth is not the only answer , just a good one , but one size does not fit all .
so .. Java ai n't it .
Consider the current situation with browsers , they fetch and read a file , display the information according to the embedded tags , place non-scaling graphic images as designated , interpret any code fragments or macros , wait for the user .
That really is all that they are doing is n't it ?
The most difficult of this whole business is the browser must change the HTML display information given , and place it in , the display constraints of the host operating system .
The reason we think of a browser as an application , not unlike a wordprocessor or database program .
You do see the problem here : we continue to interpret the display source format data for the operating system instead of integrating it into the operating system , or actually , the operating system into it .
I have always considered that the data was more important than the operating system , that vantage seems to have changed along the way for others , thus Windows .
HTML works , maybe not as well as wanted , but it does work .
In future version releases more and more functionality will creep in until there is no difference between any display source format .
Forth broke away , well Chuck did , from the norm of the computer world with its ' record oriented punch card traditions .
The beauty of structure is how each of us creates it , not what we are forced into .
So go ahead - Java , ' C ' , Algol , Pascal , Basic , Cobol , Fortran , Assemble , Lisp , Snowball , SmallTalk and Prolog your heart out - OS / Forth can accommodate them all , with faster execution than any other operating system , in less space .
Other Devices
Now here is an interesting area for appliance and equipment makers alike .
Why can't I send HTML directly to a printer not unlike postscript is currently .
Soon HTML will provide drawing commands , perhaps like Turtle graphics or defined possibilities , at that point postscript will be redundant .
I think it bad design when I must convert a graphical image to text for the printer to deal with it , something HTML negates , send the image and anchor , screen or page - no different .
Everything was based on the NEC SpinWriter or Diablo 630 for a very long time , then Epson , followed by the first HP Laser printers , now all kinds .
Each printer type has its ' own graphics capabilities or emulates the HP series .
The same goes for plotters , HP or Gerber , another I can't remember right now .
This nigh on two decades , it 's time for something new , more robust , oriented around the user and data .
One graphical format which is visual either displayed or printed and that everyone knows and understands .
The OS / Forth Concept
The OS / Forth concept is based upon , or a summary of , many of the concepts presented in the preceding sections all rolled together .
That is kind of a broad statement I know , but lets see .
Understand first that OS / Forth is not a self - booting stand alone Forth implementation - it is so much more .
so why this
The entire thrust of the concept for this new operating system is to factor the problem at hand as far as possible , provide that position to the application programmer , and reduce total size of all code running while gaining speed .
In the purest sense we are treating each aspect of the operating system and all applications and utilities as separate vocabularies .
If the operating system can open , close , read , write , buffer , sort or index a file why should such code be in my program ?
Why should my program need to update the screen coordinates in the program control file when the operating system can , and should , as it has the information first and interfaces to the storage system , my program really does not care the position of the displayed panel .
So we are back to the basis of Forth - do n't duplicate code over and over , leverage what you have already created , refine and factor .
In this method we immediately realize that a performance improvement or gain in one part of the system transfers to everything , and the reverse .
In the OS / Forth environment all processes that are not an integral part of the Kernel are tasks , which says that all code runs under the Kernel .
All non -kernel code is a process , service , driver or application and all are both clients and servers depending on the moment of execution .
startup
Control files for each task designate the location of files , first screen format or file to display , location and type of the application code , normal memory requirements , last displayed panel position and its ' details , general settings and other miscellany .
Similar in operation to an .INI or registry file .
The operating system deals with this , not the program .
The control information is a record in memory and read or written by the Operating System , so let it deal with the updates , less code in my application .
This provides the situation of stopping an application at a task switch opportunity and rolling it out to disk intact , able to be brought back up later , great for transfer to another system or processor , fault tolerance or memory cleanup .
screen
I like screens , lost of them , often several when doing systems and network administration work .
There are many utilities that need to be run and monitored and one screen does not accomplish that .
Do you open only one book at a time to one page , close it and open to the next page , or switch books in the same way while doing research - I think not .
I can often cover a whole table with open textuals and scads of notepads with points or references jotted down .
One screen only does not allow me to properly move through the data stream I use .
Minimized or half visual panels are the same as closed books .
I should be able to fill the buss with display cards .
I do not operate in a completely serial fashion and need a system with more accommodation than current ones .
I must mention HTML I guess .
Most applications today were designed with screen painters that generate display files , so is there any real difference deciding that HTML is a good all around non-proprietary format to use ?
Hitting version 3.x level in the HTML standards in such a short amount of time shows that as need arises the display capability will improve .
An Operating System that does not need a browser is the natural next evolutionary step .
But , remember , a firm such as Netscape could be the writers of the HTML service module , or of new and improved versions of it , and find a solid place in the industry .
A small change in scope or direction but a large potential and growing market for them to service .
Oh , Yeah , I want an advertisement blocking extension , like , real quick .
panels
The two aspect states a panel should exhibit are Scaling and Fixed with a Local , Remote or Shared Presence .
To begin a reasonable description I must point out something I may be taking for granted - all panels are in graphics mode all the time , this based on the fact that current video controllers convert text to graphics for display anyway .
So we may as well be in the same mode from jump .
So to simplify this , all :
Display screens are in graphics mode
Panels can be dragged between screens
Panels must be anchored on a single screen , no visual overlap ( for now )
Panels can be a desktop , like current backgrounds , and have icons hung on them
Items hung on a panel move with it
Panels are controlled by the display services and not the program
The concept of icons on panels is very powerful .
If you have a panel up , perhaps in what seems text mode , and there is a help button in the upper left corner , the button as an icon can launch an unrelated or disassociated help application , spawn an associated help application or be part of the application and flag an input event .
The Help function itself is part of the Operating System , looks like any HTML you design , and is extensible by you .
Aspect is a special feature that continues to be overlooked , but , no more .
I can change the size of a graphical image but not a screen panel , I do n't like that .
We were given scalable fonts but were denied scalable panels .
If a panels ' aspect is in Scale mode then it and content should scale up or down from thumbnail to full screen .
If a panels ' aspect is in Fixed mode then the content remains the same scale , with scroll - bars when shrunk smaller than the display content , which means it looks like panels we see today on other operating systems .
Both modes are needed .
Presence is a new way of stating something forgotten .
What is meant by Presence here is the panel display source .
Does the panels ' attached application reside on the local machine , on another and you are remote viewing or one that is shared between machines .
Imagine PC
Anywhere that only affects a single panel on the screen , or a group screen interaction not unlike IRC but with full text and graphics , perhaps a process that is being viewed by multiple people , a panel that is being updated by multiple processes on different machines .
The powerful concept of state of Presence .
With Presence I can provide support to a person in word - processing application by seeing exactly what that person sees , and able to interact directly .
I can run a backup process on a remote machine and not bother the user , able to monitor the process , interacting with it .
Multiple people can collaborate on creation of the same document .
And so on ....
storage
Sectors and tracks are items that should be ignored .
An SCSI hard disk is a good example of how storage should work , access is according to block address or number .
You can treat the content of the disk device almost like blocks of memory , a base block address plus an offset .
Remember sector skewing on early diskette drives ?
A practice required because of slow interface electronics , and not practiced anymore .
The application never saw the fact that the sectors were arranged so that it took three disk rotations to read a track , the sector stream looked continual , the facts being hidden by the disk BIOS and a skew table .
It must be remembered that the disk directory presented us is a formatted entry point representation of what is stored and has nothing to do with the actual physical location of any data .
So as long as your data is presented to you when you want it , in the format you desire , do you really care on which disk drive it resides ?
Perhaps we should think a little differently about how storage is referenced .
On large equipment the storage sub -system is called an array , you do not really care which spindle or spindles the file is residing on , it 's all one large area .
Gone are the days of drive letters to accommodate multiple 10 or 20 megabyte drives .
Let us stride forward on this also .
network
As you are experienced with currently .
I will state that I think the Novell method of addressing is much better than the others being employed .
It was derived from TCP / IP and does similar address and routing functions .
But , imagine 12 hex digits of LAN address and 12 more hex digits for station address , that 's FFFFFFFFFFFF possible LANs and FFFFFFFFFFFF possible nodes , hard to run out of addresses .
services
Some of the types of services that will be needed are listed .
Kernel ( tasker and memory manager ) HTML interpreters Forth interpreter Application loader Storage manager Storage device drivers Storage functions Floppy driver Display manager Display functions Keyboard manager Pointing device manager LAN manager LAN drivers Comms manager Comms drivers
development
Imagine F - PC , Borland ' C ' or Pascal , Pygmy , E - Forth or even assembler .
All with interface and storage request interface changes will work fine .
Any language that has an Operating System interface library for its ' standard functions will work .
The development environment would need the most work as it is normally very heavily interface oriented .
Compiler output needs only the services interface library .
library dichotomy
Consider a factored environment where the application held no extra code .
The concept here is that once efficient code is created there is no benefit to multiple instances of that code running when not in use .
That 's not clear .
I ask now , and discussed prior , why should my application need a record index mechanism when one can be provided by the Operating System , it has to do all the interfacing , buffering , reads and writes , so why not ?
This is factoring .
Why do I need to qualify keystrokes when the Operating System can do it for me and only pass me data I have declared to have value ?
Why ca n't a communications program just open and read or write the Comms ports like a file ?
All these things point to the why of the split in philosophy of design .
If I need to write a Comms driver to take advantage of specific communications gear , like a new style modem , then I need to write a process acting in server mode , not complicate my application .
This allows me to change the driver dozens of times and never touch the application code .
The real thing in client / server technology , every aspect of the Operating System OS / Forth steps up to this concept and philosophy .
thread model
Which kind do you like ?
You can do them all .
Pick .
extensions
Shall we create one ?
How about a file copy program .
Copy - Now think Forth , context and vocabularies .
With the HTML editor we paint the HTML Page for the display panel , help information and an icon , then save them .
We create our code fragment , as a Forth source text file , to run interpretively , we may test it interactively .
We create the program Control File pointing to the HTML Page file , icon , source code fragment and its ' execution type , help file , memory constraints , permissions and services needed .
We register the control file with the Operating System .
Upon icon invocation the Kernel opens the control file , loads the named HTML Page , loads the named code fragment with specified constraints , displays the HTML panel and then turns over control to the program , or interpreter in this case .
The program requests input through Display services , displays directory information through Display services as provided by Disk services , accepts selection through Display services , invokes Disk services to complete the copy task , shows status and prompts for additional interact through Display services , exits which invokes a panel close as part of Kernel clean - up .
The Kernel clears the active panel(s ) , frees memory , then updates the programs control file before closing it .
The help function was designated as system default so the default Help Icon was displayed .
If Help had been invoked then the Help services would have displayed the designated Help file through Display services in a separate panel .
A program of this type would only be about fifteen lines long , less than 1 KB , since the Disk and Display services are doing 95 % of the work .
I only need to define a small TIB to work in and do not need to declare disk buffer space , or build a table and sort word for the directory information , or design display routines to place it on the screen , all that is already done for me in the Services , by much more efficient code .
Besides , every time I make a service request then a task switch occurs , taking advantage of it , I let the requested service do things in a more efficient manner .
This code fragment as a utility could be added to a utility code vocabulary and stay resident in memory , being available for other applications to invoke , and sharing common HTML interface layout with other vocabulary words .
So now applications can add File Copy to their file access interface with minimal or no additional code , explicitly called or an icon on the application button bar .
A simple extension , or stand alone utility , either / or .
Multiple control files can be designed for the same code fragment to suit different needs with no source changes .

A Mention of PC99
If you go to the web site of either Microsoft or Intel you will find in the developers section a .
PDF document , locked to all editing functions , that details the design of the next versions of desktop PCs ' to be offered to the public in the 1999 time frame .
I guess the reason for the PC99 nomenclature .
The information shows how PCs are to be built so they will work correctly with Microsoft 's operating system offerings , or you are non-compatible .
This means that Microsoft is even now dictating the direction that hardware is going to take , becoming more integrated with their operating system , and locking us into their products .
The document states that the new specification does not address the likes of file and network servers - bunk , most servers are desktop systems with more expensive parts inside .
So where are we , just corralled , feet lashed together , butt branded or in the feed lot looking at a butchers truck ?
I really hate this sneaky shit .
We 're not that dumb .
I see a life of misery when the largest manufacturer of operating systems is dictating the design of future hardware offerings .
I think we can do something about this .
And so comes OS / Forth , the Cowboy of the Operating System world .
The Payoff
The thing of most note here is - our effort is not controlled by the perversionarys of the stock market or financial communities .
I feel it a shame that so many CEOs and Chair of firms today allow those that are interested in only short term financial gain to manipulate their perspective of reality .
What stocks do means nothing when solid sales are present in a growing market and the firm can respond with appropriate output and support .
Laying off personnel just to make the quarterly earnings look better based on sales to expense ratios , or other tripe , is ludicrous .
If you layoff personnel and the buildings burn down what do you have - ashes , but , if the personnel are there , they lend their shoulder and build it back up , better than before , as they are the only true asset .
Listen to and rely on them .
And too this , the following -
As an interesting story goes ... back about ten years or so , a little Silicon Valley founding firm called Varian Associates , started in a garage by the Varian brothers in the '30s , had a C.E.O. named Norm Parker .
I admire this man to this day .
During his leadership Varian offered up to 15 % per year increase to employees that performed at the ' Excellence ' level , there were always intern jobs for college students every summer in all company areas , there were no layoffs , the stocks paid every year , the company was adding new divisions .
He followed a simple rule - if the division was not profitable , contract out their abilities to other firms , even if only at cost .
People stay employed , the stocks pay , and the firm and its product base grow .
Ten years ago there were people having forty year anniversaries with the firm .
Then there was an executive coup de grace by some juniors , the head being the current or perhaps just past chair , Tom Sege .
On his way out this honorable man , Mr. Parker , gave an across the board raise of 4 % to all non executive employees , saying " This is the last thing I can do for you . "
In less than a year Sege and his henchmen were bragging about the purchase of another firm while closing down divisions and laying off people - oh , but the stocks went up .
This is the executive trend and sin of today .
Being whom we are , creations can be made and presented , all the while we can not be manipulated by the financial market .
That , in business terms , is real power .
Based on the fact that the OS / Forth architecture is open , firms that play in the stock or financial markets can leverage products off it , fitting well within the vision , and not corrupt their standing .
Everyone makes out without destruction or corruption of the vision .
The best possible place to be for a new Operating System , all the possibilities and none of the limits , an international contender .
As a statement of direction FIG will need to create a foundation to own and receive the proceeds from the sale of this product .
I would expect this foundation to distribute the dividends to the participants and deal with the manufacturing issues as contracts and rights .
Proceeds are for grants , scholarships and research ventures .
Proper representation and visibility in the industry costs .
The Foundation would and will enter into and administer contracts with manufacturers for use of and distribution rights to the Operating System .
The numbers look like this :
In the typical manufacturer / distributor world , given an MSRP of say $ 69.95 , expecting a cost of medium and documentation to be under ten dollars per , the price to the distributor would be $ 34.97 which leaves ~ $ 24.97 for FIG and the development participants .
Some numbers :
MSRP 69.95 Cost of production 10.00 Vendor discount of 50 % 34.97 Residual per 24.97 FIG portion of 25 % 6.24 Participant portion of 75 % 18.73
Conservative 1,000,000 sales
24,970,000.00 FIG portion of 25 % 6,240,000.00 Participant portion of 75 % 18,730,000.00 50 participants > each 374,000.00
Wild 100,000,000 sales
2,497,000,000.00 FIG portion of 25 % 624,000,000.00 Participant portion of 75 % 1,873,000,000.00 50 participants > each 37,400,000.00
I see the distribution of funds as 25 % for FIG and 75 % to be split among the participants .
I estimated fifty participants , there could be many more , or less , and the numbers slide accordingly .
Do n't be scared of the extra zeros on the right , they are just zeros after all .
If a strategic alliance situation comes into existence than these numbers must change based on the sharing of proceeds with the alliance partner doing the production or supplying the technology .
This effort will quickly gain wide visibility with consulting and development opportunities opening up for the Forth literate .
All the vendors wanting drivers for hardware , new application development or software conversions will need plenty of warm bodies babbling Forth etiquette intermixed with statements of Stack - Power and mumblings of thread models .
As acceptance occurs books will need written , applications imagined and instructors incited to orate .
All residual opportunity .
Ownership
It is intended that the rights to this effort be held by FIG unless co-ownership is created with a firm (s ) providing proprietary information for the effort .
I had started the contact process with Caldera ( a Canopy Group venture ) to try to secure the multi-tasker and memory manager written for Multi - User DOS , the last protected mode version of MP/M .
After hearing what was intended they were very interested .. then complete silence .
The code could have chopped six months off the effort with Caldera owning part of it all .
So I wonder what nerve got banged when knowledge of this effort reached the executive level .
All participants will necessarily have to sign non-disclosure to protect the Kernel , the only part of OS / Forth will not be open or available in source .
All else will be open .
This is the only way to keep from being devalued by a slew of low or no cost me - too products .
Conclusion
We stand at a very special place in time and space , we have one of those rare opportunities to actually change the direction of computational equipment .
Forth being a tool , and we the craftsmen , let us create the future .
Please - hear my orison ;
Do not think this project Horror , having come full circle and reached its ' limits , to finally disappear up its ' own sphincter .
Consider - the computer outside the context of our society has no value , is nothing .
With several million PCs in the world and thousands being sold daily one can see a potential market , a persistent one .
Little mention has been made here about other platforms , present and quite capable and very much in need .
Systems such as Sun , Apple , MIPS , Silicon Graphics and others , all the various mini-computers and main - frames , such a vast territory of potential computing landscape , one OS / Forth can address .
If we had all really pulled together with Tom Zimmer and F - PC imagine where it would be today , we could have competed with ' C ' .
I offer an apology from all of us to you Tom .
You have spent much life and frustration in your effort .
You took the original concept of a professional Forth development system and made it happen , gained select contributions from others such as Bob Smith , and did yourself one better with TCOM .
My admiration Sir. I did not cover F - PC or other flavors of Forth because the issues are not the current implementations but the one to come .
I sense that the experts in each area will feel the need to dabble , and I await your input .
Come Forth , let us break code together , cross compile falsehoods , dump all hex , trace hidden meanings , translate other tongues , decompile ancient words , and find enlightenment .
In conclusion , let me say , that Forth could soon , in essence , gasp its ' last breath if a new and radical way of thinking about its ' application is not accepted and applied .
Credits and Trademarks
If you see a graphic , word , phrase or product name that belongs to someone - well it 's theirs .
This is group internal document and as such claims immunity from various small and / or circled letters .
I offer thanks and gratitude to you that were / are ( un ) knowing and / or ( un ) willing participants and / or supporters in this effort loosely referred to as a document .

BIRMINGHAM , Ala . --
An Alabama state court ordered HealthSouth Corp. founder Richard Scrushy in June to fork over $ 2.88 billion to shareholders for his role in a massive accounting scam .
Then came the hard part for the shareholders -- getting the money out of him .
Mr. Scrushy , who is two years into a seven - year sentence in federal prison in Beaumont , Texas , in a separate political - bribery case , did n't provide much help , the shareholders ' lawyers complained .
When they visited Mr. Scrushy 's Birmingham mansion in mid-August , ...

An African - American man has pleaded guilty after being accused of impersonating a white supremacist in a fictitious Facebook account to make death threats against an African - American university student .
A Mississippi man admitted creating a false Facebook profile in November .
Dyron L. Hart , 20 , of Poplarville , Mississippi , pleaded guilty Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt to one count of communicating threats in interstate commerce , according to a Department of Justice statement .
Hart admitted creating the fictitious account in November , pretending to be a white supremacist outraged by the election of Barack Obama as the nation 's first African - American president , the statement said .
He then transmitted a death threat via Facebook to an African - American student at Nicholls State University in Louisiana , saying he wanted to kill African - Americans because of Obama 's election , according to the statement .
A court document provided by the U.S. attorney 's office said Hart told an FBI interviewer that he intended the threat to be a prank " to get a reaction . "
Do n't Miss Pentagon reviewing policy on social networking sites
The document said Hart admitted creating the Facebook profile under the name " Colten Brodoux " and used a photo of a Caucasian man that he found on a white supremacist Web site .
" This is an extremely odd case , a very unusual case , " said U.S. Attorney Jim Letten of the Eastern District of Louisiana .
" The contents of the messages were extremely troubling and provocative and very threatening . "
Hart will face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine when sentenced November 18 , the statement said .

The Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation are funding research that may result in a military turbine aircraft that for the first time ever will produce its own electricity from exhaust heat generated from thermo electricity .
Dr. Daryoosh Vashaee and a team of co-researchers at Oklahoma State University 's Helmerich Advanced Technology Research Center in Tulsa are using thermo electric nanotechnology to investigate the conversion of waste heat into electricity .
Up to this point , thermo electricity has not been used extensively beyond space and cooling applications because it could not be produced efficiently .
However , the scientists ' efforts in Oklahoma may soon change that and thermo electric technology may be heralded by the Air Force in a way that no other eco-friendly energy source has , because it has non- toxic emissions .
Vashaee and his co-researchers are examining thermo electric versus infrared technology , which is what the Air Force is currently using .
The latter requires liquid nitrogen to cool down the infrared cells .
Thermo electricity , on the other hand , would not make that necessary and it would also be inexpensive .
" The new thermo electric sensors also provide a means to make high performance infrared detectors that are structurally simple and small , suitable for being used in military missions , " said Vashaee .
Vashaee noted that the next step is to develop thermo electric modules that can be used for power generation for Air Force aircraft , solar , thermal cells and waste heat recovery systems used in industry .

Sir Liam Donaldson , the Chief Medical Officer for England , hit the swine flu panic button last week , warning the outbreak is confronting the NHS with its " biggest challenge in a generation " .
But that did n't mean everyone caught up in the hysteria that has even seen stoical commuters accessorise their work outfits with face masks was panicking .
For dozens of companies , including giant multinational corporations and tiny internet quacks , the outbreak of swine flu frenzy has turned into a licence to print money .
And plenty of it .
The disease 's explosive global advance has sent everyone from private citizens to national governments on a mass shopping spree to try to buy cures : catching swine flu might be not funny but anyone working for what increasingly looks like Swine Flu Inc is laughing all the way to the bank .
Not least GlaxoSmithKline , the British drugs company producing most of the country 's swine flu vaccine .
As it moved to become the pharmaceutical group with the broadest range of products to tackle the pandemic , last week unveiling plans to sell masks and diagnostic kits to test for the disease as well as vaccines and antiviral medicines , industry analysts estimated GSK could make up to £ 1bn from sales of its swine flu vaccine alone .
It already has orders for 195 million doses , which may cost £ 6 a dose in the UK , from 16 governments around the world .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Not that that 's any cause for apology , apparently .
Andrew Witty , GSK 's chief executive , refused to be forced on to the defensive about the company 's windfall , despite accusations he was trying to turn the crisis into cash .
" We are trying to strike a balance between society and our shareholders , who want to see a return on the risks we take , " he said .
GSK 's investors have already seen a return on sales of Relenza , its antiviral drug : second - quarter results showed quarterly sales had increased twentyfold year - on - year to £ 60 m , with first - half sales hitting £ 230m .
With up to one in three of the population estimated to be at risk of falling ill – and up to 65,000 of those actually dying – the Government has been left with little choice but to dig deep to try to limit the fallout .
The story is being repeated around the world , with the United States last week coughing up a further $ 1bn ( £ 600 m ) to buy more vaccines , and France ordering an extra 28 million vaccines from Sanofi - Aventis .
And do n't think it is just the Government that is brandishing its chequebook to deal with the pandemic that has turned the UK into a global leper .
( Britain has been hit harder by swine flu than any other European country . )
Judging from the stripped shelves at pharmacies across the country , pretty much everybody is stocking up on anything flu-related .
There have been runs on paper surgical masks , thermometers , cold and flu capsules , anti-bacterial hand sanitisers and even tissues .
A checkout assistant at Boots in Kensington High Street yesterday said the store was all out of thermometers .
" There 's no point ordering any more because the warehouses are empty .
The same goes for hand gels .
And we 're doing a roaring trade in surgical masks , " she added .
Superdrug has seen sales of its digital thermometers , at £ 7.82 each , increase tenfold , while Lloyds Chemist said it is seeing a 700 per cent increase in demand for its thermometers and a 70 per cent jump in sales of its £ 2 antibacterial hand gel .
Manufacturers such as Brannan Thermometers have warned they may run short .
It is n't only chemists that are sitting pretty as the numbers of sufferers soar .
Even clothing retailers are muscling in on the swine flu sales boom : a newly replenished tower of tissue boxes promising " antiviral " properties teetered between shoppers waiting to pay for their cardigans at one London Marks & Spencer store yesterday .
An M&S employee said the tissue mountain had appeared earlier this week , around the same time that the Government announced the number of confirmed swine flu cases had doubled in the past seven days to 100,000 , and that the boxes were " selling well " .
Never mind that a few sheets of toilet roll would probably do the trick .
Meanwhile , although the NHS had just made the flu - treatment drug Tamiflu widely available with the launch of its National Pandemic Flu Service , panicking Brits were still shelling out on their own personal just - in - case supplies .
Online vendors , such as the Online Clinic , are making a killing , despite Tamiflu 's £ 119.99 price tag .
Its sales representative , Robert Mackay , said : " It depends on the news that day ; if it 's about deaths then sales are up . "
Indeed , demand for Tamiflu on the internet has been so high that it has displaced Viagra as the most spammed drug on the web .
Other goodies from opportunistic hawkers include the £ 63.99 " essential " swine flu kit , which includes overalls , booties and alcohol foam ; medichecks.com 's £ 125 blood test ; and even the £ 22 " swine flu survival guide " written by someone claiming to be a former US navy sailor .
Swine flu Inc 's net does n't stop there .
Even restaurant chains are enjoying a fillip from the pandemic .
Home delivery chains in Mexico saw their sales boom as everyone hid indoors amid a nationwide restaurant shutdown .
Closer to home , Domino 's Pizza said its sales were likely to rise yet further if more people opted to order in rather than go out to eat .
With the number of confirmed cases still just nudging the tip of the predicted iceberg , perhaps we should be thankful that at least one section of the economy is firmly in the black , recession or no recession .
Statistics :
How many people will it kill ?
As the diagnosis of swine flu is now being carried out over the phone and against a checklist of symptoms , health officials do not have an exact figure of the number of people who been hit by the H1N1 virus in the UK .
It is therefore hard to work out what proportion of people infected with the virus are suffering the most severe reactions .
Officials are working on the prediction that one in three of us could have been infected at some stage by the end of the year .
So far in the UK , there have been 30 deaths related to swine flu .
Health officials are working on the basis that the virus could kill somewhere between 0.1 to 0.35 per cent of all the people it infects .
It is this guide which led chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson to tell the NHS to prepare for up to 65,000 swine flu deaths in a worst - case scenario , although lower projections were also released .
In comparison , rough averages show that in Britain :
2 - 3 people die from lightning strikes each year
4 from an allergic reaction to wasp and bee stings
200 from food poisoning
3,000 in road accidents
6,000 - 10,000 from seasonal flu – although seasons vary in severity
155,000 from cancer
245,000 from heart disease and strokes .
The Ginger Ninja and I went back to the Canadian National Exhibition yesterday to catch the Superdogs , see the sights and sample some more so - bad - it ’s - good food .
One item on our list was Taco in a Bag , which many people speak of only in hushed tones .
Taco in a Bag is made by taking a bag of Doritos and giving it a couple of whacks to break the chips into smaller pieces .
The bag is sliced open along one of its long sides and then the taco filling is added : ground beef , grated cheese , salsa , sour cream , guacamole and lettuce .
You eat it right out of the bag with a fork .
It ’s like a Frito pie , but you can pretend it ’s healthier because it has some lettuce .
It ’s just one of the deliciously unhealthy items that the poutine place in the corner of the CNE ’s Food Building serves .
They also serve a number of different types of poutine .
Here ’s the left half of their menu :
The first two poutine items on the menu are :
The Lumberjack : French fries covered with gravy and cheese curds , sausages and a fried egg .
I need to try this sometime .

The Canadian : French fries covered with gravy and cheese curds , topped with two strips of bacon .

French fries covered in gravy and cheese curds , ground beef , salsa , guacamole , sour cream and jalapeno peppers .
The Traditional : Good ol ’ fashioned poutine – just french fries covered in gravy , cheese curds and nothing else .
Getting back to Taco in a Bag – here ’s what it looks like when you get it :
It just needs to be stirred up .
Here ’s what the first bite looks like :
It ’s so dirtylicious .
If you get the chance , try it .
The CNE ’s open until next Monday , so keep in mind that time ’s running out .

Advertisement Apple boss Steve Jobs stole the show at an event to launch new products as he took to the stage for the first time in nearly a year following medical leave .
Mr Jobs returned to work at the end of June after taking a six - month break to recover from a liver transplant .
After a long summer of speculation about what would roll off the Apple production line , the products took second billing to Mr Jobs ' appearance .
" I 'm vertical and I 'm back , " joked Mr Jobs at a press event in San Francisco .
In Scotland , we have another way of putting it : ' fur coat and nae knickers '

As the audience rose to give him a standing ovation and cheer his return , the notoriously private Mr Jobs talked briefly about the operation he received at a hospital in Tennessee .
" As some of you may know , about five months ago I had a liver transplant , " he told the crowd of press , analysts and invited guests .
" So I have the liver of a mid-20s person who died in a car crash and was generous enough to donate their organs .
I would n't be here without such generosity . "
Dressed in his usual blue jeans and black turtle - neck , and looking perhaps a bit thinner than normal , the technology mogul urged everyone to follow suit and become organ donors .
' In charge '
Weeks before the company 's event , dubbed " It 's only rock ' n ' roll and we like it " , the rumour mill had gone into overdrive about whether or not Mr Jobs would attend .
The issue has been seen as a major distraction for the company .
The product announcements were seen as a bit of a letdown by some Many believed that this was one engagement Mr Jobs could not afford to miss given that the company 's share price has risen and fallen in the past on reports of his health .
" Today it was all about Steve Jobs , " Gene Munster , a senior analyst with Piper Jaffray & Co told the BBC .
" Users and investors of Apple adore Steve Jobs and the fact that he was here is really a statement that he is in charge and he is an active part of the company .
That is the most important takeaway , " said Mr Munster .
That was a view echoed by Barclays Capital analyst Ben Reitzes .
" We believe it is positive that Jobs is healthy and enthusiastic enough to lead Apple , which is an important element of the short - and long - term investment cases for Apple , " Mr Reitzes wrote in a research note to clients .
Although investors typically sell Apple stock after a launch event , he said the presentation should be seen as a " warm - up " for a " re-engaged Steve Jobs " .
While Apple 's shares have doubled in value since the start of the year , they fell 0.9 % on the day to $ 171.41 ( £ 105 ) .
Prices lowered Mr Jobs did not dwell on the issue of his own health for very long .
Minutes after the show kicked off , the Apple boss got down to business .
The chief executive showcased a new iPod Nano with a built - in video camera , FM tuner and voice recorder ranging from £ 115 to £ 135 in the UK and $ 149 - $ 179 in the US .
The new iPod Nano with video camera comes in a variety of colours Mr Jobs called the Nano " the most popular music player in the world " , with more than 100 million sold to date .
The company revealed that as a whole , it has sold more than 220 million iPods and now commands 73.8 % of the market , compared with Microsoft 's 1.1 % .
Apple also lowered the prices of existing iPods and introduced a new 32GB and 64GB iPod Touch that it promised would run faster than previous models .
Mr Jobs earlier turned the spotlight on a revamped iTunes program that includes app management , home sharing and the ability to buy lyrics , memorabilia and liner notes through an iTunes LP music feature .
" I think it 's really cool , but iTunes LP is n't going to sell albums , " said analyst Michael Gartenberg of Interpet .
" Good music will sell albums .
Still , it 's nice we are getting back some of the stuff we lost with the CD , " he told Wired.com Mr Jobs said that iTunes was now the world 's number one music retailer with 100 million registered users .
' Disappointment '
At the end of the day , the products the company unveiled left some feeling underwhelmed .
" The common sentiment everyone always feels after an Apple press conference is a sense of delight at some of the cool things but also some disappointment that all of the wildly crazy rumours did n't come true , " Dean Takahashi of Venturebeat.com told BBC News .
The award - winning Norah Jones performed two songs at the event " So that meant no Apple tablet and no Beatles heading to the iTunes store .
I did think there were a couple of cool things like the iPod Nano camera .
You almost expect them to come up with something more innovative but there was no big wow moment , " said Mr Takahashi .
" It was kind of a non-event , " Piper Jaffray 's Mr Munster said .
" It was all about the iPod today and in terms of competition they are still running away with the show .
Our biggest question is what is going to happen in the next six months .
The Apple Tablet is what we want to hear about and it's going to address this mid-market as people look for portability with their computing .
" This is a niche they really need to address in the coming months , " said Mr Munster .

A class action lawsuit has been filed against Apple and AT&T in the Eastern District of Louisiana on the grounds that Apple 's " print and video advertisements [ for the iPhone 3G S ] in and on television , the Internet , the radio , newspapers , and direct mailers all touted the availability of MMS , " but the functionality remains unavailable .
The complaint , filed one week ago , says " Millions of customers , including Louisiana residents , purchased the 3G and 3G S waiting for the day in June 2009 when the new application would be available which would allow MMS .
Unfortunately , after downloading the new 3.0 software update application , MMS still did not work on both the 3G and 3G S ... The only excuse offered by AT&T and Apple is a mouse - print disclaimer on the Web site , in barely readable font , which reads ' MMS Support from AT&T coming in late summer . '
The complaint estimates that at least 10,000 individuals could eventually comprise the class .

Apple fans who have heard the story are already jumping on the issue .
Seth Weintraub of 9 to 5 Mac said " Frankly , MMS is a dinosaur of a technology and wo n't be around in 5 years .
It also enables telcos to charge you for something that should be free .
You can accomplish everything MMS does on mobile e-mail so long as your recipient has e-mail on their phone . "
However , MMS is still a common method of sharing media between phones , and the issue at hand is AT&T and Apple 's alleged customer deception .
The suit cites an Apple troubleshooting article under the heading , " To send and receive MMS messages on your iPhone 3G , do the following ... " which links to a page showing carriers that support MMS .
" Clicking on that hyperlink leads to a page showing several countries , " the suit says .
" Clicking on North America and Viewing the graph for USA under the headline ' AT&T , ' it shows that AT&T is not a carrier which offers MMS !
Of course , AT&T is the only carrier in the United States used by the iPhone .
In other words , AT&T 's towers do not support MMS . "
" When and if AT&T finally upgrades its towers , the millions of iPhone purchasers will get what they bargained for in terms of MMS , " the complaint continues .
" But in the meantime , all the millions of purchasers of the 3G and 3G S iPhone have been deceived and cheated out of what they thought they were purchasing -- a phone with MMS functionality . "
This is the latest in a series of keen , green - leaning Apple accessories , like the iPhone stands made of wood or the steampunk - esque iPod case .
Josh Darrah , an Australian graphic designer , crafted this iPod Mini case entirely in wood — with a nifty matching charger dock .
Darrah told Stuff he spent about four weekends to craft the case out of just $ 12 USD in materials — Australian red cedar for the main shell and Camphor Laurel for the click wheel and base .
He used screws instead of glue , making it a little greener ( he did employ some double sided tape to secure the clickwheel ) .

“ I was given a new iPod Mini for Christmas and I just could n’t leave my trusty old Mini to sit unused somewhere , ” he commented on Flickr .
“ So I decided to finally try a wooden shell mod on him that I had wanted to do for a long time . ”

Dr. Marcia Angell is a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School and former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine .
A longtime critic of the pharmaceutical industry , she has called for an end to market - driven delivery of health care in the United States .
She spoke with freelance writer Anne Underwood .
Q .
President Obama hopes to increase the number of Americans with insurance and to rein in costs .
Do you believe any of the plans under consideration by Congress will accomplish those goals ?
A .
They wo n’t , and that ’s the essential problem .
If you keep health care in the hands of for - profit companies , you can do one or the other — increase coverage by putting more money into the system , or control costs by decreasing coverage .
But you cannot do both unless you change the basic structure of the system .
Q .
Segments of the health care industry — pharmaceutical companies , for instance — are promising to cut costs .
A .
It ’s not going to happen .
These are investor - owned companies .
Their fiduciary responsibility is to maximize profits .
If they behaved like charities , heads would roll in the executive suites .
Q .
But what about market mechanisms for reducing costs ?
Would n’t the public option , for instance , provide competition for the insurance companies ?
“ I ’m afraid the president squandered a good opportunity . ”
A .
Theoretically it would , but I doubt the public plan will pass .
Industry is lobbying against it , and the president has not said this is a “ must . ”
Even if it does pass , I ’m afraid the private insurance industry will use their clout in Congress — and they have enormous clout in Congress — to hobble the public option and use it as a dumping ground for the sickest while they cream off the young and healthy for themselves .
Q .
How ?
Wo n’t insurance companies have to cover all applicants regardless of health status ?
A .
It ’s hard to regulate an enormous industry without setting up a bureaucracy to oversee it .
That ’s very expensive and creates a whole new set of problems .
Q .
How about the individual mandate ?
Would n’t it reduce costs per capita by bringing in young , healthy people who are currently uninsured ?
A .
No .
In Massachusetts [ which enacted an individual mandate in 2006 ] , there is no real price regulation .
Essentially what the mandate does is say to people , you will go into this treacherous market and buy insurance at whatever price the companies choose to charge .
In effect , it ’s delivering a captive market to these profit - oriented companies .
Q .
Are people at least getting better health care in Massachusetts now ?
A .
Massachusetts already spends one - third more on health care than other states , and costs are rising at unsustainable rates .
As a result , they ’re chipping away at benefits , dropping beneficiaries and increasing premiums and co-payments .
Q .
Then what ’s the path to meaningful cost control ?
A .
The only way to both control costs and have universal comprehensive coverage is a single - payer system — a nonprofit , single - payer system .
Nothing else will work .
All other advanced countries have some form of a single - payer system , and they pay less than half as much per person as we do .
We should be asking , why is that so ?
It ’s not because we provide more basic services .
We do provide more tests and procedures for those who can pay , but not more basic services — and we do n’t cover everybody .
So why is it so ?
We are the only advanced country that delivers health care in a system that ’s set up to generate profits , not to provide care .
Q .
If a single - payer system is n’t feasible politically , are n’t the current proposals at least better than doing nothing ?
Is n’t half an aspirin better than none ?
A .
I think not .
As costs continue to soar , people will not say , “ That did n’t work .
Let ’s try a single - payer system . ”
Instead , they ’ll try to pay for the costs in piecemeal ways , by increasing co-pays and deductibles , by limiting services , by making the system less equitable and less comprehensive .
I ’m afraid the lesson they ’ll draw is that universal care is impossible .
But I ’m not convinced that getting a single - payer system now is politically infeasible .
The public would be happy with Medicare for all .
Polls have shown that the public loves Medicare .
The problem is n’t the public .
It ’s Congress , which caves in to special interests .
Q .
If Congress is reluctant to cut out the insurance companies , is that partly because they , like the major banks , are too big to fail ?
A .
A nonprofit , single - payer system would lead to job losses in this sector , which constitutes 17 percent of the economy .
But what about the other 83 percent of the economy ?
They ’re being bled to death .
Businesses can’t compete globally because the cost of providing coverage to their workers is so exorbitant .
Whatever loss of jobs you might see would be more than offset by benefits and job gains in the rest of the economy .
[ As for the insurance companies , ] you could introduce the program incrementally .
You could do it state by state .
Or probably better , you could do it decade by decade .
Medicare kicks in at age 65 .
In the first stage , you could take it down to 55 .
Between 55 and 65 , people are vulnerable .
They ’re losing jobs , losing health care .
They ’re starting to have more medical needs .
After a few years , you could drop it to 45 , then 35 .
It would give insurance companies time to adjust .
Q .
But Medicare is already hugely expensive .
How can we afford such a plan for everyone ?
A .
Medicare costs are rising at an unsustainable rate because care is provided in a profit - maximizing system .
The prescription drug benefit was nothing but a bonanza for the pharmaceutical industry .
I would change that .
I would also adjust the fee schedule , which preferentially rewards highly paid specialists for very expensive tests and procedures .
For the system to work , it would have to be a nonprofit delivery system .
Q .
How much could we save in administrative costs ?
A .
On average , the private insurance industry takes 15 to 20 percent right off the top of the premium dollar for its administrative costs and profits .
That ’s a lot to siphon off by an industry that adds almost nothing of value .
It ’s just a middleman .
Medicare has overhead costs of less than 3 percent .
With the money in the system right now , we could cover everyone for every medically necessary service .
But the system has to be distributed according to medical need and not as it currently is — as a commodity .
Today , those who can pay get lots of M.R.I. ’s they do n’t need , while those who are uninsured can go without ones they do need .
Q .
Military historians say we ’re always fighting the last war .
Is Mr. Obama now fighting the last health care war , in which Congress rejected the Clinton plan partly because it was developed without consulting other interested parties ?
A .
Yes .
Mr. Obama has decided that he will listen to everybody .
But it ’s not working for him , because the public ca n’t become enthusiastic about a plan that does n’t exist .
That ’s what he ’s asking .
Now Congress has gone home , and for the next month the special interests will be out there scaring people with stories of rationing and socialized medicine .
Q .
Is the president really bringing everyone to the table ?
A .
He ’s bringing everyone to the table except the single - payer people .
It ’s very odd .
When he was a state senator , he emphatically favored a single - payer system .
And in his July 22 press conference on health care , he stated that the only way to provide universal health care is with a single - payer system .
Then he moved right on , as if that was somehow self - evidently absurd .
Q .
So are you opposing this reform ?
A .
I am , though not for the same reasons as the Republicans and Blue Dogs .
I ’m opposing it more in sorrow than in anger .
I ’m afraid the president squandered a good opportunity .
UNIVERSITY offers more than the chance to indulge in a few years of debauchery .
A new report from the OECD , a rich country think - tank , attempts to measure how much more graduates can expect to earn compared with those who seek jobs without having a degree .
In America the lifetime gross earnings of male graduates are , on average , nearly $ 370,000 higher than those of non-graduates , comfortably repaying the pricey investment in a university education ( female graduates earn an extra $ 229,000 ) .
In South Korea and Spain female graduates pull in a lot more than their male counterparts .
In Turkey , although the additional wages are more modest , the difference between men and women is far less pronounced .

Back in August , the UK government administration ( collectively known as Whitehall ) was criticized by Members of Parliament for failing to meet their own carbon emission targets .
On September 15 , UK Cabinet Office minister Angela Smith claimed in a BBC article that Whitehall had “ saved enough carbon dioxide to fill almost 2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools . ”
2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools sounds like a lot .
Swimming pools are big , after all , and 2,500 of them would hold lots of water .
But when I dug a little further , I found that Whitehall ’s carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions were actually reduced by only 12,000 tonnes , a nearly negligible amount .
To put this into perspective , in 2006 , the Energy Information Administration estimated that the total emissions for the United Kingdom was 585.71 million metric tons ( aka tonnes ) .
12,000 tonnes is only 2 thousandths of one percent of the UK ’s total emissions three years ago .
So how did we get from 12,000 tonnes to “ 2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools ? ”
It ’s called the ideal gas equation .
Look at the image above – the equation shown is the ideal gas equation , where P is pressure , V is volume , n is the number of moles of gas ( a measurement of the number of atoms of gas , which id directly proportional to the mass of the gas ) , R is the universal gas constant , and T is the temperature of the gas on the Kelvin scale ( Kelvin is equal to degrees Celsius + 273.15 ) .
While the ideal gas equation does n’t perfectly represent the real behavior of gases , it ’s close enough that it ’s pretty commonly used by scientists and engineers alike .
If you look deeper into the equation , you find that it shows essentially three relationships :
Gas pressure increases when you add more gas to a constant volume at a constant temperature .
Gas pressure also increases when you heat the gas up at a constant volume and constant mass of gas .
And gas pressure increases if you reduce the volume the gas is contained in for a constant amount of gas and a constant gas temperature .
( Pressure varies proportionally to mass and temperature and inversely proportionally with volume . )
Gas volume increases when you add more gas at a constant temperature and pressure .
Gas volume goes up if you heat it up at a constant pressure and mass of gas .
And gas volume goes up if you reduce the pressure for a constant amount of gas and gas temperature .
( Volume varies proportionally to mass and temperature and inversely proportionally to pressure . )
Gas temperature increases if you increase the pressure but while holding the volume and mass of gas constant .
Temperature also goes up if you increase the gas ’ volume while holding the pressure and mass of gas constant .
And temperature increases if you decrease the amount of gas in a constant volume and at a constant pressure .
( Temperature varies proportionally to pressure and volume and inversely proportionally to mass . )
Some of these seem counter - intuitive upon first examination , but these properties of ideal gases are used all the time to produce liquid gases , pressurize oxygen for use in medical O 2 canisters , even to cool your body by evaporation .
Using the density of CO 2 gas , a value that is calculated using the ideal gas law , Smith or her staff calculated the volume that 12,000 tonnes of CO 2 would take up at a given atmospheric pressure and temperature .
At one atmosphere ( atm ) of pressure and a temperature of 273.15 Kelvin ( 0 °C ) , 12,000 tonnes of CO 2 takes up 2,427.9 Olympic - sized swimming pools .
And that ’s close enough to the reported value of “ 2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools ” that it ’s reasonable to say that this calculation is almost certainly where Smith got her swimming pool number from .
( When I looked up the volume of an Olympic - sized swimming pool , I found that the volume is at least 2,500 cubic meters ( or 2.5 million liters ) , but could be greater if the pool is deeper than the minimum 2.0 meters required by Olympic standards . )
But that ’s not the end of it .
The density of CO 2 gas is defined at a particular pressure and temperature , specifically 1 atm and 0 °C .
If you cut the mass of gas to 6,000 tonnes ( a reduction of n by 1/2 ) and held the temperature and the volume the same ( 0 °C and 2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools respectively ) , all that would happen is that the pressure would fall to 0.5 atm .
Similarly , cutting the mass of CO 2 by a factor of 100 ( from 12,000 to 120 tonnes ) would still fill up 2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools – at an atmospheric pressure of only 0.01 atmospheres .
So Smith could just as accurately , from the standpoint of physics , claimed that nearly any amount of reductions produced a volume of “ 2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools . ”
And given the fact that the BBC article neglected to mention that the mass of the reductions was 12,000 tonnes , no -one who just read the BBC would have caught the deception .
It seems reasonably likely that the reason that Ms. Smith or her staff converted mass into volume specifically because Whitehall would look better , and thus deflect some criticism , using the larger volume number .
But the problem is that the exact same physics games can be used to make exceptional progress in cutting emissions look insignificant .
Here ’s three quick examples .
Just as 2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools can be the volume of a gas at 0.01 atm , it can be the volume of CO 2 gas at 10 atm too – crank the pressure up to 10 atm , hold the temperature and volume the same , and shazam !
those swimming pools now hold 120,000 tonnes of CO 2 gas .
Better yet – compress CO 2 until it becomes a liquid ( at 56 atm and 20 °C ) and you increase the density of the CO 2 from 0.001977 kg/ L to 0.77 kg/L , an increase of 389x .
Suddenly someone who is trying to downplay a reduction of 4.81 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions can claim , perfectly accurately according to the physics , that it only fits into 2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools ( the math is 2.5 million L/ossp * 0.77 kg/L * 2,500 ossp , where “ ossp ” is “ Olympic - sized swimming pool ” ) .
Even better – turn CO 2 into dry ice at 1 atm and - 78.5 °C and you more than double the density again .
Now those same 2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools represent 9.76 million tonnes of CO 2 .
For comparison , 9.76 million tonnes of CO 2 represents about 1.67 % of the UK ’s entire CO 2 emissions in 2006 .
That ’s a far cry from the 0.002 % that Smith attempts to trumpet by way of her “ 2,500 Olympic - sized swimming pools ” quote in the BBC and Kable articles
Clearly , using volume as a proxy for the value you really care about is almost entirely meaningless .
Sticking with mass , even when it makes you look bad , is by far the more accurate and directly comparable measurement .

– Dennis " Corin Tucker 's Stalker " Farrell ( @DennisFarrell )
Sir Elton John has come out in support of measures to crack down on music piracy by cutting off the internet connections of persistent illegal filesharers .
In a letter to the business secretary , Lord Mandelson , he said : " I am of the view that the unchecked proliferation of illegal downloading ( even on a " non-commercial " basis ) will have a seriously detrimental effect on musicians , and particularly young musicians and those composers who are not performing artists . "
The letter comes as talks to heal a growing rift in the music industry over piracy broke down today , with a group of artists including Pink Floyd 's Nick Mason , Billy Bragg and Tom Jones accusing labels of stubbornness .
The artists are part of the Featured Artists Coalition , whose members also include Annie Lennox and Blur 's Dave Rowntree .
The FAC took the rest of the music industry by surprise by publicly announcing that it has " agreed to disagree " with labels over government proposals to suspend the internet connections of persistent filesharers .
But the debate is also dividing big - name artists , with Lily Allen , James Blunt and John , all taking issue with the views of the FAC .
Frantic talks over the last week between record companies , music lobby groups and the FAC have failed to reach a consensus on Mandelson 's planned law ahead of a consultation deadline for comments next week .
The FAC said in a statement : " We have negotiated in good faith with the labels all week , but they remain wedded to the idea of suspension of accounts .
We remain steadfast in our belief that making threats against individual music fans is not an effective way to resolve any problems associated with filesharing . "
Many internet service providers and consumer groups share concerns over how such laws would be enforced , with the risk of the penalising innocent internet users .
But more and more artists are coming out in defence of legal measures , echoing labels ' comments that filesharing is hampering investment in new acts .
There are fears within the industry that the public divisions between artists could derail the long - running fight against piracy just when new laws are close .
Lily Allen has set up a blog titled " It 's Not Alright " ( in reference to her first album Alright , Still ) collating the views of artists after her own comments that " filesharing is a disaster " for new talent .
James
Blunt has also now waded in , welcoming government proposals .
" Peter Mandelson is looking to engage the internet service providers who , in my opinion , handle stolen goods , and should take much more responsibility , " he wrote in a letter to the Times .
" How this legislation pans out , and if it goes through at all , is critical to the survival of the British music business ; critical to thousands of jobs ; and critical to our ability to nurture and develop great musicians and the songs and albums that we would hope to listen to in the future . "
Allen condemned FAC's Mason and fellow coalition member Ed O'Brien from Radiohead , for implying " file sharing music is fine " .
She added : " It probably is fine for them .
They do sell - out arena tours and have the biggest Ferrari collections in the world . "
Allen attacked the FAC 's stance : " I want to make it clear that I 'm not after a fight with the Featured Artists Coalition – I want us artists to stand together on this – but they 've released a new statement which just does n't make sense .
The FAC seems to be viewing the government 's proposed legislation as an attack on freedom and liberty , but stealing 's not really a human right , is it ? "
The FAC said it had been misinterpreted .
The coalition described as " maverick " by some in the industry went on record citing " evidence that repeat file - sharers of music are also repeat purchasers of music " .
But it argues today that its opposition to broadband suspension for repeat filesharers has been taken to " imply that we condone illicit file - sharing .
This is not the case and never has been . "
" However , we seriously question the wisdom of seeking to deal with this problem by terminating the internet connections of individual music fans . "
They demand government action on websites that make money from illegal filesharing , which they describe as " thieving rascals " .
" The focus of our objection is the proposed treatment of ordinary music fans who download a few tracks so as to check out our material before they buy .
For those of us who do n't get played on the radio or mentioned in the music media … peer - to - peer recommendation is an important form of promotion . "

The BBC will continue not to allow product placement Product placement is to be allowed on British TV shows , in a move due to be announced next week .
Independent broadcasters will be allowed to take payments for displaying commercial products during shows .
The change is intended to bring in extra funds for commercial broadcasters .
Experts believe it could raise up to £ 100 m a year .
There are currently strict rules against product placement and this ban would remain in place on BBC shows .
Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw is expected to announce a three - month consultation on the changes in a speech to the Royal Television Society next week .
An ITV spokesman welcomed the move , which he described as " reforming UK prohibition " .
He said : " If the government does decide to permit product placement , it will be warmly welcomed by the commercial broadcasting industry and advertisers alike .
" Reforming the UK prohibition would also be a welcome acknowledgement of the pressures currently faced by an industry in transition .
New sources of revenue means better - funded content - which can only be good news for viewers . "
You have to trust the consumer .
If it 's overdone or tasteless , viewers will switch off .
Peter Bazalgette , Big Brother creator
Plugging the gap in TV revenue
The spokesman added that ITV had led the campaign for product placement in the UK , and said it could be an important new revenue stream , as it already is in Europe .
The culture secretary 's predecessor , Andy Burnham , had said in March that " serious concerns " remained about product placement because it could harm editorial independence .
' Trust the consumer '
But the government now believes that placement should be allowed in some circumstances .
A spokesman for the Department of Culture , Media and Sport said the current situation puts the UK at a competitive disadvantage .
It is believed that ministers want to help struggling broadcasters such as ITV , which have been hit hard by the recession .
The change could mean that products will be much more visible in popular series such as Coronation Street and Britain 's Got Talent .
At present , the shows are forced to cover up labels to comply with the strict guidelines - or face fines .
It is hoped product placement will boost struggling broadcasters On Channel 4 's Big Brother , food and drink products consumed in the house come in packaging where any logos have been carefully obscured .
The ban would stay in place for the BBC and would continue to apply to all children 's programmes across all networks .
The creator of Big Brother , Peter Bazalgette , said product placement was already widespread and that lifting the ban was " hugely overdue " .
He said : " My prediction is that it could be worth £ 100 m a year to commercial TV .
" Product placement needs to be done transparently , with credits that make it clear it has taken place .
" But you have to trust the consumer .
If it 's overdone or tasteless , viewers will switch off .
" And it 's rife in British television anyway .
There 's product placement in movies that go on television and in imported American TV shows and dramas .
" And what about those sports events where sponsors ' logos are worn on shirts ?
Product placement wo n't dramatically change the way we watch TV . "
' Advertiser pressure ' Steven Barnett , professor of communications at the University of Westminster , said the viewing public might have trouble distinguishing between what was " integral to the plot " and what had been paid for " as some kind or promotional device " .
" I think we have to rely on the integrity of the programme makers which , when money is at stake , can sometimes be compromised , " he said .
" I think there are situations in which a programme or an independent company might be a little bit more desperate for the cash where they might go to an advertiser and say , ' Look , we can build in a couple of minutes ... with someone you 'll want to be associated with , how much are you prepared to pay for that ? '
" That 's the point at which I think we need to be clear about the boundaries between genuine creative independence and advertiser pressure . "

A plan to keep dozens of domestic - violence shelters from closing sailed out of the state Assembly late Friday night with nary a no vote .
Yet hours later , the bill lay in the legislative trash heap , one of many lost to politics as lawmakers reached the deadline for completing their work this year .
Republicans in the Senate blocked more than 20 bills -- all needing GOP votes to pass , many approved by the lower house with bipartisan or near - unanimous support -- to leverage a trio of unrelated demands .
Chief among those was the elimination of a program that allowed mostly low - income Californians to have the state do their tax returns free , something the maker of TurboTax has been trying to achieve for years .
The other demands , which Democrats say they were willing to meet , were putting a Republican name on a popular bill and tweaking corporate tax breaks passed months ago .
“ This is what they hold out for ? ” exasperated Senate leader Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) said shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday .

One by one , bills to keep the shelters open , help counties prepare for the next swine flu outbreak and blunt the effect of the state ’s raid on local funds , among others , fell as GOP senators refused to vote .
There ’s no policy dispute , most involved agreed , though Republicans said the blockade was n’t so much about the demands as the principle of trust .
Democrats , they said , broke promises that had sealed the summer ’s budget pact .
“ The point here is not one , two or three issues , ” said Senate GOP leader Dennis Hollingsworth ( R - Murrieta ) .
“ The point is one issue : We have to be able to abide by agreements . ”
Sen. Mark Leno ( D - San Francisco ) accused Republicans of “ extortion ” as important legislation failed .
Though Democrats hold the majority in each house , the disputed bills all required a two - thirds majority for various reasons .
Some Republican votes are needed to reach that mark , which gave the GOP a veto power .

Steinberg did not dispute that he promised Republicans that the Senate would consider scrapping ReadyReturn , the state tax program , which in the end the upper house refused to do .
But Steinberg still bristled at the GOP obstruction .
“ The inside political game here does not matter to the people , ” he said .
It matters a great deal to interest groups .
Intuit , which makes TurboTax , has spent $ 618,000 on lobbying in Sacramento since 2007 and donated to the campaigns of 29 of the 40 state senators since 2005 .
In 2006 , the company spent $ 1 million trying to elect Tony Strickland ( R- Moorpark ) as state controller .
He lost that race but is now a senator who took part in Friday ’s blockade .

Strickland said he did not see any conflict of interest in holding out for the dismantling of ReadyReturn .
“ I ’ve always thought it was wrong to use taxpayer dollars to compete with private enterprise , ” he said .
Tara Shabazz , director of the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence , said she was unhappy to be collateral damage amid the partisan warfare .
“ To find out that we got caught up in petty politics is disheartening , ” she said .

The measure to allot $ 16 million to shelters passed 76 to 0 in the Assembly .
But it died in the Senate even with two GOP senators as coauthors .
“ It was a tremendous let - down , ” said Sen. Leland Yee ( D - San Francisco ) , whose name was on the measure , SBX3 13 , until it was stripped off in a spat among Democrats .
Six shelters across the state have already closed .
Other items caught in the blockade :
* A measure to ease borrowing for cities and counties .
The state took $ 1.9 billion of their funds this summer and has three years to repay it .
Municipalities hope to borrow from Wall Street to bridge the gap .
The failure of SB 67 , by the Senate budget committee , will cost cities and counties about $ 200 million more to do that , said Paul McIntosh , executive director of the California State Assn. of Counties .
That makes more cuts to police and fire departments likely , he said .

* Federal money for the next swine flu outbreak .
SB 769 , by Sen. Elaine Alquist ( D - Santa Clara ) , would have distributed federal funds to counties .
Local agencies could now lose out on at least $ 42 million in newly allocated funds , and possibly tens of millions more in future grants , said Bruce Pomer , executive director of the Health Officers Assn. of California .
Most of the stalled bills can be taken up later , Hollingsworth said .
Lawmakers are expected to return soon to Sacramento for special fall sessions on several issues .
Still , the bickering and the stymied programs have left a poor aftertaste .
“ I ’m still sick to my stomach , ” said Sen. Abel Maldonado ( R - Santa Maria ) , the lone GOP lawmaker who broke ranks to support many of the blockaded bills .
“ I just felt that we were going to give away a whole forest for a tree . ”

Sir Howard Morrison 's final interview aired just yesterday and included plenty of " silly talk " before ending with " god bless " .
Veteran Dunedin broadcaster Neil Collins says he will always remember Sir Howard Morrison 's final words in a radio interview .
" He said ' God bless you Neil. Goodbye ' . "
It happened just yesterday .
Sir Howard died peacefully in his sleep today .
Mr Collins said they spoke in the language the Howard Morrison Quartet and friends had adopted in years past , with tenses swapped and consonants switched - boy would become doy and ' how are you ? ' would become ' would you be doy ' .
" We had this silly talk as we did , and he said ' well Doy why do n't we do it ( interview ) now ?
I said , ' well if you are happy Doy , let 's do that ' and turned the switch on .
I 'm just so pleased we did it . "
Rotorua Review FAMILY AFFAIR : Sir Howard Morrison 's nephews , Temuera and Monty Morrison address today 's press conference at Ohinemutu .
Sir Howard is to be laid to rest at Rotorua 's Kauae Cemetery on Tuesday , following a funeral service scheduled for 11 am that morning .
He will be buried alongside members of his whanau who have gone before him .
In accordance with the wishes of his immediate family he will lie at his Ohinemutu home tonight before being carried the few metres to Tamatekapua , the premier meeting house of Te Arawa where his public tangi will be held tomorrow from about 10am .
Tuesday has been chosen for Sir Howard 's farewell to allow his numerous relatives and friends from overseas the opportunity to farewell him .
Sir Howard , 74 , who had a history of heart problems had just returned from a holiday in Rarotonga .
Family spokesman Temuera Morrison said his uncle 's farewell would be a " huge celebration of a great life " .
" Uncle would like it like that .
He had the great ability to see celebration in everything .
This is the way he wanted to go . "
He said it had already become obvious that Sir Howard was a very popular man .
" So many accolades are already flowing in – the phone is ringing red hot . "
His uncle had died peacefully in bed at his own home .
" He 's got a little smile on his face . "
Morrison said a number of Ohinemutu residents had noted that a " funny kind of surreal mist " had been hanging over the village at the time of Sir Howard 's passing .
" Maybe he hopped on that , crossed the waters ( of Lake Rotorua ) and visited Mokoia Island as he started his great journey onward . "
As well as having a beautiful voice Sir Howard always had an element of cheek about him , Morrison said .
He liked to ' sus ' people out to see where they were coming from .
He was very charismatic , performing everywhere .
He had a remarkable following and the special gift of feeling an audience as he worked his way to his crescendo .
After his own father 's death , members of his immediate family had been guided by their uncle Howard , Morrison said .
" He held a kind of awe for us , there was this mystique about him , but to us he was a father figure guiding us to stand on our own feet and hold our own . "
He had fond memories of his uncle returning from a trip to the East with toy machine guns for young whanau members to play with .
" Things popped out the back – they had all the gears , we 'd never seen anything like it . "
He said as well as his Rotorua roots through the iwi of Te Arawa and its Ngati Whakaue hapu , Sir Howard had strong links with the Tuhoe , spending most of his early years in the Ureweras .
Sir Howard had a close affiliation with his home village of Ohinemutu and only recently sung at the Rotorua RSA to raise funds for St Faith 's church and Whakaturia whare kai ( dining room ) .
His cousin , Monty Morrison , said it had been a huge honour to have one of its own knighted .
Tribal members were preparing to welcome guests from throughout the country .
Among the first to pay tribute and extend condolences was Dame Malvina Major with whom sir Howard had frequently sung and toured .
Sir Howard 's family were aware of the number of heartfelt tributes pouring on to websites in recognition of his great talent .
" They are very touched .
It is very warming , very heartening , " Monty Morrison said .
TRIBUTES FLOW
Prime Minister John Key paid tribute to Sir Howard from New York , where he is at the United Nations , calling him " a real gentleman " .
He said Sir Howard had made an immense contribution to New Zealand music over more than 50 years .
" Sir Howard was a New Zealand success story .
From humble beginnings he became an international success , first with the Howard Morrison Quartet , and then in an illustrious solo career .
" But more than that , Sir Howard was one of New Zealand ’s best loved entertainers , his appeal spanning every age group .
Sir Howard received his knighthood in 1990 for services to entertainment .
" My thoughts are with his whanau at this time .
Sir Howard Morrison will be greatly missed . "
Labour leader Phil Goff said Sir Howard was a great New Zealander and a legend of entertainment for generations of Kiwis .
" He has been a huge part of New Zealand life for such a long time and will be missed by us all .
" I would like to extend my sympathies to Sir Howard 's whanau for their loss , " Mr Goff said .
Broadcaster Paul Holmes is leading the call of those saying Sir Howard Morrison deserves a new tribute – to be called the country 's greatest ever entertainer .
" I am spending some of today wondering if he is our greatest entertainer of all time .
Now I know you 've got the likes of Dame Malvina [ Major , opera singer ] and Dame Kiri [ Te Kanawa ] but in terms of being able to reach across the social divides and the racial divides Sir Howard had no peer .
Howard could make anyone laugh and his presence on stage demanded attention . "
" I think he was probably our greatest all rounder . "
Mr Holmes said Sir Howard was " such a professional " with a great sense of humour , gracious and distinguished .
" He looked aristocratic actually . "
" It was an amazing career .
Sir Howard is the first NZ entertainer I remember in my life and he was still going 50 years later . "
In 1958 the Howard Morrison Quartet recorded My Old Man's an All Black which dealt with a controversial rugby tour of South Africa .
Mr Holmes said : " My Old Man's an All Black was genuine social commentary and it enabled us to laugh at a very painful thing which was the South African exclusion of Maori from the All Black team , while at the same time making us aware that it was wrong , wrong , wrong .
Yet Howard could make us laugh about it . "
Rotorua - based Labour MP Steve Chadwick said Sir Howard lived a rich and full life that he shared with the Rotorua community and all of New Zealand .
" Sir Howard loved the song I Did It My Way and he certainly lived up to the words he sung so beautifully , " Ms Chadwick said .
" To politicians he was someone who was determined to hold us to account and to keep us honest , but he was always welcoming to us no matter what side of the political divide we were on . "
Rotorua National MP
Todd McClay has said he was greatly saddened to learn of Sir Howard 's death .
" Sir Howard was an exceptional entertainer .
He was a real statesman and a man who led by example .
Rotorua has lost one of its proud sons today , " Mr McClay said .
" Howard Morrison has been at the forefront of New Zealand music for more than 50 years and his contribution was immense .
My thoughts and feelings go to Sir Howard 's family on what must be a very difficult time . "
Sir Howard had frequent dealings with the political world and was a strong advocate on Maori health , education and development issues .
Last year it came to light that expat billionaire Owen Glenn offered Sir Howard $ 1 million to stand for Parliament .
" We got on so well he actually offered me a million dollars to stand as a Member of Parliament as an independent .
I turned him down , " Sir Howard said at the time .
One of Sir Howard 's enduring legacies was his encouragement of family into the entertainment business .
He sang at the launch of young relative and now rising international soprano Elizabeth Marvelly 's self - titled debut album two years ago .
Marvelly 's father , Rotorua hotelier Brett Marvelly , said he rang her in Germany this morning to tell her of the news of Sir Howard 's death .
" She is , of course , very sad .
She had a very strong emotional connection to him , she respected him so much for all the right reasons .
. .
He taught her so much . "
In recent years Elizabeth Marvelly had toured extensively with Sir Howard and Dame Malvina Major and was among those who performed at a televised concert staged in Rotorua in his honour last year .
Remi Morrison , 83 , said he was Sir Howard 's first cousin and the Koro Matua , or great grandfather of the family .
He said he had only heard the news a short time before spoken to by Stuff.
co.nz and said it was a " shock to all the family . "
He expected the tangi to be huge and said it would be held at the Tamatekapua meeting house on the Ohinemutu marae in Rotorua .
" It 's going to be a big occasion for Howard , " he said .
Sir Howard was due to sing the national anthem at the David Tua v Shane Cameron heavyweight boxing match in Hamilton next week .
Ray Woolf , who for 12 years appeared on adverts for Bic pens with Sir Howard on television , said he was extremely talented with an indefinable magic .
" He had a magic in his eye , when he went on stage he could just have that audience in the palm of his hand . "
" He had a great attitude … he was very talented ; extremely talented , " Woolf he told Radio New Zealand .
" He was very , very funny . "
Woolf said he was aware of Morrison 's poor health .
Although his voice had suffered a little during his illness , it had kept its " sparkle " .
Alongside his singing he was also a ground breaking comedian , doing the type of comedy that Billy T James later perfected .
Dennis Brown , music promoter who worked with Sir Howard , called him " an inspirational man " and a " unique talent " when speaking to RNZ .
Sir Howard had a magic about him and was the equal of any international star , he said .
He once opened for Tom Jones on tour .
" He was held in awe by entertainers who saw him perform . "
Yet he was a modest man who never " big noted " and his family always came first .
" I think Howard had sheer talent and a natural exuberance and of course a wonderful voice .
" He could do it so easily . "
Mr Brown said the Howard Morrison Quartet , in which Sir Howard came to fame , had been of such quality it could have performed on any international stage – and Sir Howard was the driving force .
" He was always ahead of his time . "
TVNZ said today it would rescreen the programme , To Sir With Love , on TV One tomorrow at 8.30 pm .
Sir Howard , who had a history of heart problems , died in Rotorua this morning .
He had recently returned from a holiday in Rarotonga .
He had a singing career for more than 50 years , gaining fame as his Howard Morrison Quartet ran up a string of hits in the late 1950s and 1960s .
He was awarded an OBE in 1976 and was knighted in 1990 .
Of mixed Maori and Pakeha ancestry , Sir Howard was born in 1935 into a Rotorua family renowned for its entertainment skills .
He was married to Kuia , Lady Morrison , for 52 years .
They had two sons and a daughter .
PARLIAMENTARY TRIBUTES
Tributes were also paid to Sir Howard when Parliament sat today .
Maori Party co-leader Dr Pita Sharples said Sir Howard 's music , and his style of entertainment , transcended national and cultural boundaries to lift the spirits of people great and small in every corner of the world .
" Howard took the songs of our people , the songs of his beloved village of Ohinemutu to the world , " Dr Sharples said .
" He touched the hearts of New Zealanders with his incredible talent , never finer than in the Royal Command Performance in 1981 , when his rendition of Whakaari Mai ( How Great thou art ) made us all proud . "
The party 's other co-leader Tariana Turia said Sir Howard would also be remembered for his devotion to people .
" Sir Howard was able to utilise his distinctive status to support rangatahi Maori in being able to have dreams and to believe the world was theirs , " Mrs Turia said .
" That was perhaps his greatest gift to Aotearoa – that he instilled a fierce sense of pride in us all . "
Leader of the House Gerry Brownlee said Sir Howard was a giant kauri tree of New Zealand music .
" He was always a foremost New Zealander with a deep - seated bond and love for his country , for his home town and for his people , " he said .
" Sir Howard was never shy with his time and talent to help Maori or the Government in a positive way .
He is a New Zealander whose passing will be mourned by us all . "
Progressive leader Jim Anderton said Sir Howard was more than a world - class and unique entertainer ; he was a fierce advocate for a fair go for all New Zealanders .
" Sir Howard was passionately committed to the economic development of New Zealand and in particular for Maori economic development and an equal place for Maori in New Zealand society , " Mr Anderton said .
" He never sought political glory , even though he was driven by strong convictions and beliefs all his life . "
United Future leader Peter Dunne said Sir Howard 's death was a great loss to New Zealand .
" Sir Howard contributed in so many ways to our nation , including with his commitment to charity and the good of others less fortunate than himself , " Mr Dunne said .
" He was indeed a gentleman , and with style and panache to match his talent . "
Labour MP
Shane Jones said he was a revered figure who brought New Zealand together .
" Sir Howard , you will not wholly die .
Your sentiments will live on in our personality as New Zealanders . "
Green Party MP Jeanette Fitzsimons said Sir Howard was a great entertainer whose commitment to Maori youth and education had came to the fore .
" For half a century , Sir Howard entertained , inspired New Zealanders and made us laugh .
That is a great gift , and it is one for which he is dearly loved , " she said .
" This was a life of service in so many ways .
He will be greatly missed . "
ACT MP Heather Roy said Sir Howard was an entertainer , statesman and true New Zealand icon .
" As well as using music to cross national and cultural boundaries , he devoted so much of his life to his people and made enormous contributions , " she said .
" In his lifetime , Sir Howard touched the hearts of people throughout the world , and with his passing New Zealand as a nation has lost one of its beloved sons . "
When speeches were completed Parliament adopted a motion to mark the passing of Sir Howard Morrison and stood to observe a moment 's silence .

Did n't know that did you ?
I did n't either .
Fifteen years ago , I had taught at an area prison that had a dramatic image that I wanted to capture on camera .
I wanted the image for a book I 'm publishing on Smashwords.com , Renata With Love , in which a prison figures prominently .
It would have made a dramatic cover .
So , I thought , why not drive down the way I used to go to teach there , and take a couple of pictures with my new digital camera .
Bad idea !
I had forgotten , if I ever knew , that taking pictures of the prison was a no - no .
Since I did n't have a digital camera when I taught there , and had had no reason to want to take a picture of it , I probably never paid attention .
It 's actually a state crime !
I came up towards the visiting room entrance , having taken a panoramic view ; I was going to take pictures along the wall , with the bucolic setting in the distance .
I snapped one .
One of two guards asked me what I was doing .

Week one , Planetshakers .
Week two , the Quakers .
Week three , and in the final instalment of my interrogating - reality triptych , I sat through Sunday Mass on the same pew I grew up on at my childhood parish .
But this time with my atheist sons .
How did they become atheists ?
That 's the way they were born .
Entering the cathedral of misogyny , deception , manipulation , chauvinism , hypocrisy and bigotry , all wrapped up in " If you do n't swallow this hook , line and sinker you 're going to hell " , felt like coming home .
I 'm not bitter , just being descriptive and honest .
Going back was fabulous because it reminded me I 'd escaped .
Under the same roof where I 'd been baptised , confirmed and brainwashed , my six - year - old asked : " Where 's the Pope ? " I laughed .
Until the 11 - year - old said : " Here he comes . "
The priest , obviously drawn by the unusual sight of new people , approached us to welcome us to his flock .
I shot out my hand .
" Hi , I 'm Catherine . "
All the blood drained from his face .
" You 're that writer ? " " Yes , " I replied .
I happily introduced my sons , who , in an uncharacteristic display of manners , shook the priest 's hand and said , " Nice to meet you . "
The priest wandered off in a daze .
Or was it a trance ?
Maybe it was religious melancholy .
So accustomed are we to the sunshine , rain , fog and snow of our home planet that we find it next to impossible to imagine a different atmosphere and other forms of precipitation .
To be sure , Dr. Seuss came up with a green gluey substance called oobleck that fell from the skies and gummed up the Kingdom of Didd , but it had to be conjured up by wizards and was clearly a thing of magic .
Not so the atmosphere of COROT - 7b , an exoplanet discovered last February by the COROT space telescope launched by the French and European space agencies .
According to models by scientists at Washington University in St. Louis , COROT - 7b's atmosphere is made up of the ingredients of rocks and when " a front moves in , " pebbles condense out of the air and rain into lakes of molten lava below .
The work , by Laura Schaefer , research assistant in the Planetary Chemistry Laboratory , and Bruce Fegley Jr. , Ph.D. , professor of earth and planetary sciences in Arts & Sciences , appears in the Oct. 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
Astronomers have found nearly 400 extra - solar planets , or exoplanets , in the past 20 years .
But because of the limitations of the indirect means by which they are discovered , most are Hot Jupiters , chubby gas giants orbiting close to their parent stars .
( More than 1,300 Earths could be packed inside Jupiter , which has 300 times the mass of Earth . )
COROT - 7b , on the other hand , is less than twice the size of Earth and only five times its mass .
It was the first planet found orbiting the star COROT - 7 , an orange dwarf in the constellation Monoceros , or the Unicorn .
( This priority is designated by the letter b. )
Solid as a Rock
In August 2009 a consortium of European observatories led by the Swiss reported the discovery of COROT - 7 c , a second planet orbiting COROT - 7 .
Using the data from both planets , they were able to calculate that COROT - 7b has an average density about the same as Earth's .
This means it is almost certainly a rocky planet made up of silicate rocks like those in Earth 's crust , says Fegley .
Not that anyone would call it Earth - like , much less hospitable to life .
The planet and its star are separated by only 1.6 million miles , 23 times less than the distance between the parboiled planet Mercury and our Sun .
Because the planet is so close to the star , it is gravitationally locked to it in the same way the Moon is locked to Earth .
One side of the planet always faces its star , just as one side of the Moon always faces Earth .
This star - facing side has a temperature of about 2600 degrees Kelvin ( 4220 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
That 's infernally hot -- hot enough to vaporize rocks .
The global average temperature of Earth 's surface , in contrast , is only about 288 degrees Kelvin ( 59 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
The side in perpetual shadow , on the other hand , is positively chilly at 50 degrees Kelvin ( - 369 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Perhaps because they were cooked off , COROT - 7b's atmosphere has none of the volatile elements or compounds that make up Earth 's atmosphere , such as water , nitrogen and carbon dioxide .
" The only atmosphere this object has is produced from vapor arising from hot molten silicates in a lava lake or lava ocean , " Fegley says .
What might that atmosphere be like ?
To find out Schaefer and Fegley have used thermochemical equilibrium calculations to model COROT - 7b's atmosphere .
The calculations , which reveal which mineral assemblages are stable under different conditions , were carried out with MAGMA , a computer program Fegley developed in 1986 with the late A. G. W. Cameron , a professor of astrophysics at Harvard University .
Schaefer and Fegley modified the MAGMA program in 2004 in order to study high - temperature volcanism on Io , Jupiter 's innermost Galilean satellite .
This modified version was used in their present work .
Raining Rocks
Because the scientists did n't know the exact composition of the planet , they ran the program with four different starting compositions .
" We got essentially the same result in all four cases , " says Fegley .
" Sodium , potassium , silicon monoxide and then oxygen -- either atomic or molecular oxygen -- make up most of the atmosphere . "
But there are also smaller amounts of the other elements found in silicate rock , such as magnesium , aluminum , calcium and iron .
Why is there oxygen on a dead planet , when it did n't show up in Earth 's atmosphere until 2.4 billion years ago , when plants started to produce it ?
" Oxygen is the most abundant element in rock , " says Fegley , " so when you vaporize rock what you end up doing is producing a lot of oxygen . "
The peculiar atmosphere has its own singular weather .
" As you go higher the atmosphere gets cooler and eventually you get saturated with different types of ' rock ' the way you get saturated with water in the atmosphere of Earth , " explains Fegley .
" But instead of a water cloud forming and then raining water droplets , you get a ' rock cloud ' forming and it starts raining out little pebbles of different types of rock . "
Even more strangely , the kind of rock condensing out of the cloud depends on the altitude .
The atmosphere works the same way as fractionating columns , the tall knobby columns that make petrochemical plants recognizable from afar .
In a fractionating column , crude oil is boiled and its components condense out on a series of trays , with the heaviest one ( with the highest boiling point ) sulking at the bottom , and the lightest ( and most volatile ) rising to the top .
Instead of condensing out hydrocarbons such as asphalt , petroleum jelly , kerosene and gasoline , the exoplanet 's atmosphere condenses out minerals such as enstatite , corundum , spinel , and wollastonite .
In both cases the fractions fall out in order of boiling point .
Elemental sodium and potassium , which have very low boiling points in comparison with rocks , do not rain out but would instead stay in the atmosphere , where they would form high gas clouds buffeted by the stellar wind from COROT - 7 .
These large clouds may be detectable by Earth - based telescopes .
The sodium , for example , should glow in the orange part of the spectrum , like a giant but very faint sodium vapor streetlamp .
Observers have recently spotted sodium in the atmospheres of two other exoplanets .
The atmosphere of COROT - 7b may not be breathable , but it is certainly amusing .

BBC HD has proved extremely popular BBC plans to encrypt Freeview HD data have come under fire from critics , who say it will effectively lock - down free BBC content .
Under plans submitted to regulator Ofcom , the broadcaster has requested that it be allowed to encrypt certain information on set top boxes .
Only trusted manufacturers would be offered the decryption keys .
Opponents , including Labour MP
Tom Watson , say that , if the move is agreed , it will limit consumer choice .
The BBC argues it will prevent piracy .
The BBC said it made the request to Ofcom in response to pressure from rights holders to offer copy protection on all its high - definition broadcasts .
Under licensing rules , the BBC is not allowed to encrypt the actual video or audio streams .
So instead it is requesting that it be allowed to encrypt the data associated with TV listings without which set - top boxes are not able to decode the TV content .
" We are committed to ensuring that public service content remains free to air i.e. unencrypted .
" However , HD content holders have begun to expect a degree of content management on the Freeview HD platform and therefore broadcasters have recognised that a form of copy protection is needed , " read a statement from the BBC .
Consumer interest Tom Watson , Labour MP and one of parliament 's most tech - savvy members , is not convinced such a step is in consumers ' interests .
" In an attempt to satisfy the fears of powerful rights holders , the BBC will prohibit millions of people from programming their existing set top boxes .
If implemented this will make it difficult to view or record HDTV broadcasts with free software .
Where 's the consumer interest in that settlement ? " he said in his blog .
Some set - top boxes use open source operating systems such as Linux , and this has meant they can be offered much cheaper to consumers .
Open source software is generally free of charge and the underlying code can be modified by anyone without fear of trampling on intellectual property or copyright .
Critics of the BBC 's request say that open source licenses are incompatible with the regulations because DRM locks down software so that it cannot be altered by the user .
As a result , it would be harder for manufacturers which use open source software to obtain the necessary permissions from the BBC , effectively pushing them out of the market .
Mr Watson is also not convinced by the piracy argument .
" If you 're a hardcore pirate , you 'll still be able to continue doing what you do but if you want to watch the latest EastEnders , you 'll have to purchase new stuff , " he wrote .
The deadline for responses to the proposal closes on 16 September and Ofcom will then consider its response .

If you keep on excusing , you eventually give your blessing to the slave camp , to cowardly force , to organized executioners , to the cynicism of great political monsters ; you finally hand over your brothers ~
~ Albert Camus
There is no subject more restricted nor more controlled in the United States than a critical discussion of Israel .
Balanced argument is ignored while each word is parsed -- and condemned .
It 's strange that we are free to rant and rave and point out the war crimes of our own administration -- of all other administrations throughout the world -- but not those of Israel .
The few who dare to question the damage Israel has wrought throughout the Middle East for decades are immediately labeled " anti-Semitic , " and are in danger of losing their friends , jobs , their reputations and , if they persist , their country -- for America has zero tolerance for those who recognize Israel 's brutality .
Why is this ?
Are not crimes against humanity just that , regardless of who is committing them ?
For example , when one - and - a - half million human beings are imprisoned like caged animals , with no food , electricity , medical care , clean water , and then are exterminated like so many insects -- cut to pieces , burned to a crisp with illegal weapons banned by the Geneva Conventions -- is that not a crime against humanity ?
Are the men , women and children trapped behind the walls of Gaza with nowhere to run -- nowhere to hide -- not human ?
Kill Them All
If you 've been listening to the Israeli leadership for the past 60 years , the last 10 years -- the last year -- you know very well that Palestinians are many things , but not human .
In 1982 , former Likud leader and prime minister Menahim Begin said Palestinians " are beasts walking on two legs . "
The next year , Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces Raphael Eitan gloated , " When we have settled the land , all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle . "
And , in 1988 , Yitzhak Shamir , a Likudnik elected Prime Minister twice , told the settlers taking over the Palestinian land , " The Palestinians will be crushed like grasshoppers ... heads smashed against the boulders and walls . "
But it was our own Evangelical , oxy - moronic ( sic ) Judeo - Christian ( sic ) cloven - hoofed Pat Robertson , who chats often with God who gave us the real lowdown on Israel 's " moral " savagery .
Robertson explained God 's rationale to his 700 Club members in May 1985 ...
" The wars of extermination have given a lot of people trouble unless they know what was going on .
The people in the land of Palestine were very wicked .
They were given over to idolatry ; they sacrificed their children ; they had all kinds of abominable sex practices ; they were having sex , apparently , with animals ; they were having sex men with men , and women with women ; they were committing adultery , fornication ; they were worshipping idols , offering their children up ; and they were forsaking God .
" God told the Israelites to kill them all -- men , women and children , to destroy them .
And that seems to be a terrible thing to do .
Is it ?
Or is n't it ?
Well , let us assume there were 2,000 of them , or 10,000 of them living in the land , or whatever number there was of them .
I do n't have the exact number .
Pick a number .
God said , ' Kill them all . ' . . . the abomination was there like a contagion .
God saw that there was no cure for it .
It was n't going to change ; their hearts were n't going to change ; and all they would do is cause trouble for the Israelites , and pull the Israelites away from God , and prevent the truth of God from reaching the Earth .
So , God , in love , took away a small number that he might not have to take away a large number . "
Beasts .
Insects .
Victims of a relentless , methodical genocide that grinds away , day after day , year after year , with no analysis , no reflection , no questions -- subsidized with US equipment , US political support , US taxpayers ' money .
How easily we have not only excused , but given our blessing to Israel 's crimes -- handed over our brothers -- from the 1967 attack on the USS Liberty using US - financed French aircraft leaving 34 dead and 174 injured American sailors , to massacres using US - furnished weapons in Jenin , Rafah , Sabara , Shatila , Lebanon , and repeatedly in Gaza .
How silently we stood on March 16 , 2003 when an Israeli soldier in a US Caterpillar bulldozer crushed to death 23 - year - old Rachel Corrie -- shot and seriously wounded 26 - year - old Brian Avery on April 5 , 2003 -- and , on April 11 , 2003 , shot and killed 21 - year - old Tom Hurndall while he was attempting to save three terrified Palestine children who were being shot at as they played .
Political Monsters
Israel 's grotesque 22 - day foray into Gaza earlier this year shocked the world with its savagery -- with one notable exception -- the United States .
Perhaps that 's because , according to the Australian Herald , one week before the invasion , the US shipped 989 containers of munitions , including white phosphorous , to Israel .
Three months earlier , Congress approved a $ 77 million sale to Israel of 1,000 Boeing Corp.
GBU - 39 bunker - buster bombs which arrived just in time to wreck havoc on the Gaza infrastructure .
Despite the layers upon layers of justification Israel cites , there is only one reason it continues its heinous extermination of the Palestinian people -- because it can .
Because the United States supports such atrocity .
Because the United States finances , arms and equips Israel , and -- more important -- protects it from having to account for any of its crimes .
So , who 's to blame here ?
From whose hands does the blood of Palestinian men , women and children run ?
Israel or the United States ?
Who are the monsters ?
Speak , memory .
Scarcely a week after the " war " on Gaza began , the jubilation in both houses of Congress was palatable .
Members elbowed each other out of the way to co-sponsor and vote for resolutions condemning Hamas for forcing Israel to maim and kill its Gaza population .
Resolutions were submitted and passed by voice vote on Jan.
8 . The Senate Resolution had 34 co-sponsors ; the House Resolution chalked up 116 .
The votes and the blame were shamefully one - sided , with Hamas being blamed for both the war and the death of its own citizens .
Israel did not receive a single rebuke ; was praised throughout -- ironically , for facilitating " humanitarian aid to Gaza with hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian assistance and numerous ambulances entering the Gaza Strip since the war began . "
Three days later , investigative journalist Max Blumenthal covered a 10,000 - strong rally in New York City .
Senator Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) whipped the crowd into a frenzy , shouting about the morality of Israel text - messaging Palestinians to " vacate their homes because there were weapons in them ... "
Schumer , giddy with pride , his fist waving in the air , cried -- " What other country would do that ! "
According to Blumenthal , the rally was pulsating with hate .
He said ...
" Right in front of the stage , a man held a banner reading , “ Islam Is A Death Cult . ”
Rally attendees described the people of Gaza to me as a “ cancer , ” called for Israel to “ wipe them all out , ” insisting , “ They are forcing us to kill their children in order to defend our own children . ”
A young woman told me , “ Those who die are suffering God ’s wrath . ”
“ They are not distinguishing between civilians and military , so why should we ? ” said a member of the group of messianic Orthodox Jewish Chabad - Lubavitch group that flocked to the rally .
" No one I spoke to could seem to find any circumstance in which they would begin to question Israel ’s war .
No number of civilian deaths , no displays of extreme suffering -- nothing could deter their enthusiasm for attacking one of the most vulnerable populations in the world with the world ’s most advanced weaponry .
There are no limits , no matter what Israel does , no matter how it does it . "
As I watched those caught up in the shockingly racist excitement of that rally , I could not help but wonder what these people -- what US politicians -- would do if the children being blown to bits , the homes bombed and bulldozed , the families mutilated , the livelihoods destroyed ... were theirs .
And , I also am forced to wonder -- is the inability to hold back tears at the sight of so much inhumane lust for blood anti-Semitic -- even anti-American ?
Blame the Jews ?
Perhaps I am the wrong person to address this issue .
I was raised , for the most part , in the wilds of New Mexico by parents completely devoid of racism , bigotry or hate .
Those ugly ideologies were n't just ignored -- they did n't exist .
This may sound naive , but I never met a Jew until I was married , my husband was in the Army and stationed at Fort Monmouth in Long Branch , New Jersey .
We rented a bedroom " apartment " from the Brodskys , a Jewish family -- wonderful , joyous , good - natured people who welcomed us into their midst as if they had been waiting for us all their lives .
For me , for years , the Brodskys personified all Jews .
So , when I look to the Middle East and see human beings abused , without food or adequate health care , their infrastructure destroyed , their children slaughtered for sport , it is difficult for me to believe such barbaric savagery is being committed , or even condoned , by Jews who are aware of what is happening .
American Jews , Jews in Israel , Jews around the world are vigorously opposed to such treatment .
Far more Jews than non-Jews in this country speak out about Israel 's relentless execution of Palestinians .
They protest , engage in " die-ins , " hold 24 - hour vigils with signs heralding their dissent .
They scream to heaven -- but their voices are silenced and the media steadfastly refuses to cover their views .
There was no mention in the US media of the rally in New York City in support of Gaza on the same day as the Schumer Screamer ; no mention of IDF soldiers who refused to serve because of the violence against innocent Palestinians ; no mention of the 700 Israeli citizens arrested in the first two weeks for protesting the assault ; and no mention of a Jan 8 meeting of prominent Canadians who spoke out against the war on Gaza .
Toronto psychotherapist Judith Weisman , a Jew who is a member of Independent Jewish Voices , Jews for a Just Peace , the Jewish Women 's Committee to End the Occupation of Palestine , and a founding member of Not In Our Name , said , " Zionism is the scourge of the Jewish people .
It is Zionism that has created all of this . "
Weisman , herself a former " committed Zionist , " said , " it took many years for the scales to literally fall off of my eyes and for me to see what Israel has wrought among the Palestinians . "
Weisman is frightened at the influence Israel now has around the world , and the " power that Israel and the United States are using to control so much of what is happening around the world . "
It 's not that nobody is listening , it 's that -- for those hog -tied to the US media -- there 's nothing to hear but silence , propaganda and lies .
Gideon Levy wrote in Haaretz that fully a third of those killed were children .
Levy said ...
" The public 's shocking indifference to these figures is incomprehensible .
A thousand propagandists and apologists cannot excuse this criminal killing .
One can blame Hamas for the death of children , but no reasonable person in the world will buy these ludicrous , flawed propagandistic goods in light of the pictures and statistics coming from Gaza . "
No matter .
We here in the United States have moved on .
We have given our blessing to the great political monsters .
It is as George Orwell wrote in his prescient 1984 ...
" Everything faded into mist .
The past was erased , the erasure was forgotten , the lie became truth . "

On September 9 , 1999 , Sega released the Dreamcast in North America .
While the launch was successful -- Sega touted a one - day sales total of nearly $ 98 million -- the good news and the console itself were short lived .
The Dreamcast soon faltered , and Sega pulled the plug on its final hardware effort in January of 2001 .
Since then , it has become a third - party publisher , with its former hardware standard - bearer Sonic the Hedgehog appearing on systems made by former rivals , such as Nintendo , Sony , and Microsoft .
EA Sports president and former Sega of America honcho Peter Moore .
Throughout the Dreamcast era and for two years afterward , Peter Moore was president and CEO of Sega of America .
For the 10th anniversary of the console , Moore took time out from his current duties as president of EA Sports to speak with GameSpot about the lessons to be learned from the Dreamcast 's brief life and rapid demise .
Excerpts of the interview follow below .
A more thorough version of the conversation -- one in which Moore talks about the changing industry , EA Sports ' downloadable content plans , and this year 's lack of NCAA football , NHL , or NBA action on the Wii -- can be heard on this week 's episode of the HotSpot podcast .
GameSpot :
What lasting impact do you think the Dreamcast made on the industry ?
Peter Moore : I think there are a couple of things .
As an employee at that time and somebody now looking at this milestone of 10 years , I think the lasting impact on the industry is that we put an online console onto the market ... albeit dial - up and at a time when the huge majority of Americans were connecting through a phone modem rather than cable , DSL , or any form of broadband .
And secondly , you look at the way we built the launch , made the launch a huge event , and , I think , catapulted video games into the general psyche of entertainment and made it a legitimate entertainment medium .
We had looked at the numbers we felt we were going to get in the first 24 hours a few months prior to that [ and ] had done a ton of research on entertainment launches .
It was very clear to us that we were going to be -- if we hit our numbers -- the biggest 24 hours in entertainment retail history .
And we put a lot of stock behind that as a PR message .
I think it was instrumental in vaulting video games into the minds of even non-gamers as a legitimate entertainment medium that could stand on its own and was n't the domain of boys in their bedrooms .
To this day , I think you can look back at the Dreamcast as being a benchmark in how to launch a console , how to push technology forward , and how to change the view of observers as to what video games are all about .
GS : We 're now living in a world where 10 - year life cycles are an entirely realistic goal for successful consoles .
Is there anything you think could have been done differently that would have the Dreamcast only now winding down its last days ?
Quake III Arena was one of the biggest online Dreamcast titles released .
PM : Yeah , I wish .
They were challenging times , if you recall .
It had been a difficult few years prior to that for Sega with the Saturn not quite doing what I think the expectations were .
I was n't with the company then .
I was still with Reebok in those days .
Once I arrived at Sega , I realized we needed to do two things : a little bit of rehabilitation with the consumer and then start fresh with the Dreamcast itself .
When you think about the challenges that were impending , it was obviously the launch the following year of the PlayStation 2 and what that would mean for us .
Could we actually establish a platform that could live alongside and be very competitive with the PS2 ?
And that platform was going to be online gaming .
But of course , we had determined to build a dial - up modem in , and the broadband peripheral came later with just a couple of games .
Quake springs to mind and maybe Counterstrike ... that allowed you to play on a broadband modem through the Dreamcast and it just certainly was n't a portfolio that was big enough .
I think the overall platform of online gaming and expression we 'd coined at the time , " taking gamers where gaming was going " were probably somewhat premature in that positioning .
The market was n't ready for it .
The infrastructure in North America was n't ready to deliver broadband to everybody 's home like it is today , for the most part .
And we simply did n't have the pipeline of software that we could sustain for a number of years that was going to make the platform a must - have even in the face of a very powerful competitor in Sony coming to market with the PS2 .
GS : Some of the Dreamcast 's best - loved and most memorable games -- Shenmue , Jet Grind Radio , Skies of Arcadia , Seaman , Crazy Taxi -- were original intellectual properties .
Was there too much of an emphasis on these original and unproven franchises ?
PM : Yes and no .
We had nine studios in Japan and relatively decent third - party support across the board .
But there was a little bit of the second phase of " wait and see . "
In other words , we had not secured , two to three years out , a pipeline that we could look at from our third - party partners at that time .
But we had a very strong engine out of Tokyo that was supplemented .
A number of those were actually arcade games , Crazy Taxi being the most memorable .
You still had the arcade teams -- the AM teams as we called them -- that had two platforms they could develop for : the Sega arcade machines in Japan , which were during that period of time still successful and popular , and then it was a relatively quick port to the Dreamcast .
The development teams there were very strong and had a very clear view of what they wanted to do to develop new intellectual property .
There was no questioning that that was the right thing to do at that time .
As you mentioned those games , all of them were groundbreaking .
You think of Seaman , which was so quirky and unique , but really caught the attention .
And then Shenmue ... still to this day if I start talking Dreamcast to people I meet on the street , it 's still one of the games they feel was groundbreaking .
Still to this day , everyone wants sequels to Shenmue .
To answer your question , I would n't have changed the strategy .
I thought new intellectual properties were where we needed to go .
We needed to make sure we were delivering a differentiated experience and were n't relying too heavily on third - party games that also might show up on the PS2 .
GS : Games like Seaman and Shenmue obviously made a very strong impression on people .
Did you find that translated well into sales ?
Shenmue still commands a loyal following , although it 's been years since there were even credible rumors of a third installment in the series .
PM : Yes and no .
New intellectual property is always a challenge because you 've got to build it from scratch .
You 've got to explain it to the consumer .
It was n't easy explaining how you keep your Seaman alive through oxygen and heat , making sure you talk to him and why he would know you had n't played with him the previous day .
And in fact , you were cheating on him by playing Sonic the Hedgehog .
It was all very new and different , and it was a tremendous amount of fun .
Shenmue was Yu Suzuki 's masterpiece .
It was deep , but we needed to be able to build upon this , and in those two instances , neither of them were truly mass - market games .
You needed a microphone .
Certainly Seaman was more expensive than the average game .
We did n't have enough games to justify the microphone on top of that .
And Shenmue was a very deep experience .
But in those days role - playing games of that nature were still somewhat of a niche genre rather than a mass - market genre .
We really did n't -- maybe with the exception of Sonic Adventure -- have that game that was aimed at a broad mass market that could really be the " killer app " to drive the hardware .
Certainly sports were serving a purpose for us then , but there was nothing when we look back that said , " This is the one game that is going to sell millions of units , the must - have game . "
We had a tremendous portfolio at launch - - 18 titles and some great games that followed up quickly -- but nothing you can look back and say was the game that drove Dreamcast where it needed to be .
GS : The Dreamcast had at least some support from every major third - party publisher except EA .
From your perspective on the Sega side , what kept EA from embracing the Dreamcast ?
How badly did the lack of support hurt the machine ?
PM : Difficult to say how badly it hurt the machine .
The one thing it did have us do at Sega was invest heavily in our own sports brand -- Sega Sports -- that evolved into 2 K Sports .
It created a great and fun competitive element between Sega and EA , which I enjoyed thoroughly .
And interestingly , now being on the other side , [ I ] talk fondly of people who were here at the time , including [ EA CEO ] John Riccitiello .
NFL 2 K 's presentation and animation were revolutionary in 1999 .
It actually , I think , helped grow the sports genre during the 1990s because there was tremendous competition between ourselves and EA and -- depending on the sport -- Acclaim and Konami .
They were fun times .
Do we wish that EA had published for the platform ?
Of course , but they had their own reasons .
It was their business ; they made a decision .
And we just had to get on with it , not worry too much about what we could n't have , and just focus on what we could get .
GS : At Sega , you oversaw the company 's last attempt to reestablish itself in the hardware market .
At Microsoft , you fought with Nintendo for a distant second behind the PlayStation 2 .
At EA Sports , you 're finally the biggest dog on your particular block .
How different is it playing the favorite instead of the underdog ?
PM : You tend to think about your brand , your business , what the consumer wants , and worry less about the competition .
Do you look back at those days and enjoy being the feisty underdog ?
Sure .
But in my role today , I 'm absolutely blessed to have such a great brand as EA Sports and phenomenal licenses .
And I think the world has changed .
We get competitive challengers all over the place , from my old friends at 2 K Sports , from Konami ... particularly in the world of soccer , obviously .
But in today 's world of 24 - hour - a - day interaction with our consumers , we 've got to listen to them and make the best game they 're looking for , rather than worry about what the competition is doing .
It 's a whole different world today than it was as recently as seven or eight years ago .
Students interested in pursuing a job in sustainability now can choose from a variety of " green " degree programs .
With an increased interest in the environment and growth in the " green collar " job sector , colleges and universities are beginning to incorporate sustainability into their programs .
From MBAs in sustainable - business practices to programs that give students the technical training necessary to operate wind turbines , students have an increasing array of options to choose from .
GOING GREEN : Strikes a chord with colleges
" Clearly , demand is there for these types of workers , " says Marisa Michaud of Eduventures , a higher - education research and consulting firm .
" Colleges are seeing that , and they want to provide appropriate educational programs to meet that demand . "
Concern for the environment is the motivation , says Julian Dautremont - Smith of the Association for Sustainability in Higher Education .
" The past few years , society as a whole has become increasingly interested in sustainability , " he says .
" Higher education has been swept up as well . "
David Soto of The Princeton Review says student interest is driving colleges to create programs that offer training in sustainability .
Two - thirds of students surveyed for the company 's recent " College Hopes and Worries " survey said a college 's " environmental commitment " would be a factor in where they applied .
" Students are really savvy shoppers these days , so they 're realizing , with a changing economy and green jobs looking to take a leap within the next couple of years , that they want to be armed with those types of skills , " Soto says .
Green — not greed — is good
One popular program is an MBA that teaches skills for operating sustainable businesses .
A University of Pennsylvania program that started this year lets students earn an MBA and a master 's in environmental studies at the same time .
" There 's an increasing interest among businesses to take the environment seriously , " says Eric Orts , director of the Wharton School 's Initiative for Global Environmental Leadership at Penn .
" Our take is you really need to have the science background and some other approaches that are not normally taught in the business school context , " he says .
Architecture schools are responding to the increased interest in energy - efficient buildings .
Christoph Reinhart , associate professor of architectural technology at Harvard 's Graduate School of Design , says the school 's decision last summer to start offering a concentration in sustainable design was driven by interest from students and changes in the field .
" Over the past few years , there has been an increased interest and pressure to provide this knowledge in more depth , whereas before , maybe a class would have been sufficient , " he says .
" Now there 's an expectation that more of these skills are being learned . "
Newly minted grads
Arizona State University 's School of Sustainability graduated its first class in May .
The school offers a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of science in sustainability as well as a graduate degree .
Charles Redman , the director of the School of Sustainability , says the school takes an interdisciplinary approach .
Student Drew Bryck says what drew him to the school was the opportunity to study biology , economics and a variety of other fields .
Bryck says he is " fairly confident " his degree will help him land a job because the need for people with a well - rounded background in sustainability is growing , especially in the private sector .
The program resonates with students , Redman says ; 300 undergraduates enrolled the first year it was offered .
Bucknell University in Lewisburg , Pa. , will require all students to take at least one class that explores the human connection to the environment .
Dina El - Mogazi , director of the Campus Greening Initiative , says courses in a variety of disciplines will fulfill the requirement .
" We feel that it 's very important , given the current state of the world , that students understand both the way the environment supports human life and the way human decisions " affect the environment 's ability to function .
A growing number of schools , including community colleges , are training students to operate green technology .
Kalamazoo ( Mich . )
Valley Community College will offer a 26 - week program starting in October to train students in operating wind turbines .
Jim DeHaven , vice president for economic and business development at the college , says the school is offering the program to meet the needs of wind farms that are " scrambling " for trained technicians .
" They can really write their own future at this point because they 're needed at all the wind farms , " he says .
" They do n't want us to wait and put people through a two - year program or a one - year certification — they want a fast track to employment . "
An Indian student accused of helping a culpable driver flee Australia has been granted bail .
Sukhcharanjit Singh , 21 , is accused of recklessly giving his passport to a drink driver who killed a student in a crash at Southbank in Melbourne last year .
Puneet Puneet used the passport to flee to India after pleading guilty to criminal charges .
A magistrate has granted Singh bail , saying his jail term , if convicted , could be less than the time he would serve on remand .
She said the fact Puneet had breached bail did not mean Singh would do so .
Singh will return to court at a later date .
TSKHINVALI , Georgia 
A year after war broke out in this tiny provincial city in the breakaway region of South Ossetia , the roads are still rutted with jaw - rattling potholes and downtown buildings are shells open to the sky .
But great effort has gone into commemorating last year ’s war .
Near midnight on Friday , precisely a year after Georgia began shelling Tskhinvali , thousands of people gathered in the city ’s main square , where a Russian - made documentary was projected on a huge screen overhead .
Images of Georgia ’s president , Mikheil Saakashvili , and President George W. Bush were juxtaposed with footage of dead Ossetians , as a floodlit violinist played melancholy music .
Georgia , too , offered heavy symbolism .
In Gori , which came under Russian bombing in the war , authorities erected a replica of the Berlin Wall , a pointed commentary on Russia ’s foothold on Georgian land .
Georgians observed a nationwide moment of silence in the afternoon , and 500 schoolchildren dressed in red and white formed a living replica of Georgia ’s flag .
A year after the war , the question of who is to blame is still being fought out in public life .
On Friday , the presidents of both Russia and Georgia took pains to justify their decisions to send their armies into South Ossetia .
Both have faced pressure over the war ; Russia set itself at odds with the West by sending its troops into Georgia and again , more permanently , when it recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Georgia ’s other separatist enclave , Abkhazia .
Mr. Saakashvili , meanwhile , is blamed by domestic critics for losing control over the territories .
Polygraph operator Patrick T. Coffey of San Francisco has threatened AntiPolygraph.org co-founder George Maschke with a defamation lawsuit .
In a letter ( 877 kb PDF ) dated 4 September 2009 sent by U.S. mail and fax , Coffey ’s attorney , Carleton L. Briggs , demands “ a full and complete retraction ” of the 20 August 2009 blog post , “ Is Patrick T. Coffey Fit to Be Screening Police Applicants ? ”
The letter , ominously titled “ Coffey v. SF Weekly , Maschke , et al. ” begins ( hyperlinks supplied ) :
I represent Patrick T. Coffey , the subject of an article entitled “ Is Patrick Coffey Fit to Be Screening Police Applicants ? ” which appeared on your blog on August 20 , 2009 .
Your article referred to , and contained a hyperlink to , an article entitled “ The Lie Detective ” by Matt Smith in the August 19 - 25 issue of SF Weekly , Volume 28 , Number 30 .
I enclose a copy of your article and of the SF Weekly article , which quotes both you and your blog .
It should be noted that the SF Weekly article does not quote this blog .
Rather , it quotes posts that Coffey made to the AntiPolygraph.org message board .
Briggs continues :
The SF Weekly article attributes various quotes and opinions to Mr. Coffey , some of which are not his and some of which are taken out of context to make him appear prejudiced .
For example , Mr. Coffey did not refer to any such questions or topics as “ Are you racist ?
A dissembler ?
A bully ? ” , and there is no professional in his field who would ever test with such questions , which are not testable subjects with the polygraph .
It is true that these exact questions would not likely be asked in the context of a pre-employment polygraph examination .
But while the question , “ Are you a racist ? ” might not be asked in those terms , until recently the Los Angeles Police Department asked applicants the following relevant question while strapped to the polygraph : “ Based on your personal bias , have you ever committed a negative act against anyone ? ”
And while “ Are you a dissembler ? ” might not be asked in those words , the question “ Did you ever lie to get out of trouble ? ” is a commonly used probable - lie “ control ” question .
Likewise , while “ Are you a bully ? ” might not be asked so bluntly , the LAPD asks applicants , “ Have you physically harmed a significant other during a domestic dispute ? ”
Coffey ’s lawyer continues :
The SF Weekly article attributes to Mr. Coffey controversial views about the changing national face of Holland and France , when in fact he told Mr. Smith that this was based on a “ 60 Minutes ” story he had watched and that , in context , the comments were made on your blog about your possible perceptions ….
The SF Weekly article quotes two posts that Mr. Coffey made to the AntiPolygraph.org message board under the moniker , TheNoLieGuy4U .
The first quotation is from a post Coffey addressed to Maschke on 17 March 2005 .
Coffey wrote : “ I doubt even without the polygraph that you could now meet security criteria to serve in any capacity given your choice to ‘ work ’ in socialist Holland , which like France is losing it ’s idenity [ sic ] to Islamic Immigration there . ”
The second quotation in the SF Weekly article is from a post Coffey made on 28 May 2005 .
Coffey wrote , among other things , “ George should stay in Holland or some other Socialist nation .
He is apparently more comfortable in a nation like that , or France , which has lost its / their respective identities to massive Arab / Islamic immigration . ”
Nowhere in either post did Coffey make any reference to any 60 Minutes story .
And while Mr. Coffey may now profess that he was commenting on George Maschke ’s “ possible perceptions , ” others might reasonably conclude that Coffey ’s posts provide more insight into his own perceptions .
Attorney Carleton L. Briggs continues :
… The SF Weekly article labels Mr. Coffey as a “ peculiar choice ” by the SFPD , when in fact by all measurable criteria he is a highly qualified professional with twenty - three years of experience .
The SF Weekly article questions Mr. Coffey ’s contract with the SFPD , saying the issue should be raised because Mr. Coffey ’s alleged bias and prejudice may make the polygraph tests he administers unreliable .
You are quoted therein as saying , “ He ’s got a lot of biases coming to the table .
To have someone with that mentality screening police applicants is inappropriate . ”
Your blog also questions Mr. Coffey ’s fitness to screen police applicants .
Indeed .
The bigotry in Patrick Coffey ’s posts to the AntiPolygraph.org message board speaks for itself .
It calls to mind the prejudice of those who in the early 20th century lamented that Germany had “ lost its identity ” to “ massive Jewish immigration . ”
Briggs continues :
The SF Weekly article falsely states that Mr. Coffey paid $ 10,000 to settle a claim that he had performed a voice - stress analysis on a subject without permission .
Your article does , as well .
In fact , Mr. Coffey has never performed any such voice - stress analysis , and he never paid any such settlement .
The SF Weekly article states that “ according to court records , ” Coffey ended up “ paying a $ 10,000 settlement ” to Jesus Guerrero , who in a 2003 lawsuit ( 1.1 mb PDF ) alleged that “ Mr. Coffey told Mr. Guerrero that he was submitting him to a lie detector ( i.e. , voice stress analyzer ) test , which testing was performed without Mr. Guerrero ’s permission . ”
AntiPolygraph.org has obtained a copy of a court order ( 90 kb PDF ) implementing a settlement agreement between Guerrero , Coffey , and the latter ’s erstwhile employer , Triad Consultants .
According to the order , Coffey and Triad Consultants were to pay Guerrero $ 10,000 .
It ’s certainly possible , as Mr. Briggs avers , that Mr. Coffey “ never paid any such settlement . ”
But on 15 April 2005 , Coffey and Triad Consultants were ordered to pay it by California Superior Court Judge Ronald Evans Quidachay .
Coffey ’s attorney continues :
Finally , the SF Weekly article suggests that Mr. Coffey is n’t bigoted against Arabs and Muslims who happen to be fee - paying representatives of regimes which condone torture , but that he may be against ordinary Arabs and Muslims with their minds set on a career with the San Francisco Police Department .
As a matter of fact , Mr. Coffey has never failed an SFPD applicant of Arab extraction or of the Muslim faith .
Devout Muslims actually do quite well in such tests , as they tend to have a conservative lifestyle which does not conflict with being in law enforcement .
Again , the anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bigotry inherent in Coffey ’s posts to the AntiPolygraph.org message board speaks for itself .
Coffey ’s lawyer goes on to cite examples of defamation case law before making the following allegation and demand :
Your statements , repetitions and implications were materially false and damaging to Mr. Coffey , as they indicated that he is a bigot and that his alleged prejudice against Arab immigrants makes him unsuitable for his profession as a polygraph consultant to the San Francisco Police Department .
As a result , Mr. Coffey has been receiving death threats , seven so far .
Without conceding that any demand for retraction is required , I hereby demand that , within ten days of the date hereof , you publish a full and complete retraction .
Please have your counsel contact me if he or she wishes to discuss the terms of the retraction .
AntiPolygraph.org condemns any threats of violence against Mr. Coffey .
But AntiPolygraph.org co-founder George Maschke has made no materially false statements regarding him .
There will be no retraction .
It should be noted here that in addition to his expressed views about European countries “ losing their identity ” to Arabs and Muslims , Coffey has made numerous intemperate remarks about Maschke–an honorably discharged US Army veteran–threatening him in 2008 , for example , “ You are no patriot , you piss me off , and I and others have the resources to deal with you if and when it ever becomes necessary .
Stay in Holland you traiterous [ sic ] bastard . ”
Apple ’s carefully thought - out notebook designs , as well as the clean lines of the iconic Apple Stores , make things very easy for smash - and - grab thieves .
Better .
Faster .
Easier .
That is the slogan for Apple ’s new operating system , OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard .
It could also refer to the heist that took place yesterday in Marlton , New Jersey .
First , the uncluttered , open design of the store , unencumbered by ugly metal shutters , made it easy to smash the plate glass window with just one blow .
Next , the thieves signaled to the security guard that they had a gun and then took off along the long , clear tables of merchandise , the straight run allowing them to efficiently scoop MacBooks and iPods into their swag bags .
The magsafe cords detached instantly , offering no resistance and leaving power sockets undamaged .
Finally , the stiff unibody shells meant that the villains could grab the notebooks one - handed from a corner with no flexing , and no risk to the internal circuitry , the tough aluminum bodies resisting the jostling clanks inside the sacks .
And so we see that it is true that Apple really does design for the end - user , with small efficiencies that all add up .
Thanks to Apple , the scoundrels managed to load up their booty — 23 Macbook Pros , 14 iPhones and nine iPod Touches — in just 31 seconds .
As Steve Jobs might say , “ Boom ! ” Store employees should watch for anyone wanting to buy 23 mains adapters in the next few days .

After a summer of healthcare battles and sliding approval ratings for President Obama , the White House is facing a troubling new trend :
The voters losing faith in the president are the ones he had worked hardest to attract .
New surveys show steep declines in Obama ’s approval ratings among whites -- including Democrats and independents -- who were crucial elements of the diverse coalition that helped elect the country ’s first black president .
Among white Democrats , Obama ’s job approval rating has dropped 11 points since his 100 - days mark in April , according to surveys by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press .
It has dropped by 9 points among white independents and whites over 50 , and by 12 points among white women -- all groups that will be targeted by both parties in next year ’s midterm elections .
“ While Obama has a lock on African Americans , his support among white voters seems to be almost in a free fall , ” said veteran Republican pollster Neil Newhouse .

Strategists in both parties blame Obama ’s decline on growing discontent with his policy agenda , particularly after a month of often - rowdy debate over his proposed healthcare overhaul , in which some conservatives accused him of socialism .
Obama ’s ratings seem likely to rise again if he wins passage of healthcare legislation this fall .
But the drop in support among whites also comes as some conservatives have stoked controversies that have the potential to further erode Obama ’s standing among centrists -- including some controversies that resulted from White House stumbles .
One such episode came to a head Sunday when Van Jones , Obama ’s green jobs czar , resigned after a week of criticism over past inflammatory statements and for signing onto conspiracy theories questioning whether the U.S. government played a role in the Sept. 11 attacks .
A White House official acknowledged Sunday that Jones had been vetted less rigorously than other officials .
In another episode , some conservatives have criticized a White House dinner invitation issued to the lead lawyer in the American Civil Liberties Union lawsuits that have forced the government to disclose Bush - era interrogation techniques .
The lawyer was invited to an event for the Muslim holiday of Ramadan .

And Obama ’s plan to address the nation ’s schoolchildren Tuesday has prompted an outcry among some conservative parents and GOP officials .
Some of them have accused the White House of trying to infuse “ socialism ” into the minds of young people .
These controversies have followed conspiracy theories that the president was born overseas and is ineligible to hold office , and that his true religion is Islam -- false rumors that some Democrats worry could be affecting the public ’s view of the president and his party .
Pew first identified a slippage in white support immediately after a news conference in July , when Obama surprised many by saying that a white police officer had acted “ stupidly ” in arresting a black Harvard professor .
Still unclear is whether Obama ’s slide in the polls is due solely to his policies , or questions about his personal background or allegiances .

During the presidential campaign last fall , the nation ’s economic meltdown swamped any attempts by Republicans to portray Obama as having radical associations with figures such as his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr .
Some conservatives , such as Fox ’s Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity , have argued that Jones , an outspoken Bay Area black activist who once described himself as a communist , fit the same pattern .
One black congressman , Rep. Charles B. Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) , was quoted last week alleging that opposition to Obama ’s healthcare policies was “ a bias , a prejudice , an emotional feeling . ”
“ Some Americans have not gotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States .
They go to sleep wondering , ‘ How did this happen ? ’ ” Rangel said , according to the New York Post .

Democratic pollster David Beattie conducted a survey last month in one competitive congressional district that found that more than a quarter of independents believed Obama had not proven his natural - born status .
The same sentiment was expressed by nearly 6 in 10 Republican women -- a group that Beattie said would be important for a Democratic victory .
He declined to name the district because the polling was private , but said that such questions about Obama ’s background seemed to be a “ proxy ” for voters ’ growing unease with Obama ’s ambitious agenda , which has included a potential push to create a government - sponsored health insurance plan .
Surveys show that the vast majority of Americans like Obama personally , but that they are increasingly skeptical of policies that seem to expand the scope of government .
“ We ’re having an economic culture war , ” Beattie said .
Advertisement
“ The criticisms of Obama are about the fundamental role of government in our economy . ”
A new analysis by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report concludes that nervousness about the president could prove devastating for Democrats next year .
The analysis , with a headline asking if 2010 could be the “ year of the angry white senior , ” warns that Obama faces a growing “ gulf ” between his still - strong support among young people and his dwindling numbers among people 65 and older .
The result , according to analyst David Wasserman , could be a loss by Democrats of up to 25 House seats .
Democrats currently hold a 78 - seat majority in the House .

Obama won a narrow majority of independents in last year ’s election , and the Pew numbers show that his approval rating among that group rose to 57 % in April -- including half of white independents -- before declining to 48 % most recently .
More than half of whites older than 50 approved of Obama ’s job performance in April .
But now , after weeks of Republican accusations that the Democrats would seek to cut Medicare benefits , that number is 43 % .
Among white Democrats , Obama ’s approval rating dropped to 78 % , from 89 % .
Some Democrats are hopeful that Republican opposition to Obama may be firing up core conservatives but failing to win over even skeptical centrists and independents to the GOP cause .
Dan Parker , Democratic Party chairman in Indiana , home to three competitive congressional districts and an upset win last year by Obama , said that the Republicans have yet to field strong challengers in those House races this year .

And , he added , in a state hit hard by economic troubles , voters are willing to give Obama credit for his economic stimulus package and for bailing out the auto industry .
“ Once he gets the credit for passing healthcare reform , then he ’ll see the political benefit , ” Parker said .
But the conservative rebellion against Obama has even hit Parker close to home .
Last week , he received an e-mail from the principal at his children ’s school with the news that Obama ’s Tuesday back - to - school address would not be shown to most students , due to complaints from parents .

An all - party group of MPs has recommended mandatory nanny filters for all mobile devices and data devices that can access the internet - and wants the UK's Internet Watch Foundation secretive censor system extended to the whole world .
The All Party Parliamentary Group on Communications ( Apcomms ) today recommends : " A global ' notice and take - down ' regime is required , and if the IWF cannot provide it then someone else should . "
That 's ambitious .
Our MPs may be getting a little carried away : they 're MPs for the UK Parliament , not a global government , or an Intergalactic Federation .
The reason for given for mandatory net filters is " that the default child protection settings are different on different mobile networks and different devices .
This is unnecessarily confusing for parents , and so the report recommends that the industry move to a consistent , and ' safe ' , arrangement . "
ISPs will be pleased to learn that they are expected to foot the bill for cleaning up all the malware on British PCs .
ISPs should establish a voluntary code and if it fails to clean up our PCs , Ofcom should impose one anyway : " A reduction in compromised end user machines is essential to make the Internet a safer place , " they write .
Elsewhere they call for Ofcom to regulate broadband speed advertising .
There are only two areas where MPs do n't want the state to interfere .
They recommend the UK government abandon its music strategy and suggest it should defer to Europe for policy .
The group has also squarely blamed the music business for the problem of P2P file sharing .
" Much of the problem with illegal sharing of copyrighted material has been caused by the rights holders , and the music industry in particular , being far too slow in getting its act together and making popular legal alternatives available . "
The recommendation is likely to be ignored by the music business , which rarely agrees on anything - but does agree that Mandelson 's impetus is the last chance to implement some kind of enforcement agenda for a long time - an incoming Conservative administration may have more urgent priorities .
The MPs also looked at " net neutrality " and decided pre-emptive technical regulation was n't needed now .
Those two areas are the exception , however .
There 's enough new red tape proposed in the MPs ' report there to keep technology manufacturers and service providers busy ( doing nothing ) for years - and generate at least a dozen new quangos .
So who said the internet was rolling back big government ? ®
Decades of languishing industrial pollution , combined with emerging threats like invasive species and a spike in a new chemical compounds known as endocrine disrupters , have rendered large sections of the Great Lakes inhospitable to both humans and wildlife .
Yet , years of accumulated knowledge on such problems has not translated into real solutions for the lakes , whose stature as a national and even global source of freshwater has grown in recent years as climate change and other environmental stresses threaten to dry up freshwater resources in other regions .
Recognizing the clock is ticking on the lakes ' recovery prospects , U.S. EPA is rolling out a new package of restoration programs that could begin shifting the Great Lakes back toward ecological health .
The program , known as the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative , is backed by a $ 475 million pledge from the White House and House of Representatives , which approved full funding for the program in June .
If the Senate follows suit , EPA officials say the government will take its first steps toward implementing the broader " Great Lakes Multi - Year Restoration Action Plan , " which lays out the highest - priority restoration goals between 2010 and 2014 .
" This will allow us to really jump - start the effort , to get us started on projects that have been on hold for a long time , " said Gary Gulezian , director of EPA 's Great Lakes National Programs Office , based in Chicago .
" There has been a tremendous amount of planning going on , and a tremendous amount of science that supports the goals we 've set for the lakes .
Now what we 're saying is , ' Let 's get going . ' "
For much of July and early August , EPA officials barnstormed Great Lakes ports -- from Chicago and Milwaukee to Erie and Duluth -- to sell that message to regional and local stakeholders , many of whom have grown wary of government promises to address the lakes ' declining health .
The last stop , on Minnesota 's Lake Superior shoreline , brought the usual mix of public enthusiasm and skepticism , including pointed criticism from a member of the Lake Superior Chippawa tribes , who excoriated the federal government for allowing the tribe 's cultural , spiritual and economic life source to become poisoned with chemicals , fertilizers and sewage .
But EPA officials , as well as other key figures in setting Great Lakes restoration goals , said the federal government and its state and private - sector partners are uniquely positioned under the Obama administration to make progress toward improving the lakes ' condition , even if the full $ 20 billion needed for total restoration remains elusive .
Cam Davis , the Obama administration 's recently appointed senior adviser for Great Lakes restoration , called the program a top priority for EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson , adding that the more than $ 400 million in new funds would build upon existing programs .
" We 've got the three P's -- political leadership , policies and we 've got the pecuniary , " Davis said of the Obama administration 's strategy .
Tim Eder , executive director of the Great Lakes Commission , whose members include the eight Great Lakes states and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec , noted that the bump in restoration funding was a campaign promise by candidate Obama .
" Now we have to demonstrate that we 're capable of making progress , that we 're capable of spending this money efficiently and effectively , " he said .
Indeed , the president 's home city and state are poised to reap the benefits Great Lakes restoration .
The Chicago Department of Water Management draws more than 365 billion gallons of Lake Michigan water each year to meet drinking water needs for the city and its surrounding suburbs , according to the city 's annual water report .
Legacy of pollution
But the lakes ' problems extend far beyond the Chicago shoreline .
EPA has designated 31 " areas of concern " within the U.S. portion of the basin -- places where conditions have deteriorated enough that authorities have placed restrictions on fish and wildlife consumption , dredging activities and water consumption .
The greatest concentration of such areas are along the industrial corridors of Lake Erie and portions of Lake Michigan , where discharges of industrial waste , sewage and other toxic sludge were standard practice for much of the 20th century .
Ohio's Cuyahoga River , for example , received international attention in 1969 when its thick accumulation of oil and industrial waste caught fire -- it was actually the 13th river fire since the Civil War.
EPA 's predecessor , the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration , noted after the 1969 fire : " The lower Cuyahoga has no visible life , not even low forms such as leeches and sludge worms that usually thrive on wastes . "
Today , the Cuyahoga , like dozens of other Great Lakes drainages , is much improved .
But sediments in many areas remain choked with hazardous substances such as PCBs , mercury and dioxin .
Meanwhile , others have emerged , including nutrient shocks from stormwater runoff , sedimentation caused by streambank erosion , atmospheric deposition of heavy metals like mercury from coal - fired power plants , and sewer system overflows caused by both heavy rains and bypasses around wastewater treatment plants .
EPA hopes its new funding will quickly make a dent in some of the most pressing threats , in part by stripping much the red tape off the program .
For example , none of the $ 475 million proposed in fiscal 2010 will go toward large - scale infrastructure projects that require years of planning and can soak up hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money before a single day 's work is done in the field .
EPA will also streamline the allocation of funds to project partners by holding all restoration funds in a single account , rather than having Congress parcel out funding to multiple agencies whose priorities may change over time .
" It 's our job to get those dollars into the hands of the people who know how to get these projects under way , " EPA 's Gulezian said .
To that end , EPA has established five focus areas for the first round of projects , which the agency hopes to have under way by next year .
They are :
Toxic substances , particularly in the agency 's geographically fixed " areas of concern . "
Invasive species .
Non-point source pollution and the health of nearshore environments .
Wildlife and habitat restoration .
Program administration , including accountability , monitoring and evaluation .
While the federal government will carry most of the program 's administrative and financial burden , the bulk of the ground work will fall to state and local agencies , as well as tribes , nonprofit groups , universities and private firms that will competitively bid for project work .
And unique among projects of this size and scale , the federal government will not require states and local governments to provide matching funds to win contracts .
" Our intent is to minimize non-federal matching grant requirements , " said Gulezian .
" Where we 've got flexibility , we want to be able to exert that . "
Many of EPA 's prospective restoration partners , including state and local governments and nonprofit groups , say the " no federal match " mechanism could be the key to moving the restoration program forward .
Fierce competition , limited funds
" I think it 's a downpayment on the commitment that the president made during the campaign , " said Ken DeBeaussaert , director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality 's Office of the Great Lakes .
In fact , Michigan since 2005 has been building the foundation for what officials hope will be the first of several years of government requests for proposals to complete hundreds of millions of dollars in restoration projects .
DeBeaussaert said Michigan will seek first to restore its 14 EPA - designated areas of concern , including some of the lakes ' most contaminated industrial sites , as well as restoring wetlands that keep pollution from reaching the lakes in the first place .
In neighboring Wisconsin , similar plans are taking shape .
The Wisconsin Great Lakes Strategy was created to direct money to projects that would do the most good in the areas with the most need and not simply to the loudest shouters , said Cheryl Nenn , interim head of the nonprofit Milwaukee RiverKeeper .
Still , Nenn conceded , some projects are more ready to go than others , and shovel - readiness will have some bearing on which areas get priority treatment .
For some of the lakes ' most pressing problems , however , geography is less important than strong federal policies aimed at reducing basin - wide problems such as invasive species .
DeBeaussaert noted that Michigan toughened its regulations on ballast water discharges from oceangoing vessels with the hope of stopping the spread of exotics from entering state waters .
But he acknowledges some of the most persistent species -- such as quagga mussels and Asian carp -- do not stop at state lines .
" Ultimately , to be more effective , we need to a strong federal approach , " he said .
Mixed reception
Among those attending last week 's public meeting on Minnesota 's Lake Superior shore were stakeholders expecting to lend a hand in the restoration .
While many expressed optimism that EPA 's latest approach will begin repairing two centuries worth of damage , others worried about the government 's ability to carry the project through to completion .
" This is one of the most exciting things I 've seen in years , " said Larry McDonald , mayor of Bayfield , Wis. , whose economy is heavily dependent upon summer tourists to Lake Superior 's Apostle Islands National Lakeshore .
But , McDonald added , " It 's important to not delay and not lose momentum .
These things have been a long time coming . "
Others , including a representative of the Duluth Seaway Port Authority , which annually oversees 45 million tons of shipped cargo , including exports of grain , forest products and iron ore as well as imports of turbine parts for the Midwest 's burgeoning wind - power industry , said the restoration must not overlook the needs of shippers to the Great Lakes ' largest port .
" It is vitally important that business and industry be invited to the table , " said Adele Yorde , the authority 's public relations manager .
" This area was built on the maritime industry , and it will not survive without the maritime industry . "
Edith Leoso , a senior council member of the nearly 7,000 - member Bad River band of Lake Superior Chippewas , whose 125,000 - acre reservation hugs Wisconsin 's Lake Superior shoreline , openly doubted the government 's will to restore the lake to its once - pristine condition .
" You talk about restoring this lake , but you 'll never be able to go back and drink that water again , " said Leoso , who implored EPA to meet directly with Great Lakes tribes , which she said have endured decades of broken federal promises over protection of ancestral lands .
" Here we are today trying to restore something to something , and I do n't know what that is , " Leoso added .
" I have some ambiguous feelings about this , about talking about this lake . "
EPA officials said they will solicit public comment on the restoration initiative through Aug. 19 , with the hope of submitting a detailed program outline to the White House Office of Management and Budget by Sept.

What can I say I love coffee .
I used to own a coffee shop called the Bean Counter Coffee Shop .
I miss it dearly , and hope to reopen the Bean Counter Coffee Shop one day .
In the mean time , I have contented myself to home coffee roasting and perfecting my coffee brewing skills at home .
I am always looking for new and inventive ways to serve coffee while staying true to the amazing traditions of this wonderful little bean .
For some , the battle lines are drawn .
But in recent interviews , a number of people of color expressed a weariness with the debate .
They asked , essentially :
Why ca n’t hair just be hair ?
Must an Afro peg a woman as the political heir to Angela Davis ?
Is a fashionista who replicates the first lady ’s clean - cut bob really being untrue to herself ?
“ I am who I am regardless of how I wear my hair , ” said Tywana Smith , an owner of Treasured Locks , a Web site devoted to upkeep for relaxed and natural hair .
“ I want my kids to be seen for who they are , not for how they wear their hair , ” she added .
“ Whether they walk down the street with twists or braids , they are n’t making any other statement other than ‘ Today I felt like twists . ’ ”

Assumptions about the motives for straightening or wearing hair natural are n’t as easy to make as they once were .
During the last presidential campaign , Noliwe M. Rooks , the associate director of the Center for African American Studies at Princeton , had many conversations about what it meant when the hair of Sasha and Malia Obama was pressed straight .
“ Unlike earlier times , ” the conclusion was n’t “ clearly she had sold out , or she ’s saying straight hair is better , ” Professor Rooks said .
“ There ’s a complexity to who we are now .
There was n’t an easy answer to why . ”
Afua Adusei-Gontarz , 30 , of Brooklyn , wore her hair natural for five years in a French braid , two - strand twists or a puffy ponytail .
But she does n’t think those looks made her more authentically black .
“ If you have natural hair , you ’re considered more real , or in touch with your African - ness , ” said Ms. Adusei - Gontarz , an assistant editor at Columbia University Press .
She rejects that thinking :
In Ghana , her older relatives relax their hair  as she does now but for convenience  and “ it ’s more the newer generations who have natural hair . ”
If a fair maiden kisses a frog which instantly changes into a handsome prince we would call it a fairy tale .

We all know that getting backlinks to our site plays a major role in getting better search engine placements .
Most webmasters try to get as many inbound links as possible to ensure better search engine ranking for their site .
This is a good ploy , but at times a website with more back links than its competitor may be ranking lower for the same keyword when compared with its competitor .
This is a general scenario most webmaster faces and this issue should be deeply looked into .
There are various reasons why a website with more inbound links than its competitor is losing the battle in the search engine rankings with its competitor for the same keywords .
Just getting many backlinks alone does not aumatically make your site keywords rank highly .
As we all know that Google determines the ranking of websites in search results based on various metrics such as onpage and offpage factors .
On page factors are those which are visible on your website by making changes in the HTML code .
On the other hand offpage factors are those factors that are not visible on your website but are done by working on external sites .
So both offpage and onpage factors plays an important role in your search engine results .
Offpage factors inlcudes link building activities such as article submissions , directory submissions , promoting the site through forums , blogs , social media sites etc .
There are are certain parameters to keep in mind while getting backlinks for your site .
1 ) Try to get better backlinks , i.e quality backlinks from sites which are relevant to your site content .
2 ) Avoids links from link farms , low grade directories and other spammy sites .
3 ) Try to get links from pages with better page ranks , ie , 3 and above .
4 ) Add compelling content on your site and prompt other webmasters to link back to you .
5 ) Try to get your major keywords included in the anchor text of your inbound links .
These are the basic offpage factors needed for you to have an edge over your competitors in search engine results .
Try these things and I am pretty sure that the results would be there at the doorstep for you .
Father 's fury over children 's ' pornographic ' sweet wrappers
A father - of - two has spoken of his disgust after spotting fruity cartoon characters appearing to have sex on SWEET wrappers .
Simon Simpkins was buying Haribo MAOAM sour candies for his children when he noticed the ' pornographic ' illustrations of limes , lemons and cherries romping with each other .
Mr Simpkins , of Pontefract , West Yorkshire , said : ' The lemon and lime are locked in what appears to be a carnal encounter .
Fruity : According to Mr Simpkins , the lime has a ' particularly lurid ' expression on its face during its encounter with a lemon
Debauched :
The lime enjoys a similarly smutty experience with a willing pair of cherries
' The lime , whom I assume to be the gentleman in this coupling , has a particularly lurid expression on his face . '
He said : ' I demanded to see the shop manager and , during a heated exchange , my wife became quite distressed and had to sit down in the car park . '
A spokesman for Haribo said the ' fun ' packaging of the sweets was introduced in Germany 2002 and added : ' This jovial MAOAM man is very popular with fans , both young and old . '

Cosmic record
The growth of British trees appears to follow a cosmic pattern , with trees growing faster when high levels of cosmic radiation arrive from space .
Researchers made the discovery studying how growth rings of spruce trees have varied over the past half a century .
As yet , they cannot explain the pattern , but variation in cosmic rays impacted tree growth more than changes in temperature or precipitation .
The study is published in the scientific journal New Phytologist .
" We were originally interested in a different topic , the climatological factors influencing forest growth , " says Ms Sigrid Dengel a postgraduate researcher at the Institute of Atmospheric and Environmental Science at the University of Edinburgh .
The relation of the rings to the solar cycle was much stronger than to any climatological factors
Sigrid Dengel
University of Edinburgh
To do this , Ms Dengel and University of Edinburgh colleagues Mr Dominik Aeby and Professor John Grace obtained slices of spruce tree trunks .
These had been freshly - felled from the Forest of Ae in Dumfriesshire , Scotland , by Forest Research , the research branch of the UK's Forestry Commission .
The trees had been planted in 1953 and felled in 2006 .
The researchers froze the trunk slices , to prevent the wood shrinking , then scanned them on to a computer and used software to count the number and width of the growth rings .
As the trees aged , they showed a usual decline in growth .
However , during a number of years , the trees ' growth also particularly slowed .
These years correlated with periods when a relatively low level of cosmic rays reached the Earth 's surface .
Reaching for the stars
When the intensity of cosmic rays reaching the Earth 's surface was higher , the rate of tree growth was faster .
The effect is not large , but it is statistically significant .
The intensity of cosmic rays also correlates better with the changes in tree growth than any other climatological factor , such as varying levels of temperature or precipitation over the years .
" The correlation between growth and cosmic rays was moderately high , but the correlation with the climatological variables was barely visible , " Ms Dengel told the BBC .
Here comes the Sun Cosmic rays are actually energetic particles , mainly protons , as well as electrons and the nuclei of helium atoms , that stream through space before hitting the Earth 's atmosphere .
The levels of cosmic rays reaching the Earth go up and down according to the activity of the Sun , which follows an 11 - year cycle .
As for the mechanism , we are puzzled
Sigrid Dengel
University of Edinburgh Every 11 years or so , the Sun becomes more active , producing a peak of sunspots .
These sunspots carry a magnetic field that blocks and slows the path of energetic particles .
When the researchers looked at their data , they found that tree growth was highest during periods of low sunspot activity , when most cosmic rays reached Earth .
But growth slowed during the four periods of cosmic ray - blocking high sunspot activity , which have occurred between 1965 and 2005 .
" We tried to correlate the width of the rings , i.e. the growth rate , to climatological factors like temperature .
We also thought it would be interesting to look for patterns related to solar activity , as a few people previously have suggested such a link , " explains Ms Dengel .
" We found them .
And the relation of the rings to the solar cycle was much stronger than it was to any of the climatological factors we had looked at .
We were quite hesitant at first , as solar cycles have been a controversial topic in climatology . "
Sliced for examination " As for the mechanism , we are puzzled . "
Ms Dengel 's team proposes two main hypotheses as to how cosmic ray particles could influence the growth of trees .
The first idea is that cosmic rays ionise gases in the atmosphere , creating molecules around which clouds condense , therefore increasing cloud over .
This mechanism is hotly debated among scientists , and evidence for it is weak .
One study published in 2006 suggested it may account for as little as 2 % of the variation in cloud cover across the UK .
But if it does occur , then an increase in cloud cover and haze would diffuse the amount of solar radiation reaching the trees .
As diffuse radiation penetrates forest canopies better than direct light , it would increase the amount of radiation that plants capture , and increase photosynthesis by trees , boosting growth .
Explaining the unexplained " Or there is some direct effect , " says Ms Dengel .
What that might be is unknown , but experiments in space have shown that cosmic rays can have some positive impacts on biological materials .
Ms Dengel says that much more work needs to be done to investigate the effect further , and their results have received a mixed reaction from other scientists .
" We sent the paper to 161 international colleagues .
We are still harvesting the emails .
We 've identified four groups who would like to work with us on this .
" Locally , one of our colleagues is a cloud physicist .
He was encouraging but sceptical at the same time . "
If further research backs up the team 's findings , the implications could be significant .
" We want to repeat this work for larger data sets , and understand the mechanism better , before we speculate , " says Ms Dengel .
But the influence of cosmic rays could resolve other as yet unexplained cycles in tree growth found in studies in North America .
It also suggests the amount of aerosols that humans emit into the atmosphere could impact tree growth , as high levels of aerosols cause " global dimming " , an effect that occurs when the levels of light reaching the Earth 's surface fall .
" If it is true that the mechanism is all about rays enhancing diffuse radiation , it would mean that ' global dimming ' and ' global brightening ' would have a big effect on tree growth and therefore on the absorption of carbon dioxide , " warns Ms Dengel .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Harley - Davidson Inc. HOG , +3.93 % said Thursday its third - quarter net income dropped 84 % to $ 26.48 million , or 11 cents a share , from $ 166.54 million , or 71 cents a share in the year - ago period .
The Milwaukee - based motorcycle manufacturer was expected to earn 23 cents a share , according to a survey by FactSet Research .
Harley 's latest quarter included a one - time fixed - asset impairment charge of $ 14.2 million related to Buell and a goodwill impairment charge of $ 18.9 million related to MV Agusta .
Looking ahead , the company will discontinue production of Buell motorcycles , resulting in the loss of 180 jobs over time .
It 'll book one - time charges of $ 215 million to $ 245 million in 2009 and 2010 , about $ 55 million ahead of its July projections .
The company expects to ship 35,000 to 40,000 motorcycles in the fourth quarter .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Police recently concluded that former NFL star Steve McNair was fatally shot in his sleep by girlfriend Sahel Kazemi in a murder - suicide .
Yet while there are more than 10,000 media entries on Google News for Steve McNair , only a few of them even mention the phrase domestic violence .
Violence by women against their male partners is often ignored or not recognized as domestic violence .
Law enforcement , the judicial system , the media and the domestic - violence establishment are still stuck in the outdated “ man as perpetrator / woman as victim ” conception of domestic violence .
Yet more than 200 studies have found that women initiate at least as much violence against their male partners as vice versa .
Men account for about a third of domestic - violence injuries and deaths .
Research shows women often compensate for their lack of physical strength by employing weapons and the element of surprise — just as Miss Kazemi is thought to have done .
The most recent large - scale study of domestic violence was conducted by Harvard researchers and published in the American Journal of Public Health .
The study , which surveyed 11,000 men and women , found that , according to both men’s and women ’s accounts , 50 percent of the violence in their relationships was reciprocal ( involving both parties ) .
In those cases , the women were more likely to have been the first to strike .
Moreover , when the violence was one - sided , both women and men said women were the perpetrators about 70 percent of the time .
New research from Deborah Capaldi shows the most dangerous domestic - violence scenario for both women and men is that of reciprocal violence , particularly if that violence is initiated by women .
Moreover , children who witness their mothers assaulting their fathers are just as likely to assault their intimate partners when they are adults as those who saw their fathers assault their mothers .
There are solutions to protect all parties affected by domestic violence :
c Just as we ’ve properly stigmatized men who hit women , we need to encourage women not to attack their men .
Ms. Capaldi says she thinks the best way for women to be safe is not to initiate violence against their male partners .
“ The question of initiation of violence is a crucial one …. much DV is mutual , and initiations — even that seem minor — may lead to escalation , ” she says .
Ms. Capaldi ’s research found that a young woman ’s domestic violence was just as predictive of her male partner ’s future domestic violence as the man ’s own past domestic violence .
c When safe , the domestic - violence system needs to treat violent couples as violent couples , instead of shoehorning them into the “ man as perp / woman as victim ” model .
Counseling services for violent couples are rare .
Domestic - violence author and authority Lonnie R. Hazelwood says the misguided domestic - violence establishment “ has been very effective in passing laws to prohibit couples counseling and eliminate programs which use gender - inclusive strategies . ”
c Establish services and help for male domestic - violence victims .
Denise Hines of Clark University found that when an abused man called the police , the police were more likely to arrest him than to arrest his abusive female partner .
This is partly the result of primary aggressor laws , which encourage police to discount who initiated and committed the violence but instead look at other factors that make them likelier to arrest men .
When the men in Ms. Hines ’ study tried calling domestic - violence hot lines , 64 percent were told the hot lines helped only women , and more than half were referred to programs for male domestic - violence perpetrators .
c Work to ensure that male domestic - violence victims will not lose their children in custody proceedings .
Ms. Hines found that the biggest reason male domestic - violence victims hesitate to leave their wives / girlfriends is concern for their children .
If they leave , their children are left unprotected in the hands of a violent mother .
If they take their children , when they ’re found , the children will be taken away and given to the mother .
Moreover , the men probably would lose custody of their children in the divorce / custody proceeding anyway , again leaving their children in harm ’s way .
Perhaps none of these policies would have saved Mr. McNair .
However , domestic violence by women is n’t rare , it is n’t trivial , and ignoring it harms couples and their children .

EXCLUSIVE :
The White House is collecting and storing comments and videos placed on its social - networking sites such as Facebook , Twitter and YouTube without notifying or asking the consent of the site users , a failure that appears to run counter to President Obama ’s promise of a transparent government and his pledge to protect privacy on the Internet .
Marc Rotenberg , president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center , said the White House signaled that it would insist on open dealings with Internet users and , in fact , should feel obliged to disclose that it is collecting such information .
“ The White House has not been adequately transparent , particularly on how it makes use of new social media techniques , such as this example , ” he said .
Defenders of the White House actions said the Presidential Records
Act requires that the administration gather the information and that it was justified in taking the additional step of asking a private contractor to “ crawl and archive ” all such material .
Nicholas Shapiro , a White House spokesman , declined to say when the practice began or how much the new contract would cost .
Susan Cooper , a spokeswoman for National Archives and Records Administration , said the presidential records law applies to “ social media ” and to public comments “ received by the president or immediate staff . ”

Mr. Obama signed a memo in January stating that his efforts to maintain an open government would be “ unprecedented ” and “ ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency , public participation and collaboration . ”
An Obama campaign document on technology pledged that , as president , Mr. Obama “ will strengthen privacy protections for the digital age and will harness the power of technology to hold government and business accountable for violations of personal privacy . ”
In a June 5 , 2008 , article in PC Magazine , Mr. Obama said , “ The open information platforms of the 21st century can also tempt institutions to violate the privacy of citizens .
We need sensible safeguards that protect privacy in this dynamic new world . ”
The National Legal and Policy Center , a government ethics watchdog , said archiving the sites would have a “ chilling effect ” on Web site users who might wish to leave comments critical of the administration .
Ken Boehm , a lawyer and chairman of the center , also disputed that the presidential records law applies , because the comments are pasted onto a third - party Web page and not official correspondence with the president .
“ If the White House has nothing to hide , why is this cloaked in secrecy ?
Why wo n’t they make the dollar amount this is going to cost public ? ”
Mr. Boehm asked .
“ I do n’t think there is an expectation that this is being captured by the government and saved . ”
But Patrice McDermott , director of OpenTheGovernment.org , called the proposal “ a positive development because it demonstrates a commitment from the Obama administration to meet its obligations under the Presidential Records Act . ”
“ Additionally , I am encouraged to see the administration recognizing that it must find a way to handle the ever - expanding amount of data generated electronically .
I hope the rest of the executive branch will learn from the president ’s leadership on this issue , ” Ms. McDermott said .
Shahid Buttar , executive director of the Bill of Rights Defense Committee , called for congressional oversight of the practice of collecting data .
“ Given the administration ’s disappointing secrecy in other contexts , the Bill of Rights Defense Committee encourages Congress to conduct oversight to ensure compliance with the law , maximize transparency and protect individual privacy , ” Mr. Buttar said .
According to the law , the term “ presidential records ” means documentary materials “ created or received by the president , his immediate staff or a unit or individual of the Executive Office of the President whose function is to advise and assist the president , in the course of conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional , statutory , or other official or ceremonial duties of the President . ”
“ It includes any documentary materials relating to the political activities of the president or members of his staff , but only if such activities relate to or have a direct effect upon the carrying out of constitutional , statutory , or other official or ceremonial duties of the President , ” the law says .
David Almacy , who served as President George W. Bush ’s Internet director , said the Bush administration did not use the then - fledgling social - networking sites in the same manner as the Obama White House , except to upload presidential speeches onto iTunes .
The White House , however , did archive comments posted to its official Web site .
The proposal issued Aug. 21 calls for a contractor to “ crawl and archive ” social - networking Web sites where the White House maintains an official presence on seven networks : Facebook , Twitter , MySpace , Flickr , YouTube , Vimeo and Slideshare .
The collection will include the comments , tags , graphics , audio and video posted by users who do n’t work for the White House .
The White House has more than 333,000 fans on Facebook , and posts updates several times a day that draw hundreds of thousands of comments , both positive and negative .
The White House has more than 1 million followers on Twitter and more than 87,000 subscribers on YouTube , where more than 400 videos of the president and White House briefings are posted .

Runaway Bride or Crime Victim ?
Annie Le Goes Missing From Yale Campus Police are still unsure if Annie Le is a crime victim or if she got cold feet .
Sept. 11 , 2009  --
Yale University has announced Friday that the school is offering a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to the whereabouts of missing student Annie Le .
Le , a 24 - year - old pharmacology graduate student , is supposed to be married in two days .
Worried friends and family have gone from helping prepare for the wedding to searching for the missing Yale grad student .
She was last seen walking into a research laboratory around 10 a.m. Tuesday .
But she later disappeared , leaving her purse and other belongings behind .
" She left her pocketbook , her cell phone , everything , in the lab , " Le 's co-worker Debbie Apuzzo said .
Now New Haven , Conn. , police -- who have been joined by the FBI -- are trying to determine whether Le was the victim or a crime or if she simply got cold feet .
Her friends describe the petite woman as smart , pretty and conscientious .
Le is a 4 - foot - 11 - inch Asian female with shoulder - length brown hair and brown eyes .
She weighs 90 pounds .
Le 's friend Tara Bancroft said Le had " a lot of good friends , a wonderful fiance she 's going to marry on Sunday .
We all love her a lot . "
Le 's Facebook page shows the 24 - year - old student posing in wedding dresses and smiling with fiance Jonathan Widawsky , a Columbia University graduate student in physics whom she described as her best friend .
" He 's an amazing kid , just a wonderful , wonderful boy and he must be heartbroken , " Widawsky 's friend Linda Matychack said .
" I just ca n't imagine . "
Investigators have combed the lab and sorted through Dumpsters looking for clues .
Le 's face now graces an electronic billboard along Connecticut 's Interstate 91 .
ABC 's Connecticut affiliate WTNH reported that FBI agents searched Le 's apartment earlier Tuesday but would not answer any questions about the investigation .
" Law enforcement officers are continuing to undertake detailed searches of the surrounding area , and security officials are reviewing images from closed - circuit cameras in the area , " Yale Chief of Police James Perrotti said in a statement .
Annie Le' Co-Worker : ' We 're Not Going to Look at the Worst Here '
Her co-workers have said they do n't understand how she disappeared in the middle of the day .
" How could that happen ?
She 's a tiny little thing but still I mean , it 's amazing .
It really is .
It 's pretty scary , " Apuzzo said .
" We 're just praying that she 's just going to pop up somewhere and everything 's OK , we 're not going to look at the worst here . "
Le herself wrote an article about crime in New Haven for the University Magazine earlier this year , nothing that the campus is " still plagued with thefts , some involving frightening confrontations " and that " New Haven is a city and all cities have their perils , but with a little street smarts , one can avoid becoming another statistic . "
Le is a pharmacology student and attended the University of Rochester for her undergraduate degree , according to WTNH .
If Le did flee to avoid her nuptials , she would join ranks with Jennifer Wilbanks , the infamous runaway bride who , in 2006 , fled her Georgia home .
Though a massive manhunt was launched , Wilbanks was found in Albuquerque days later after claiming to have been kidnapped .
After being charged with making false statements , her wide - eyed mug shot was later used as fodder for late - night television comics .
When you hear the word “ telephone booth ” you ’ll probably think about old fashioned way to make a call , dirty red boxes , coins that you never carry with you and a fat torn up telephone book you do n’t want to touch .
Maybe those opinions would change if you saw this incredible telephone booth aquarium located in Lyon , France .
Benoit Deseille and Benedetto Bufalino have made this piece of art using an old telephone booth .
It ’s even more amazing to watch when it gets dark because it ’s glowing and looks very colorful .

Innovation and invention :
Why did n’t I think of that ?
September 10 , 2009 By Paul Wagorn
Sometimes a picture needs almost no explanation :
This great idea solves the problem of how to dry all the clothes in the laundry at once , and also helps rid laundry of clothespin marks .
I would imagine that these clotespin - hangers would also double as regular hangers once the clothes are dry .
The sheer simplicity of these hangers is what impresses me most about these innovative and creative hangers .

before hanging the clothesline , tie knots with 6 " spacing .
use regular hangers on the line .
the knots will keep the hangers from sliding .
Do you know who manufactures these ?
Why not just hang the hanger on the clothesline ?
Why not just put the clothes on a hanger and hang them inside on a bathroom curtain rod or make a stand outside to hang clothes on hangers ?
It seems that 'd be a lot simpler since most people have dryers and do n't have to hang dry stuff much .
You could at a clothpin - style clip to this and ditch the metal spring .
Cheaper to manufacture and just as effective.@dubsman Positioning .
You do n't want your clothes to all slide together ; the clothes in the middle wo n't get as dry .
Um , what ?
I fail to see what has been accomplished in that photo .
Clothesline bow in the middle .
If the shirts are touching they are n't going to dry well will they .
A strong breeze will also knock them off at the right angle as well .
yes ... they slip that muchDitch the spring and the extra part and just use a second smaller hook .
http://imgur.com/y0MDf.pngI usually pin socks up between ... sock , sock , shirt , sock , sock , shirt .
But these would be handy in a few instances , anyhow .
Dubsman , you must have more tension in your clotheslines than I.dubsman : coat hangers on a clotheline tend to all weigh down the line and bunch up in one spot .
the advantage of having the clothespin hold it to the line is that they do n't slide .
the workaround right now is to use clothespins along the line to let the hangers fall into that .
why not put a clothespin on the line next to the hanger to keep gravity from pulling it to the middle ?
clothespins are dirt cheap , and I imagine these would cost more than your average hanger .
does n't seem like a great idea to me - just one to sucker people out of their money .
The do n't look like they 'd hold up well during a windy day , and if you are hanging clothes on an outdoor clothesline , you want some wind .
not bad , but why is this a major advantage over using ordinary hangars , I do ..... they do n't slip that muchif you 're already a member .

CIA Torturers Running Scared
For the CIA supervisors and operatives responsible for torture , the chickens are coming home to roost ; that is , if President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder mean it when they say no one is above the law – and if they do n’t fall victim to brazen intimidation .
Email
Printer friendly Unable to prevent Holder from starting an investigation of torture and other war crimes that implicate CIA officials past and present , those same CIA officials , together with what those in the intelligence trade call “ agents of influence ” in the media , are pulling out all the stops to quash the Justice Department ’s preliminary investigation .
In what should be seen as a bizarre twist , seven CIA directors — including three who are themselves implicated in planning and conducting torture and assassination — have asked the President to call off Holder .
Please , tell me how could the whole thing be more transparent ?
The most vulnerable of the Gang of Seven , George Tenet , is not the brightest star in the heavens , but even he was able to figure out years ago that he and his accomplices might end up having to pay a heavy price for violating international and U.S. criminal law .
In his memoir , At the Center of the Storm , Tenet notes that what the CIA needed were “ the right authorities ” and policy determination to do the bidding of President George W. Bush : “ Sure , it was a risky proposition when you looked at it from a policy maker ’s point of view .
We were asking for and we would be given as many authorities as CIA had ever had .
Things could blow up .
People , me among them , could end up spending some of the worst days of our lives justifying before congressional overseers our new freedom to act . ” ( p. 178 ) Tenet and his masters assumed , correctly , that given the mood of the times and the lack of spine among lawmakers , congressional “ overseers ” would relax into their accustomed role as congressional overlookers .
Unfortunately for him , Tenet seems to have confined his concern at the time to the invertebrates in Congress , not anticipating a rejuvenated Justice Department that might take its role in enforcing the law seriously .
Tenet proudly quotes his former counterterrorism chief , Cofer Black ( now a senior official at Blackwater ) : “ As Cofer Black later told Congress , ‘ The gloves came off that day . ’”
That day was Sept. 17 , 2001 , when “ the president approved our recommendations and provided us broad authorities to engage al - Qa’ida . ” ( p. 208 ) Presumably , it was not lost on Tenet that no lawmaker dared ask exactly what Cofer Black meant when he said “ the gloves came off . ”
Had they thought to ask Richard Clarke , former director of the counterterrorist operation at the White House , he could have told them what he wrote in his book , Against All Enemies .
Clarke describes a meeting in which he took part with President George W. Bush in the White House bunker just minutes after Bush ’s TV address to the nation on the evening of 9/11 .
When the subject of international law was raised , Clarke writes that the president responded vehemently : “ I do n’t care what the international lawyers say , we are going to kick some ass . ” [ p. 24 ]
It only took Bush six days to grant the CIA the “ broad authorities ” the agency had recommended .
It then took White House counsel Alberto Gonzales , Vice President Dick Cheney ’s lawyer David Addington , and William J. Haynes II , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ’s lawyer , four more months to advise the president formally that , by fiat , he could ignore the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war .
This gang of lawyers so advised at the turn of 2001 - 2002 , beating down objections by William Howard Taft IV , Secretary of State Colin Powell ’s lawyer .
Bush chose to follow the dubious advice of imaginative lawyers in his and Dick Cheney ’s employ ; namely , that 9/11 ushered in a “ new paradigm ” rendering the Geneva protections “ quaint ” and “ obsolete . ”
Prosecutorial Warning Addington and Gonzales did take care to warn the president , by memorandum of Jan. 25 , 2002 , of the risk of criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 2441 , the War Crimes Act of 1996 .
Their memo said : “ That statute , enacted in 1996 , prohibits the commission of a ‘ war crime ’ by or against a U.S. person , including U.S. officials .
‘ War crime ’… is defined to include any grave breach of the GPW [ Geneva ] or any violation of Article 3 thereof ( such as outrages against personal dignity ) … Punishments for violations of Section 2441 include the death penalty ….
“ … it is difficult to predict the motives of prosecutors or independent counsels who may in the future decide to pursue unwarranted charges based on Section 2441 .
Your determination [ that Geneva does not apply ] would create a reasonable basis in law that Section 2441 does not apply , which would provide a solid defense to any future prosecution . ”
With that kind of pre-ordered reassurance , President Bush issued a two - page executive directive in which he states , “ I accept the legal conclusion of the Department of Justice and determine that common Article 3 of Geneva does not apply to either al Qaeda or Taliban detainees … ”
This is the smoking gun on Bush ’s key role in the subsequent torture of “ war on terror ” prisoners .
The Senate Armed Services Committee issued a report last December stating that that Feb. 7 memorandum “ opened the door ” to abusive interrogation practices .
Unhappily for Bush and those who carried out his instructions , on June 29 , 2006 , in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Geneva DOES apply to al - Qaeda and Taliban detainees .
One senior Bush administration official is reported to have gone quite pale at the time , when Justice Anthony M. Kennedy raised the ante , warning that " violations of Common Article 3 are considered ' war crimes , ' punishable as federal offenses . "
What about U.S. criminal law ?
Despite the almost laughable attempts by lawyers like Addington and John Yoo to get around the War Crimes
Act by advising that only the kind of pain accompanying major organ failure or death can be considered torture , those involved are now in a cold sweat — the more so , since those dubious opinions have now been publicly released .
Evidence of Torture
In releasing the sordid , torture - approving memoranda written by Justice Department lawyers and a critical “ Special Review ” by the CIA ’s own horse ’s - mouth Inspector General , Obama and Holder had to face down very strong pressure from those with the most to lose — former CIA directors and the functionaries ( some of them in senior CIA positions to this very day ) who were responsible for seeing to it that “ the gloves came off . ”
Now , out in the public domain is all the evidence needed to show that war crimes were committed — “ authorized ” as legal by Justice Department Mafia - type lawyers recruited for that express purpose — but war crimes nonetheless .
Torture , kidnapping , illegal detention — not to mention blatant violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) outlawing eavesdropping on Americans without a court warrant .
The stakes are incredibly high .
No wonder the CIA and its “ agents of influence ” ( see Saturday ’s lead story in the Washington Post ) are going all out .
According to the story , seven former CIA directors wrote a letter to Obama on Sept. 18 asking him to “ reverse Attorney General Holder ’s August 24 decision to re-open the criminal investigation of CIA interrogations that took place following the attacks of September 11 . ”
This is the saddest commentary on CIA covert action operatives ’ disdain for the law since their predecessors loudly applauded former Director Richard Helms for lying to Congress about the CIA role in the overthrow of Salvador Allende on 9/11 / 73 .
The largest CIA cafeteria was bulging with welcoming supporters of Helms , when the court got finished with him .
They then took up a collection on the spot to pay the fine the court had imposed after he was allowed to plead nolo contendere .
Among the most transparent parts of the letter from the Gang of Seven is their corporate worry that “ there is no reason to expect that the re-opened criminal investigation will remain narrowly focused . ”
Their worry is all too real .
Evidence already on the public record shows that the first three listed – Michael Hayden , Porter Goss and George Tenet – could readily be indicted for crimes under U.S. and international law , including : -- Illegal eavesdropping by the National Security Agency ( Hayden was NSA director when he ordered his employees to violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which requires warrants from a special court before wiretaps are undertaken . )
-- assassination planning without notification to Congress ( Goss , whose uncommonly abrupt departure in May 2006 was never looked into by the Fawning Corporate Media [ FCM ] ) ; and Tenet ( who turned out to be right about at least one thing — that “ things could blow up . ” )
The other “ distinguished signatories ” were : John Deutch , arrogant to the point of criminality , Deutch disregarded the most elementary rules governing protection of classified information , and had to be given a last - minute pardon by President Bill Clinton .
R. James
Woolsey , the man who outdid himself in trying to tie Saddam Hussein to 9/11 , and in pushing into the limelight spurious intelligence from the fabricator known as “ Curveball . ”
( Remember those fictitious biological weapons labs for which Colin Powell displayed “ artist renderings ” to the U.N. on Feb. 5 , 2003 ? )
William Webster , known mostly at Langley for his handsome face and his devotion to his late - afternoon matches with socialite tennis partners .
( Folks like Webster should recognize that , once they have reached what my lawyer father used to call “ the age of statutory senility , ” they should be more careful regarding what they let themselves be dragged into . )
James R. Schlesinger , “ Big Jim ” launched his brief stint as CIA director by warning us CIA employees that his instructions were “ to ensure that you guys do not screw Richard Nixon . ”
To give substance to this assertion , he told us that the White House had said he was to report to political henchman Bob Haldeman — not Henry Kissinger , the national security advisor .
More recently , Schlesinger led one of the see - no - evil Defense Department “ investigations ” of the abuses of Abu Ghraib .
Quite a group , this Gang of Seven .
Their letter also is condescending toward President Obama : “ As President you have the authority to make decisions restricting substantive interrogation …
But the administration must be mindful that public disclosure about past intelligence operations can only help al - Qaeda elude US intelligence and plan future operations . ”
The seven then proceed to repeat the canard alleging that such collection “ have saved lives and helped protect America from further attacks . ”
It reads as though Dick Cheney did their first draft .
Actually , that would not be all that surprising , given his record of doing quite a lot of CIA ’s drafting for eight long years .

Revelations that a Latrobe Valley man fathered four children with his daughter over 30 years have rocked Victoria a day after the Ombudsman slammed the state 's record on child protection .
The man , in his 60s , is charged with multiple counts of rape and incest in a case that echoes Austria 's Fritzl incest horror .
According to reports , the man raped his daughter almost daily for 30 years and fathered her four children .
The man , who cannot be named , was initially charged with 83 offences , most of which have been withdrawn by police .
Armstrong noted that his quest “ took on a double story ” after Tom Watson , 59 , nearly won golf ’s British Open .
But Armstrong also understood that he had opened himself to public failure by willing himself back into the peloton , three and a half years after retiring when logic and his weary body had told him he was growing old .

Last Sunday , he saw Contador pull away from him on a mountain stage .
On Thursday , he watched Contador ace the time trial , the way a champion should .
They are not the best of friends , as demonstrated by Armstrong ’s gritted words on Versus network early Saturday .
Anybody could see what was going on , he said , meaning Contador was not a helpful teammate .
But Contador has obviously earned the right to be the lead rider .
Armstrong will not give up chasing Contador  and why should he ?
On Thursday , he announced that he would race next year for a team sponsored by RadioShack .
He will have a stable of domestiques laboring exclusively for him .
“ I believe I ’ll be better , ” he said .
“ It ’s hard to get back to speed , but now that I ’ve been through the Giro and the Tour , I think I can make some tactical adjustments . ”
He talked about throwing a potential teammate like Levi Leipheimer at Contador and other opponents .
He was already racing in 2010 .
Why did he come back ?
Some people may use the word ego , but if ego is a bad thing , then we are all wasting our time following sports .
Take away ego , and you take away Michael Jordan ’s sneer and Martina Navratilova ’s scowl and Dara Torres ’s glint .
They all went away and came back , for whatever their reasons , beating a lot of younger competitors , just out of orneriness .
Without ego , Armstrong would not have persevered for three weeks , through rain and heat and tricky curves and steep hills and drunken lunatics lurching centimeters away from him .
The old man and the mountain .
None of this affects his past .
He won his seven straight Tours , beating a lot of cyclists who were caught taking one thing or another , in a sport that was allowed to be highly dirty .
Editor 's Note :
This story details how two members of the CNN Special Investigations Unit reported a story about controversial plans to spend $ 31 million to enhance two remote crossings on the border between the United States and Canada .
The road to the border was so quiet it was safe for Drew Griffin to sit in the middle of it .
SCOBEY , Montana ( CNN ) --
We were driving through some of the most remote country in the United States , chasing a story that seemed hard to believe .
The Department of Homeland Security had announced it was spending $ 31 million to enhance and upgrade two remote border crossings -- just 12 miles apart -- on the border between Montana and the Canadian province of Saskatchewan .
The spending was lauded by Montana 's two senators , even though only an average of 22 cars a day traveled through these border posts .
We hopped a plane from Atlanta , Georgia , to Billings , Montana , and then headed to Scobey and Whitetail .
The six - hour drive took us through some of this nation 's most beautiful country into the high plains of the Missouri River Region .
It was a drive punctuated with glimpses of cows and antelopes , but few people .
In fact , Burl Bowler , editor of the Daniels County Leader newspaper , which serves the border towns , advised us where to stop for gas en route , so we would n't run out and then really be in trouble .
Besides seeing a part of the country where Lt. Col.
George Custer took his last stand , there was the added benefit ( sorry CNN management ) of having no phone or Blackberry access .
In that respect , it was a peaceful drive .
When we got to Scobey , the few people we encountered could n't have been nicer .
Everyone we passed stopped , said hello , or waved .
But encountering people was the problem -- and in fact , the story :
We just did n't encounter that many .
Certainly not at the border , where we stood and even sat in the middle of the road to show viewers how few people travel to and from Canada here .
Watch just how quiet the border crossing was »
The Scobey border crossing itself seemed perfectly adequate .
But the Department of Homeland Security had warned its agents not to allow us inside , so we do n't know what the interior is like .
If we came in , we would be too disruptive , one government spokesman had informed us .
In Scobey , that claim seemed a little far - fetched , since there was n't anything going on here -- disruptive or otherwise .
On the Canadian side , farmer Marc Chabot , a U.S. citizen whose family has farmed the area on both sides of the border for generations , said he was grateful for the money his senators -- Democrats Max Baucus and Jon Tester -- steered to northeast Montana .
But , he said , like others in the community , he gasped when he learned of the plan to spend $ 31 million expanding two border crossings that are rarely used .
" It would be wiser spent on something more useful to the public generally , " he told us , adding that come winter , the average of 20 cars crossing a day in Scobey drops to almost none .
Editor Burl Bowler told us the area could certainly use stimulus money for jobs , but not at the border .
We asked both Bowler and Chabot about the possibility of terrorists creeping across the frontier .
Both said that after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , everyone needed to be more mindful of the porous border .
But Chabot said the government had the area fairly well covered .
" Trust me , they know we are here right now , " he said .
And a massive new building costing more than $ 15 million in Scobey , Montana , was n't exactly a deterrence to someone set on harming the United States , he added .
Chabot joked that any stranger in the area certainly would not be a stranger long , since everyone knew everyone -- a point echoed by Bowler , who pointed out that while he had n't told many people that CNN was coming to town , everyone seemed to know it anyway .
In Whitetail , it was even quieter .
The town has grain elevators and a post office .
Bureau of Transportation statistics show only about two people a day cross the border there , and the agents ' building seemed in good shape , save for maybe needing a paint job .
The DHS planned to spend $ 15 million on the outpost .
That would buy a lot more paint than the building seemed to need .
So why did these two areas get so much money ?
Locals and critics suspect politics might have played a role .
Baucus is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee ; Tester is on the Senate 's Homeland Security Committee .
Both took credit for convincing the DHS to give these towns millions for border crossings , bragging in a joint press release that they pressured the agency .
" This is good news for all of Montana and especially communities across the northern tier , " Baucus said in the statement .
Tester said the spending would " pay off for generations to come by creating new jobs and opportunity that will benefit all of Montana . "
As late as Wednesday , his spokesman reiterated Tester 's support of the spending , saying that it would seal security gaps on the border .
So , the nagging question : Did politics , rather than security , guide the DHS ?
Especially when a border town like Laredo , Texas , which sees 66,000 crossings a day , was getting not one dime of the $ 400 million in DHS border stimulus funds .
Montana , in total , was to receive $ 77 million .
In an interview Wednesday with CNN , Trent Frazier , the director of port modernization for the Department of Homeland Security , denied that politics played any role .
" We feel that these ports , like all ports of entry , are a vital part of the network of security that we have established across the border apparatus that we employ across the borders , and the investments we are going to do along these borders are a critical step in ensuring we can perform our mission , " Frazier said .
But if Frazier did not believe politics factored in the decisions , it appeared to play a big role by Wednesday afternoon .
Fellow Democrat Sen. Byron Dorgan , from the neighboring state of North Dakota , sent out a news release urging DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano to suspend the stimulus program .
He said that spending the money on such remote ports -- including the nine in his state -- was " just nuts . "
Dorgan said the plan " just defied common sense . "
Within hours , Napolitano announced she was ordering a 30 - day review to see if the money was being spent appropriately .
In her letter to Dorgan , Napolitano said 39 of the 43 Custom and Border Protection posts were located in the northern United States .
She said most of the Southern ports were owned by the General Services Administration , and the money directed by Congress was earmarked for the Custom and Border Protection properties and required to be spent within 24 months .
" Nonetheless , " she wrote , " in order to ensure even further transparency in this process , I am ordering a 30 day review " of all port construction decisions by officials who did not make the initial allocation decisions .
So , for now , if you want to travel to Canada through Scobey or Whitetail , the agents who inspect your vehicles will be using the buildings now in place -- and according to the locals , you will be adequately served .

Homemade butter is easy , relatively quick to make and amazingly delicious .
If it cost less than buying butter at the grocery store , it would be too good to be true , which is why this is not the case .
All things considered , though , I still think it ’s well worth it .
This stuff is precious , so I think the best use of it is not in baking , but rather , on top of freshly baked , still warm , bread , muffins or crumpets .
Are you ready for this ?
It ’s intense .
We begin with cream .
I used superfresh local stuff , but the carton at the grocery store will do just as well .
The important thing is to use cream at room temperature .
The difference between doing this with cold cream and room temperature cream is the difference between an hour of churning and ten minutes .
Next , get a container with a tight - fitting screw - on lid that will not spurt cream all over your kitchen when you shake it vigorously .
It also needs to hold at least twice the volume of the amount of cream you ’re using .
Begin shaking the container up and down in a rhythmic pattern .
After 3 minutes , it ’ll start feeling less like you ’re shaking a jar of liquid and more like you ’re shaking a jar of whipped cream , because essentially , you are .
The next 3 minutes will feel like you ’re shaking a brick .
This is the hardest part .
You will wonder “ is this doing anything ? ” Just keep at it .
All of a sudden , within just a few shakes , the jar will begin going “ shuk shuk shuk ” and you ’ll be able to feel the butter separating from the buttermilk .
Keep doing that for about four minutes until you have lots of buttermilk in there .
Next ( not pictured ) , cover the top of the jar with cheesecloth and pour off the buttermilk , which can be used for a great many delicious items , but most notably , all the best pancake recipes call for buttermilk .
It ’s a truth .
After that , let the faucet water get as cold as it gets , then fill the jar to just under the top of the butter .
The water needs to be very cold , or else the butter will melt as you replace the cheesecloth and pour the water out into the sink .
Repeat 7 - 10 times until the water drains completely clear .
This cleans the butter and keeps it from going rancid as quickly as it will otherwise .
Also important is to drain the butter .
I have pictures of this part .
All that water puddling under the butter needs to come out .
The best way is with a marble cutting board , but since I do n’t have one of those , I used a wooden one .
Simply squeeze the water out of the butter with a wooden spoon or spatula .
The latter will double as a scraper to regroup between squeezings .
To do away with the drained water , tilt the cutting board and / or use paper towels to absorb it .
If you feel like the butter is getting melty at all , just stick it in the fridge for a few minutes before going back at it .
If you want to salt your butter , add about 1 / 4 tsp salt and stir into your finished butter .
I think the reason to do this last is that it does n’t interfere with the draining process by absorbing water and embedding it in the butter .
And that ’s it !
Beautiful , beautiful butter .
Notes
I used one pint of cream to make just under 6.5 oz of butter and almost a cup of buttermilk .
These amounts will vary from batch to batch , but is a decent estimate .
According to our calendars , summer is almost over .
Kids are returning home from camp , school supplies are being purchased and I ’m wondering where the time goes .
Want your summer to last forever ?
The Rolling Summer House may be just what this doctor ordered .
It ’s a huge spherical structure constructed of unseasoned wood ( from local , sustainable forests ) that is curved via an eco-friendly process called “ steam - bending ” .
Charlie Whinney , of the UK based Charlie Whinney Associates , is known for his unusual furniture and sculptures and he ’s the master of the innovative art of steam - bent wood .
He designed the Rolling Summer House using this low energy technique which produces almost no waste .
He did n’t use any epoxy resins , glues or sealants – it ’s amazing , actually , that the entire thing does n’t explode .
The “ house ” has a cozy interior cave - like space – perfect for relaxing or reading – surrounded by an outer layer of thin strands of wood .
And imagine this : it can be rolled around by two adults without hurting the lawn , as well as stay firmly in place ( using three sturdy legs ) and act as a jungle gym for kids to climb all over .
A private space in your garden , a piece of organic outdoor sculpture , a climbing structure for young children – the Rolling Summer House was designed with a year - long summer in mind .
See this and Whinney ’s other steam - bent creations and collaborative projects on the temporary website .
The Fountain Bench is particularly stunning .
Or go to thegreenhaus .
co.uk to order one of his “ signature pieces ” – the fantastic Curly Shade or Giant Curly Shade pendant lights ( $ 500 and $ 990 respectively ) .
Whinney constantly pushes the steam - bent envelope and will introduce a new group of products – Fragmented Factories – during the London Design Festival , 13 to 23 September .

NEW YORK — Is Israel just a nation among nations ?
On one level , it is indeed an ordinary place .
People curse the traffic , follow their stocks , Blackberry , go to the beach and pay their mortgages .
Stroll around in the prosperous North Tel Aviv suburbs and you find yourself California dreaming .
On another , it ’s not .
More than 60 years after the creation of the modern state , Israel has no established borders , no constitution , no peace .
Born from exceptional horror , the Holocaust , it has found normality elusive .
The anxiety of the diaspora Jews has ceded not to tranquility but to another anxiety .
The escape from walls has birthed new walls .
The annihilation psychosis has not disappeared but taken new form .
For all Israel ’s successes — it is the most open , creative and dynamic society in the region — this is a gnawing failure .
Can anything be done about it ?

Since Pat Tillman 's death by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004 , journalists have operated under the incorrect assumption that Tillman did not grant interviews after he walked away from a multimillion - dollar contract with the Arizona Cardinals to join the Army .
We were wrong .
After leaving football , Tillman participated in a single , ongoing , no -holds - barred conversation with himself .
He kept a journal .
Some of his most telling entries appear in the book " Where Men Win Glory : The Odyssey of Pat Tillman , " by Jon Krakauer , which goes on sale today .
In the years since Tillman became the object of a military cover - up and a crass public - relations campaign by an administration desperate to win an election and divert attention away from the Abu Ghraib prison scandal , reporters have had to rely on public statements from Tillman 's friends and family to imagine what the athlete - turned - soldier - turned - hero would have thought about what happened to his legacy .
I 've spoken a number of times to his mother , Mary , who wrote her own book , " Boots on the Ground by Dusk , " about her son .
She told me once of Pat , " He was a very big - hearted person .
And honest to a fault . "
Pat 's brother , Kevin , who entered the Army with Pat , eloquently addressed the Army 's contention that a " perception of concealment " occurred after Pat 's death .
Speaking before a congressional committee , he said : " Delivering false information at a nationally - televised memorial service is not an error in judgment .
Discarding an investigation that does not fit a preordained conclusion is not an error in judgment .
These are deliberate acts of deceit .
This is not the perception of concealment .
This is concealment . "
But no one had heard from Pat until his wife , Marie , gave Krakauer access to Tillman 's surviving journals .
( After his death , a notebook he had with him was burned by the Army , along with his clothes . )
The excerpts Krakauer includes in his book answer some of the questions we might have asked Tillman .
For instance :
How did he feel about the war with Iraq ?
Shortly before the invasion , Tillman wrote : " Were our case for war even somewhat justifiable , no doubt many of our traditional allies ... would be praising our initiative ...
However , every leader in the world , with a few exceptions , is crying foul , as is the voice of much of the people .
This ... leads me to believe that we have little or no justification other than our imperial whim .
Of course Nub ( his nickname for Kevin ) & I have ... willingly allowed ourselves to be pawns in this game and will do our job whether we agree with it or not .
All we ask is that it is duly noted that we harbor no illusions of virtue . "
Krakauer also quotes from an Army document Tillman filled out in which he was required to state preferences for possible funeral arrangements .
Under " special instructions " Tillman wrote , " I do not want the military to have any direct involvement with my funeral . "
( Krakauer will appear at a discussion and book signing on Oct. 3 at Dobson High School in Tempe .
The event , sponsored by Changing Hands Bookstore , will benefit the Pat Tillman Foundation .
For tickets call 480-730-0205 . )
Finally , while others have attempted to define Tillman 's legacy , he provided his own answer in a journal entry .
Like the man , it avoids cliches , acknowledges ambiguity and speaks humbly of his aspirations .
He wrote :
" Will people see me as an honest man , hard working man , family man , a good man ?
Can I become the man I envision ?
Is vision and follow - through enough ?
How important is talent & blind luck ? ...
There are no true answers , just shades of grey , coincidence , and circumstance . "

For kindergarteners , high schoolers and pre-med students alike , a calendar flip to September means it 's back to school time .
Freshly sharpened pencils , notebooks just begging to be scribbled in and one inevitable question that will be asked and answered a gazillion times within the first week of classes : what did you do this summer ?
Throw that query at Vancouver Canucks forward Kyle Wellwood and the response will most likely catch you off guard .
" I spent the whole summer in Windsor and I spent a weekend in Saskatoon visiting a friend , that was my only vacation . "
I greeted that response with a sheepish smirk .
Wellwood knew I was n't buying it , so he pressed on .
" I really did n't do a whole lot .
I did some cycling and a lot of training , and other than that I just hung out with family and friends .
Oh and my sister got married too , so that was an event . "
That 's right , Wellwood spent the summer like you and I did , only with less glitz and glam .
Remember the Kyle Wellwood who won over everyone last season with his everyman approach to hockey ?
The guy who battled his way through showing up to training camp overweight and out of shape only to record a career - high 18 goals , 10 of which came on the power play with three counting as game - winners ?
That Wellwood learned a lot last season , a lot , a lot , a lot .
For the first time in his brief NHL career , the Ontario product had to put in a substantial effort every day just to stick with the Canucks .
It was exhausting , yet rewarding and at season 's end he finally had a sense of what it takes to do more than just coast in the big leagues .
He understood how to be an impactful player that is counted on in a rainbow of situations .
Wellwood does n't want to ever - and he means ever - experience the hell he went through at the beginning of the 2008 - 09 campaign .
So he made a plan and it started with thinking of summer less as a 24/ 7 free - for - all and more as a 24/7 workout .
" Last summer I was just happy to get on the ice and be able to skate and make it through practice , " admitted Wellwood , who weighed in at nearly 200 - pounds during camp last season .
" Now there 's definitely a big difference .
Hopefully at this year 's camp I 'll be one of the better players and I 'll be able to make the team a lot easier . "
Wellwood is down to a lean 180 - pounds and is in the best shape of his life .
No Bowflex , no pilates , just an unwavering dedication to being the best player he can be .
A marked improvement in strength was Wellwood 's primary objective , mainly because he did n't feel up to par compared to other NHLers last year .
The Canucks agreed and although they understood that Wellwood was n't a workout machine last summer because of injury , this off - season it was time to git -r - done .
" My goal was mainly to catch up on the time missed while I was hurt and try to get back to a level that everybody else is at .
" I feel like I 've accomplished that , cardio wise and fitness wise I 'm feeling great .
It takes years to build the kind of strength that you need , but I had some big improvements . "
Turns out Wellwood did more this summer than he initially let on .
Schwarzeneggering himself certainly makes the list , as does one noteworthy day the 26 - year - old spent in court .
No , it was n't for brawling with cabbies .
Wellwood took part in arbitration and to his disbelief , it was n't the worst thing in the world .
" I would do it again , " he laughed .
" I do n't know if they took it easy on me or what , but it was n't horrible .
As a player it 's part of the game and sometimes you need to do it .
" I wanted to be in Vancouver 100 per cent and we knew that would be the case at any rate . "
One other minor detail Wellwood forgot to mention from his summer was that his younger brother Eric , a forward who spent the last three seasons with the OHL's Windsor Spitfires , got the call he had been dreaming of .
The phone rang early in July and the Philadelphia Flyers told the 19 - year - old they had selected him in the sixth round , 172nd overall , in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft .
" That was definitely an event , " said Wellwood with pride .
" We had a draft party back at home and it was exciting .
It 's a hard thing to do to get drafted and he was really excited and our whole family was .
He had a great summer so he 's trying to go in and impress them at camp . "
With the off - season this second - year Canuck had , he 's well on his way to doing the same thing .

Germany could raise 100bn euros with the wealth tax , say the petitioners
A group of rich Germans has launched a petition calling for the government to make wealthy people pay higher taxes .
The group say they have more money than they need , and the extra revenue could fund economic and social programmes to aid Germany 's economic recovery .
Germany could raise 100bn euros ( £ 91 bn ) if the richest people paid a 5 % wealth tax for two years , they say .
The petition has 44 signatories so far , and will be presented to newly re-elected Chancellor Angela Merkel .
The group say the financial crisis is leading to an increase in unemployment , poverty and social inequality .
Simply donating money to deal with the problems is not enough , they want a change in the whole approach .
" The path out of the crisis must be paved with massive investment in ecology , education and social justice , " they say in the petition .
Those who had " made a fortune through inheritance , hard work , hard - working , successful entrepreneurship , or investment " should contribute by paying more to alleviate the crisis .
The man behind the petition , Dieter Lehmkuhl , told Berlin 's Tagesspiegel that there were 2.2 million people in Germany with a fortune of more than 500,000 euros .
If they all paid the tax for two years , Germany could raise 100bn euros to fund ecological programmes , education and social projects , said the retired doctor and heir to a brewery .
Signatory Peter Vollmer told AFP news agency he was supporting the proposal because he had inherited " a lot of money I do not need " .
He said the tax would be " a viable and socially acceptable way out of the flagrant budget crisis " .
The group held a demonstration in Berlin on Wednesday to draw attention to their plans , throwing fake banknotes into the air .
Mr Vollmer said it was " really strange that so few people came " .

Josh I has 26 tattoos , some of which are demons .
Belying a stable , middle - class upbringing , he has a résumé littered with revolving - door drug and alcohol rehab stints .
He 's a former crackhead who 's admitted to driving drunk , getting high and not having the faintest idea what he might have done or where he might have done it on countless foggy last nights .
He recently — only after photos surfaced on the Internet , mind you — confessed to a boffo binge in January in a Tempe tavern that ended up with him drunk , shirtless , covered in whipped cream and having his crotch massaged by three semi- dressed women , none of them his wife .
In the eight months between incident and enlightenment , he continued selling his autobiography — Beyond Belief — and telling his motivational tale of born - again sobriety .
Josh II also has tattoos , including one of his grandmother 's name .
His childhood included a father walking out immediately after his birth and his severely bowed legs being broken below the knees and reset twice before age 2 .
He had an uncle killed in a robbery , a friend murdered and a sister jailed for , among other things , spitting on a cop .
He 's guilty of handing out birthday party fliers during a playoff series , admitting to smoking marijuana , getting arrested for drag racing and spewing out a vulgar dissin ' of the national anthem at a charity flag football event .
Info Josh Hamilton
The sagas of both Joshes sparked emotional feedback to the Dallas Observer and my Sportatorium sports blog over the last year .
A sampling :
Josh I : " American hero " ... " more respect for him than ever " ... " never said he was perfect .
But he is forgiven " ...
" Give the guy a break .
He screwed up , but got right back on track . "
Josh II : " He 's just a dumb coon nigger " ... " Hanged " ... " I wish he'd go back to throwing spears in Africa " ...
" I 'll never watch him play .
Ever . "
Josh I , of course , is Texas Rangers ' two - time All - Star outfielder Josh Hamilton .
Josh II , obviously , is Dallas Mavericks ' former All - Star forward Josh Howard .
None of their transgressions has hurt anyone other than themselves .
And , relatively speaking , Howard shoots a basketball on par with how Hamilton hits a baseball .
So what gives ?
While Howard incited harsh criticism from yours truly and from readers — vitriolic backlash that would make even David Duke blush — Hamilton 's immunity has been perplexing .
You can try to ignore , dismiss or simply deny the truth , but the reality is that Hamilton comes equipped with two major antidotes in his battle for a pardoned public image :
Religion .
Race .
Cringe , or even exit onto Naïve Lane if you want , but the reasons Hamilton skates are his white skin and his Jesus shield .
Sorry , but our mostly white media — yep , the finger is pointing at me — and mostly white fan base treat Hamilton more favorably than Howard .
But what if Josh Hamilton was black ?
And Josh Howard was white ?
For starters , Hamilton would be immediately portrayed by the media — Me ? Guilty as charged .— as a " thug " or a " crackhead punk " while Howard would be " misunderstood " or " outspoken . "
Howard would also , apparently , have his sins rinsed by religion .
From Robert Tilton to Quincy Carter we 've seen our share of religious hypocrisy .
Generally when athletes start quoting scripture we roll our eyes — something about the higher we praise Christians the bigger the bruises when they fall .
Hamilton 's latest pothole has invoked within me a blend of sympathy and cynicism .
But to most , not even a dash of disillusion .
Second chances may be color blind .
But we are n't .
Human beings tend to identify with people who look like them or share similar environments .
Does n't mean we 're all racists .
But we are all racial .
We 're easily manipulated by religion and readily influenced by color .
All things equal , we 'll side with our own .
Depending on where you live or what you read , there remains segregation in sports .
Around these parts , similarly temperamental black players are " volatile " and white players are " fiery . "
Right , Terrell Owens ?
As it is , Hamilton is the most beloved recovering crackhead on the planet .
He 's somehow the victim ; addiction the villain .
His story is so touching , so good , that we 're moved to treat his comeback from a self - inflicted mess as some noble triumph .
What , Marlon Byrd has never been tempted ?
In fact , I 've been criticized for referring to Hamilton as , among other things , a hypocrite .
Even though he 's a man who used to do A , promised to do B , but has again been caught doing A , Hamilton is somehow Teflon .
Even though hypocrite is his word , not mine .
From a July 2008 story in The New York Times : " If I did n't ( stay clean and sober ) , " Hamilton said , " I 'd be the biggest hypocrite in the world . "
Apparently Hamilton also forgot the evangelical virtues about being honest and forthcoming .
From his August 8 press conference in Anaheim in response to the incriminating photos that would work seamlessly in credits for The Hangover : " I do n't feel like I 'm a hypocrite .
I feel like I 'm human . "
At that point , is n't it hypocritical to deny being a hypocrite ?
If Hamilton was black , I fear the focus would n't have so quickly and smoothly shifted back onto baseball .
The player who takes part in I Am Second commercials but one night decided to bat himself first was n't booed in Anaheim , Cleveland or Arlington , but was coddled and cuddled as an imperfect , try - hard addict .
Which is great news for the Rangers , because after Hamilton 's better - late - than - never apology , he finally started hitting .
( Ironic that for Texas to sustain its playoff push they need an on - field relapse from Hamilton to his early ' 08 form . )
A black Hamilton 's hiccup would 've still been news , because when a team in the thick of a playoff chase has its best player admit to a night in which he got drunk , blacked out and put himself in jeopardy of getting suspended or even killed , well , that 's big news .
But the media would n't have let this one dissolve in the glass of warm water known as God , forgiveness and " nobody 's perfect . "
If Hamilton was neither Caucasian nor Christian , questions would be asked .
Legit questions , like ...
Where did he go and how did he eventually get " home " after leaving the bar ?
Are we supposed to believe that the three women , after drinking with Hamilton and licking whipped cream off his naked chest and vice - versa , did n't accompany him out the door to ... wherever ?
In the months after the incident Hamilton continued selling his book and witnessing to groups and retelling his tale to the media about being sober since October 6 , 2005 .
Is n't not telling the truth , the whole truth and nothing but , tantamount to lying ?
If he supposedly was informed by Hamilton the day after the incident , why did personal chaperone Johnny Narron respond with skeptical disbelief when initially quizzed about the pictures ?
Hamilton claims to have blacked out .
Does it really make sense then for him to be apologizing for things he does n't exactly remember and are n't we , in essence , forgiving him for things that are impossible to acknowledge ?
What took so long for the eight photos to surface ?
Is there a photograph No. 9 ? Perhaps a No. 10 ?
To most , Josh I comes off honorable .
To some , Josh II will always be despicable .
Shame it 's so black and white .
The Telegraph 's feisty Ambrose Evans - Pritchard pours a gallon of ice cold water over your v-shaped dreams .
There 's no real growth , even with massive government stimulus , and oh yeah , there 's another credit crunch coming .
Whoever wins today 's elections in Germany will face the reckoning so deftly dodged before .
Kurzarbeit , that subsidises firms not to fire workers , is running out .
The cash - for - clunkers scheme ended this month .
It certainly " worked " .
Car sales were up 28 pc in August , but only by stealing from the future .
The Center for Automotive Research says sales will fall by a million next year : " It will be the largest downturn ever suffered by the German car industry . "
Fiat 's Sergio Marchionne warns of " disaster " for Italy unless Rome renews its car scrappage subsidies .
Chrysler too will see some " harsh reality " following the expiry of America 's scheme this month .
Some expect US car sales to slump 40 pc in September .

Exports rose 6.3 % from the previous quarter , the biggest gain since the second quarter of 2002
Japan has emerged from its worst recession since the end of the second world war , recording its first quarter of growth for more than a year amid a rise in exports .
Japan 's fledgling recovery saw gross domestic product ( GDP ) rise at an annualised rate of 3.7 % from April to June , and by 0.9 % from the previous three months , the cabinet office said .
Exports rose 6.3 % from three months earlier , the first increase since the start of 2008 and the biggest gain since the second quarter of 2002 .
The emergence of the world 's second - largest economy from recession follows last week 's news that Germany and France – the two biggest economies in the eurozone – returned to growth in the second quarter .
Freefalling global demand for the consumer durables on which Japan built its economic success – notably consumer electronics and cars – were to blame for dragging it into a recession from which few believed it would emerge so quickly .
The guarded optimism now surrounding Japan is shared elsewhere .
The US economy shrank at an annualised 1 % last quarter , its smallest contraction in a year , while the 0.1 % contraction seen in the eurozone was its best showing for more than a year .
China 's economy , helped by a vast $ 586bn ( £ 357 bn ) stimulus package , grew 7.9 % from a year earlier .
The figures appear to bear out prime minister Taro Aso 's assurance that Japan would be one of the first major economies to emerge from recession , although polls suggest they probably will not be enough to save his Liberal Democratic party from defeat in the general election in a fortnight 's time .
Though parts of his ¥ 25tn ( £ 160 bn ) stimulus package were derided – in particular the cash handouts to all residents – those , together with subsidies for fuel - efficient cars and green electrical appliances , have produced at least some short - term benefits .
Experts warned , however , that the recovery could quickly fizzle out without improvements in demand at home , where falling wages and job fears have hit household spending .
Unemployment is at a six - year high of 5.4 % and could rise to a record 5.8 % next year .
In addition , wages fell 1.7 % in the last quarter , while consumer spending , which accounts for 55 % of the economy , rose just 0.8 % from the previous three months .
Public investment , buoyed by the government stimulus , was up 8.1 % .
Private capital investment dropped 4.3 % from the previous quarter , while housing investment fell 9.5 % , the government said .
Hiroshi Watanabe , an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo , said : " When you look at the numbers , the contrast between external demand and internal demand is as clear as night and day .
With payments falling , it 's really hard to expect individual spending to hold up . "
Still , even modest , export - led growth offers respite after more than a year of contraction that included a record 13.1 % annualised drop in GDP in the last quarter of last year and an 11.7 % fall in the first quarter of this year .
Yoshimasa Hayashi , the economic and fiscal policy minister , warned of continued threats to sustained recovery .
" Production is still at a low level , and worries remain that employment conditions will worsen , " he said .
" So we must watch the downside risks . "
The Asia -Pacific region has surprised many analysts with the speed of its recovery .
China , South Korea , Indonesia , Singapore and Hong Kong reported growth in the three months to June .
However , it is so powerful that if the facts are wrong , pupils are more likely to believe them even if they are told otherwise by text books or teachers , they say .

Half a century ago , as I was struggling to articulate a social and political philosophy with which my inner voices could find approval , I discovered one of my earliest introductions to what has since come to be known as libertarian thought .
I had read – and enjoyed – classical philosophers John Locke , John Stuart Mill , the Stoics , and others who took seriously the plight of the individual at the hands of political systems .
Discovering the writings of H.L. Mencken during the early days of my inquiries introduced me to a number of contemporary critics of governmental behavior .
It was at this time that I read a book , titled Our Enemy , the State and written by Albert Jay Nock , that began the real transformation of my thinking .
I soon became less interested in the pursuit of abstract philosophic reasoning and increasingly focused on the realpolitik of political systems .
A major problem with political philosophies is that they involve the playing out of the abstract thoughts of their authors .
Are the differing visions of a " state of nature " as seen by Hobbes , Rousseau , or Locke grounded in empirical studies of the history of stateless societies , or are they only the projection of the life experiences , intuitive speculations , indoctrinations , the collective unconscious , and other internally generated influences upon the mind of the writer ?
As our understanding of the world is grounded in subjectivity , the same question needs to be asked of anyone engaged in speculative philosophy : is it possible to stand outside our own minds and comment upon the world free of the content of our own thinking ?
Our understanding of the world is grounded in subjectivity , and we are easily seduced into confusing the reality of political systems with our expectations as to how such systems ought to work .
Was Heisenberg right in telling us that the observer is an indispensable ingredient in what is being observed ?
Who was this observer I had just discovered ?
Albert Jay Nock began his career as an Episcopal priest , later turning to journalism .
At different times , he wrote for the magazines The Nation and Freeman , publications with different perspectives than their current versions .
A self - described Jeffersonian and Georgist , he was an articulate spokesman for classical liberalism and an advocate of free markets and private property who had a strong distrust of power .
He wrote at a time when the concept of " liberalism " was being intellectually and politically corrupted into its antithesis of the state - directed society ; and he was troubled by the detrimental effect such a transformation would have on both individuals and the culture when the resulting debasement of character and behavior became accepted as the norm .
Nock had an abiding interest in the epistemological question that asks how we know what we know and how changes in our thinking generate the outward modifications that occur in our world .
In his classic Memoirs of a Superfluous Man , he observed that
the most significant thing about [ a man ] is what he thinks ; and significant also is how he came to think it , why he continued to think it , or , if he did not continue , what the influences were which caused him to change his mind .
Albert Jay Nock was what in my youth would have been described as an exponent of a " liberal arts " education .
He understood not only that " ideas have consequences " – a proposition later expounded upon by Richard Weaver – but that organizations have a certain dynamic which , when mobilized , can generate unexpected consequences .
He acknowledged the pursuit of individual self - interest as a principal motivating factor , but he saw how corporate and political interests can combine to promote such interests , coercively , at the expense of others .
Nock 's intellectual development was greatly influenced by the works of the German economist and sociologist , Franz Oppenheimer .
Nock focused much of his attention on Oppenheimer 's analysis of the two principal means – expounded upon in Der Staat – by which human needs can be met .
Satisfying such needs through the exercise of " one 's own labor and the equivalent exchange of one 's own labor for the labor of others " Oppenheimer defined as " economic means . "
By contrast , pursuing such interests through " the unrequited appropriation of the labor of others " he termed " political means . "
Nock elaborates upon Oppenheimer 's thesis to describe how the state actually works .
Because people tend to act with " the least possible exertion " in pursuing their ends , they will tend to prefer the political to the economic means , a trait that has produced the modern corporate - state – or what Nock referred to as the " merchant - State . "
The efforts of earlier political philosophers to explain the origins of the state either as an expression of " divine will " or as the product of an alleged " social contract " begin to melt away when confronted by Nock 's realism .
He tells us that the state has its genesis not in some highly principled pursuit of a " common will " to resist some imagined perverse human nature , but in nothing more elevated than " conquest and confiscation . "
He echoes Voltaire 's observation that " the art of government consists in taking as much money as possible from one class of the citizens to give to the other . "
The Watergate - era mantra " follow the money " reverberates this more - prosaic theme .
Those who chide critics of the state as being " idealistic " or " utopian " must , themselves , answer for their visionary faith that state power could be made to restrain itself .
As Nock understood , and as more recent history confirms , it is those who believe that written constitutions can protect the individual from the exercise of state power who hold to a baseless idealism , particularly when it is the state 's judicial powers of interpretation that define the range of such powers .
Words are abstractions that never correlate with what they purport to describe and must , therefore , be interpreted .
Supreme Court decisions continue to affirm Nock 's realistic assessment that " anything may be made to mean anything . "
The 20th century alone provided thinkers such as Nock with a perspective that allowed them to see how their earlier speculations about the nature of the state actually played out .
The post -9/11 years have seen a wholesale retreat by the American government from the illusion of limited government , with constitutional prescriptions for and proscriptions against state power widely ignored .
Anthony de Jasay has added his critique of the imaginary nature of limited government by observing that " collective choice is never independent of what significant numbers of individuals wish it to be . "
Has history shown that political systems and the citizenry retain the sense of mutuality that is implicit in the " contract " theory that supposedly underlies the modern state ?
Does the avowed purpose of political systems to protect the lives , liberty , and property interests of individuals remain intact ?
The modern state increasingly manifests itself as the ill it was the purpose of centuries - old philosophies to identify , and of constitutional systems to prevent .
This raises the question whether the very existence of the state , with its self - interested exercise of a monopoly on the use of force , could portend other than the continuing cycles of wars , repression , economic dislocations , and other forms of collective conflict and disorder .
Will today 's young minds , desirous of understanding the reality rather than just a theory of politics grounded in hope , be able to resist a shift in thinking such as is offered by Nock and others who offer explanations for statism grounded in principled pragmatism ?
Such a question brings us to a consideration of Nock 's purposes in writing .
He had no interest in political reforms , seeing such efforts as superficial in nature .
Neither was he motivated by a desire to educate mass - minded men and women , as such people lacked both the depth of character and the intellectual capacity to understand the principles underlying " the humane life . "
He saw his task , rather , as being to care for those he called " the Remnant , " those independent men and women whose intellectual and emotional inquisitiveness provide them a profound understanding of such principles .
Unlike mass - minded persons who are easily manipulated and mobilized in service to various institutional causes , the Remnant remain skeptical of proselytizers who seek converts to ideologies , or who desire to save mankind .
Trying to find members of the Remnant will be futile , Nock tells us , for it is they who will seek out like - minded spirits .
Nock sees his role as providing the support and nurturing to such individuals who will , once the civilization has collapsed , be the ones to " build up a new society " on the basis of their understanding of the " august order of nature . "
For such people alone , Nock tells us , was this book written .
Our Enemy , the State was first published in 1935 , when the economic consequences of the New Deal were beginning to be felt .
In 1943 , Nock spoke of writing a second edition , to elaborate on these economic effects .
In the summer of 1945 , however , Nock died without accomplishing this task .
Nonetheless , as his friend Frank Chodorov commented in his preface to this work , " Our Enemy , the State needs no support , " and stands as a sufficient indictment of political systems .
" We have been told we can not do this by a chorus of cynics .
It will only grow louder .
We ’ve been asked to pause for a reality check .
We ’ve been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope .
But in the unlikely story of America , there ’s never been anything false about hope . " -- Barack Obama

The general 's report carries a direct call for extra troops
The US mission in Afghanistan will " likely result in failure " unless troops are increased within a year , the top general there has said in a report .
Gen Stanley McChrystal made his assessment in a confidential report obtained by the Washington Post .
He recently called for a revised military strategy in Afghanistan , suggesting the current one is failing .
More than 30,000 extra US troops have been sent to Afghanistan since May - almost doubling the US contingent .
The number of US troops in Afghanistan is already set to rise to 68,000 by the end of the year .
ANALYSIS Paul Reynolds , BBC world affairs correspondent
Gen McChrystal has dared to use the F - word - " failure " .
He wants a super - surge of troops to try to avoid that .
Reinforcements are already being sent , almost doubling US troops by the end of this year .
Now , the general wants perhaps tens of thousands more .
Yet the request is in contrast to the stated goal of handing over operations more and more to the Afghan army .
With the situation so critical , how can that happen ?
Answer - it cannot for the time being .
And will President Obama agree ?
He is reluctant just to add to the numbers but without numbers , how can the US and its allies win ?
And will the Nato allies give more help ?
This must be doubtful .
Stark concerns have previously been expressed about the viability of the military mission in Afghanistan , but the BBC's Paul Reynolds says what is new about the general 's warning is his outright use of the word " failure " .
Gen McChrystal , who took over as military commander in May , is expected to make a separate request for tens of thousands of extra forces to be deployed .
He also says that training for Afghan forces needs to be speeded up - and that the growth of Afghan forces should also be accelerated .
A senior adviser to Afghan President Hamid Karzai said the government was not against more international troops being sent , though their success would depend on where they were sent .
But he agreed that domestic forces were crucial to the operation .
" Our official stance is that until our security forces are strengthened , both in terms of numbers and quality , there wo n't be a long - lasting peace in Afghanistan , " Sebghatullah Sanjar told the BBC .
US President Barack Obama has recently said the right strategy for Afghanistan will have to be found before any fresh commitment of forces can be considered .
' Mission failure '
MARDELL'S AMERICA [ Obama ] will find it tough to sell the general 's policy to a party and public reluctant to see more men and women sent to bolster an Afghan government accused of election fraud

In his latest assessment , Gen McChrystal is quoted by the Washington Post newspaper as saying : " Failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near - term [ next 12 months ] ... risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible . "
He warns that " inadequate resources will likely result in failure " .
" Additional resources are required , " the general states in the summary of the report .
He says that failure to provide adequate resources " risks a longer conflict , greater casualties , higher overall costs , and ultimately , a critical loss of political support " .
" Any of these risks , in turn , are likely to result in mission failure . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
It can be a success if all parties develop a backbone coupled with a clearly defined goal Rich P , Milwaukee , Wisconsin
But Gen McChrystal adds that the increase in troop numbers must come in the context of a revised military strategy in the country .
He has consistently called for a strategy which makes its top priority the protection of the Afghan people .
In the report Gen McChrystal also :
Provides new details about the sophisticated nature of the Taliban insurgency
Criticises Nato forces for focusing more on tackling insurgents than protecting Afghan civilians
Censures the Afghan government for lack of action on widespread corruption
Warns that Afghanistan 's prisons have become a sanctuary for active insurgents
All of these factors , he claims , have led to a " crisis of confidence among Afghans " in the face of a resilient insurgency .
MCCHRYSTAL'S NEW STRATEGY
Focus on protecting civilians when fighting insurgents Interact more closely with local populations
More troops needed for effective counter - insurgency Better training for Afghan forces to operate independently Government and NGOs to provide services after military action More constructive engagement with Taliban fighters willing to talk
McChrystal 's blunt warning Profile : Gen Stanley McChrystal Afghanistan : Security map
The increase in troop numbers would provide security for the Afghan people and create a space in which good governance can take root , Gen McChrystal argues .
In a blunt evaluation , he says that both the Afghan government and international forces face losing credibility among the Afghan population .
" Pre-occupied with protection of our own forces , we have operated in a manner that distances us - physically and psychologically - from the people we seek to protect , " he says .
But 2009 has been the deadliest year for foreign troops in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 .
Italy is holding a day of mourning for six soldiers killed in a Kabul bomb attack last week .
And the future of German troops in Afghanistan has become a central issue in Germany 's election campaign .
The Washington Post says that the report has been presented to US Defence Secretary Robert Gates .
A recent opinion poll showed that a narrow majority of Americans now oppose the conflict .
Last week the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm Mike Mullen , told the US Senate Armed Services Committee that more troops might be required to tackle the mounting Taliban insurgency .
But President Obama later said there was " no immediate decision pending " on sending more troops to Afghanistan .
" You have to get the strategy right and then make the determination about resources , " Mr Obama said .
The BBC 's security correspondent Nick Childs says the timing of this leak , and the stark language contained in it , is certain to pile the pressure on the Obama administration , particularly when the president has just said he is not ready to make a final decision .
This is largely because the issue has become so politically charged in Washington , our correspondent says .
US MEDIA REACTION TO MCCHRYSTAL REPORT
Spencer Ackerman , at the Washington Independent , points out that the president 's recent statements have been made with full knowledge of Gen McChrystal 's recommendations .
The National Review's Rich Lowry welcomes Gen McChrystal 's contribution .
Foreign Policy 's Peter Feaver suspects the leak come from inside the White House , not from Gen McChrystal 's team .
Commentary 's Jennifer Rubin fears that any delay in implementing Gen McChrystal 's proposals could damage the US mission in Afghanistan .
Robert Dreyfuss , of the Nation , counsels Mr Obama to ignore Jennifer Rubin and her conservative colleagues .
Kevin Drum , blogging at Mother Jones , advises liberals to approach Gen McChrystal 's proposals with an open mind .
It started in France but now the trend seems to be spilling across the English Channel .
European readers engrossed in Stephenie Meyer 's " Twilight " teen vampire series are reaching for Emily Brontë classic " Wuthering Heights " as well .
According to the Guardian , " A new edition of [ " Wuthering Heights " ] , repackaged in a similar style to Meyer 's Twilight books – black cover , white flower , tagline ' love never dies ' – was released in May this year , and has already sold more than 10,000 copies in the UK , nearly twice as many as the traditional Penguin Classic edition , making it [ British bookseller ]
Waterstone 's bestselling classic . "
In the third book of the " Twilight " series , heroine and hero Bella and Edward both cite " Wuthering Heights " as their favorite novel because of the novel 's focus on an all - consuming love .
In France , ( where the book is titled " Les Hauts de Hurlevent " ) , " Twilight " served as an introduction to the Brontë novel , which is not taught in French schools .
Last March , a spokesperson for the publisher of the French translation of " Wuthering Heights " told the Times Online that , " We have sold as many copies of ‘ Wuthering Heights ’ in the first two months of 2009 as we usually sell in a whole year , " at least partly due to the release of the film version of " Twilight " in France last January .
This does n't necessarily mean , however , that that these newly interested European readers of " Wuthering Heights " ( many of whom are teens ) will now become Brontë fans .
The Guardian notes some negative comments on the book on the Waterstone website .
One reader wrote , " I was really disappointed when reading this book , it 's made to believe to be one of the greatest love stories ever told and I found only five pages out of the whole book about there love and the rest filled with bitterness and pain and other peoples stories , " while another asked if the book was " in old english or mordern understandable english [ sic ] ? "
If nothing else , however , the phenomenon is unique .
" I do n't think a vampire 's recommendation has ever sent a book to number one before , " Waterstone 's classics buyer Simon Robertson told the Guardian .
A man who said his car was struck by bullets during an attack outside a Las Vegas skating rink Sunday night told a newspaper that boxer Floyd Mayweather personally threatened him less than an hour beforehand .
Las Vegas police have said they do not consider Mayweather a suspect in the incident after searching one of his luxury automobiles Monday .
The Las Vegas Review - Journal quotes 24 - year - old Quincey Williams as saying Mayweather confronted him at the skating rink .
Williams told the newspaper Mayweather was angry over a text message he sent the Grand Rapids native about two months ago , in which he wrote that he hopes the boxer loses a Sept. 19 comeback bout to Juan Manuel Marquez .
Williams said he took Mayweather 's threats to mean the boxer has " enough money to get me hit . "
Williams said his BMW was the vehicle later struck by several gunshots outside Crystal Palace Skating Center .
No one was injured in the incident .
A Las Vegas Metro Police Department spokesman previously confirmed that a BMW was the make of the car struck by the gunshots and that Williams is one of two victims listed on the incident report .
Mayweather 's Rolls - Royce was seen leaving the skating rink after the shots were fired , just after 10 p.m. Sunday , witnesses said .
Police executed a search warrant of Mayweather 's car Monday at his residence .
They described the boxer as cooperative .
Police said two men were considered suspects in the incident , including a man who goes by the nickname " O.C. " and is an associate of Mayweather Promotions .
The victim's car was shot as it exited the skating rink parking lot , police said .
Williams said he did not see who shot at him but told the newspaper he was dismayed that police did not arrest Mayweather and believes the boxer knows who committed the crime .
" Floyd knows who he is .
He works for Floyd , " said Williams , who claimed he has known Mayweather for about a decade .

Taboo , Fergie , will .i.am and Apl.de.ap of the Black Eyed Peas perform during the 43rd Montreux Jazz Festival July 6 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Denis Balibouse
KUALA LUMPUR ( Reuters ) - Muslims in Malaysia have been barred from attending a concert by U.S. hip hop band the Black Eyed Peas sponsored by Guinness which is owned by the world ’s biggest spirits group Diageo .
The move comes after a Malaysian Islamic court sentenced a 32 - year Muslim woman to be caned after she was caught drinking beer in a hotel and at a time when an opposition Islamic party has moved against beer sales .
The concert , part of celebrations of Guinness 250th birthday , asks on its website ( www.arthursday.com.my)
" Are you a non-Muslim aged 18 years and above ? " and if the response is no , access is not allowed .
Muslims account for 55 percent of the 27 million people in this Southeast Asian country and are barred from consuming alcohol although the rules are regularly flouted , especially in big cities like the capital , Kuala Lumpur .
Malaysia ’s Guinness Anchor which sells Guinness and other brands here had sales of 1.2 billion Malaysian ringgit ( $ 340.6 million ) in 2008 .
Even without alcohol , foreign bands are subject to scrutiny .
Earlier this week , the Pan Malaysian Islamic Party ( PAS ) said it wanted Danish band Michael Learns to Rock banned from performing as it would cause immorality .
Since 2007 , PAS , the country ’s second largest political group measured by party membership , has campaigned against performances by the likes of Beyonce , Rihanna , Gwen Stefani and Avril Lavigne .

The family of 16 - year - old sailor Jessica Watson says she is still determined to become the youngest person to sail solo around the world , despite hitting a bulk carrier after less than 24 hours at sea .
Ms Watson 's damaged yacht limped into harbour on the Gold Coast at about midday after the collision with a merchant ship east of Queensland 's Stradbroke Island in the small hours of this morning .
The 34 - foot Pink Lady was escorted through the Southport Seaway by Water Police and marine rescue boats and will now undergo repairs after the collision snapped its mast and damaged the deck .
Ms Watson was spending her first night at sea en route from Mooloolaba to Sydney , where she planned to officially start her round - the - world quest , when the collision happened .
Watson family spokesman Scott Young says the accident will not stop her attempt at a world record .
" I do n't think anyone in their right mind would be brave enough to stop Jessica making this journey , " he said .
" It 's been something she 's been focused on for many years .
Those that believe that this is something that she 's dreamt up overnight do n't know Jessica or the family . "
A statement on Ms Watson 's website reads : " Early this morning Jessica Watson had an incident at sea whilst in transit from Mooloolaba to Sydney .
" Her 34 - foot yacht , Ella 's Pink Lady , came together with a 225 - metre cargo ship .
" Ella 's Pink Lady is currently under motor to a south east Queensland port .
Jessica is fine and remains as committed as ever to commence her voyage as soon as her yacht can be repaired . "
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority ( AMSA ) is investigating allegations that the merchant ship did not stop after the collision .
Solo yachtsman and Clean Up Australia founder Ian Kiernan says Ms Watson is a " plucky young Australian " who is obviously well prepared and has survived " an incredibly threatening situation " .
Mr Kiernan says he hopes the accident wo n't be enough to deter Jessica from her adventure , but in these cases it is really up to the sailor to get out of the way .
" Evasive action is the way that I think you should go , because you 're the pea against the sledge hammer , " he said .
" Those bulk carriers - the line of sight from the bridge , they probably can't see anything in front of the bow of the ship for perhaps 50 or 100 metres .
" She has handled a very difficult situation - to be dismasted with a full crew is bad enough but to dismasted on your own is - fortunately I 've never been dismasted when I 've been on my own - but it would be an incredibly threatening situation . "
An AMSA spokesman says it is still unclear who was at fault in the accident .
Danish - American actor Viggo Mortensen was working the Toronto International Film Festival today , doing press for a movie .
He also wrote a very strong blog entry explaining why he had signed a statement protesting the festival .
[ The statement objects ] to the festival singling out Tel Aviv ( which was merged with Jaffa to form a single municipality in 1950 ) for special recognition when the government of Israel continues to flout international law , essentially acting unilaterally as a rogue state in very much the same manner that the U.S. government did under George W. Bush …
I signed the statement in question , along with people like Noam Chomsky , Howard Zinn , Naomi Klein , and many other thoughtful citizens from various countries ( including a number of Israelis ) some of whom have suffered from very real censorship and blacklisting .
The statement does not promote the boycotting or censorship of any artist or movie from Israel or anywhere else .
Those who have attacked the statement with that accusation are simply spreading misinformation and , unfortunately , continuing the ongoing successful distraction from the issue at hand : the Israeli government ’s whitewashing of their illegal and inhumane actions inside and outside their legal national borders .
There was nobody outside the cinema objecting to anyone going to see " Ajami " .
In fact , there was nobody doing anything other than going to see this and other movies being shown at the Scotiabank complex , or just walking on down Toronto ’s Richmond Street
Why Are n't Government Employees Worse ?
By Bryan Caplan
I first read Murray Rothbard when I was seventeen years old , and suddenly my whole high school made sense .
Lazy teachers , guys with college degrees teaching gym , required drama classes , and lies , lies , lies everywhere .
Mr. Libertarian had a compelling explanation :
On the free market , in short , the consumer is king , and any business firm that wants to make profits and avoid losses tries its best to serve the consumer as efficiently and at as low a cost as possible .
In a government operation , in contrast , everything changes .
Inherent in all government operation is a grave and fatal split between service and payment , between the providing of a service and the payment for receiving it .
The government bureau does not get its income as does the private firm , from serving the consumer well or from consumer purchases of its products exceeding its costs of operation .
No , the government bureau acquires its income from mulcting the long - suffering taxpayer .
Its operations therefore become inefficient , and costs zoom , since government bureaus need not worry about losses or bankruptcy ; they can make up their losses by additional extractions from the public till .
Furthermore , the consumer , instead of being courted and wooed for his favor , becomes a mere annoyance to the government someone who is “ wasting ” the government ’s scarce resources .
In government operations , the consumer is treated like an unwelcome intruder , an interference in the quiet enjoyment by the bureaucrat of his steady income .
In the two decades since I read those words , I ’ve seen them confirmed again and again .
And yet …
I ’ve also noticed counter - examples – government employees who actually try to do a good job .
Indeed , I am a counter - example .
There ’s no financial reason for me to prepare written lecture notes for all of my classes .
Yet prepare them I do .
What ’s going on ?
Hypothesis # 1 : Government employees ’ financial rewards for performance are better than Rothbard described .
Evaluation :
There are clearly some grunt - level government jobs where you ’ll get fired if you do n’t perform .
A municipal garbageman who gets high instead of picking up the trash may get more chances than a privately - employed garbageman , but he ’s still on a pretty short leash .
But ( a ) most government jobs are n’t like this , and ( b ) the grunts only need to worry about good performance if their supervisors do – and their supervisors have pretty weak incentives to do so .
Hypothesis # 2 : Elected politicians at the top of the pyramid send good incentives all the way down to the base because they ’re worried about re-election .
Evaluation :
While voters could give elected officials reasons to behave in this way , they almost never do .
Hypothesis # 3 : Government employees self - select for dedication and / or caring .
Evaluation : I ’m ideologically tempted to guffaw , but this is definitely important in some government enterprises .
Not at the Social Security Office or the DMV , that ’s for sure .
But I ’ve often seen this in education .
In pleasant suburban elementary schools , for example , teachers are more likely to be hyper than lazy .
And at risk of sounding self - serving , when I put extra effort into my lectures , it ’s primarily because I care about economic education .
The key complication : Figuring out when this self - selection mechanism works .
In my high school , perhaps a third of the teachers took pride in their work .
The rest seemed to just be punching the clock .
Were they always that way ?
Or did time just wear them down ?
I still do n’t know .
Hypothesis # 4 : Government employees want to look good in front of their co-workers .
This is more of a complement for # 3 than a substitute .
But again , it ’s plausible .
I do n’t want to become deadwood ; but if I did , the shame I would feel before my colleagues would deter me .
Even at the Post Office , I ’ve seen employees show off their superior postal skills in front of their co-workers .
It seemed to make them feel good about themselves .
Once again , there ’s a key complication :
When does doing a good job lead to the admiration of your peers ?
And when does it lead to derision for being a sap ?
There are clearly multiple equilibria : Police departments where your peers despise you for taking bribes , and others where they despise you for not taking bribes – or worse yet , “ ratting ” on an officer who does .
Finally , it ’s worth pointing out that the goodness of dedication / caring depends on the goodness of the task being performed .
It ’s far better for Communist secret policemen to be lazy and corrupt than zealous and pure – and the same goes government employees who enforce U.S. immigration laws .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - The Arctic ’s sea ice pack thawed to its third - lowest summer level on record , up slightly from the seasonal melt of the past two years but continuing an overall decline symptomatic of climate change , U.S. scientists said on Thursday .

The range of ocean remaining frozen over the northern polar region reached its minimum extent for 2009 on September 12 , when it covered 1.97 million square miles ( 5.1 million square km ) , and now appears to be growing again as the Arctic starts its annual cool - down , the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported .
That level falls 20 percent below the 30 - year average minimum ice cover for the Arctic summer since satellites began measuring it in 1979 , and 24 percent less than the 1979 - 2000 average , the Colorado - based government agency said .
This summer ’s minimum represents a loss about about two - thirds of the sea ice measured at the height of Arctic winter in March .
By comparison , the Arctic ice shelf typically shrank by a little more than half each summer during the 1980s and 1990s , ice scientist Walt Meier said .
The lowest point on record was reached in September 2007 , and the 2009 minimum ranks as the third smallest behind last year ’s level .
But scientists said they do not consider the slight upward fluctuation again this summer to be a recovery .
The difference was attributed to relatively cooler temperatures this summer compared with the two previous years .
Winds also tended to disperse the ice pack over a larger region , scientists said .
“ The long - term decline in summer extent is expected to continue in future years , ” the report said .
The U.S. government findings were in line with measurements reported separately by the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Norway , which reported this summer ’s minimum ice extent at just under 5 million square km ( 1.93 million square miles ) .
Scientists regard the Arctic and its sea ice as among the most sensitive barometers of global warming because even small temperature changes make a huge difference .
“ If you go from a degree below freezing to 2 degrees above freezing , that ’s a completely different environment in the polar region , ” Meier said .
“ You ’re going from ice skating to swimming .
Whereas if you ’re on a tropical beach and it ’s 3 degrees warmer , you probably would n’t even notice it . ”
World leaders will meet at the United Nations in New York on Tuesday to discuss a climate treaty due to be agreed on in December .
MARITIME IMPLICATIONS
The shrinking polar cap poses a loss of crucial habitat for polar bears and has implications for maritime shipping , opening up new routes to navigation .
Once again this year , the Northern Sea Route through the Arctic Ocean along the coast of Siberia opened , enabling two German ships to navigate the passage with Russian icebreaker escorts .
Russian vessels have traversed the passage many times over the years , but the maritime fleets of other nations are showing more interest in the route as the summer thaw expands .
This year , the Amundsen ’s Channel through the Northwest Passage also opened briefly , as it did in 2008 , but the deeper Parry ’s Channel did not .
Both opened in 2007 .
Scientists have voiced concern for years about the alarming decline in the size of the Arctic ice cap , which functions as a giant air conditioner for the planet ’s climate system as it reflects sunlight back into space .
As a greater portion of the ice melts , larger expanses of darker sea water are exposed , absorbing more sunlight and adding to the global warming effect attributed to rising levels of heat - trapping greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere by human activity .
Scientists also have measured a thinning of the frozen seas , as older , thicker ice more resilient to warming temperatures gives way to younger , thinner layers that melt more easily in summer .
Scientists monitor Antarctic sea ice as well , but the Arctic is considered a more critical gauge of climate change because more of the northern sea ice remains frozen through the summer , playing a bigger role in cooling the planet .

A bush squirrel collected 500 m from the fatal incident A squirrel has been seen attempting to savage a fruit bat to death .
The bizarre incident was witnessed by zoologist Mr William Stanley , while he was conducting fieldwork in the forests of Tanzania .
" No - one has recorded this type of behaviour or incident before , " says Mr Stanley , who saw the squirrel try to kill the bat in a tree above his head .
Squirrels are not known to eat meat or hunt animals , so it is unclear why this squirrel would launch such an attack .
Mr Stanley , who works at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago , US has published details of the incident in the African Journal of Ecology .
This is pure speculation , but it 's almost as if the squirrel was seeking to maim the bat in some way .
Maim it or kill it such that it could n't fly
Zoologist William Stanley
For the past 20 years , he has studied small mammals in Tanzania , focusing on shrews , bats and rodents , usually conducting field work during July and August .
During one afternoon survey in the Mwofwomero Forest , in the Rubeho Mountains , he heard a fruit bat shrieking .
" It was strange to hear an alarm call or vocalisation from a fruit bat typically we hear at night , " he told BBC Earth News .
" That 's what caught my attention .
When I looked up I realised that there was a squirrel up in the branches where the noise was coming from .
The next thing I saw was the flapping of the bat 's wings . "
Mortal wounds Mr Stanley then describes how the events unfolded .
" It became apparent that there was an altercation happening between the squirrel and the bat , something I 'd never seen before or ever heard of . "
" The squirrel had the bat in its mouth , or it was at least biting it , and then the bat went quiet for a while and then starting flapping its wings again . "
The fruit bat 's mortal wounds " The second time it started vocalising and flapping , the squirrel released it and the bat fell out of the tree and literally fell into these small saplings right above my head , and ultimately to my feet . "
Mr Stanley recovered the now dead bat , a species known as Epomophorus wahlbergi , and photographed it .
" Both wings were broken at pretty much the same place on the same side and the side of the head was fractured , " he explains .
Why the squirrel would want to kill the bat is a mystery .
Mr Stanley and his colleagues identified the squirrel as a Svynnerton 's bush squirrel ( Paraxerus vexillarius ) , which at a weight of around 280g is three times heavier than the 89g bat .
Like most other rodents , Svynnerton 's bush squirrels eat vegetable matter , fruits , nuts and small insects .
No squirrels are known to hunt vertebrates , or even scavenge meat .
" The least likely hypothesis is that the squirrel was preparing to eat the bat , " says Mr Stanley .
" The bat was injured and damaged in very specific places .
This is pure speculation , but it 's almost as if the squirrel was seeking to maim the bat in some way .
Maim it or kill it such that it could n't fly . "
A baboon feasts on a bird " Either the squirrel thought the bat was a threat to it , or to its young if they were around , or to a food source .
Maybe the squirrel was going after some fruit and the bat was hanging there and the squirrel wanted to get rid of some competition . "
" Another possibility is that either the squirrel or the bat were mentally off balance . "
" I do n't think this is normal , " he adds , suggesting that injury or disease could also have prompted the bizarre interaction .
Baboon 's taste for bat
In the African Journal of Ecology research paper , Mr Stanley and colleague Ms Leah Collett , who works at the Animal Behaviour Research Unit based in Mikumi , Tanzania , describe another rare incidence of bat predation .
Conducting field work in the Mikumi National Park , Ms Collett witnessed a yellow baboon eating another fruit bat of the same genus ( Epomophorus minor ) .
While baboons are known to eat reptiles , birds and some mammals such as hares , they have never before been recorded eating bats .
" What was really intriguing about this , which may be pure coincidence or not , is that both the bat and the baboon that ate it were pregnant , " says Mr Stanley .
" We found a very developed foetus from the bat , and the baboon gave birth five days after the event was witnessed .
Whether there was a connection or not we can't say . "

This is especially apparent on the Lower East Side , which has a high number of banks compared with some parts of the Bronx and Queens .
When the Lower East Side People ’s Federal Credit Union received its charter to open in 1986 , it replaced the only bank branch within a 100 - block area .
Now ,
Pew data show that while the neighborhood has one of the borough ’s highest concentration of non-banking households , nearly every major bank has opened a branch there .

Dozens of groups and neighborhood bankers know firsthand how hard it can be to get New Yorkers to trust banks .
The New York Urban League , which has worked for five years on a program it calls “ financial connections , ” found that it had trouble drawing participants when it was marketed as banking education .
Repositioned it as a money - management training program , it had more of an eager audience .
Workers at Amalgamated Bank , which opened a branch in an underserved section of Long Island City two years ago , continue to answer questions from potential customers who came from countries where friends and relatives lost their fortunes to collapsed or corrupt banks .
“ There is n’t that trust that Americans are accustomed to having , ” said Peter Mosbacher , the bank ’s senior vice president of community development .
“ We are having that challenge to get people to understand that the American banking system is stable . ”
Nearly two years ago , the city ’s Department of Consumer Affairs started offering accounts without overdraft fees that have drawn 1,700 low - income families into the banking system , the department said .
An additional 1,207 New Yorkers had signed up for the agency ’s $ aveNYC Account Program , a program that provides savings accounts that is active only during the tax season .
With a big hurdle still ahead , some politicians , government agencies and banks are turning to Bank On , a program that has been adopted in 60 cities nationwide .
The Manhattan borough president , Scott M. Stringer , organized a forum for 71 executives from large and small banks , community leaders and politicians at the Federal Reserve last month to begin the program in New York City .
While Mr. Stringer agreed that the task will be especially difficult , with financial institutions having lost so much credibility in recent months , he argued that it may be easier to persuade hard - pressed banks looking for customers to reach out to these New Yorkers now .
“ Sometimes when times are most difficult , banks realize they have to expand their customers , ” he said .

Beamed Energy Propulsion ( BEP ) is far more than a dream or idea :
It is a powerful enabling technology that will radically transform the future of air and space transportation .
It is physics , not imagination .
BEP permits us to build and fly hyper - energetic vehicles driven by remote sources of laser , microwave , and mm - wave power .
Such vehicles provide unique performance that would be impossible to achieve with traditional , combustion - based engines .
Vehicles driven by BEP will be " greener , " safer , smaller , lighter , faster , and far more efficient than any currently existing means of flight transport .
Beamed Energy Propulsion , detailed in our book " The Lightcraft Flight Handbook : LTI - 20 , " is inherently a clean technology .
It uses electricity , which can be produced in an eco-friendly manner .
It does n't matter whether the electricity comes from Earth - based or space - based solar , wind , fission , fusion , hydroelectric ( or other ) , so we can choose how to produce it — and we can choose from the start to produce it in an ecologically responsible way .
We see here the emergence of nothing less than a sustainable energy infrastructure , one that permits us to relegate our crude oil to use as a chemical feedstock , a resource far too precious to burn .
Throughout the history of human transportation , two things have acted as the practical constraints on how fast , far , and high we can go : the power density of our engines and the energy density of our fuels .
And what if we leave the " fuel " behind altogether — and exploit beamed energy propulsion instead ?
What if we could have the total output of an aircraft 's or spaceship 's powerplant devoted to lifting the payload and structural shell that supports the engines and payload ?
Such a system would represent the next major breakthrough in aerospace propulsion , first enabling affordable access to space for launching constellations of nanosatellites , and finally transform humans from Earthlings into space - farers .
We could not only lift 100 times as much payload with a given amount of energy — we could do so with cheap electric energy .
By leaving the fuel behind , we also can make spaceflight much safer .
Cheap access to space is nothing short of revolutionary .
Just as internal combustion , electricity , telephones , computers , the internet , and aviation have dramatically changed our lives , so will our lives be changed again by our gaining cheap access to nearby space .
We will tap the vast energy resources of the sun and material resources of the nearby asteroids while expanding human civilization into this unbounded new environment .
We will enter a new era for humanity , a new Age of Sustainable Flight Mobility .
Is beamed energy propulsion some futuristic pipe dream ??
Interestingly , laser - powered lightcraft have already flown in miniature form .
In a series of experiments nearly a decade ago , saucer - sized lightcraft were successfully launched using a military laser ( one non-optimized for propulsion ) at White Sands Missile Range , New Mexico to 71 meters altitude .
That altitude record still stands .
In one generation , the science and technology needed to build and fly full - size Lightcraft has been developed to maturity , ripe for commercialization .
All that 's needed now is to actually build them .
The problem has evolved from a scientific one to an engineering one — simply a matter of will .
The sky is no longer the limit .

Plusieurs artistes , politiciens et acteurs de premier plan du mouvement souverainiste rendent hommage à Pierre Falardeau , cinéaste et polémiste décédé à l'âge de 62 ans .
Le cinéaste et écrivain Pierre Falardeau est décédé vendredi soir à l'âge de 62 ans à l'Hôpital Notre - Dame , à Montréal .
Il combattait un cancer depuis quelques mois .
Il laisse dans le deuil sa conjointe et ses trois enfants .
Pierre Falardeau était connu pour ses prises de position en faveur de l'indépendance du Québec , un thème qui a marqué une bonne partie de son oeuvre et de sa vie .
Après des études en anthropologie et en ethnologie à l'Université de Montréal , Pierre Falardeau a tourné des documentaires puis des films de fiction .
Nommé Patriote de l'année en 2002 , il remporté en 1995 le Prix Ouimet - Molson pour son film Octobre , un prix qu'il accepte alors qu'il a toujours critiqué la famille Molson .
En juin 2009 , il reçoit le Prix Pierre - Bourgault du Mouvement souverainiste du Québec .
Il a réalisé son premier court métrage , Continuons le combat , en 1971 , un film qui dresse un parallèle entre la lutte sportive et l'identité politique des Québécois .
Le film qui le fera connaître comme cinéaste engagé est Pea Soup , sorti en 1978 .
Le film est le fruit de six ans de travail , sans aide de l'Office national du film et sans rémunération .
Il s'agit d'un documentaire qui tente de démontrer l'aliénation des Québécois face au pouvoir économique .
Le film a été tourné dans des usines et donne la parole aux ouvriers .
Il réalise en 1981 la première des aventures comiques d'Elvis Gratton , un fédéraliste grossier et caricatural joué par son bon ami le comédien Julien Poulin .
Ses films les plus connus sont 15 février 1839 , Octobre , Le steak , Le Party , et Le temps des bouffons .
Il a aussi publié plusieurs livres , dont La liberté n'est pas une marque de yogourt en 1995 , Les boeufs sont lents , mais la terre est patiente en 1999 , et Il n'y a rien de plus précieux que la liberté et l'indépendance , sorti cette année .
Acteurs et politiciens rendent hommage
Agrandir l’image ﻿ ( Nouvelle fenêtre ) ﻿ ﻿ Luc Picard et Pierre Falardeau , lors du tournage de 15 février 1839 .
L'acteur Luc Picard , qui interprétait Chevalier de Lorimier dans 15 février 1839 de Pierre Falardeau et joua aussi dans Octobre , le décrit comme un « amoureux de la vie » , un « être d'une profonde humanité » .
Denis Trudel , qui interprétait tout comme Luc Picard un des protagonistes de la crise d'Octobre , a reçu comme un choc la nouvelle de sa mort .
« Falardeau , pour moi , c'était la rencontre marquante de ma vie d'acteur , parce que c'était un exemple d'intégrité comme il n'en existe pas , en fait , dans le métier .
C'est un gars chez qui il n'y a pas de différence entre ce qu'il dit dans la vie et ce qu'il dit dans ses films , dans ses livres » , affirme M. Trudel .
Interrogé à RDI , l'ancien premier ministre du Québec Bernard Landry a déclaré qu'il s'agissait « d'une perte considérable pour notre nation .
C'était un grand créateur qui a utilisé le cinéma d'une façon exemplaire pour faire valoir ses idées et des convictions .
Parfois avec humour , parfois d'une façon tragique , mais son oeuvre cinématographique en soi est d'une grande valeur .
Et pour notre nation , notre combat national , il a aussi été d'un apport exceptionnel » .
L'actuelle chef du Parti québécois , Pauline Marois , a salué la mémoire de l'artiste , mais aussi du polémiste .
Elle reconnaît le caractère parfois excessif de ses propos , mais y voit la marque d'un homme libre .
« C'était un homme qui franchissait peut - être certaines frontières que l'on ne franchirait pas , nous .
Mais en même temps , il était excessif et c'est le propre , souvent , des gens qui ont des convictions profondes et qui veulent que leurs causes progressent » , a dit la chef péquiste .
Mme Marois déplore la perte d'un grand défenseur de la cause souverainiste .
Le chef du Bloc québécois Gilles Duceppe a loué la force de conviction du défunt ainsi que son oeuvre cinématographique .
Il admet ne pas avoir partagé toutes ses opinions , mais salue sans détour son engagement total envers la souveraineté du Québec .
Le député de Québec solidaire , Amir Khadir , décrit le défunt comme un libre penseur épris de justice , avec des préoccupations dépassant largement les frontières du Québec .
Le premier ministre du Québec , Jean Charest , qui participe au conseil général du parti , à Drummondville , a aussi réagi au décès du cinéaste .
« M. Falardeau , on le sait est un pamphlétaire , un homme qui avait le goût de la polémique , qui avait des opinions toujours fortes et il trouvait souvent une formule - choc pour les exprimer .
Par contre , son oeuvre artistique est substantielle » , a - t - il dit .
President Obama plans to detail his health care demands in a major speech as soon as next week , when Congress returns from the August recess .
Under fire , Obama shifts strategy
Aides to President Barack Obama are putting the final touches on a new strategy to help Democrats recover from a brutal August recess by specifying what Obama wants to see in a compromise health care deal and directly confronting other trouble spots , West Wing officials tell POLITICO .
Obama will address a joint session of Congress on health care reform in prime time on Wednesday , Sept. 9 , a senior official tells POLITICO , and the president plans to give lawmakers a more specific prescription for health care legislation than he has in the past , aides said .

And although House leaders have said their members will demand the inclusion of a public insurance option , Obama has no plans to insist on it himself , the officials said .
“ We ’re entering a new season , ” senior adviser David Axelrod said in a telephone interview .
“ It ’s time to synthesize and harmonize these strands and get this done .
We ’re confident that we can do that .
But obviously it is a different phase .
We ’re going to approach it in a different way .
The president is going to be very active . ”
Top officials privately concede the past six weeks have taken their toll on Obama 's popularity .
But the officials also see the new diminished expectations as an opportunity to prove their critics wrong by signing a health care law , showing progress in Afghanistan , and using this month 's anniversary of the fall of Lehman Brothers to push for a crackdown on Wall Street .
On health care , Obama ’s willingness to forgo the public option is sure to anger his party ’s liberal base .
But some administration officials welcome a showdown with liberal lawmakers if they argue they would rather have no health care law than an incremental one .
The confrontation would allow Obama to show he is willing to stare down his own party to get things done .
“ We have been saying all along that the most important part of this debate is not the public option , but rather ensuring choice and competition , ” an aide said .
“ There are lots of different ways to get there . ”
The content of Obama 's presentation is still being debated in the West Wing .
Aides have discussed whether to stick to broad principles , or to send specific legislative language to Capitol Hill .
Some hybrid is likely , the officials said .
“ I ’m not going to put a date on any of this , ” Axelrod said .
“ But I think it ’s fairly obvious that we ’re not in the second inning .
We ’re not in the fourth inning .
We ’re in the eighth or ninth inning here , and so there ’s not a lot of time to waste . ”
Obama 's specifics will include many of the principles he has spelled out before , and aides did not want to telegraph make - or - break demands .
But Axelrod and others are making plain that Obama will assert himself more aggressively — a clear sign that the president will start dictating terms to Congress .
" His goal is to create the best possible situation for consumers , create competition and choice , " Axelrod said .
" We want to bring a measure of security to people who have health insurance today .
We want to help those who do n't have coverage today , because they can't afford it , get insurance they can afford .
And we want to do it in a way that reduces the overall cost of the system as a whole . "
Also this fall , Obama wants to slap new regulations on Wall Street firms , a goal that is now considered a higher priority than cap - and - trade energy legislation in the West Wing .
White House officials think the legislation will show voters , especially wavering independents , that he is serious about making the culprits of the economic crisis pay .
It also helps that it does n't carry a big price tag , like other Obama priorities .
The president also plans to send Congress a report on Afghanistan by Sept. 24 that is designed to build patience after two months in a row of the highest U.S. casualties since the invasion eight years ago .
Aides say they recognize they need to show progress over the next 12 to 18 months , or risk losing the support of key Democrats in Congress , who already have balked at funding Obama ’s 20,000 - troop buildup .
But health care remains front - and - center in Obama ’s fall strategy .
“ I understand the governing wisdom here in town as to where this is right now , ” Axelrod said .
“ I feel good about where it is right now .
I understand that there ’s been a lot of controversy .
I understand that there ’s been a lot of politics .
But the truth is , we ’re a lot closer to achieving something than many thought possible .
People look to the president for leadership on this and other issues .
He feels passionately about this , and you can look for him to provide that leadership . ”
Obama has been criticized for deciding to cede much of the debate to Capitol Hill -- or , as Axelrod put it , “ allow Congress to consider the whole range of ideas . ”
“ History will judge whether this was right or it was wrong , ” Axelrod said .
“ We feel strongly that it was right .
As a result of it , we have broad consensus on over 80 percent of this stuff , and a lot of good ideas about how to achieve the other 20 .
Now , people are looking to the president and the president is eager to help lead that process of harmonizing these different elements and completing this process so that we can solve what is a big problem in the lives of the American people , for our businesses and our economy . ”
White House officials say they are looking forward to " a break from the August break " -- a chance to take back control of the debate after a grim month where news coverage of the issue was dominated by vocal , emotional opponents at lawmakers ’ town meetings , railing against the cost and complexity of the plans being debated .
So Obama and Democrats will return from vacation wounded , divided and uncertain of the best way to turn things around .
Many Democrats , especially in the House , were spooked over break by the rowdy town hall meetings and flurry of polls showing independent voters skeptical of their leadership and spending plans .
The mood swing is hitting some top leaders hard : Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , for instance , is trailing little - known GOP contenders in his re-election race now .
The news swing has been no less brutal .
There has been saturation coverage of the town halls and rising casualties in Afghanistan -- the latter leading to a big drop in support for the war .
All of this makes for a tumultuous -- and wildly unpredictable -- fall for Obama and his party .
Axelrod said he is n’t worried .
“ Part of it is born of long experience , ” he said .
“ In Washington , every day is Election Day .
I ’d be lying to you if I told you I do n’t look at polls -- I do .
But I ’ve also learned that you have to keep your eye on the horizon here and not get bogged down .
I am not Polyannish , but I am also not given to the hysteria that 's endemic to this town . ”
Yoga is associated with flexibility , increased range of motion and de-stressing .
And at more advanced levels , yoga can certainly build strength , in addition to bestowing numerous other benefits , not the least of which are mindfulness and well - being .
So there 's little doubt that yoga is a good workout .
But is it a complete program for building muscle mass , weight loss and cardio health ?
The short answer is that yoga can be the centerpiece of a good fitness regimen , but it comes up a bit short in a department or two , mainly in cardiovascular health .
But yoga 's power to transform the body in other areas may surprise you .
Yoga builds the kind of real - life muscle strength that carries you through the day .
Strength
Hatha yoga -- the kind of yoga most commonly taught in classes -- will substantially improve your strength , as well as your flexibility , endurance and balance .
In a study funded by the American Council on Exercise , researchers found that one hour of Hatha yoga 3 days a week brought substantial gains in chest and abdominal strength .
Gains in endurance were also particularly notable in chest and abdomen , with the yoga group able to perform six more push - ups and 14 more curl - ups at the end of the trial than the non -yoga group .
A big advantage of yoga is that builds real - life strength , developing along with flexibility , balance and endurance .
However , if your main goal is to bulk up , you 'll make faster progress with weights .
Neuromotor Development
A couple of yoga classes per week fulfills the American College of Sports Medicine recommendation of 30 minutes , 2 to 3 days a week of neuromotor exercise and proprioceptive training , which can be described as the body 's sixth sense regarding its position in space .
In this way yoga lowers risk of injury while exercising and in daily life , falls in older adults and improves physical function .
Aerobics
Alas , aerobic activity is the one area where yoga comes up short .
The ACE study found no notable changes in VO2 max -- the maximum amount of oxygen you can burn during intense activity -- in the yoga group over the 8 week period .
While some types of yoga such as vinyasa will raise your heart rate up somewhat , getting an all - around cardio workout means you 'll still want to hit the treadmill , the stairs or some other form of heart - pumping exercise .
Weight Management
Yoga does not turn your body into a calorie - burning furnace .
According to the American Council on Exercise , doing yoga burns about 3 to 6 calories per minute , or 180 to 360 calories for a 60 - to 90 - minute class .
How many calories you burn can depend on the type of yoga -- an intense Ashtanga class will be at the higher end of the spectrum while a mellow Hatha practice will burn less calories .
By comparison , a rigorous kettlebell workout burns about 13 to 17 calories per minute , or 800 or more calories in an hour .
However , yoga may help people attain a healthy weight in other ways , especially when it comes to staving off the dreaded middle - aged spread .
Between the ages of 45 and 55 , most people gain an average of a pound a year .
But a 2005 study funded by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center found that people who were of normal weight at the age of 45 and had a regular yoga practice gained about 3 pounds less in the ensuing 10 - year period than average .
What 's more , yoga had the biggest weight - loss impact on people who were overweight -- they lost about 5 pounds compared to the 14 pounds gained by people who did n't do yoga .
Researchers concluded the benefits were likely derived from a more mindful approach to eating ; because yoga practice imbues mental discipline by training the mind to stay focus when the body is under stress , chocolate cravings and other weight - gain bugaboos may hold less sway .
Part I summarizes the state of the world wide nuclear fission energy today and its perspectives for the next 10 years ;
Part II presents the situation concerning secondary uranium and plutonium resources ;
Part III analyses the " known " uranium resource data as presented within the past editions of the IAEA / NEA Red Book ; Part IV finally outlines the plans and prospects for the long term future of nuclear fission and fusion .
This analysis about nuclear energy and its future contribution attempts to shed some light on the nuclear reality and its limitations .
The report , presented in four parts , is based on data provided in documents made available by the IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) , the NEA ( Nuclear Energy Agency of OECD countries ) , the WNA ( World Nuclear Association ) , and the IEA ( International Energy Agency ) .
Nuclear fission energy is considered anywhere between the holy grail , that can solve all energy worries of the human industrialized civilization , and a fast path di­rectly to hell .
Discussions about future energy sources and the possible contribution from nuclear energy are often tainted and dominated by irrational expectations and fears .
As a consequence , very little actual knowledge is available to the general public and even to decision makers about the contribution of nuclear energy today , about uranium supplies , uranium resources , and current and future technological challenges and limitations .

Introduction
Most people today agree that a comfortable way of life depends on the avail­ability of cheap energy with its almost limitless applications .
The average per capita energy consumption in the developed world increased by a factor of three or more during the past 50 years .
However at most one billion people , or 1/ 7 of the human population of today , enjoy this increase .
They live mainly in the richer countries and use on average approximately 50,000 kWh of thermal energy from various sources per year .
This is three times higher than the world average consumption , roughly five times higher than the average per person energy use in China , and about 10 times larger than in India [ 1 ] .
Depending slightly on the counting procedure , roughly 85 % of this energy comes from fossil energy sources : about 40 % from oil , 20 % from natural gas and 25 % from coal .
Our mobility depends to almost 100 % on oil .
Electric energy , made from various " fuels , " has the highest value for stationary applications and forms a basis for essentially all hi-tech and luxury energy applications .
On a world - wide scale , electric energy accounts for 16 % of the end energy use and between 20 - 25 % in most of the rich countries .
About 70 % of the electric energy is again made from fossil fuels , about 16 % from hydropower , and only 14 % from nuclear fission energy .
The renewable wind , solar , and geothermal energy sources , with some minor local exceptions , contribute no more than 1 - 2 % to the energy mix [ 2 ] .
These numbers demonstrate that electric energy , especially the part of it that is made from nuclear energy and renewable energy sources , contributes only little to the total world energy mix .
In contrast , one obtains a totally distorted picture of their importance when one follows the media coverage and the political discussions at all levels about the pros and cons of nuclear fission power , hydropower , wind power , geothermal , and direct and indirect solar energy sources .
For Switzerland , an interesting example of a small , densely populated and rich industrialized country , one ﬁnds that electric energy contributes to roughly 24 % of the ﬁnal energy mix .
Electric energy is produced almost exclusively from hydropower ( ≈ 60 % ) , and nuclear fission power ( ≈ 40 % ) [ 3 ] .
Consequently , the two big and three old and smaller nuclear power plants contribute only 10 % to the Swiss energy mix .
Similar basic energy numbers can be found on the Internet at the IEA website [ 4 ] and at many other websites .
As fossil fuel resources , and especially oil and gas , are not renewable , it is obvious that the world - wide energy mix of today is totally unsustainable .
While it is generally accepted that fossil fuels will not last forever , the energy situation is mainly discussed in relation to its effects on global warming .
This is reflected in various high - level meetings , where climate change and other side effects of our energy use are on the agenda of world - wide policy makers .
Even though the recent price explosions for crude oil have resulted in some policy changes , the serious consequences of limited oil and gas resources are rarely discussed .
If addressed at all , one finds that they are discussed under the more ambiguous heading of " energy security . "
Perhaps disillusioned by the official politically correct main stream arguments , many people have started to investigate the resource limitations , often under the title " peak oil and gas " and " peak everything . "
These problems and the need to react are now discussed at many levels , and plenty of details can be found at web sites such as the " oil drum , " the " energy bulletin , " and many others [ 5 ] .
Those who have accepted that the situation with our use of fossil fuels is unsustainable suggest and support , in order to prevent wars , chaos , and collapse , mostly a mixture of the following three sometimes orthogonal evolutionary directions :
the nuclear energy option ;
the all renewable energy option , based dominantly on the transformation of solar and wind energy ;
the energy reduction option , which stands for some efficiency improvements combined with an overall coordinated reduction of consumerism .
Consequently , economic activities will slow down and " we " all will have to live simpler , perhaps still satisfying , lifestyles .
In this report , we shed some light on the nuclear energy option and its limitations .
This analysis is split into four parts : ( I ) the nuclear reality of today and its short term perspectives ; ( II ) the situation concerning secondary uranium resources ; ( III ) the existing data about " known " exploitable uranium resources ; and ( IV ) status and perspectives of fast breeder reactors ( fourth generation reactors ) and why commercial fusion reactors will always be 50 years away .
We believe that a comprehensive discussion of nuclear energy must also address problems related to ( 1 ) the real and imagined dangers of nuclear energy relative to other energy forms ; ( 2 ) nuclear weapon proliferation , and ( 3 ) the accumulated nuclear waste .
Yet in this series of articles , we shall not enter into any details concerning these important issues and instead refer the interested reader to the extensive literature dealing with them [ 6 ] .
In this first article , nuclear energy and its place in today 's world energy mix are reviewed .
As significant new constructions in the nuclear power cycle , including uranium mines , enrichment facilities , and power plants , require at least a 5 - 10 year construction time , the maximum possible contribution of the nuclear power sector up until almost 2020 is already known and presented in this report .
It should become clear from the facts presented in the following sections of this article that the nuclear energy situation is far from being in the often claimed " nuclear renaissance phase . "
In fact , even without considering the impact of the 2008/ 9 world financial chaos , it seems already now very difficult to stop the slow nuclear phase - out , with an annual decrease of about 1 % , that has been observed during the past few years .
Energy from nuclear fission : past , present and the next 10 years
Humanity began to understand the laws of physics that describe nuclear energy with its enormous energy density about 100 years ago , when a new form of very energetic radiation from heavy elements , like uranium , was discovered .
It became quickly evident that many appli­cations were waiting to be discovered and used .
Among them , we learnt to build the " final weapon of mass destruction " and found a way to produce commercial energy from nuclear fission .
In 1938 , O. Hahn and F. Strassner studied the neutron bombardment of uranium observing some lighter elements .
Within weeks , L. Meitner and O. Frisch could explain the reaction as the fission of uranium atoms into two lighter atoms .
Today we know that , on average , 2 - 3 neutrons and a large amount of energy are liberated in this reaction .
This observation opened the road to a controlled chain reaction using the neutrons emitted from one fission reaction to fission further uranium atoms .
Such a chain reaction with a power of 2 Watt was first achieved by E. Fermi and his team in 1942 .
Only three years later , the world saw the explosions of two fission bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki that killed 150,000 people instantaneously .
The civilian use of nuclear fission energy , i.e. , the nuclear energy age , began during the 1950s with the hope that this would lead mankind to an almost unlimited future energy supply .
This idea came from the fact that the fission of 1 kg of uranium liberates about the same amount of energy as 1,000,000 kg of coal .
Even if only the U235 component of natural uranium , which contains the two isotopes U238 ( 99.29 % ) and U235 ( 0.71 % ) , can be used , one still finds that 1 kg of natural uranium contains energy equivalent of more than 10,000 kg of coal .
Thus even a " useless " rock , containing perhaps only 0.01 % of uranium , i.e. , 0.1 kg of uranium per ton , could in theory liberate more energy than 1 kg of coal .
The necessary chain reaction to liberate nuclear fission energy is known to be possible if , on average , more than one neutron is emitted for every fission reaction .
This is essentially possible only with two uranium isotopes , U235 and U233 , and with the plutonium isotope Pu239 , where , on average , 2 - 3 neutrons are emitted per fission reaction .
Among them , only U235 exists naturally in sizable quantities .
The fission of these heavy elements is induced usually by a bombardment with moderated ( slowed down ) neutrons .
If these extra neutrons are used efficiently for new fission reactions , a chain reaction , either controlled ( in a reactor ) or uncontrolled ( in a bomb ) can be started .
As only one neutron is required to keep the controlled chain reaction going , the other neutrons can be used to transform the non-fissionable U238 and Thorium 232 isotopes under neutron absorption and subsequent decays into the fissionable isotopes Pu239 and U233 .
This neutron absorption process can be used to breed ( produce ) fissionable material .
Already in the existing reactors , often called " once through " reactors , up to 1/3 of the produced power comes from the fission of Pu239 produced from the above U238 transformation .
A more complicated technological challenge poses the Fast Breeder Reactor ( FBR ) .
This reactor is operated in a chain reaction mode using the prompt energetic ( fast ) fission neutrons .
The­oretically , the amount of fissionable material can be increased with fast breeders by a large factor .
So far , prototype commercial FBRs were not a great success for energy production [ 7 ] .
More details can be found in the " Generation IV " nuclear power plant road map [ 8 ] .
In this document , written by scientists from all larger nuclear energy countries , it is stated that at least 20 years of intense research and development are required before the breeder option can be considered as a real alternative to the existing standard nuclear reactors .
More details about the status and prospects of FBRs will be presented in the fourth and final article in this series .
Nuclear fission power today
Today , about 30 countries on our planet operate commercial nuclear fission power plants .
Dur­ing 2008 , these power plants provided together 2601 TWhe [ 9 ] .
" TWh " stands for Terra Watt hours or 1012 Wh and " e " stands for electric energy .
The power of a standard nuclear power plant is usually given in units of GW or 109 W .
If a 1 GW reactor is operated with 85 % efficiency over one year , about 7.5
TWhe of electricity are produced .
The amount of nuclear electricity produced in 2008 is 2.1 % below that of the record year 2006 where all nuclear power plants together produced 2658 TWhe .
As a consequence of the ever increasing electric energy demand , the contribution from nuclear fission energy to the total amount of produced electric energy has decreased from 18 % in 1993 to 14 % in 2008 .
Roughly 16 % of the world energy end use comes from electric energy [ 2 ] .
Multiplying 14 % by 16 % , one finds that nuclear energy contributes now less than 2.5 % to the world 's end energy mix .
The true nuclear energy contribution is about three times smaller than the percentage stated in most reviews of the world energy situation .
The IEA and other agencies convert various sources of energy into a so - called " primary energy equivalent . "
In order to do so , the produced thermal energy is used for the statistics , and nuclear electric energy is multiplied roughly by a factor of three .
However , this approach is somewhat misleading as it is unclear how hydropower , where no thermal waste heat is produced , should be used in comparison .
Furthermore , hydropower and gas - fired power plants provide electric energy on demand .
In contrast , an efficient operation of nuclear power plants requires their operation with little interruptions at 100 % capacity .
As a result , nuclear power plants produce the so - called base load for the electric grid , whereas hydro and gas - fired power plants are used to satisfy peak load needs .
A fairer comparison would thus give the electric energy produced from hydropower a much higher quality factor than the one from nuclear fission power .
Another problem with the primary energy accounting is related to the efficiency of nuclear power plants , which , on average , have a thermal - to - electric energy conversion factor of 33 % , much lower than modern fossil fuel power plants , where efficiency factors of 50 % and more can be reached .
In addition , the waste heat from nuclear power plants is of lower temperature than that from gas - fired power plants .
Consequently , the usage of waste heat from today 's nuclear power plants is much less efficient and therefore essentially wasted to the environment .
We thus find it more logical to measure the contribution from nuclear fission energy to the world end energy mix .
According to the IAEA database [ 10 ] , nuclear electric energy comes currently from 436 nuclear fission reactors with an electric power capacity of about 370 GWe .
The average age of these reactors is already about 25 years , and 130 reactors with a capacity of more than 90 GWe have an age between 30 and 40 years .
A large fraction of those reactors will probably be decommissioned during the coming 5 to 10 years .
The two oldest relatively small commercial reactors of 0.217 GWe each , have an age of 41 and 42 years and are expected to be shut down by the end of 2010 [ 11 ] .
In contrast to the often repeated statement that the world is in a phase of a " nuclear renaissance , " the data show a very different picture .
Since the beginning of 2008 , one reactor in Slovakia and two of the older reactors in Japan were shut down permanently , whereas not a single new reactor was completed .
In fact , the year 2008 marks the first year since 1968 , when not a single new reactor was connected to the electric grid .
During the past 10 - 15 years , about 3 - 5 new nuclear power plants per year were connected to the electric grid on average , and an equivalent number of smaller and older reactors were decommissioned .
Pursuant to the IAEA data base [ 10 ] , 48 reactors are currently under construction , and according to the WNA data base , roughly 10 reactors per year will be completed , on average , during the coming 5 - 10 years [ 12 ] .
While the connection of about 10 reactors per year would indicate a substantial increase compared to the past 15 years , this number is far lower than 25 years ago , when 33 new nuclear reactors were started up each year .
If one assumes a normal reactor construction time of 5 - 10 years , one could imagine that all these 48 reactors might be operational between 2015 to 2020 .
If they can be operated as efficiently as the existing reactors , these new nuclear power plants will contribute at most about 300 TWhe per year of additional electric energy , resulting for the years 2015 - 2020 in a total nuclear energy production of no more than 2900 TWhe .
However , if one takes the average retirement age for the so far closed 122 reactors as a guideline , one can expect that up to 100 older smaller reactors will be decommissioned during the next 10 years .
Combining these two pieces of information , it seems rather unlikely that even a net increase of the world - wide fission - produced electric energy is possible by 2015 .
In contrast , if one uses the annual decline of almost 1 % observed during the last years as a base , a production of 2350 TWhe may be expected for the year 2015 .
Consequently , one can predict for 2015 , ignoring other limiting factors , that the total contribution from nuclear power plants will remain at best close to the current level .
Those interested in following the nuclear evolution during the coming months and years can compare the planned and real start - up dates summarized in a recent WNA reference document [ 12 ] .
According to this WNA data base , it is planned that 7 and 8 new reactors will be connected to the grid during the remaining months of 2009 and 2010 , respectively .
It seems that at least the 2009 expectations are already now highly unrealistic .
Requirements of natural uranium equivalent
In the previous section , we have presented how the long construction times for new nuclear power plants and the existing age structure of nuclear power plants constrain the evolution of nuclear power during the next 5 - 10 years .
We will now investigate the nuclear fuel supply situation .
Current nuclear reactors have , for several reasons , a relatively low thermal efficiency of about 33 % .
To operate a 1 GWe power plant , one finds that U235 or Pu239 isotopes have to be fissioned at a rate of roughly 1020 fissions / sec ( about 0.05 grams / second ) .
Knowing that the U235 isotope makes up only 0.71 % of natural uranium , one finds that about 6.5 gram of natural uranium equivalent are required per second to operate a 1 GWe nuclear reactor .
Multiplying this amount with the number of seconds per year , one finds that 170 tons of natural uranium equivalent per year are needed to operate a 1 GWe power plant .
Therefore , about 65,000 tons of natural uranium equivalent per year are needed to operate the existing 370 GWe nuclear capacity .
It is generally believed that ( 1 ) this amount of uranium can easily be obtained from the existing mines combined with secondary resources ; ( 2 ) it will be easy to extract a sufficient amount of uranium from new mines in the near future ; and ( 3 ) no nuclear fuel shortages should be expected for the coming years .
However as will be shown below and in Part II of this review , the situation with uranium extraction from the known mines and with the secondary resources during the coming 5 - 10 years appears to be much more critical than generally believed .
Before we present these data , a few more details about the usage of nuclear fuel might be helpful to understand the current uranium supply situation and how it will constrain the evolution of nuclear power during the coming 5 - 10 years .
Nuclear reactors produce energy from the fission of either uranium U235 or plutonium Pu239 , which is one of the secondary sources of nuclear fuel .
To simplify the discussion , we always use the natural uranium equivalent in the following .
As has been explained above , the amount of fissile material required to operate a 1 GWe nuclear power plant for one year , e.g. assuming one annual refilling , is about 165 - 180 tons of natural uranium equivalent per year .
In practice , the normal operation of most reactors requires a few weeks of annual shutdown in order to replace about 1 /4 of the used up uranium fuel rods .
Fresh reactor fuel rods contain a mixture of the fissile isotopes U235 or Pu239 component enriched to 3 - 4 % and U238 .
During the few years of operation , the U235 content will be reduced to roughly 1 % .
At the same time due to neutron capture and subsequent β decays , some U238 is transformed into Pu239 .
During the reactor operation , Pu239 increases to something close to 1 % and contributes on average up to 30 % of the produced fission energy .
Once the concentration of fissionable material in the fuel rods is reduced well below 2 % , new fuel rods are usually required .
The first uranium load , which brings a new 1 GWe reactor to nominal power , is about 500 tons of natural uranium equivalent .
Some important statistics about nuclear power plants in different countries , their electric energy production in 2007 , and the corresponding uranium requirements , extracted from the Red Book data base of the IAEA and the NEA [ 14 ] and from the WNA [ 13 ] , are summarized below .
The second column gives the number of reactors per country and in parantheses the corresponding electric power .
The third column gives the total amount of electric energy produced in 2007 .
The number in parantheses indicates the average number of TWh produced per installed GWe power , which is an indication of how efficiently the nuclear power plants were operated in 2007 .
A non-negligible number of reactors is always on some kind of long - term technical shut - down .
A typical example is the result of the 2007 earthquake in Japan , where some 8 GWe nuclear power plants were damaged and operation has not resumed yet after two years .
The number in the fourth column shows the natural uranium equivalent requirements for 2008 .
The number in parantheses gives the average uranium requirements per GWe installed power for the world and the different countries .
Since about 15 years , only about 2/3 of the annual uranium requirements , i.e. , between 31,000 and 44,000 tons , are extracted from the world - wide mining industry .
This quantity is much smaller than the mining capacity , which for example in 2007 was , according to the Red Book , 54,000 - 57,000 tons [ 15 ] .
The difference between the required and the extracted uranium in 2007 was about 23,000 tons .
This is about the same amount as extracted by the three largest uranium producing countries , Canada , Australia , and Kazakhstan , together .
The missing amount of fissile material is currently satisfied with secondary resources .
These are the civilian and military stocks of uranium and plutonium that were accumu­lated during the cold war and the so called MOX , a mixture of U235 and plutonium recycled in an expensive and technically challenging process from the used fuel rods .
The tails left over from the U235 enrichment process still contain some 0.2-0.3 % of U235 and are another potential source of U235 .
In Part II , we shall present some publicly available data on secondary resources , which provide some quantitative explanations for the alarming situation expressed ( highlighted by the author ) in the IAEA and NEA press declaration of June 3 , 2008 [ 16 ] about the new 2007 edition of the Red Book :
At the end of 2006 , world uranium production ( 39,603 tons ) provided about 60 % of world reactor requirements ( 66,500 tons ) for the 435 commercial nuclear reactors in operation .
The gap between production and requirements was made up by secondary sources drawn from government and commercial inventories ( such as the dismantling of over 12,000 nuclear warheads and the re-enrichment of uranium tails ) .
Most secondary resources are now in decline and the gap will increasingly need to be closed by new production .
Given the long lead time typically required to bring new resources into production , uranium supply shortfalls could develop if production facilities are not implemented in a timely manner .
Uranium extraction , past and present
In order to understand today 's uranium supply situation , it is interesting to note that many formerly rich uranium mines , especially in large uranium consuming countries , closed many years ago .
This closure has happened despite that ( 1 ) the claimed goal is energy independence , and ( 2 ) uranium explorations make only minor contributions to the electricity price .
Reality shows that these countries are now largely dependent on uranium imports from other countries .
Today , the ten largest uranium consumers are the United States , France , Japan , Russia , Germany , Korea ( South ) , UK , Ukraine , Canada , and Sweden .
These countries consume about 84 % of the uranium needed world wide or roughly 54,000 tons of the natural uranium equivalent .
This number can be compared with the uranium extracted world wide .
The latest numbers from the WNA indicate that 43,930 tons of uranium were extracted in 2008 [ 17 ] .
The corresponding data from the WNA and the Red Book for the previous years are 41,279 tons in 2007 , 39,429 tons in 2006 and 41,702 in 2005 .
Somewhat remarkable is the fact that the achieved numbers are usually at least one thousand tons smaller than the short term production forecast for the next year .
Only 4 of the above 10 countries , Canada , Russia , USA , and Ukraine , are still extracting uranium in sizable quantities .
Out of these four countries , only Canada , which extracted 9476 tons in 2007 , produces a large amount of uranium directly for export .
It is interesting to note that the existing mines in Canada seem to be in a steep decline , while upgrades and new mines are unable to compensate for this decline .
During the years 2002 - 2005 , the Canadian mines produced , on average , more than 11,000 tons per year .
Since then , production fell by 5 % and more per year , and only 9000 tons were produced in 2008 .
The uranium mines in the above 10 largest uranium consumer countries produce only about 28 % of their uranium needs , i.e. , 15,400 tons in 2007 and 14,751 tons in 2008 .
If the two uranium exporting countries in this list are not taken into account , the remaining eight countries need to import about 95 % of their requirements .
For the European countries , the uranium import dependence is now almost 100 % and as such much larger than their relative dependence on oil and gas imports .
The table below shows some important numbers about nuclear fission energy and present and past uranium production for the entire world and for different countries as given in the Red Book 2007 [ 14 ] and the WNA data base [ 18 ] .
As can be seen , ( East ) Germany and France have essentially stopped uranium mining , even though they used to extract large amounts of uranium from within their territory .
Finally , Japan , the UK , South - Korea , and Sweden never had any substantial uranium mining of their own .
For the largest uranium consumer country , the United States , the situation is even more amazing .
The internal uranium production declined from a peak of 17,000 tons per year around 1980 to a production of 1654 tons in 2007 and 1430 tons in 2008 .
Last year 's amount does not even allow to operate 10 % of their nuclear power plants .
More interesting questions should come up when one considers that currently about 50 % of the nuclear reactors in the USA are operated with excess military uranium stockpiles from Russia .
As the bilateral contract between the USA and Russia ends in 2013 and as Russia has currently very ambitious plans to enlarge their own nuclear energy sector , it is unlikely that Russia will renew this contract in 2013 .
Consequently , the stability of the electric grid in the United States now depends on the friendship with their former archenemy and possibly today 's and tomorrow 's most important economic competitor .
The dependence of USA on Russia 's good will looks like an interesting problem for the next few years .
These uranium data demonstrate the obvious contradiction between the goal that energy imports need to be reduced in order to achieve more energy security , as expressed by past and present US administrations , and reality .
Thus , the data demonstrate that there is nothing like uranium self - sufficiency in the United States , the European Union , Japan , and other rich countries , and that the uranium import dependence is in general much larger than for oil and gas .
In fact , the data on uranium mining and the large import dependence for several large uranium consuming countries undermine strongly the widespread belief that uranium resources are plentiful and that uranium exploration and mining costs are only a minor problem for nuclear energy production .
A naive observer may conclude that the permanently repeated claims from authorities , such as from the NEA director general L. Echávarri and the IAEA deputy director Y. Sokolov in 2006 [ 19 ] , that uranium resources are plentiful and sufficient to sustain the expected growth of nuclear power are either wishful thinking or assume that such statements are needed in order to reinforce the belief in a bright future for nuclear energy .
More details about uranium mining in different countries and especially their evolution during the past years and the near future needs will be presented in the next section .
Uranium needs and production limits : the next 10 years
As we have seen in the previous section , the world nuclear power plants can reach a maximum capacity of 410 GWe by 2015 .
In order to achieve this number , it has to be assumed that none of current 370 GWe reactors will be decommissioned and that all plants currently under construction can be completed by 2015 .
We shall now estimate how much uranium fuel can be expected for the operation of nuclear power plants around the year 2015 and whether this amount will provide a second constraint for the number of nuclear plants in operation .
Such estimates are fairly reliable because the fuel needs for the reactors operating or under construction today are well known .
Fuel requirements of future generation reactors are irrelevant for the next 10 years as at least 20 years of research and development are required to build them [ 8 ] .
Nuclear capacity estimates and the corresponding uranium needs for the years beyond 2015 are becoming more and more speculative .
For example , one needs to know what will happen with the oldest nuclear reactors and whether they can be replaced in time .
Nevertheless many government agencies , like the IAEA / NEA , the IEA or the EIA from the USA government , as well as large pro-nuclear organizations like the WNA try to make forecasts at least up to the year 2030 .
For example the 2008 press declaration for the 2007 edition of the Red Book states [ 16 ] :
World nuclear energy capacity is expected to grow from 372 GWe in 2007 to between 509 GWe ( +38 % ) and 663 GWe ( +80 % ) by 2030 .
To fuel this expansion , annual uranium requirements are anticipated to rise to between 94,000 tons and 122,000 tons , based on the type of reactors in use today .
More generally , three scenarios for the evolution of the yearly nuclear capacity are envisaged for the next 20 years [ 20 ] :
a fast growth with an increase of + 2 % per year ; a reference scenario with a 1 % annual growth ; and a slow decline scenario with a 1 % annual decrease starting in 2010 .
Taking the performance from the world - wide nuclear power plants and from the uranium mines in the last few years as an indication , only scenario ( 3 ) , the slow phase - out , seems to be consistent with the current data .
This trend might even be strengthened by the current financial world crisis , which will make it more difficult to obtain the large commitments needed for the construction of new nuclear power plants and new uranium mines , and indeed , some construction delays for new nuclear projects have already been announced [ 21 ] .
In addition , it is evident that unpredictable events such as earthquakes , accidents or wars can only result in a capacity decrease .
The uranium requirements up to at least 2015 are already well known and summarized below :
The nuclear power perspectives up to 2015 for different countries and the world are extracted from the Red Book 2007 [ 14 ] .
The WNA numbers are taken from [ 12 ] .
As quantiﬁed within the 2007 edition of the Red Book and the WNA 2009 data base , the expected increase in nuclear power plant capacity is expected to come from a few countries only .
Some important aspects about these near future world - wide nuclear plans are :
Germany , currently the fifth largest nuclear power consumer , has indicated a definite plan for their nuclear phase - out .
According to this plan , the German nuclear power capacity should be reduced from 20.3 GWe to about 11 GWe by 2015 [ 22 ] .
Very ambitious plans to complete a large number of nuclear power plants by 2015 are currently proposed by China , where the current 7.6 GWe ( 2007 ) should increase to 25 - 35 GWe [ 12 ] .
A similar increase is planned by India , where 3.8 GWe ( 2007 ) should increase to 9.5-13.1 GWe .
This can be compared with the plans from Japan , Russia , and South Korea , where their entire capacity should increase by an additional 8 - 10 GWe .
The rich OECD countries are planning currently for a roughly constant nuclear capacity .
However , the high growth 2010 forecast from the IAEA / NEA Red Book 2007 is , according to the more recent March 2009 WNA numbers , already unachievable .
In fact , even this WNA estimate , which assumes that during 2009 and 2010 seven ( 4.3 GWe ) and eight ( 5.2 GWe ) new nuclear power plants will be connected to the grid [ 12 ] , seems to be totally unrealistic .
As we are interested in estimating the maximum possible contribution from nuclear power plants during the next decade , the above Red Book scenario can be used as a guideline to estimate the requirements of uranium equivalent for the coming years .
In order to operate the current and future running nuclear reactors , the authors of the Red Book 2007 estimated that between 70,000 - 75,000 tons of uranium equivalent are required for the year 2010 and between 77,000 - 86,000 tons by 2015 .
Following the IAEA / NEA June 2008 press declaration [ 16 ] , such a growth for uranium mining seems to be a serious challenge :
Given the long lead time typically required to bring new resources into production , uranium supply shortfalls could develop if production facilities are not implemented in a timely manner .
Despite this and similar hidden warnings , the authors of the Red Book usually offer a rather rosy picture for the future uranium mining , as can be seen from the data summarized below :
The expected uranium production capacity is given in units of 1000 tons from the Red Book for the world and for different countries for the years 2010 and 2015 [ 25 ] .
The expected world - wide capacity increase between 2007 and 2010 and from 2010 to 2015 is obtained from the evolution of the total capacity .
The ratio between the real production numbers for 2007 from the WNA and the uranium capacity from the Red Book are given in column 2 . Scenarios
A and B are rough forecasts for the maximal uranium mining for the years 2010 and 2015 based on past capacity and real mining relation .
For Scenario
A , it is assumed that the mining performance will be 75 % of the future capacity expected according to the Red Book .
For Scenario
B , we assume that the existing mines in 2007 will continue an average annual production of 40,000 tons and that only 50 % of the capacity forecast can become operational in time .
The predicted large increase of world - wide uranium mining almost exactly matches the requirements .
However , essentially all countries exaggerate their mining capacity predictions far beyond the amount that can be reasonably extracted , as demonstrated e.g. by comparing the 2007 claimed capacity with the actually achieved uranium 2007 mining results .
The numbers in the second column indicate especially large and unrealistic expectations for Canada and the USA .
For 2007 , the world - wide uranium mining capacity is given as of 54,370 - 56,855 tons .
In comparison to this capacity , the expectations from the Red book for the year 2007 were given as 43,328 tons .
Uranium mining 2007 achieved 41,264 tons , about 2000 tons less than the forecast for the same year .
Similarly wrong estimates were given in past Red Book editions .
For example the Red Book 2003 ( 2005 ) gave capacities for the year 2003 ( 2005 ) of 49,940 tons ( 49,720 -51,565 tons ) .
In comparison , the achieved uranium extraction was 35,492 tons in 2003 and 41,943 tons in 2005 [ 23 ] .
As if these capacity numbers , exaggerated by 20 - 30 % , would not be troubling enough , the discrep­ancy between the claimed new mining capacity and the amounts that were really achieved is even more surprising .
According to the Red Book 2007 , the total additional capacity in 2007 compared to 2005 was estimated to be 5290 tons .
The real result for 2007 , a combination from older sometimes declining operating mines and new mines , was about 700 tons lower than the one achieved in 2005 .
For 2008 , the production reached 43,930 tons , which is 2200 tones larger than in the year 2005 but still far below the increase expected already for 2007 [ 17 ] .
Similar discrepancies between Red Book predictions and real extraction data can be found in previous Red Book editions .
These discrepancies are , somewhat hidden , acknowledged in the latest 2007 edition .
Unfortunately instead of explaining the origin of such mistakes and correcting them in order to improve the quality of the Red Book , systematic differences are simply accepted with the statement that " world production has never exceeded 89 % of the reported production capability and since 2003 has varied between 75 % and 84 % of production capability " [ 24 ] .
Further inconsistencies exist between the expected mining capacity increase and the detailed timetable given for the opening and extensions of uranium mines [ 25 ] .
For example the Red Book forecast , Table 24 ( page 48 ) , assumes that between 2007 and 2010 , the uranium mining capacity will increase by 26,000 to 29,900 tons .
However , direct counting of the new uranium mines ( page 49 ) results in new capacity of about 20,000 tons .
Similarly the forecast between 2010 and 2015 assumes that new mining projects should increase the capacity by another 15,000 - 30,000 tons .
In comparison , direct counting of new uranium mines sums up at most to about 21,000 tons , about 30 % below the claimed upper limit of 30,000 tons .
A critical reader of the Red Book will thus be intrigued to investigate , in which countries these capacity increases are expected .
Some of these predictions , extracted from the Red Book , are shown in the table printed above .
One finds that about 50 % of the world - wide uranium increase between 2007 and 2010 should come from Kazakhstan .
It is claimed that their production capacity will increase from 7000 tons in 2007 to 18,000 tons .
Such an increase should have raised some critical reﬂections and comments from the authors of the Red Book , as it would put Kazakhstan on equal terms with the combined production of Canada and Australia in 2008 .
According to the WNA spring 2009 document , the 2010 forecast for Kazakhstan has already been reduced to 15,000 tons [ 26 ] .
If one takes the latest news about a huge corruption affair concerning the uranium resources of Kazakhstan into account [ 27 ] , a further drastic reduction of the 2009 and 2010 forecasts can be predicted .
Uranium mining in Canada is also far behind the Red Book expectations [ 28 ] .
Not only are the real mining numbers much lower than the claimed capacities , but the existing three mines , which produce essentially 100 % of the Canadian uranium , are in steep decline .
The production from these three large mines ( McArthur River , McClean Lake , and Rabbit Lake ) declined from 11,400 tons in 2005 to 9000 tons in 2008 .
The previously expected 2007 start of the Cigar Lake mine , with an estimated yearly production capacity of 7000 tons , was stopped due to catastrophic flooding in late 2006 .
The start - up date of this mine is now delayed until at least 2012 .
One may conclude that the Red Book uranium mining extrapolations are exaggerated and not based on hard facts , as one would have expected from this internationally well respected document .
Those interested in the near future nuclear energy contribution and thus uranium mining perspectives for the next 10 years should consequently not use the Red Book data directly .
Instead , we might try to guess more realistic numbers by using the ratio between the 2007 mining results and the 2007 capacity as a first guess and update and improve these numbers accordingly during the next few years .
Following this method , we should reduce the mining capacities by at least 20 - 30 % in order to obtain a more meaningful forecast ( Scenario A ) .
As a result , we might predict a total uranium production of about 60,000 tons in 2010 and 72,000 tons in 2015 .
At least for 2010 , it is already clear that the Scenario A numbers are still quite a bit too high .
For Scenario B , we used the evolution of new uranium mines in order to determine how fast new capacity can become operational .
Using this procedure and the real mining data from the past few years , roughly 40,000 tons per year , and assuming that only 50 % of the new mining capacities can be realized , we might predict a perhaps more realistic production of 54,000 tons in 2010 , and 61,500 tons by 2015 .
Those numbers can be compared to the latest WNA June 2009 estimates , where a total of 49,400 tons and 74,000 tons are predicted for 2009 and 2015 , respectively [ 29 ] .
It seems that such professional estimations do not use much more input than a mixture of the above two simple - minded methods .
Within less than one year , we shall be able to update the above scenarios using the 2009 results and improve the 2010 and 2015 forecasts accordingly .
For those interested , I am offering a bet that the 2009 and 2010 numbers will not be higher than 45,000 tons and 47,000 tons , respectively .
Taking into account that civilian secondary resources currently provide about 21,000 tons of natural uranium equivalent per year and that the civilian part of these resources will be basically exhausted within the next few years , one finds that even the optimistic WNA 2009 numbers indicate uranium fuel supply stress during the coming years .
According to a recent presentation at the annual WNA September 2008 symposium from the Ux consulting ( Macquarie Research commodities ) [ 29 ] , about 1200 tons of uranium are missing for the 2009 demand .
Furthermore , an uranium mining result below 50,000 tons / year in 2009 and beyond will result in a serious uranium shortage .
Summary of Part I : Nuclear fission energy today
Our analysis of publicly available data from the large international and very pro-nuclear organiza­tions , the IAEA and the WNA , show that the current evolution of nuclear fission energy is consistent with a slow nuclear phase - out .
This situation is summarized by the following points :
The overall fraction of nuclear energy to electric energy has gone down from 18 % in 1993 to less than 14 % in 2008 .
With electric energy providing roughly 16 % of the world - wide energy end use , one finds overall a nuclear energy contribution of less than 2.5 % .
The number of produced TWhe of electric energy from world - wide nuclear power plants is now lower than in 2005 , and it has decreased by about 2 % from a maximum of 2658 TWhe in 2006 to 2601 TWhe in 2008 .
Today and world wide , 48 nuclear power plants with a capacity of about 40 GWe are under construction .
Only 10 % of them are being constructed within OECD countries , which host currently about 85 % of the existing nuclear reactors .
However , about 100 older reactors with slightly larger capacity are reaching their retirement age during the same period .
It follows that even if all 48 reactors might be connected within the next 5 to 10 years to the electric grid , it will be difficult to maintain the current level of TWhe produced by nuclear energy .
The natural uranium equivalent required to operate the 370 GWe nuclear power plants of today is roughly 65,000 tons per year .
However during the past 10 years , the world - wide uranium mines extracted , on average , only about 40,000 tons of uranium per year , and the difference had to be compensated for by secondary resources .
According to the data from the Red Book 2007 and the WNA , the remaining civilian uranium stocks are expected to be exhausted during the next few years .
Consequently the current uranium supply situation is unsustainable .
The urgency to increase world - wide uranium mining by a large amount is well documented in the current and past Red Book editions and related official declarations .
However , the latest uranium mining data indicate that new uranium mines will not be capable to compensate for the diminishing secondary uranium resources , and that it will be difficult to fuel the existing 370 GWe .
It seems that either a rather welcome but improbable further large conversion of nuclear weapons into reactor material will happen during the coming years , or fuel supply problems within the next 3 - 5 years will force a 10 - 20 GWe reduction of the operational nuclear power capacity .
We can thus conclude Part I : Nuclear Fission Energy Today , with the statement that publicly available official data are inconsistent with the widespread belief that the world is in a " Nuclear Energy Renaissance " phase .
In reality , the data about uranium mining and the large number of aging nuclear reactors indicate that the trend of a 1 % annual decrease of fission produced TWhe will continue at least up until 2015 .
In fact , the increasingly serious uranium supply situation might even lead to a forced nuclear shutdown of perhaps 5 % of the world - wide reactors , most likely in countries without sufficient domestic uranium mining and enrichment facilities .
Such a result would certainly end the widespread belief in a bright future for nuclear fission energy .

Sprengstoff im eigenen Körper Experten fürchten neue Bomben - Methode von Terroristen
Wie konnte ein Selbstmordattentäter bis ins Büro eines saudischen Prinzen vordringen ?
Das Opfer überlebte den Anschlag leicht verletzt - doch die nun aufgedeckte Methode des Angreifers bereitet Terrorexperten Sorgen : Der Mann trug die Bombe in seinem Körper .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Najibullah Zazi , a Colorado resident and Afghan national questioned in an alleged terrorist plot in the United States , declined to attend a fourth day of interviews with the FBI , his attorney 's publicist told CNN on Saturday .
A lawyer for Najibullah Zazi disputes claims that bomb - making plans were found on his client 's computer .
No other details were available from attorney Arthur Folsom 's office , though a statement was expected later Saturday .
The federal terror probe that snagged Zazi began in Denver , Colorado , and expanded to New York , where authorities Saturday confirmed that they searched a U - Haul location where a group of Afghan men unsuccessfully tried to rent a large truck this month .
Zazi has admitted to having ties to al Qaeda , an administration official familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday , but has not been arrested or charged .
Either a plea deal or charges are possible for Zazi , the official said .
The alleged terrorist plot , which came to light this week after raids in New York , may have been targeting a major transportation center , like a large railroad or subway station , sources close to the investigation told CNN on Thursday .
Watch the latest on investigation into alleged terror attack »
There were plans for an attack , presumably in the New York area , where crowds are large and security screening for nonairport travelers is lax , the sources said .
The investigation in New York has led authorities to a U - Haul location in the New York City borough of Queens , where the men allegedly tried to rent the truck .
A former counterterrorism official familiar with the investigation said that the group of Afghans tried to rent the truck September 9 , but were unsuccessful after three different credit cards they attempted to use were declined .
The men , who held driver 's licenses from Florida and Ohio , also were unable to use cash for the rental , the official said .
The FBI searched the U - Haul location Thursday , the official said .
U - Haul spokeswoman Joanne Fried confirmed the search and said the company is cooperating with the investigation .
U - Haul staff identified one of the Afghans to the FBI as Naiz Khan , the former counterterrorism official said .
Khan , whose apartment was raided by authorities earlier this week , had given Zazi a place to stay last weekend .
Watch more about the U - Haul location and the men being investigated »
In a CNN interview Saturday , Khan denied that he was at the U - Haul store and said he had no knowledge of a plot .
Khan said he does n't know about any ties Zazi had to terrorism , saying that he only knew Zazi from a mosque in Queens .
Khan , 26 , said he runs a coffee cart for a living six days a week .
Khan was prepared to leave the country Saturday to visit his wife in Pakistan for four months , he told CNN , but decided to postpone the trip until the issue is resolved .
" While DHS and FBI have no information regarding the timing , location or target of any planned attack , we believe it is prudent to remind transit authorities to remain vigilant , " the Department of Homeland Security said Friday in a written statement .
Two sources familiar with the investigation said that Zazi had video of New York 's Grand Central Terminal , a massive junction of rail and subway lines , as well as shops and restaurants , which see an average of more than a half - million visitors per day .
A former counterterrorism official said backpacks , computers and maps were found during searches in Queens , and field tests turned up positive for explosives .
But such tests often yield false positives , and the former official was unaware whether more definitive test results had been obtained .
On Wednesday , federal agents searched Zazi's apartment in Denver and another home in a Denver suburb in connection with the investigation .
A law enforcement official told CNN that diagrams showing how to make bombs were found on the computer that Zazi had with him when he was stopped in New York during a recent visit , but his lawyer , Folsom , denied that was true .
" There 's no diagram of a bomb ; there 's no information like that , " Folsom told reporters Thursday as he accompanied his client to his second meeting with federal agents .
Had that been the case , he asked , " Do you really think the FBI would have allowed us to walk out of here last night ? "
Zazi has no ties to terrorism , Folsom said .
He suggested that Zazi may have drawn investigators ' attention " because he stayed at a house owned by an old friend of his who was under observation from the FBI . "
Folsom said Zazi stayed in an apartment that was raided after he had driven from Denver to New York on business .
Sources close to the investigation told CNN that the Queens raids were spurred by a confluence of events in the city , including the upcoming U.N. General Assembly session and President Obama 's Wall Street speech on Monday .
Law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation said the Colorado searches were part of a probe that began with Zazi and led to New York .
Zazi has driven limousines for First ABC Transportation in suburban Aurora , near Denver International Airport , for about six months , according to a worker who answered the phone at the company .
The man , who identified himself only as " Joe , " said he was startled to hear Zazi was under investigation .
He said Zazi was a hard - working man who was single - handedly supporting his family .
" He is a young , nerdy , kind of good kid -- nothing to do with religious or anything , " the man said .
" He is a kid . "
Joe said co-workers called Zazi " the bearded one " in a lighthearted way .
When he heard that Zazi might be associated with a bomb plot , he said , " I was literally laughing . "
" I agree with his lawyer he has nothing to do with that kind of stuff .
His character is much better than that , " Joe said .
The case began with a tip from a New York police informant and led to FBI wiretaps to develop the case , the former counterterrorism official said .
Agents launched the raids after police stopped Zazi on the George Washington Bridge during a recent visit to New York City , raising concerns that he would figure out he was under surveillance , the former official told CNN .
FBI Director Robert Mueller told a Senate committee Wednesday that he did not think the investigation had revealed any " imminent danger . "
Resources devoted to the investigation include the placement of a hostage rescue team in New York for possible raids and the deployment of resources to the Denver area in Colorado , where another phase of the probe is taking place , the sources said .
CNN 's Deb Feyerick , Kiran Khalid and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report .

History is a funny sort of thing .
As humans , we often take an extremely complex event and filter the information from that event that best captures the story in our minds .
As a result of the limited nature of the human brain , often fascinating and / or critical information is lost .
In this list , I wanted to capture some of the often overlooked and under - reported information surrounding major historical events .
This list is in no way definitive and somewhat U.S. - centric .
It would be great to see future lists that cover the topic in respect to other countries .
10 Man on the Moon
While the moon landing may be the single most remembered event in the history of mankind and President John Kennedy , as the man who championed and led this accomplishment , often forgotten is Kennedy ’s true motive for the daunting task .
In a conversation with James Webb , the director of NASA at the time , Kennedy was quoted as saying , “ Everything we do ought to really be tied into getting on to the Moon ahead of the Russians [… ] otherwise we should n’t be spending that kind of money , because I ’m not interested in space [ … ]
The only justification for [ the cost ] is because we hope to beat [ the USSR ] to demonstrate that instead of being behind by a couple of years , by God , we passed them . ”
Due to this passion to push the U.S. past the Soviets , Kennedy essentially diverted all of NASA ’s funds to the moon landing , much to the dismay of Webb , who favored a broader approach of discovery and programs .
9 Mass suicide at Jonestown
Due to the powerful images conjured up while recalling the horrific incident in Jonestown that saw 900 + men , women and children die through suicide or murder , the world often only remembers the victims that were actually in the compound itself and forgets the victims that tried to flee with Congressman Leo Ryan , who was there to determine whether or not U.S. citizens were being held against their will .
The day before the mass suicide , Ryan and other U.S. government officials landed in Guyana .
During their visit , many of the cult members asked to leave with Ryan ’s delegations .
Arriving at the airport , the delegation was ambushed by the cult , one of who had embedded himself into the group asking to leave .
The embedded cult member drew a gun on the plane and summarily shot the passengers .
Additionally , the cult disbanded a small force and attacked the delegation from a tractor with a trailer .
Congressman Ryan was one of those murdered , becoming the first and only U.S. Congressman killed in the line of duty in the history of the U.S .

When U.S. history recalls Japan in WWII , it often only remembers the mushroom clouds that scarred Japan ’s physical geography and overlooks the strong psychological moorings that were devastated after the surrender .
Following the surrender of Japan , U.S. General MacCarthur forced Hirohito to issue the , “ Humanity Declaration , ” or the Ningen - sengen .
In the declaration , the Emperor proclaimed that in fact and contrary to the Shinto religion , which the culture at the time was largely built upon , he was not a god .
Interestingly however , the confession was given in an archaic , court form of Japanese allowing the Emperor to be deliberately vague .
It is theorized that he substituted the much more common word , “ arahitogami ” or “ living god ” , with the much more unique word “ akitsumikami , ” meaning an , “ incarnation of god . ”
Many scholars have noted that one could be a living god , without being an incarnation of god .
7 The terrorist attacks of 9/11
Again , because of the sensational images of the two , 110 - story Twin Towers of the World Trade Center falling , many people forget the overall tremendous devastation that the acts truly resulted in .
On 9/11 , in addition to the Twin Towers - 7 World Trade Center ( 47 - stories tall ) , 6 World Trade Center ( 8 - stories tall ) , 3 World Trade Center and the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church were all completely destroyed , the latter entirely buried by debris of Tower 2 .
Also , 5 World Trade Center ( 9 - stories tall ) , 4 World Trade Center ( 9 - stories tall ) , the Deutsche Bank Building ( 40 - stories tall ) , and Manhattan Community College ’s Filterman Hall ( 15 - stories tall ) were all damaged beyond repair and have been or are slated for demolition .
6 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
Immediately following the 2004 Tsunami , the world was so rocked with the staggering death toll of nearly 240,000 individuals that it is often forgotten that many of the more rural and traditional citizens were able to survive through an indigenous understanding of the signs of an incoming tsunami .
For example , scientists in the area initially were convinced that the aboriginal population of the Andaman Islands would be significantly ravaged by the tsunami , however , all but one of the tribes in the islands ( oddly enough , the one that had largely converted to Christianity and thus , a change of lifestyle , ) suffered only minor casualties .
When questioned , the tribesmen explained to the scientists that the land and ocean often fought over boundaries and when the earth shook they knew that the sea would soon enter the land until the two could realign their borders .
Because of this , the villagers fled to the hills and suffered little or no casualties .
Additionally of note is the story of Tilly Smith , a 10 - year - old British student vacationing on Mikakhao Beach in Thailand .
Tilly , had recently studied tsunamis in school and immediately recognized the frothing bubbles and receding ocean as a harbinger of a tsunami .
Along with her parents , they warned the beach and it was entirely evacuated safely .
5 The Bobby Kennedy Assassination
While nearly everyone can name the place ( The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles ) and perpetrator of the assassination ( Sirhan Sirhan ) , few people recall the man who captured and disarmed the gunman .
That man was Rosie Grier , an American Football sensation ( Super Bowl Champion , 2 time pro-bowler , member of the Ram ’s “ Fearsome Foursome , ” and 5 time All Pro defensive tackle . )
On the night of the assassination , Grier was the bodyguard for Kennedy ’s pregnant wife .
Along with Rafer Johnson , an Olympic gold medal decathlete , Grier heard the shots and tackled Sirhan .
Grier , then jammed his finger behind the trigger of the gun and broke Sirhan ’s arm .
Grier then fought off those that were literally ready to rip Sirhan apart .
Later Grier , would explain that , “ I would not allow more violence . ”
Additionally , Grier would later testify to Judge Lance Ito during the O.J. Simpson trial that he had been present when O.J. confessed to the crimes in prison .
Judge Ito however , ruled that the testimony was inadmissible .
4 The Moscow Theatre Massacre
When the news broke that the Russian military had ended the standoff where 850 people were held hostage by a Chechen separatist group in Moscow , the focus of the news quickly turned to the dramatic rescue .
Due to this , the heroism and sacrifice of Olga Romanova , is often overlooked .
When Romanova , a 26 year - old perfume - shop clerk , heard of the crisis , she left the safety of her parent ’s house and walked to the Theatre alone .
Convinced that she could reason with the terrorists and at the very least convince them to free the women and children , Romanova somehow managed to bypass the intense security in the area and enter the theatre .
She then confronted the rebels and pleaded for the immediate release of the hostages .
The terrorists , suspecting that she was FSB , marched her into an adjoining room and executed her with a shot to the head .
3 Kent State Shootings
Due to the iconic photo of a student lying dead and another leaning over his body and weeping , the Kent State Massacre has largely been accepted as a single event that took place in Ohio and resulted in 4 students being killed by the U.S. National Guard .
What is often forgotten about the event is the sheer size and scale of the overall national unrest at the time of the shootings .
Immediately following the shooting and centered on the common sentiment of , “ they ca n’t kill us all , ” 900 college campuses were closed because of violent and non-violent protests .
Also , 100,000 people descended on Washington D.C. , smashing car windows , lighting fires , looting and barricading streets and freeways .
The President of the United States was evacuated to Camp David and the 82nd Airborne was brought in to defend the white house .
Additionally , Nixon organized a special commission to focus solely on campus unrest .
Ray Price , Nixon ’s chief speechwriter was quoted as saying , “ that ’s not student protest , that ’s civil war . ”
Overall , 4,000,000 people took place in the protests .
It was at the time , the only nation wide protest on college campuses .
2 Altamont Free Concert of 1969
When the Altamont Concert is remembered , it is often solely for the Hell ’s Angels providing “ security , ” and the ensuing riot that left an 18 - year old man dead .
According to sources , the Rolling Stones had hired the Hell ’s Angels to keep people off the stage and to escort the Stones through the site .
According to some witnesses , the Angels were hired for $ 500.00 worth of beer .
As the evening went on , the crowd and the Angels got increasingly agitated with one another .
The crowd pressed to the stage and the Angels fought them back .
In the ensuing melee , Meredith Hunter was killed and the death has ever since been remembered as an example of the Angel ’s inherent lawlessness and violence .
However , what is not often remembered is the actual event that spawned the killing .
Meredith Hunter , high on methamphetamine was captured on camera approaching the stage and brandishing a pistol .
In response to the imminent danger , an angel drew a knife and stabbed him .
The act of violence was determined by a judge to be an act of justifiable homicide as the Angel had every reason to believe his life was in jeopardy .
1 The Boston Massacre
The Boston massacre was one of the most critical events that led the colonies of America to revolt against King George III .
While it is well remembered in this fashion , the fates of the British soldiers that fired on the civilians are often forgotten .
In fact , the Captain that was present and 8 of the soldiers were arrested and tried .
What is interesting is that the defender of the soldiers was none other than , John Adams , founding father and future President of the United States .
No lawyer in Boston would take the case and so the court pled with Adams to represent the men .
Although , he was hesitant , he so believed that everyone deserved a fair trial that he finally relented .
Adams successfully convinced the jury that 6 of the men were afraid for their life and therefore , had the right to defend themselves .
Interestingly , two of the men were convicted of murder , however , Adams presented a loophole to the court whereby according to English law , if the men could read then they could claim to be clergy and thereby were not bound by secular law .
Adams had the men read out - loud from the Bible and the charges were reduced to manslaughter for which they were punished by a branding on the thumb .

During the second EVA of the Apollo 14 mission on the moon , astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell had a goal of hiking to the rim of nearby Cone Crater in the Fra Maura highlands .
But the steep terrain made the going difficult , elevating the astronauts ’ heart rates .
Additionally , without landmarks it was difficult to judge distances and the rolling terrain was filled with similar - looking ridges , so Shepard and Mitchell could n’t really tell if they were close to the rim or not .
Realizing time and available oxygen were getting short , Mission Control told the astronauts to head back to the Lunar Module , and although disappointed , the astronauts agreed .
But how close did they actually come to the crater ?
No one knew for sure , until now .
One of the latest images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter shows new details of the Apollo 14 landing site .
If you look closely at the image above , visible are the tracks from the astronauts steps and their three - wheeled MET cart , and you can clearly follow the trail of the astronauts on their “ radial traverse . ”
Click the image for larger version if you ’re having trouble seeing the tracks .
Their tracks stop just 30 meters short of the rim , near a dark spot just to the lower left of the crater , which might be Saddle Rock , shown in the image below .
Shepard and Mitchell never realized just how close they really were .
On the LROC ( Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera ) website , Samuel Lawrence notes that more and different detail is visible on this image as opposed to the initial images released prior to the Apollo 11 anniversary in July because the lighting is different .
“ This time the Sun is 24 degrees higher above the horizon providing a clearer view with fewer shadows .
Albedo contrasts are greater , and more clearly show soil disturbances from landing , astronaut surface operations , and blast off . ”
Lawrence notes how the term “ radial traverse ” does not quite do the crew of Apollo 14 justice .
“ Their journey sounds like a stroll in the park , however the reality is quite the contrary .
The hike up Cone crater was quite challenging .
For the first time , astronauts traveled out of the sight of their lunar module while hiking uphill over 1400 meters with only a poor map , dragging the tool cart ( MET ) , and wearing their bulky spacesuits .
It was an amazing feat that the two astronauts made it to the top of Cone ridge and acquired all their samples .
They ended up about 30 meters shy of peering into Cone crater itself , surely a disappointment at the time , but absolutely no reflection on the success of the traverse and the scientific results gleaned after the mission . ”
Here ’s an annotated video of the Apollo 14 landing site .

Applied Materials is one of the most important U.S. companies you ’ve probably never heard of .
It makes the machines that make the microchips that go inside your computer .
The chip business , though , is volatile , so in 2004 Mike Splinter , Applied Materials ’s C.E.O. , decided to add a new business line to take advantage of the company ’s nanotechnology capabilities  making the machines that make solar panels .
The other day , Splinter gave me a tour of the company ’s Silicon Valley facility , culminating with a visit to its “ war room , ” where Applied maintains a real - time global interaction with all 14 solar panel factories it ’s built around the world in the last two years .
I could only laugh because crying would have been too embarrassing .
Not a single one is in America .
Let ’s see : five are in Germany , four are in China , one is in Spain , one is in India , one is in Italy , one is in Taiwan and one is even in Abu Dhabi .
I suggested a new company motto for Applied Materials ’s solar business : “ Invented here , sold there . ”
The reason that all these other countries are building solar - panel industries today is because most of their governments have put in place the three prerequisites for growing a renewable energy industry : 1 ) any business or homeowner can generate solar energy ; 2 ) if they decide to do so , the power utility has to connect them to the grid ; and 3 ) the utility has to buy the power for a predictable period at a price that is a no - brainer good deal for the family or business putting the solar panels on their rooftop .
Regulatory , price and connectivity certainty , that is what Germany put in place , and that explains why Germany now generates almost half the solar power in the world today and , as a byproduct , is making itself the world - center for solar research , engineering , manufacturing and installation .
With more than 50,000 new jobs , the renewable energy industry in Germany is now second only to its auto industry .
One thing that has never existed in America  with our fragmented , stop - start solar subsidies  is certainty of price , connectivity and regulation on a national basis .
Mr Powell had known Johnstone for 20 years before the attack A woman who killed a frail pensioner by stabbing him 18 times with scissors at his home has been jailed for 11 years .
Henrietta Johnstone , 33 , carried out the frenzied attack on 67 - year - old Andrew Powell in the Roystonhill area of Glasgow in January .
She claimed he had tried to rape her and she had acted in self defence .
Johnstone was originally charged with murder but was found guilty of culpable homicide at the High Court in Glasgow last month .
The court heard how 67 - year - old Mr Powell , who was also known as Steven , had come to the UK in the 1960s and stayed in London before finally settling in Scotland .
He had known Johnstone for 20 years before the fatal attack on 11 January .
I accept that you claim you acted in self - defence , but the jury rejected that and convicted you of a violent attack on a frail old man
Marlene Severin
Temporary judge John Morris QC
On the night he was killed , Johnstone and another of his friends , Josie Kenzie , had been in his flat in Rosemount Terrace .
The court heard how Ms Kenzie left after a row with Mr Powell .
She returned to the flat the next day but was unable to get an answer .
Ms Kenzie tried for two more days before eventually speaking to Johnstone , who she knew as Rita .
Johnstone reassured her that Mr Powell was fine but she eventually called the police on 17 January .
Mr Powell 's body was discovered in his living room .
He was clutching a pair of scissors in his right hand .
Rape claim
It was later found that he had been stabbed up to 18 times with one blow penetrating his skull .
Police later arrested Johnstone , who denied attacking Mr Powell .
However , during the trial she admitted striking him after claiming that he tried to rape her .
This claim was dismissed by a jury at the High Court in Glasgow .
Passing sentence , temporary judge John Morris QC told Johnstone : " I accept that you claim you acted in self - defence , but the jury rejected that and convicted you of a violent attack on a frail old man .
" For that you will go to jail for 11 years . "

One of the best ways to learn a programming language is to practice .
People new to Perl can either make up a new project for themselves or can get involved in an existing open source project .
So which projects would you recommend for newbies ?
How can they get involved ?
I heard a lot about the DreamWidth development community to be very beginner friendly so I joined them to learn how are they doing it .
So far I cannot really recommend that for newbies .
While the people are really very friendly the code base they inherited from LiveJournal has all the marks of the last 12 years on it .
I do n't think this is something I 'd want newbies to see .
Maybe in a few months it can be cleaned up .
Padre , the Perl IDE .
I would love to see newbies get involved in the development of either core Padre or some of the plugins .
Thanks to some of the other developers in the project the code is relatively well organized though there are lots of places for improvement .
People are friendly in the project but I think our project does not yet have real facilities to help newbies .
Also the documentation of wxPerl is very lacking , another thing that makes it difficult for newbies to get started .
I just asked on our mailing list how to improve the situation so I hope we will make our project more accessible for beginner contributors .
Also we 'll follow up on the ideas listed in Improving the Padre experience .
What projects could you recommend for newbies ?
How can we make more projects accessible to newbies ?

Opening one envelope tells you more than you might think .
Random switching based on the value of the envelope can help a player win more money in the long run .
Image credit : Wikimedia Commons .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers from Australia have taken a step toward resolving a seemingly simple yet unsolved paradox known as the " two - envelope " problem .
They ’ve worked out a new strategy that can enable a player to beat the game in terms of increasing their payoff .
The strategy could have applications in optimizing gains in investments and other areas .
Mark McDonnell of the University of South Australia and Derek Abbott of the University of Adelaide have published their results in a recent issue of Proceedings of the Royal Society A .
The Paradox
In the two - envelope paradox , a player must choose between two envelopes , one of which contains twice as much money as the other .
The player can open the envelope they choose , and then they have the option of switching envelopes .
The other envelope , of course , has either twice the money or half the money as the first envelope , but the player does not know which .
It may seem that , since a player has a 50 - 50 chance of choosing either envelope , they have an equal chance of gaining or losing money whether they decide to switch or keep the original envelope .
However , probability theory seems to confusingly show that it ’s always better to switch .
For example , say the first envelope you pick has $ 10 , so that the other envelope has either $ 20 or $ 5 .
Then you can calculate the expected value ( i.e. the probability - weighted sum of the possible values ) of the second envelope , assuming that each possibility has a 50 % chance : ( 0.5 x $ 5 ) + ( 0.5 x $ 20 ) = $ 12.50 .
Since $ 12.50 is more than $ 10 , it makes sense to switch .
No matter which numbers you use , you always get an expected value for envelope two that is 5 / 4 higher than the value for the original envelope : if c is the value of the original envelope , the expected value of the second envelope is ( 0.5 x [ 0.5 c ] ) + ( 0.5 x [ 2 c ] ) = 5/4 c .
The mathematical difference is determined by the relations between the envelopes ’ values , but it still does n’t make sense to switch every time , since it could be argued that a player could have started out with the second envelope in the first place - yet still be advised to switch .
Mathematicians have been trying to figure out the problem ( or some variation of it ) since 1930 , though it was not expressed in the two - envelope format until 1988 by Harvard mathematics professor Sandy Zabell .
Though several researchers have claimed to have found solutions to the paradox , no consensus has been reached and so the problem is still considered unsolved .
Randomized Switching
Perhaps , as McDonnell and Abbott suggest , the key to the paradox may occur when the player looks inside the first envelope ; knowing this information breaks the symmetry , since the envelopes are not identical anymore .
To demonstrate this idea , the researchers have worked out a formula that can increase a player ’s chance of picking the envelope with the greater amount of money , if played repeatedly .
The researchers named the new method Cover ’s strategy , since it originated with a suggestion by Stanford engineering professor Tom Cover during lunch .
In the strategy , a player randomly switches envelopes with a probability that depends on the amount of money in the first envelope .
The larger the amount , the less likely it is that a player should switch , even without knowing how high or low the values might be ( the distribution ) .
Over 20,000 simulations , this strategy increased a player ’s payoff compared with simple switching .
The researchers also found that a deterministic switching strategy - where a player switches whenever the value of the first envelope is smaller than some predetermined threshold - also leads to a gain compared with never switching .
“ The apparent paradox arose before because it did n't seem to make sense that opening an envelope and seeing $ 10 actually tells you anything , and therefore it seemed strange that your expected value of winning is $ 12.50 by switching , ” Abbott told PhysOrg.com .
“ But we resolve this by explaining it in terms of symmetry breaking .
Before the envelopes are opened , the situation is symmetrical , so it does n't matter if you switch envelopes or not .
However , once you open an envelope and use Cover 's strategy , you break that symmetry , and then switching envelopes helps you in the long run ( with multiple plays of the game ) . ”
The researchers explained that the strategy emerges from recent advances in two - state switching phenomena that are emerging in the fields of physics , engineering , and economics .
For example , in stochastic control theory , random switching between two unstable states can result in a stable condition .
“ When I had lunch with Tom Cover in 2003 and he suggested that his strategy ought to work , I thought he was nuts and refused to believe it , ” Abbott said .
“ It was that counterintuitive that I thought it was crazy .
But I went back to Australia and slowly came around to Cover 's viewpoint after careful thought over the years .
My expertise in Brownian ratchets was the key to me understanding the physical picture behind it . ”
As Abbott explained , a Brownian ratchet is a physical device that can organize random particles to flow in a particular direction .
“ The trick with a Brownian ratchet is that again it uses the idea of breaking symmetry , ” he said .
“ It is this idea that is behind the principle of the well - known ‘ Parrondo 's paradox , ’ which shows that you can mix two losing games and yet win .
This solution to the two - envelope problem is a breakthrough in the field of Parrondo 's paradox . ”
Winning While Losing
Although a player can use the random switching strategy to win money when having prior knowledge of the statistical distribution of the envelopes ’ values , the significant point is that this knowledge is n’t necessary .
“ What is surprising is that our analysis shows that you can always improve your gain using Cover 's method with ignorance of the ‘ house limit ’ ( the highest value of money allowed ) and of the statistical distribution the numbers obey , ” Abbott said .
“ That is rather amazing .
And the reason it is of importance is that engineers often have to consider what are called ‘ blind optimization ’ problems .
And so our solution may stimulate new work in this area . ”
Another type of optimization method that shares similarities with the two - envelope problem is financial investing in the stock market .
For instance , in " volatility pumping , " switching between poor investments can result in winning an exponentially increasing amount of money .
“ Volatility pumping is a ‘ toy model ’ that you can't use exactly in its present form on the stock market , ” Abbott explained .
“ However , it is a toy model that illustrates underlying mechanisms that are useful .
It suggests the power of changing your portfolio of stocks periodically , buying low and selling high .
Both the two - envelope process plus volatility pumping appear closely related to Brownian ratchet phenomena .
They both exploit the interaction of asymmetry with randomness . ”
This insight also brings with it a number of open questions .
For example , when playing a sequence of games , a player could modify the details of the strategy by continually updating the estimated distribution from which the envelopes ’ values are chosen .
Also , since the strategy relates to two - state switching in other fields , perhaps it may be possible to explain all these phenomena with a common mathematical framework .

Recently , a few series of previously unknown Soviet Russian comics books came to the daylight .
Here are the covers of some of them .
The first one is “ Chekists ” or if to translate it something like “ Special Security Agents ” .
“ … In 1918 the new Special Agents comics series appeared and gained huge popularity .
The violence level increased with each next edition , and eventually every page had scenes of murders in it . ”
“.. Just a few years later , in 1922 a new comics was even more popular .
It was telling stories about the life of young TroTro .
The last series took place in Mexico ” .
Here , there are parallels with Mr. Trotsky – Russian politic , former Communist who fled from Russia to Mexico and later was slabbed with a hammer there by Soviet special agent .
“ … In the end of 1920s publishers try to gain interest from rural Soviet citizens making new series like The Communal Farmer and The World of Future .
The stories of those books take place in future , in year 2000 , when every Soviet farmer could enjoy benefits of the Communism . ” .
Including those ten feet tall rural robots .
In 1940s the urge for violent content has sprang again .
The series about the adventures of the Farmer Man was put on hold and it was replaced by this new “ The Invincible Red Bear vs. Invaders ” .
The first edition came out in 1941 and they were pretty popular for a few years , but after 1945 their ratings got low , until they were discontinued at all . ”
“ … In 1961 the new , Gagarin comics series appeared opening new Sci - Fi niche in Soviet comics industry . ”
“ … In 1980s Soviet people have completely lost the interest in the old heroes , and publishers could n’t come up with something new , except this “ The Mutant Pioneers ” series which did n’t last long . ”
“ The last one was “ Gorbert ” .
The story of Soviet comics ends on it ” .
It was associated with Gorbachev .
“ Then the Era of totally new comics has begun ” .
Well , the comments here come from original artists who created this stuff .
Intel has begun producing 32 - nm " Westmere " chips , the focus of the company 's Intel Developer Forum in two weeks .
New transistor enhancements are also planned .
Intel has begun producing 32 - nm " Westmere " chips , the focus of the company 's Intel Developer Forum in two weeks .
Intel plans to announce on Sunday night that is has begun manufacturing its 32 - nm shrink of its
Core microprocessor line , which the company refers to by the umbrella code name of " Westmere " .
Those chips will be spearheaded by the so - called " Dales " chips -- " Clarkdale " for the desktop , and " Arrandale " for the notebook -- which will contain an Intel CPU and graphics core together in the same package .
Arrandale is expected to ship during the fourth quarter of 2009 .
Intel is also expected to announce that its has developed a system - on - chip technology to complement its CPU efforts , leading to improved versions of its SoC efforts for the consumer , commercial , communications , and other markets .
In addition , Intel plans to announce new transistor improvements .
The Intel Developer Forum will begin on Sept. 14 in San Francisco , a frequent venue for what Intel refers to as its " geekfest " .
Intel plans to host 5,000 developers , technologists , and journalists , laying out its vision for 2010 and especially the all - important holiday season .
Intel tipped those holiday plans long ago , at the Hot Chips conference , and , most likely the last major 45 - nm update for the desktop PC .
( Clarksfield , a 45 - nm mobile chip , is expected to be announced at IDF . )
Eventually , Intel will manufacture Larrabee , a chip architecture that puts both capabilities on the same die .
More about Larrabee is expected at IDF .
Still , the combination of a CPU and graphics inside the main microprocessor package may put pressure on rival AMD , which has begun obliquely addressing Arrandale and Clarkdale , which addresses what a laptop equipped with a CPU can achieve .
The combination should also cut power , a design feature Intel has addressed with its HUGI ( Hurry Up and Get Idle " ) design mantra .
Intel will also talk about a new second - generation high - k+ metal gate transistor formula , which will give Intel " a 3 + year advantage in addressing leaky and energy inefficient transistors , " according to a blog post from Intel spokesman Bill Kircos .
Intel has shipped more than 200 million 45 nm CPUs using high - k+ metal gate transistors , Kircos will say .
The emphasis on improved transistor manufacturing will be evidenced in the first keynote by Bob Baker , Intel 's vice president of manufacturing , who will join Intel chief executive Paul Otellini and IDF fixture Pat Gelsinger on stage on Tuesday , Sept. 14 .
On Wednesday , executive vice president Dadi Perlmutter will provide an update on Intel 's mobile efforts , followed by Renee James , who will update attendees on Intel 's software efforts , including the .
On Thursday , senior vice president Eric Kim and vice president Justin Rattner will update attendees on Sodaville and other system - on - chip efforts , plus more on the future of TV .

Tests have revealed Caster Semenya 's testosterone level to be three times higher than those normally expected in a female sample , BBC Sport understands .
Analysis prior to the World Athletics Championships coupled with her rapid improvement prompted calls for a gender test from the sport 's governing body .
News of the test was made public just hours before the 18 - year - old South African won 800 m gold in Berlin .
A high level of testosterone does not always equate to a failed drugs test .
But the news will only increase speculation surrounding Semenya , who arrived back in South Africa to a rapturous welcome on Tuesday .

Hundreds turned out in Johannesburg to greet the teenager , who has stunned the athletics world with her performances this season .
She ran a time of one minute , 56.72 seconds in Bambous in July to smash her previous personal best by more than seven seconds .
She also broke Zola Budd 's long - standing South African record and arrived at the World Championships as the newly crowned African junior champion .
Then in Berlin she left her rivals trailing to win gold in a time of 1:55.45 .
Janeth Jepkosgei was second , a massive 2.45 seconds adrift , with Britain 's Jenny Meadows taking the bronze medal .
Only hours before the race , it leaked out that the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) had demanded Semenya take a gender test amid fears she should not be allowed to run as a woman .
It has since emerged that news of the test only became public knowledge because a fax was sent to the wrong person .
Caster is like my child .
I know where she comes from .
For myself , I know Caster is a girl
Semenya 's uncle
It has also been revealed that following the findings of initial tests , the South Africans were asked by the IAAF to withdraw her from the team at the World Championships .
Since then , both her family and South African athletics chiefs have leapt to her defence , insisting she is 100 % female .
" Caster is a girl .
I am not worried about that too much , " said her uncle on her arrival back in South Africa .
" Caster is like my child .
I know where she comes from .
For myself , I know Caster is a girl . "
Leonard Chuene , president of Athletics South Africa ( ASA ) , has resigned from his seat on the IAAF board in protest against the organisation 's treatment of Semenya .
" It will not be fair for me to attack the IAAF as a council member and representative of South Africa .
It is a conflict of interest , " Chuene told BBC's Newshour programme .
Chuene also asked that the issue be laid to rest .
" We have not once , as ASA , doubted her , " he said .
" It 's very simple - she 's a girl .
" We took this child to Poland to the junior championship under the IAAF .
Why was there no story about it ?
She was accepted there .
" No - one said anything there because she did not do anything special .
She is the same girl . "

Testosterone levels can vary widely , which makes it hard to detect possible infractions .
When analysis shows an athlete to have a raised level , they are monitored at regular intervals over a set period to establish what their underlying levels would be .
That is then used as a marker for the future , so any sharp differences immediately stand out as suspicious .
An analysis of Semenya 's testosterone levels was carried out in South Africa and it is understood that this information contributed to the IAAF 's decision to request the ASA carry out a detailed " gender verification " test on the athlete .
Those medical tests are said to be ongoing , with the results not expected for several weeks .
On Sunday , IAAF president Lamine Diack admitted the affair could have been treated with more sensitivity .
" It should not even have become an issue if the confidentiality had been respected , " he said .
" There was a leak of confidentiality at some point and this led to some insensitive reactions . "

The Evans House is the latest edition to the Crestwood Hills neighborhood , a modernist community perched above the Los Angeles valley .
Designed by BittoniDesignStudios , the Evans House was a remodel project of an existing modern home that warranted a contemporary upgrade .
The lot itself is a work of art– Bittoni and crew devised the structure to face the sky , with the rolling clouds and colorful sunsets providing the paint to the home ’s stark white canvas .
As part of the remodel , the architects cut into the ceiling above the kitchen to extend to the top of the second floor .
The goal was to make the kitchen a more social environment , and give the private top level a view down into the home below .
The rest of the home is contemporary and stunning , but instead of describing the details , we ’ll let the pictures do the talking .

Changes in Israeli policy have military rabbis joining combat troops at the tip of the spear .
Ostensibly there to boost morale , critics worry that the rabbis are turning soldiers into Jewish jihadis .
One rabbi says he was ordered to blow a ram ’s horn like Joshua , because “ It makes the war holier . ”
During the Gaza war , the military ’s religious leaders distributed propaganda under the army ’s official seal , casting that conflict in biblical terms .
All this has created an environment more attractive to fundamentalists and less appealing to Israel ’s moderates and secular citizens .
The military is drawing in settlers and zealots and transforming into something that does n’t quite reflect the rest of the country .

Planning a trip to Mars ?
Take plenty of shielding .
According to sensors on NASA ’s ACE ( Advanced Composition Explorer ) spacecraft , galactic cosmic rays have just hit a space - age high .
“ In 2009 , cosmic ray intensities have increased 19 % beyond anything we ’ve seen in the past 50 years , ” says Richard Mewaldt of Caltech .
“ The increase is significant , and it could mean we need to re-think how much radiation shielding astronauts take with them on deep - space missions . ”
The cause of the surge is solar minimum , a deep lull in solar activity that began around 2007 and continues today .
Researchers have long known that cosmic rays go up when solar activity goes down .
Right now solar activity is as weak as it has been in modern times , setting the stage for what Mewaldt calls “ a perfect storm of cosmic rays . ”
“ We ’re experiencing the deepest solar minimum in nearly a century , ” says Dean Pesnell of the Goddard Space Flight Center , “ so it is no surprise that cosmic rays are at record levels for the Space Age . ”
Galactic cosmic rays come from outside the solar system .
They are subatomic particles–mainly protons but also some heavy nuclei–accelerated to almost light speed by distant supernova explosions .
Cosmic rays cause “ air showers ” of secondary particles when they hit Earth ’s atmosphere .
They pose a health hazard to astronauts .
And a single cosmic ray can disable a satellite if it hits an unlucky integrated circuit .
The sun ’s magnetic field is our first line of defense against these highly - charged , energetic particles .
The entire solar system from Mercury to Pluto and beyond is surrounded by a bubble of solar magnetism called “ the heliosphere . ”
It springs from the sun ’s inner magnetic dynamo and is inflated to gargantuan proportions by the solar wind .
When a cosmic ray tries to enter the solar system , it must fight through the heliosphere ’s outer layers ; and if it makes it inside , there is a thicket of magnetic fields waiting to scatter and deflect the intruder .
“ At times of low solar activity , this natural shielding is weakened , and more cosmic rays are able to reach the inner solar system , ” explains Pesnell .
Mewaldt lists three aspects of the current solar minimum that are combining to create the perfect storm :
(1) The sun ’s magnetic field is weak .
“ There has been a sharp decline in the sun ’s interplanetary magnetic field ( IMF ) down to only 4 nanoTesla ( nT ) from typical values of 6 to 8 nT , ” he says .
“ This record - low IMF undoubtedly contributes to the record - high cosmic ray fluxes . ”
(2) The solar wind is flagging .
“ Measurements by the Ulysses spacecraft show that solar wind pressure is at a 50 - year low , ” he continues , “ so the magnetic bubble that protects the solar system is not being inflated as much as usual . ”
A smaller bubble gives cosmic rays a shorter - shot into the solar system .
Once a cosmic ray enters the solar system , it must “ swim upstream ” against the solar wind .
Solar wind speeds have dropped to very low levels in 2008 and 2009 , making it easier than usual for a cosmic ray to proceed .
(3) The current sheet is flattening .
Imagine the sun wearing a ballerina ’s skirt as wide as the entire solar system with an electrical current flowing along the wavy folds .
That is the “ heliospheric current sheet , ” a vast transition zone where the polarity of the sun ’s magnetic field changes from plus ( north ) to minus ( south ) .
The current sheet is important because cosmic rays tend to be guided by its folds .
Lately , the current sheet has been flattening itself out , allowing cosmic rays more direct access to the inner solar system .
“ If the flattening continues as it has in previous solar minima , we could see cosmic ray fluxes jump all the way to 30 % above previous Space Age highs , ” predicts Mewaldt .
Earth is in no great peril from the extra cosmic rays .
The planet ’s atmosphere and magnetic field combine to form a formidable shield against space radiation , protecting humans on the surface .
Indeed , we ’ve weathered storms much worse than this .
Hundreds of years ago , cosmic ray fluxes were at least 200 % higher than they are now .
Researchers know this because when cosmic rays hit the atmosphere , they produce the isotope beryllium - 10 , which is preserved in polar ice .
By examining ice cores , it is possible to estimate cosmic ray fluxes more than a thousand years into the past .
Even with the recent surge , cosmic rays today are much weaker than they have been at times in the past millennium .
“ The space era has so far experienced a time of relatively low cosmic ray activity , ” says Mewaldt .
“ We may now be returning to levels typical of past centuries . ”
NASA spacecraft will continue to monitor the situation as solar minimum unfolds .
Stay tuned for updates .
In spring 2003 , filmmaker James Miller and reporter Saira Shah , following the success of their Peabody - winning films “ Unholy War ” and “ Beneath the Veil , ” set out to take a first - hand look at the culture of hate that permeates the Middle East .
They captured the lives of three Palestinian children growing up in the bullet - riddled streets of Gaza , indoctrinated in the creed of Jihad , and had planned to show the Israeli side next .
But on May 2 , in the midst of filming , Miller was shot to death by an Israeli tank , falling victim to the conflict he covered .
The America Undercover special Death In Gaza tells this tragic , eye - opening story .
Death In Gaza begins in Nablas , where Miller and Shah witness an explosion that kills several Palestinians suspected of being suicide bombers .
“ We ’re trying to understand how people learn to hate so deeply that they ’re prepared to die in order to kill , ” says Shah .
“ So we ’re looking for the next generation , the children who will make either peace or war . ”
In Nablas , that generation is playing dangerous games with the Israelis , as children shower the tanks that patrol their street with rocks , taunting the soldiers inside .

Wipeout HD In - game Ads Nearly Double Load Times ( Updated )
Update : Sony has now pulled the most common video ad , a commercial for State Farm , and vowed to " ensure that any in - game advertising does not affect gameplay . "
Original :
In - game advertisements recently added to Wipeout HD are nearly doubling the load times of some races , Shacknews can confirm .
The video ads , served by advertising firm Double Fusion , occasionally play in a window as a race loads .
Video evidence suggested that load times can last around twice as long when the ads are incorporated , a ratio that Shacknews can corroborate after independent testing .
After selecting a ship , it took us approximately 12 seconds to enter a race .
With the ads playing , the race consistently loaded after around 20 seconds .
The advertisements were added several days ago in an update to the year - old game , but were not mentioned in the patch notes or by Sony .
The first official word of the commercials came from a Double Fusion press release issued today .
" By introducing high - resolution dynamic video ads into Wipeout HD , Double Fusion is responding to advertiser demand and offering an engaging ad format while pushing in - game ad innovation to a new level , " said Double Fusion CEO Jonathan Epstein .
Stoney Knows
How is a visit with a master of the oldest art in the world - Tattooing .
Disabled by rheumatoid arthritis since the age of four , and forced to use a wheelchair , his growth stunted , Stoney St. Clair ( 1912 - 1980 ) joined the circus at 15 as a sword - swallower .
A year later , he learned to tattoo , and for the next 50 years , he continued to work as a tattooist traveling with circus and carnivals across the country .
As we watch him at work , we see the determination which led Stoney to overcome his handicap to heal himself and others with the magic of symbols .
The film ends with a visit by New School master tattoo artist Don Ed Hardy who pays Stoney the highest compliment by asking him for a souvenier tattoo .
For more information on the life of Leonard L. " Stoney " St. Clair , see Alan Govenar , Stoney Knows How : Life as a Sideshow Tattoo Artist " , Schiffer Publishing , 2003 .

Twenty years ago , governments adopted the Montreal protocol , a treaty to protect the Earth 's ozone layer from emissions of destructive chemicals .
Few could have foreseen how far - reaching that decision would prove to be .
The protocol explicitly aimed at phasing out substances such as chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) – found in products such as refrigerators , foams and hairsprays – in order to repair the thin , gassy shield that filters out the sun 's harmful ultraviolet rays .
By 2010 , close to 100 ozone - depleting substances , including CFCs , will have been phased out globally .
Without the decisions taken 20 years ago , atmospheric levels of ozone - depleting substances would have increased tenfold by 2050 .
This could have led to up to 20 m additional cases of skin cancer and 130 m more cases of eye cataracts , not to speak of damage to human immune systems , wildlife and agriculture .
But this is only part of the story that we celebrate on the international day for the preservation of the ozone layer ( 16 September ) .
Over the past two years , it has been established that the Montreal protocol has also spared humanity a significant level of climate change , because the gases it prohibits also contribute to global warming .
Indeed , a study in 2007 calculated the climate mitigation benefits of the ozone treaty as totalling the equivalent of 135bn tonnes of C02 since 1990 , or a delay in global warming of seven - 12 years .
So the lessons learned from the Montreal protocol may have wider significance .
Scientists now estimate that somewhere close to 50 % of climate change is being caused by gases and pollutants other than C02 , including nitrogen compounds , low - level ozone formed by pollution , and black carbon .
Of course , a degree of scientific uncertainty remains about some of these pollutants ' precise contribution to warming .
But they certainly play a significant role .
Meanwhile , many of these gases need to be curbed because of their wider environmental impact on public health , agriculture and the planet 's ecosystems , including forests .
Consider black carbon .
A component of the soot emissions from diesel engines and the inefficient burning of biomass cooking stoves , it is linked to 1.6 m - 1.8 million premature deaths annually as a result of indoor exposure and 800,000 from outdoor exposure .
Black carbon , which absorbs heat from the sun , also accounts for anywhere from 10 % to 45 % of the contribution to global warming , and is linked to accelerated losses of glaciers in Asia , because the soot deposits darken ice and make it more vulnerable to melting .
One study estimates 26 % of black carbon emissions come from stoves for heating and cooking , with more than 40 % of this amount from wood burning , roughly 20 % from coal , 19 % from crop residues and 10 % from dung .
Some companies have developed stoves that use passive air flows , better insulation and 60 % less wood to reduce black carbon emissions by around 70 % .
Mass introduction of such stoves could deliver multiple green - economy benefits .
While CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for centuries , other pollutants , including black carbon and ozone , remain for relatively short periods – days , weeks , months or years – so that reducing or ending emissions promises almost immediate climate benefits .
The international community 's overarching concern must be to seal a serious and significant deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December to curtail CO2 emissions and assist vulnerable countries to adapt .
If the world also is to deploy all available means to combat climate change , emissions of all the substances that contribute to it must be scientifically evaluated and urgently addressed .

Natalie Portman perches on a stool at the counter of a vegan restaurant in downtown Manhattan , nibbling on a soy - cheese sandwich and minding her own business .
The same cannot be said of her fellow patrons , two of whom grin smugly , imagining they go undetected snapping pictures of her -- still in full makeup from a photo shoot and wrapped in a trench coat -- with their cellphones .
Hanging by the counter behind Portman is framed testimony of how often this occurs : A paparazzi shot of the 28 - year - old pixie , who is holding a bottle of the restaurant ’s juice while her dog mistakes her leg for a fire hydrant .
Portman ’s ability to elegantly ignore this kind of attention -- first garnered for her debut in “ The Professional ” at the age of 12 and reaching mania during the second “ Star Wars ” trilogy -- is about to be sorely tested .
This year , she has a spate of films that any actress her age would be delighted to accumulate over a lifetime .
First up on Friday is “ New York , I Love You , ” a series of intertwining short films , one of which Portman wrote and directed , in which a father shepherds a child through the park and is mistaken for a nanny .
She also stars in a segment directed by Mira Nair , playing an Orthodox Jew who connects with an Indian jewelry dealer as they exchange cultural stories .
Don Roos ’ drama “ Love and Other Impossible Pursuits , ” which showed at the Toronto International Film Festival , will follow , and on Dec. 4 , she will be seen opposite Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal in Jim Sheridan ’s “ Brothers . ”
And that ’s just the beginning .
Last spring , she filmed the indie “ Hesher , ” which she also produced , then spent the summer in Belfast on her first comedy , the royal fantasy “ Your Highness , ” before returning to New York for four months of filming Darren Aronofsky ’s “ Black Swan . ”
Finally , she ’ll usher in the spring on the Santa Fe , N.M. , set of “ Thor . ”

After that , “ I will take a nap -- for like , two months , ” she says with a laugh .
“ Right now , I ’m working probably more than is good for me , but sometimes it ’s good to exceed your boundaries and stretch yourself . ”
Despite the disparateness of the projects , they are unified in showing off Portman ’s newfound comfort as a full - fledged adult .
“ Just as what you are feeling in your life affects your acting , what you act in definitely affects what you are feeling in your life , ” she says with typical thoughtfulness .
“ And whether you want it to or not , and even if you do n’t know it , it bleeds into your life .
I made ‘ Heat ’ when I was 14 and played a girl who died , ” she continues .
“ A year later , I got into a fight with my mother and cut myself .
I had never done it before and I never did it after that , but I think having my wrists bloody in a movie definitely affected my psyche . ”

A decade out of the turbulence of adolescence , she ’s now choosing roles in which she can show off her emotional strengths or , as director Sheridan says , that “ she ’s the kind of woman you ’d want flying your plane . ”
In “ Brothers , ” she ’s a young mother grieving for the beloved husband she believes has died in Iraq , while in “ Love and Other Impossible Pursuits , ” she ’s a mother mourning the loss of her days - old infant .
And in “ New York , ” both in the segment she directed and the one in which she is directed by Mira Nair , she explores the universality of love and commitment .
“ At this point , ” says Portman of the parts that appeal to her , “ I want to be a woman on - screen because I want to be a woman in my life .
I do n’t want to be a little girl . ”
Adds Sheridan , “ I thought she was a revelation in ‘ Closer , ’ ” a movie that earned Portman an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe .
“ But she ’s been the Lolita and the sexy ingenue .
Now she ’s grown up , and it ’s understandable she wants to harness that . ”
Casting her as a mother required little faith on the director ’s part , who says , “ She ’s a very strong person , and it ’s immediately apparent .
The weirdest thing is if you ’d look at her , you ’d think she was a technical actor , but she ’s absolutely emotional .
The only help I gave her were technical things like , ‘ Your eyes should be up higher . ’
There are n’t many people in the world like Meryl Streep who can truly inhabit different people , but she can .
I think there ’s a lot going on with Natalie we have n’t seen . ”

Portman would seem to agree .
She recently switched from vegetarianism to veganism after reading Jonathan Safran Foer ’s upcoming nonfiction work , “ Eating Animals , ” and she ’s planning on becoming more vocal on the subject of animal rights .
“ There are certain things you can have different opinions on , but then other things , like torturing animals , [ are ] just wrong , ” she says .
She ’s discussing how to raise international awareness for the importance of girls ’ education with FINCA , a nonprofit microfinance organization for which she has volunteered for six years .
Indeed ,
Nair last met up with her “ New York ” star last summer in Uganda , where Portman was traveling for FINCA and where the director lives half the year .
“ Natalie is a student of the world , and you sense that on - screen , ” Nair says .
“ She has an empathy and an openness that imbue her characters . ”
And on the film front , in addition to her new production company , Handsomecharlie Films , she ’s slowly edging up to the possibility of directing something longer than a short .

“ Working with Mira in New York , I was so thrilled to watch a female director , and you could n’t ask for a better model than her , ” she says .
“ For me , directing is n’t a backup plan , because I really love it .
At the end of the day , it is your product , which you do n’t get when you ’re acting .
Even good performances are pieced together by good directors .
You give plenty of bad takes , and they put it together in the editing room . ”
As for when she might take on that particular challenge , “ I do n’t love saying I ’m going to do something before I do it because I feel like that ’s a formula for hearing , ‘ You never did what you said you were going to , ’ ” she says , “ but I really love directing . ”
And while she admits to some fear of stepping behind the camera and out of her comfort zone , “ that ’s intrinsic to everything you do as a creative person .
You ’re constantly putting yourself up there to be trashed .
If I thought about it too much , I ’d just be crippled .
I ’d rather create . ”

Go to the Tierra home page .
I have translated these texts as my own way of studying Japanese .
I have made them available on my web page primarily for other people studying Japanese ( and also for Japanese people studying English ) , but also for those in the West who may not be familiar with these stories .
However , these stories have , of course , already been translated .
A web search on Japanese Children 's Stories can show you how to get the English editions .
The files present the books , page by page .
Each page begins with the Japanese text , the way it appears in the book , in Japanese characters .
This is followed by a phrase by phrase , or sentence by sentence translation .
Then there is a brief explanation of new vocabulary or grammatical forms that appeared on that page .
The style of the English is a bit rough , in part because I want it to be as much as possible , a literal translation of the Japanese , so that it can aid in learning to read the Japanese .
For those who wish to use the texts to study Japanese , it is useful to have spaces separating the Japanese words .
Because Japanese generaly does not use spaces between words , Netscape displays the Japanese text without spaces .
However , the .html source files have spaces between the words .
I recommend downloading the .html source files , stripping off the html formatting code , and printing the resulting text .
If you do n't know how to display Japanese characters : in Netscape , select the ``Options '' menu , then the ``Language Encoding '' , then ``Japanese ( Auto - Select ) ' ' .
If your browser does n't handle Japanese , you can still read the English translation .

The majority‟s decision to permit bong water to be used to support a first - degree felony controlled - substance charge runs counter to the legislative structure of our drug laws , does not make common sense , and borders on the absurd .
The Judge says the majority 's decision " has the potential to undermine public confidence in our criminal justice system .
Further , he finds the majority 's result to run counter to the legislative structure of the state 's drug laws , which must be read together , in a way to give effect to all its provisions .
Second , I dissent because the decision of Rice County to charge Sara Ruth Peck with a first - degree felony offense — an offense that has a presumptive sentence of 86 months in prison — for possession of two and one - half tablespoons of bong water is not only contrary to the law , it is counterproductive to the purposes of our criminal justice system .
... Rice County‟s decision to charge Peck in a manner far more serious than what was intended by the legislature represents the kind of counterproductive activity that leads unnecessarily to increasing incarceration rates and wasted taxpayer money .
1
I conclude that Rice County‟s actions are not permitted by law , were not intended by the legislature , and do not benefit the citizens of the State of Minnesota .
The majority credited the testimony of Douglas Rauenhorst , a narcotics cop not involved in Peck 's case , who said he had no experience with smoking meth , and acknowledged that users do not ordinarily inhale or ingest bong water when smoking a bong pipe .
He adds , however , that in his experience drug users drink bong water , or shoot it up .
( He also testified in his experience some drug users drink urine . )
The lower courts ruled in Peck 's favor :
Based on the function water serves in bong usage and the fact that the bong water forming the basis of Peck‟s charge was found while still in the bong , Judge Neuville found it “ apparent that the water which was seized by the State was intended to be a part of the bong , or drug paraphernalia . ”
The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the district court , concluding that the weight of the bong water could not be used to sustain a first - degree controlled - substance charge against Peck because the post-use byproduct of a methamphetamine bong is not a mixture .
4
The Judge chides the majority for relying only on dictionary definitions of the words mixture , substance , etc .
He notes how the majority 's conclusion runs counter to the intent of the drug laws :
But if we treat the bong water as paraphernalia , the same defendant would receive a fine of no more than $ 300 dollars and a petty misdemeanor conviction that would not go on his or her criminal record .
The disparity in the severity of the sentence between these two possible charges is enormous .
This enormous disparity in sentencing severity creates ambiguity as to how the legislature intended the drug statutes to apply to the facts of this case .
Finding ambiguity in whether the legislature intended to apply the term “ mixture ” to bong water , he turns to the rules of statutory construction to resolve it .
First , it appears the legislature wanted to impose more significant penalties on serious drug offenders without also imposing those same penalties on minor offenders .
.... Treating bong water as a mixture capable of sustaining a first - degree felony controlled - substance charge does not meet the purposes , aims , or objectives of the legislature when it established the weight - based system .
Bong water is not marketed or sold by dealers , large or small , nor is it purchased by consumers .
It is not even ordinarily consumed .
Bong water is usually discarded when the smoker is finished with consumption of the smoke filtered through the bong water .
A person is not more dangerous , or likely to wreak more havoc , based on the amount of bong water that person possesses .
The bong water is no more dangerous than the bong itself , because both are used to facilitate consumption without being consumed .
Thus , there is no reason to believe the legislature intended to treat the bong water differently from the bong , and there is even less reason to believe that the legislature intended to treat bong water so seriously as to presumptively mandate a more than 7 - year prison sentence for possessing two and one - half tablespoons of bong water .
As stated earlier , I believe this result to be absurd and a threat to public confidence in our criminal justice system .
He adds :
I conclude that it is also unreasonable to interpret our legislature‟s laws as punishing Peck‟s possession of two and one - half tablespoons of bong water as a more serious crime than the possession of 24 grams of cocaine , heroin , or methamphetamine .
Bong water is normally not consumed , and Peck would likely have disposed of it had the police not seized it .
Bottom line :
The majority 's position is indeed silly to the point of absurdity and not only undermines confidence in the state 's drug laws and justice system , it makes a mockery of it .
The bong water was at best , paraphernalia .
There was no evidence presented that this defendant intended to ingest it or shoot it .
The narcotics cop had not participated in the search and had no experience with smoking meth .
Yet , the majority credited his opinion , which was based on his anecdotal experience .
It would be laughable , except it 's possible a woman may do 86 months -- 7 years -- for possession 2.5 tablespoons of bong water .
Thank you to everyone who has e-mailed with kind words about the Saturday - only sci- fi storyline :
Most of you seem to be enjoying it , and that means the world to me .
Regarding that strip : I wanted to address some concerns that are repeated across dozens of e-mails , if that 's OK :
- First off : Lots of you have asked if there could be specific navigation on the site just for these sci- fi strips .
This is a great idea , but it 's trickier than it sounds , based on the way this site is structured .
- Secondly , a lot of you have written in either loving the blue or disliking the blue ... mainly for reasons of screen legibility .
Legibility is a fair concern : Especially on older laptops with ( fading ) screens , or older eyeballs with ( fading ) vision , blues can be tricky .
Personally , I love the * idea * of the blue , and am still tinkering with a finding a blue that 'll give me a great variegation of tones , and yet still allow for sharp , 1 - color printing in the ( eventual ) book .
- Thirdly , I have a longer - term goal of developing a second site solely for this sci - fi strip , where it will appear once a week like the marvelous strip Charles Christopher .
But , two things are conspiring against me at the moment , before I can build the site .
1 . ) A title .
Clearing a strip title through both the USPTO and a ( concise ) URL is proving to be tricky ( as I remember well from my Mattel days ) .
2 . ) Time .
I have a few things on my plate before I have time to design a new site .
The spirit is willing , but the calendar is weak .
So !
The short answers are : Specific Navigation ?
Probably not .
Blue ?
Yes , but with modifications .
New Site ?
Yes , but no time soon .
In the meantime , thanks again for the feedback on the new strip !
I really appreciate it !
A recent study out by Interpret has revealed that the Palm Pre is the second “ smartest ” mobile device on the market .
Second only to the iPhone .
Interpret reveals that despite being massively disadvantaged in the marketplace , Palm managed to nab a huge chunk of mindshare with the Pre — in fact , the report suggests that the Pre is number two only to the iPhone 3GS in the metric .
The study looks at the driving factors behind purchaser ’s decisions to buy a smartphone , narrowing down the list to three major components : belief that the phone is “ smart , ” belief that the phone is “ hip / cool , ” and belief that the phone will make them more productive .
via Engadget
Personally I have tried both phones out , and I like the Pre , but I believe the iPhone has a much sleeker , easy to use interface , and it definetly more a hip , cool , and easy to justify phone .
The Palm Pre on the other hand is probably more geared towards an active business executive who wants more phone and less music and multimedia capability .

“ It is rare that a documentary director has the privilege to shoot a film that , while in production , becomes the greatest story of our time .
The “ worst case scenario ” of January 2008 , when we began work on American Casino , turned into reality in the year that followed .
We were able to follow our characters through Wall Street ’s collapse , foreclosure , bankruptcy , homelessness .
We watched whole neighborhoods ravaged by the subprime meltdown .
I have spent much of my career filming in war zones and post apocalyptic societies — Somalia , Iraq , Afghanistan .
But I never expected such a disaster at home .
To be there , with a camera , while it was happening , telling the story , was certainly the highlight of my career . ” —

The subject of our discourse is ' the school of humanity ' .
The human being who is the only inquisitive being in the world that we know , has always been subjected to investi- gation and discussion .
By : Ayatollah Murtada MutahhariThe word ' humanity ' has always been connected with a sense of loftiness and sanctity as a being superior to animals from various points of view , such as knowledge justice , freedom , moral conscience , etc .
Although many of humani- ty 's sacred objects have been subjected to doubt and even denial , apparently no school of thought has yet gone so far as to scorn the special dignity of humanity and its superiority over other Creatures .
This fact has been elegantly expressed in the poems of Rumi and Sa'adi and by other poets of ours .
This topic is also the theme of most of the world 's literature , both reli- gious and non-religious , in which the question of humanity and its glorification has been described .
In Islamic literature , too , both in Persian and Arabic , we come across many such statements .
In the last two centuries , with the great advance of science , humanity has suddenly fallen from that pedestal of sanctity it had always been given .
It fell with a real crash since the more one is elevated , the greater is the damage Caused by the fall .
In the past , mankind has been ex- acted to the rank of a demi- god as witnessed in the poems of Hafiz and other poets .
The first discovery of humanity was the form of the universe which revolutionized its ideas .
Before that , the earth was believed to be the center of the universe round which all the plants and stars revolved .
Science proved that the earth was a small planet which revolved around the sun and the solar System was only an insignificant part of the universe .
It was then that the position of humanity as the center of all possibilities and as the goal of creation was subjected to doubt and denial , and no one dared any longer to make claims about its exalted position .
Then , another severe blow dealt , was the idea that the human being was no longer a divine creature and vice gerent of God upon the earth was given up .
Biological research on the question of evolution and the origin of species at once showed the relationship of people with those same animals which they Scorned and despised .
It proved them to be an evolved form of a monkey or some other animal and thus they lost their divine origin .
Another strong blow as against humanity 's apparently brilliant record of activities , namely , that it could act in such a way that showed only goodness and benevolence , whose motive was only the love of Cod , and lacking all animal aspects .
The new thesis was that the claim of humanity to all that sanctity and virtue was false and all the activities to which it had given the name of the love of knowledge , art , beauty , morality and conscience , prayer and devotion and everything supernatural , are similar to those which can be found in animals , too , except in a more complex form and mechanism .
It was said that the stomach is the source and cause of all activities .
Some went so far as to say that the stomach was also the basis of its thoughts and feelings .
There were still others who considered this position too high and claimed that the human being was even lower than he is .
Eventually it was concluded that this being who had formerly claimed divine origin and exaltation must be sub- jected to a careful study to discover its true nature .
Another theory was offered that there is no difference between hu- mans , plants and even inanimate objects .
There is , of course , a difference in the texture and form , but not in the sub - stance of which they were all made .
It was stated that spirit and divine breath were non-existent because the human being is a machine which is only more complicated than other machines such as cars , planes , and satellites ; that is , only a mechanical creature .
This was a great blow to humanity and yet human values were not wholly condemned except in some schools of thought where ideas like peace , freedom , spirituality , justice and compassion were considered as jokes .
But since the middle of the 19th century , humanity has won fresh attention in philosophical schools Such as schools of humanity and even worship of human beings .
In the past the human being was only a sign of spirituality and the Quran speaks of the human being as being the worthiest creature through whom God could be understood .
Now the human being is trying to recover its former honor and sanctity and become a goal in itself but without the adoption of the former criteria and without a regard for its divine or non-divine aspect , or the points stated in the Quran that everything that is created on earth is for it and that God has breathed some of this spirit into it to making it a manifestation of Himself .
Part IIThere is no longer any talk of the above matters , nor even a discussion of internal human motives , but only a belief in the sanctity of humanity and its intelligence .
Now we see all schools of thought and even the declaration of human rights beginning their claims with respect for the inherent dignity of human beings .
They say this in order to base their education on its foundation and though each individual is able to violate the rights of others , this respect for the dignity and sanctity of humanity will serve as a check to such violations .
Most of those who follow the philosophy of humani- tarianism , have criteria different from those of the past .
But the difficulty lies in this same contradiction in the life , thought and logic of mankind today , a logic which lacks foundation .
I do not think that there are any scholars in the world who would interpret humanitarianism to mean universal peace .
There are , of course , ordinary people who think all human beings in the world are the same and of equal worth .
But this is not true .
One is learned , another is ignorant ; one is virtuous , another is impure ; one is tyrannical , another is oppressed ; one is benevolent , another is malevolent .
Should we consider them all the same from a humanitarian point of view , irrespective of their knowledge , faith , chasti- ty and benevolence or vice versa ?
If we say so , we are betraying humanity .
Let me give an example .
Both A and B are human beings who are biologi- cally similar .
If you dislike one of them , it has nothing to do with his blood group .
But if you are humanitarian , you cannot be indifferent to both of them and claim that they are equally human ; for then both should be equally liked , or both equally disliked .
But this is not so since the human being 's basic difference with animals is that the human being has more potentiality than animals and less actuality .
What does that mean ?
A horse on its birth possesses all the peculiarities that a horse should have and if it has less than that , it can gain it by practice .
But a human being has potential only at birth .
lt is not known what he or she will be in the future .
The shape is human hut that person may , in reality , become a wolf or a sheep or a human being .
Mulla Sadra , the great Iranian Islamic philosopher , in pointing out the error of people in thinking human beings equal in everything , says that there are as many kinds of individuals as there are individuals .
He is , of courses regard - ing the human being philosophically , not biologically .
A biologist pays attention to human organs and limbs , while a philosopher concentrates on the human being 's qualities and thus he cannot believe that human beings are all of the same kind .
That is why human values are potential .
Some attain the height of humanity while others fail to do so .
As Hadrat Ali says , " The shape is humans but the mind may be a beast . "
Not all individuals have an interior proportio- nate to their exterior .
As I said before , to a great extent , the world is returning , once again to the school of humanity , meaning that philoso - phies of humanity have appeared ; and the strangest of them all is the creed of humanity which Auguste Compte originated in the middle of the 19th century .
This man wavered between his intelligence and mind on the one hand and his heart and conscience on the other and came to the conclusion that the human being needed a creed , the ab - sence of which results in all kinds of social corruption .
According to him , past religion ( Catholicism ) is not ade - quate enough for modern mankind .
He describes three stages of religion ;
The divine supernatural stage , the philoso phical reasoning stage and the scientific positive stage .
He said that Catholicism belonged to the human being 's super - natural thinking and this is not acceptable to the person of the scientific age .
His invented religion however , lacked an occult root , but he accepted all the traditions and rites which existed before , and even proposed having priests in this new creed , presenting himself as its prophet , but a prophet without a god .
They say about him that he got his rites from Catholicism and he was criticized for this since he disbelieved that religion but imitated and adopted its ceremonies and traditions .
He was right in one thing , that the human being needs worship and devotion as well as the performance of a number of rites .
He seems to have found a large number of followers in Europe and America and his house has become a center of pilgrimage for them .
According to some Arabic books , he had fallen in love with a lady whose husband had been condemned to life imprisonment , but she died before he could win her and consequently he turned away frown the world of the intellect to the world of sentiments and even - tually started his creed of humanity .
This lady - love is con- sidered by his followers as holy as Mary , the mother of Christ .
But this school of humanity underwent a number of changes which gave it its present form .
One of the questions concerning the human being is freedom and responsibility .
Is the human being really free and independent or does it have a responsibility and a mis- sion to perform ?
According to the Quran , the human being is faced with no compulsion before God .
On the contrary , the human being is created a free being with a fixed res- ponsibility and mission .
The Holy Quran refers to the human being as the vice - gerent of God , while no others Holy book has given such sanctity to the human being .
Part IIIGod says in the Quran , " And when your Lord said to the angels , I am setting on the earth a vice - gerent , they said , What will You set therein one who will do corruption there and shed blood ...
But God answered , Assuredly I know what you know not .
" All that , is evidence of the human being 's talents and potentialities .
You see , then , that Islam , which is a school of humanity , believes in the exalted position of the human being from a philosophical point of view .
The Quran says again that God taught the human being the names of all things .
Then it showed itself superior to the angels in this knowledge and God reproached the angels for what they did not know about humanity and while they supposed the human being to be a creature of wrath and lust , they had ignored the other side of its character .
The angels confessed their ignorance and begged for His forgiveness .
Then God told the angels to prostrate themselves before His creature .
The greatest interpretation that can be given to this command in order to show the human being 's mission freedom and option is that God makes it the vice - gerent of and the successor to himself .
God is the Creator and here
He confers some of His creative power on the human being to benefit from .
Another question shout the human being is its hap - piness and pleasure .
I say briefly that the human being seeks pleasure .
Where Should it be found ?
Is it from within the self or from without , or from both within and without and in what proportion ?
Those who focus their attention on sures outside themselves , wrongly supposing that the whole joy of life is this , have not been able to know themselves as human beings .
They cannot consider the life within them - selves as a source of joy and pleasure .
Their exhilaration lies in a wine - cup , a cabaret .
How well does Rumi describe a person addicted to drinking and direct that person to righteousness and away from evil saying , You are the symbol of existence , wherefore do youseek annihilation ?
You who are an ocean , what do you intend to be -come ?
Why do you make yourself indebted to wine ?
He continues to say that the human being is the es-sence and the world is the form .
It is equally wrong to reject all external things and go to the other extreme of thinking that all joys must be sought internally .
In some poems of Rumi we come across such an exaggeration when he says , Consider that the way of pleasure is allfrom within , not without And think it foolish to abandoncustoms and traditions .
Someone is happy and intoxicated inthe corner of prison , And another is full of grief in his garden .
He does not mean that all external things should be put aside but , at the same time , it Should not be supposed that all joys are found in material things .
The self is the center of joy and there should be an equilibrium between the internal and external .
There are many things to say about the human being .
The school of thought which considers itself human should be able to answer certain questions in order to be accepted as a true human school .
The human being was considered as the door of spirituality , that is , one could discover the spiritual work through one 's own essence .
Spirituality and humanism or religion and humanism are two inseparable matters .
We cannot accept one of them and abandon the other .
The contradiction which we claim to exist in various genuine humanistic schools lies in this point that when humanity suffered a downfall , however wrongly , namely through a change in the Ptolemaic astronomy , it should not make us doubt the exalted position of the human being as a goal in the course of creation .
The human being is the goal of the universe whether the earth is the center of the universe or not .
What does the phrase ' goal of the universe ' mean ?
It means that nature moves in a certain direction in its evolutionary course whether we consider the human be - ing a spontaneously created being or a continuation of other animal species .
it makes no difference to this process whether we think it to possess a divine spirit or not .
God has said , " We have breathed some Our spirit into him . "
He has not said that the human being is the race of God .
If He had said that thee substance of which the human being is made was brought from another world , then the human being would be a lofty and sacred being .
Part IVTo those of you whose philosophy is humanitarian , we say , is there a sentiment in the human being either called benevolence , goodness or service , or not ?
If you say there is not , then to attribute Such a quality to the human being would be as meaningless as calling him a stone or an animal .
But the human being has the sentiment .
What is it ?
Some one may say the feeling of service in us is a kind of sub- stitution .
What does that mean ?
When we witness some - thing and our humanitarian feeling is supposedly roused to go and instruct , serve and save the oppressed , we are told that if we ponder about it , we as human beings are putting ourselves in their place , thinking of them first as belonging to our group or our group related to them and then we substitute ourselves for them .
Then , the feeling of self - ishness which makes us defend ourselves is roused to defend the oppressed ; otherwise there is no genuine sentiment in the human being to defend an oppressed person directly .
The school of humanity must firstly answer whether such a sentiment exists in the human being or not ?
We answer that it does on the basis of its being appointed the vice - gerent of God and as the manifestation of divine generosity and benevolence .
It means that while the human bring in its Selfishness is duty - bound to show activity for its survival , tile whole of its existence is not selfishness .
The human being also has benevolence , humanity , world - build ing and moral conscience .
Some time ago when I was in Shiraz , an organization called the Happy Organization was introduced to me consisting of individuals with an internal sentiment and personal faith and a gathering of the deaf and dumb .
I visited one of their classes .
For us fastidious people it would he exhausting to spend even one hour in such a class and watch them and their strange gesticulations for a remark .
Their teacher was a Sayyid who was named after the first son of Imam and he was showing a great deal of interest and sympathy in those children even though his salary was less than an elementary school teacher 's , for that organi- zation was short of funds .
He taught them how to write and made them understand words with a great expendi- ture of effort .
What is this sentiment in the human being ?
It is the manifestation of humanity and its genuineness .
Generally speaking , what is this sense of praise for the good and dis - like for the sick , even though they belong to the distant past ?
When we hear the names of Yazid and Shimr and re- member their wickedness and crimes , and on the other hand , when the names of the martyrs of Karbala are men- tioned , we have a feeling of hatred for the first group and a sense of wonder and respect for the latter .
What is the rea- son for it ?
Is it a class feeling which makes us think of our - selves as belonging to the group of the martyrs of Karbala and dislike Yazid and Shimr as we dislike our enemies ?
Do we project our feelings of sympathy and hatred on to each group respectively , while in truth both are related to our - selves ?
If this is so then the person you consider your enemy will be no different from you .
For in his turn he has the right to praise those you dislike and hate those you praise .
On the contrary you may look upon it from a different angle which is not personal and individual but is related to the whole of humanity in which there is no question of per- sonal dislike but the truth .
There your connection with the martyrs in your praise , and your dislike of their enemies , is not personal but general and universal .
The school of humanity must supply an answer to what these feelings are and whence they arise and to such pro- blems as the human being 's honest love of gratitude , to some one who has done a good deed .
When the genuineness of human values are discovered , then the question of the human being crops up .
Is the human being who has such genuine qualities the same person spoken of by materialism ?
Is that person a machine , a satellite ?
A machine , however big , is only big , if a machine is made a thousand times bigger than an Apollo , what could we say about it ?
We could say it is great , amazing and extraordinary but not noble or sacred .
Even if it is made a billion times bigger , possessing a billion pieces , again it can only be called amazing and extraordinary but never noble , holy and honorable .
How can the declaration of human rights and communist philoso - phers who support human genuineness in various forms , speak of the human being 's inherent prestige and sacred - ness without paying attention to God 's words saying , " We breathed some of Our spirit into him , " When they ascer - tain the genuineness of these values then they can realize the genuineness of the human being itself .
Now supposing we realize this genuineness of the human being is it only the human being who exists in this universe which is in infinite darkness ?
As a European says , is the human being only a drop of sweat in an ocean of poison created accidentally ?
Or is the human being a drop of sweet water in a sweet ocean ?
Does this small light re- present universal light ?
Here the relation of the genuineness of the human being with God will become clear , for both of them are inseparable .
In the phrase of the Holy Quran , God is the light of the heavens and the earth , the word God is not what Aristotle calls the first Cause for that is different from the God of Islam .
His god is separate from and foreign to the universe .
But the God Of Islam , when the phrase , He is the First , He is the Last , He is the Outer and He is the Inner . ( 57:3 ) is heard , it at once gives you a different view of the universe .
Then you understand the meaning of all the genuine qualities within yourself and realize that there is a goal .
You will see that if you are a beam of light then a whole world of light exists and if you are a drop of sweat water it is because an infinite ocean of sweetness exists there and a ray of His light is within you .
Islam is a humanistic school based on human criteria
There is nothing in it based on wrong discriminations be- tween human beings .
In Islam there exists no country , race , blood , zone and language .
These things are not an evidence and criterion of privilege for human beings .
That criterion in Islam is those human values .
If it respects those values , it is because it believes in the genuineness of the human being and the universe ; that is , it believes in God Almighty .
That is why Islam is the only humanistic school that has for its foundation proper logic and there exists no other such school in the world .
Cassandra vs. Any Government
In a recent column in the New York Times , editorialist Paul Krugman lead off his piece titled “ Averting the Worst , ” with this quote :
“ So it seems we are n’t going to have a second Great Depression after all .
What saved us ?
The answer , basically , is Big Government . ”
This is a little , to my mind , like saying that a man who shoots you in the back , paralyzes you for life , and then hands you a second - hand wheelchair so you can putt around is to be hailed as a savior .
In an essay written by John Hasnas , Associate Professor of the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University , titled “ What it Feels Like to be a Libertarian , ” he writes :
“ Imagine spending two decades warning that government policy is leading to a major economic collapse , and then , when the collapse comes , watching the world conclude that markets do not work .
“ Imagine continually explaining that markets function because they have a built in corrective mechanism ; that periodic contractions are necessary to weed out unproductive ventures ; that continually loosening credit to avoid such corrections just puts off the day of reckoning and inevitably leads to a larger recession ; that this is precisely what the government did during the 1920 ’s that led to the great depression ; and then , when the recession hits , seeing it offered as proof of the failure of laissez - faire capitalism .
“ Imagine spending years decrying federal intervention in the home mortgage market ; pointing out the dangers associated with legislation such as the Community Reinvestment
Act that forces lenders to make more risky loans than they otherwise would ; testifying before Congress on the lack of oversight and inevitable insolvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to legislators who angrily respond either that one is ‘ exaggerat[ing ] a threat of safety and soundness . . . which I do not see’ ( Barney Frank ) or ‘ If it ai n’t broke , why do you want to fix it ?
Have the GSEs [ government - sponsored enterprises ] ever missed their housing goals ? ’ ( Maxine Waters ) or ‘ The problem that we have and that we are faced with is maybe some individuals who wanted to do away with GSEs in the first place ’ ( Gregory Meeks ) or that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are ‘ one of the great success stories of all time ’ ( Christopher Dodd ) ; and arguing that the moral hazard created by the implicit federal backing of such privately - owned government - sponsored enterprises is likely to set off a wave of unjustifiably risky investments , and then , when the housing market implodes under the weight of bad loans , watching the collapse get blamed on the greed and rapaciousness of ‘ Wall Street . ' ”
Such revelations do little to sway government apologists in the media like Krugman , however .
Here ’s what he had to say about the government ’s actions in response to the economic crisis :
“ Probably the most important aspect of the government ’s role in this crisis is n’t what it has done , but what it has n’t done :
Unlike the private sector , the federal government has n’t slashed spending as its income has fallen . ”
He then readily admits that state and local governments are a different story – more on that below .
Krugman continues : “ Tax receipts are way down , but Social Security checks are still going out ; Medicare is still covering hospital bills ; federal employees , from judges to park rangers to soldiers , are still being paid . ”
What Paul Krugman and those of his ilk consistently ignore is that there are only two ways such lunacy can continue while flying wildly in the face of basic mathematics .
First , of course , is taxation – money taken from the productive private sector by the unproductive “ public ” sector literally at gunpoint .
However , since the amounts of revenue necessary to perpetuate government at its current and future spending levels are unachievable through taxation alone – both in the practical and political sense – politicians must continue to borrow from the privately - owned Federal Reserve , which simply prints more and more fiat currency and lumps it into the banking system and economy .
The end result , invariably , is hyperinflation and higher interest rates .
In effect , a hidden tax on savings and investment .
A recipe for disaster .
Yet Krugman would have us believe that handing a bandage and an aspirin to a leukemia patient is all that ’s needed to perpetually outhit disaster ad infinitum .
After praising government intervention once again for rescuing the banking system , and Obama ’s American Recovery and Reinvestment boondoggle , Krugman states , “ Sometimes the private sector is the problem , and government is the solution . ”
He then ends the column on this note : “ We appear to have averted the worst : Utter catastrophe no longer seems likely .
And Big Government , run by people who understand its virtues , is the reason why . ”
I ’ll pass on whatever he ’s smoking .
Utter catastrophe has been postponed , not eliminated .
The leukemia patient has been hit with a little morphine , but that ’s about all .
Professor Hasnas , in his essay , says it best :
“ Libertarians spend their lives accurately predicting the future effects of government policy .
Their predictions are accurate because they are derived from Hayek ’s insights into the limitations of human knowledge , from the recognition that the people who comprise the government respond to incentives just like anyone else and are not magically transformed to selfless agents of the good merely by accepting government employment , from the awareness that for government to provide a benefit to some , it must first take it from others , and from the knowledge that politicians cannot repeal the laws of economics .
For the same reason , their predictions are usually negative and utterly inconsistent with the utopian wishful - thinking that lies at the heart of virtually all contemporary political advocacy .
And because no one likes to hear that he cannot have his cake and eat it too or be told that his good intentions cannot be translated into reality either by waving a magic wand or by passing legislation , these predictions are greeted not merely with disbelief , but with derision .
“ It is human nature to want to shoot the messenger bearing unwelcome tidings .
And so , for the sin of continually pointing out that the emperor has no clothes , libertarians are attacked as heartless bastards devoid of compassion for the less fortunate , despicable flacks for the rich or for business interests , unthinking dogmatists who place blind faith in the free market , or , at best , members of the lunatic fringe .
“ Cassandra ’s curse was to always tell the truth about the future , but never be believed .
If you add to that curse that she would be ridiculed , derided , and shunned for making her predictions , you have a pretty fair approximation of what it feels like to be a libertarian .
“ If you ’d like a taste of what it feels like to be a libertarian , try telling people that the incoming Obama Administration is advocating precisely those aspects of FDR ’s New Deal that prolonged the great depression for a decade ; that propping up failed and failing ventures with government money in order to save jobs in the present merely shifts resources from relatively more to relatively less productive uses , impedes the corrective process , undermines the economic growth necessary for recovery , and increases unemployment in the long term ; and that any ‘ economic ’ stimulus package will inexorably be made to serve political rather than economic ends , and see what kind of reaction you get .
And trust me , it wo n’t feel any better five or ten years from now when everything you have just said has been proven true and Obama , like FDR , is nonetheless revered as the savior . ”
Of course , it does n’t have to be that way .
First however , Americans must realize that not just Big Government , but any political government – of any size or type – will only produce the same failed , disastrous results .
Markets work , state socialism and fascism do n’t .
We have thousands of years of human history to prove this .
It ’s time to stop voting , stop supporting politics and politicians altogether , and start looking for ways to build a future for ourselves not hampered and threatened by such madness .

So we had an orgy of bonuses just as the recession was taking hold and now another orgy ( with taxpayers as the enablers ) that is nothing short of an arrogantly pointed finger in the eye of everyone who suffered , and continues to suffer , in this downturn .
Whether P.T. Barnum actually said it or not , there is a sucker born every minute .

If the epithet fits ...
We need to make some fundamental changes in the way we do things in this country .
The gamblers and con artists of the financial sector , the very same clowns who did so much to bring the economy down in the first place , are howling self - righteously over the prospect of regulations aimed at curbing the worst aspects of their excessively risky behavior and preventing them from causing yet another economic meltdown .
We should be going even further .
We ’ve institutionalized the idea that there are firms that are too big to fail and , therefore , “ we , the people ” are obliged to see that they do n’t  even if that means bankrupting the national treasury and undermining the living standards of ordinary people .
What sense does that make ?
If some company is too big to fail , then it ’s too big to exist .
Break it up .
Why should the general public have to constantly worry that a misstep by the high - wire artists at Goldman Sachs ( to take the most obvious example ) would put the entire economy in peril ?
These financial acrobats get the extraordinary benefits of their outlandish risk - taking  multimillion - dollar paychecks , homes the size of castles  but the public has to be there to absorb the worst of the pain when they take a terrible fall .
Enough !
Goldman Sachs is thriving while the combined rates of unemployment and underemployment are creeping toward a mind - boggling 20 percent .
Two - thirds of all the income gains from the years 2002 to 2007  two - thirds !
 went to the top 1 percent of Americans .

The Dvorak Keyboard is a major improvement over the QWERTY layout , which was designed to slow people 's typing speed !
Learning it may increase your typing speed , and even reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries .
Back in the early 1990s , with the aid of some interesting parsing techniques , I devised a typing course which , much like the tutors of the QWERTY keyboard , starts you out on the home rows and gradually has you learning the entire keyboard .
With a Dvorak keyboard , you can type fairly interesting words fairly quickly .
( Anybody remember lessons like " a sad lass ; a dad falls " ? )
I have been interested in the Dvorak keyboard layout for some time , but never was able to find a typing tutorial that properly taught this layout .
I even bought a piece of commercial software that claimed to teach the Dvorak layout .
But all they did was remap the keys and teach the same old QWERTY lessons .
Yuck .
For the curious , or for reference , here is a picture of the keyboard layout .
Notice how the commonly used keys are in the " home " rows and the more obscure letters are harder to reach .
Check out the FAQs , and when you are ready , let 's begin the Dvorak Typing Tutor !
And when you are done ... if you like ABCD , feel free to show your appreciation by sending me something from my Amazon.com wish list .

Family First Senator Steve Fielding has stumbled while trying to clarify his views on the economy .
Senator Fielding has frequently recently mispronounced " fiscal policy " as " physical policy " .
Speaking to journalists this morning he was questioned about the mispronunciation .
" I 'll make it quite clear : fiscal , F - I - S - K - A - L , " he spelt .
The journalist repeated his misspelling , at which point Senator Fielding corrected himself .
" F - I - S - C - A - L. Yeah , fiscal . "
Senator Fielding has argued against a Greens push for a Senate hearing into the stimulus spending , saying it would only be worthwhile if Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens appeared as well as Treasury secretary Ken Henry .
He has argued it is important to consider both monetary and fiscal policy .

Why , it feels like only yesterday that every right - wing talker on the planet -- from Michael Savage to Greta Van Susteren -- was denouncing the Department of Homeland Security for supposedly " smearing our veterans " by issuing a bulletin for law - enforcement officers warning that right - wing extremists and neo -Nazis intended to recruit members of the military and returning veterans .
Well , we 've already seen just how prescient the bulletin actually was -- after Richard Poplawski , Scott Roeder , and James Von Brunn all proved its point .
Now Stars and Stripes is reporting on just how far , indeed , neo - Nazis have infiltrated our military ranks :
It is Facebook for the fascist set , and the typical online profiles of its members reveal expected tastes .
Favorite book : “ Mein Kampf . ” Favorite movie : the Nazi propaganda film “ Triumph of the Will . ”
Interests : “ white women . ” Dislikes : “ anyone who opposes the master race . ”
But there ’s one other thing that dozens of members of newsaxon.org , a white supremacist social networking website , have in common :
They proudly identify themselves as active - duty members of the U.S. armed forces .
The Southern Poverty Law Center , the Montgomery , Ala . - based watchdog group that tracks extremist hate groups , has compiled a book containing the online user profiles of at least 40 newsaxon.org users who say they are serving in the military , in apparent violation of Pentagon regulations prohibiting racist extremism in the ranks .
The military has been shrugging this off .
So the SPLC is going to take the matter up with Congress :
On Friday , the SPLC will present its findings to key members of Congress who chair the House and Senate committees overseeing the armed forces and urge them to pressure the Pentagon to crack down .
“ In the wake of several high - profile murders by extremists of the radical right , we urge your committees to investigate the threat posed by racial extremists who may be serving in the military to ensure that our armed forces are not inadvertently training future domestic terrorists , ” Morris Dees , SPLC co-founder and chief trial counsel , wrote to the legislators .
“ Evidence continues to mount that current Pentagon policies are inadequate to prevent racial extremists from joining and serving in the armed forces . ”
Added Mark Potok , editor of the Intelligence Report , a magazine produced at the law center : “ The Pentagon really has shrugged this off and refused to look at this in any serious way . ”
We 've been reporting on this trend for some time now , and have discussed especially the ramifications of this development .
As an FBI assessment made last year noted :
The prestige which the extremist movement bestows upon members with military experience grants them the potential for influence beyond their numbers .
Most extremist groups have some members with military experience , and those with military experience often hold positions of authority within the groups to which they belong .
...
Military experience — often regardless of its length or type — distinguishes one within the extremist movement .
While those with military backgrounds constitute a small percentage of white supremacist extremists , FBI investigations indicate they frequently have higher profiles within the movement , including recruitment and leadership roles .
...
New groups led or significantly populated by military veterans could very likely pursue more operationally minded agendas with greater tactical confidence .
In addition , the military training veterans bring to the movement and their potential to pass this training on to others can increase the ability of lone offenders to carry out violence from the movement ’s fringes .
America has really been fortunate for the past 30 years or so in that the vast majority of right - wing domestic terrorists -- from the militiamen who plotted to blow up a Sacramento propane facility ( likely dead : about 3,000 ) to the cyanide - bomb maker to the would - be dirty - bomb builder -- have proved to be incompetent or catchable ; in many cases , we 've simply been lucky they were done in by fate .
When there have been exceptions -- Timothy McVeigh and Eric Rudolph particularly -- there has also been a military background .
In other words , our luck may be about to run out .
And we can thank right - wing yammerers for having delayed and distracted us from dealing with it in a timely fashion -- before it happens .
( CNN ) -- Many
Google users probably did n't notice this month that they can now display their search tips in the Hawaiian language .
Hawaiian is one of more than 125 " interface languages " now available on Google .
Wedged between Hausa and Hebrew , Hawaiian is one of more than 125 " interface languages " now available on Google .
The list also includes some humorous twists on English , including " pirate , " " Klingon " and " Elmer Fudd . "
But for Hawaiian educators , the addition of Hawaiian is a small step toward legitimizing a language that is considered " critically endangered " by the United Nations .
" It 's the capstone of a lot of work , " said Keola Donaghy , an assistant professor of Hawaiian studies at the University of Hawaii - Hilo .
" We 've been doing this work for 18 years , simply trying to make it easier for people who speak Hawaiian to use these kinds of technologies . "
It marks the first native American language available through the " Google in Your Language " program .
Getting started
It took Donaghy several years to get the project off the ground through the " Google in Your Language " program , which was launched by the California - based company not long after it was founded in 1998 .
" The idea was to enable users worldwide to be able to access Google in the language of their choice , and if it was n't available , to enable users to help make it so , " Google spokesman Nate Tyler said .
" Why limit users to a set of dominant languages if they were willing to help make Google their own ? "
The results of the search are still in English , although the user can select a preference for Web pages written in more than 40 other main languages .
Google works with linguists like Donaghy who are interested in translating search instructions into their language .
" Volunteers sign up on their own to provide translation , " Tyler explained .
" They simply sign themselves up , declare a language proficiency , and then start translating or reviewing the products that are available for volunteer translation .
" When the translations are completed , we make the product (s ) available in that language .
Recent other languages like this include Maori language . "
It was the Maori project , launched last year , that actually helped get Donaghy 's initiative off the ground .
Three years ago , Donaghy started e-mailing and calling Google about a Hawaiian language project , but he got no response .
He put the project on hold until last year .
" When I heard the Maori version came out , I asked Google about it , " Donaghy said .
" Apparently the original ( language ) coordinator had gone and as soon as a new coordinator was brought online , they set up the system . "
Donaghy began working on the massive translation project sometime late last year .
" It was whenever I could find an hour or two in between teaching or other duties , " he said .
" It was a combination of personal and work time . "
He spent more than 100 hours translating the search terms that appear on the Google page into Hawaiian through the program .
" I did the actual translation from beginning to end , and then I consulted with my colleagues at the university who have worked on these projects in the past , " Donaghy said .
" I wanted to be very consistent -- such as how you say ' Go to this menu and select this ' -- or people may become confused . "
What 's Hawaiian for ' browsing ' the Web ' ?
Some of the Hawaiian words for terms such as " links " or " Web browser " had already been established when Donaghy and others worked on translating the Netscape Navigator search engine in 1997 .
" Over the years , we usually face the debate of do we want to ' Hawaiianize ' an English word , or take an old Hawaiian word and give it a new meaning , " he said .
He explained some of the challenges in translating terms , such as " browsing " or " surfing , " into Hawaiian .
" People use the term ' surf the Internet ' and they 'll say ' he'e nalu ' which is literally surfing the ocean out on a board , " he explained .
" But we use ' kele , ' which is what you do when you 're steering a canoe .
So we chose that as you 're navigating the net . "
Donaghy finished the translation project in April , but there were issues with the code for the search engine that would not activate the Hawaiian language interface .
The Hawaiian language interface actually launched on Apple 's Safari browser first because Donaghy had worked with Apple to ensure that the language 's diacritical marks and characters were available on the company 's computers .
" Now , it comes with every computer that they ship , " he said .
See and hear phrases in Hawaiian »
Some Apple computer users who had selected Hawaiian as their primary language for other programs noticed a couple of weeks ago that Google 's search terms started appearing in Hawaiian , too .
" People started calling me and asking , ' Did you hack into my computer ?
My Google is in Hawaiian , ' " Donaghy said .
" And that was the point I said , ' OK , word is getting out about this ' and I put out a news release .
I was afraid someone was going to start freaking out , ' Why is my computer in Hawaiian ? ' "
Important milestone for Hawaii 's culture
The initiative is an important milestone for Hawaiian linguists and cultural educators who have pushed to have their native language taught in schools alongside English .
It was n't until the 1980s that the law banning the Hawaiian language from being taught in schools was overturned .
The law was established in the late 19th century as a prerequisite to Hawaii becoming a U.S. territory .
Today , more and more Hawaiians are studying and majoring in Hawaiian language programs .
There are Hawaiian language immersion programs in which English is taught as a second language .
Mona Wood , a Hawaiian speaker and owner of a public relations firm in Honolulu , said there has been a kind of Hawaiian language " renaissance " in the state since the late 1970s .
" Even tourism has been learning and growing and realizing that our ' host culture ' must be added to the visitor experience , " Wood said .
" There are many more programs available at hotels and shopping malls that were n't there 20 years ago . "
Wood said that when she studied Hawaiian in college , it was under the foreign languages department .
" It has been so wonderful to see so many of our youth embrace the native culture and see the programs expand to the point where there is an entire Hawaiian Studies Department , " she said .
" One can now get a B.A. ( Bachelor of Arts ) and M.A. ( Master of Arts ) in Hawaiian language . "
Wood -- who owns Ikaika Communications , which represents local officials , local and national companies and celebrities including Duane " Dog the Bounty Hunter " Chapman -- said that when she was growing up , " Our culture was dying in every way . "
" Learning my roots came through my own curiosity -- choosing to take hula lessons when my mom wanted me to take piano , " she said .
" Then I went to the Hawaiian High School , Kamehameha , and continued with some Hawaiian classes and joined a club at UH ( University of Hawaii ) .
" Seeing Hawaiian knowledge becoming an asset over the years has been truly satisfying , " she said .
Donaghy hopes the Google initiative is another step toward giving Hawaiian " the same status as English and other major European and Asian languages " -- particularly in the fast - moving sector of technology .
" To me personally it 's very important that we are giving the opportunity to have as many things in Hawaiian as in English , " he said .
" So if we had not begun to address technology in the early 1990s , we would be telling people that this is a place where Hawaiian does n't belong .
You have to revert to English .
" We did n't want to send that kind of message so we 've worked to make the language more accessible . "
