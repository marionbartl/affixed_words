Down in his basement laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech­nology , Donald Sadoway and his students are hunting for the perfect battery .
Not for cellphones or laptop computers , but to power a future generation of automobiles or perhaps the electric grid .
To achieve that goal , we will need batteries many times cheaper , safer , more powerful , and more durable than today ’s best , professor Sadoway says .
They must store enough juice to send a car 250 miles on a charge – and cheap enough to store solar or wind power for use at night and in calm periods , he says .
Risky , over - the - horizon research is vital because , although most Americans and politicians do n’t know it yet , the United States is in a global race to build a new generation of batteries based on lithium - ion technology , Sadoway and others say .
With double the “ energy density ” of today ’s standard nickel - metal - hydride batteries , lithium - ion cells have emerged as a viable first - generation battery chemistry to power plug - in hybrid vehicles ( PHEVs ) , major announcements this month reveal .
Such a battery is critical to President Obama ’s energy plan , which includes deploying PHEVs that go 40 miles on a charge in order to replace much of the nation ’s oil imports with US - generated electricity .
As electricity replaces gasoline , the race to develop ever more powerful batteries will determine which nations emerge as winners in transportation , renewable energy , and economic clout , many say .
“ We ’re entering an exciting new phase for the automotive industry where we increase the electrification of vehicles , reducing consumption of gasoline through advanced batteries , ” David Vieau , president A123 Systems in Watertown , Mass. , said in a statement this month announcing its plan to build the nation ’s first lithium - ion battery manufacturing plant .
Yet the US is entering the race late .
It must move fast to catch Japan , Korea , and China .
Each is pouring billions into lithium research and each already has manufacturing plants .
Still , there are signs the tide may be turning .
A123 Systems has applied for $ 1.8 billion in funding from the US Department of Energy to build a lithium battery factory in Detroit big enough to supply a half dozen auto companies and employ 14,000 workers .
Last week , the National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Battery Cell Manufacture , a consortium of more than a dozen US battery developers , announced it was seeking up to $ 2 billion to fund a major lithium battery manufacturing facility .
“ We cannot allow ourselves to become dependent on foreign sources of lithium - ion battery cells as we have become dependent on petroleum from the Middle East , ” says James Greenberger , the National Alliance ’s director .
Now add the Obama administration ’s plan to spend $ 25 billion for new energy programs .
All of which is good news to battery researchers like Sadoway , who have long toiled with slender funding as research dollars sluiced to fuel cells , nuclear power , and others with more buzz and backers .
“ I applaud the new money going into battery research , ” Sadoway says .
“ We ’ve been underspending on something that ’s vital to our national security and economic well - being . ”
In the near term , however , the US is playing catch - up .
For more than a year , General Motors has said it hopes to launch the world ’s first mass - produced PHEV , the Chevrolet Volt , in 2010 .
But until recently , GM executives had been damping expectations , saying a battery with the right performance and cost still did n’t exist .
That changed last week when GM named LG Chem , a Korean company , as the lithium - ion battery cell supplier for the Volt .
It is also working with A123Systems , officials say .
Not to be outdone , Toyota announced it would sell some PHEVs with lithium batteries late this year .
“ When we introduced this [ Chevrolet Volt ] concept not long ago , it seemed to resonate , ” says Robert A. Kruse , GM ’s executive director of global vehicle engineering for hybrids , electric vehicles , and batteries .
“ We said , ‘ Hey , we ’ve got to figure out how to do this .
The battery did n’t exist .
We went through a very elaborate search of cell chemistry and construction . ”
( For the full interview with Mr. Kruse , click here . )
Finding the right battery recipe
The beauty of lithium - ion is there ’s not one single chemical , but many variants involved .
As a result , the race is n’t over making a Chevy Volt battery designed to run 40 miles on a single charge that could cost as much as $ 10,000 .
Instead engineers hope to create a cell that could last perhaps 80 miles per charge and cost half as much , battery experts say .
“ There are n’t any showstoppers , ” Sadoway says .
“ We ’re not asking for light to travel 10 times faster than it can go .
We ’re not asking for science fiction .
Most remaining problems involve engineering .
So I ’m optimistic that these problems that remain can be solved . ”
Still , he worries the US and the rest of the world could become “ hooked on lithium ” just like oil , since places including China and South America have the richest lithium deposits .
So down in his lab , Sadoway ’s students are exploring “ earth abundant ” compounds other than lithium .
The LG Chem lithium - ion cell is reportedly based on manganese .
But other flavors of lithium - ion are emerging , too .
A123Systems ’ lithium cell , for instance , is an iron - phosphate variety that ’s said to be very safe and stable , a key attribute .
“ By tinkering with the materials involved , one can address the various challenges .
And that ’s what we ’re seeing now , ” says Jim Miller , a senior electrochemical engineer involved in battery research at Argonne National Laboratory , which is providing research support to the National Alliance .
Safety and cost remain top concerns , however .
Lithium -ion batteries using cobalt chemistry , popularly used in laptop computers and cellphones , have in the past shown a propensity to overheat , resulting in a few laptops going up in flames .
That must not happen in a car , all agree .
So while the search goes on for a powerful but stable and reliable battery chemistry , automakers are developing sophisticated battery management systems to monitor lithium cells for signs of impending failure .
GM announced last week it will make its own computer - monitored pack to hold the LG Chem cells .
“ There ’s many layers of safety built into the Volt , that includes all the way down to the cell level , ” Kruse says .
Cost is critical
Kruse wo n’t say whether the $ 10,000 price tag for the batteries floating around the media is correct .
If so , the 16 kilowatt - hours ( kWh ) worth of energy in the GM battery pack would put the price at $ 625 per kwh of capacity .
But the cost of the Chevy Volt battery should drop sharply once production ramps up , several experts say .
“ Right now the price [ for lithium PHEV batteries ] is beyond what is required for a sustainable business , ” says Ann Marie Sastry , a University of Michigan battery materials expert .
“ But automotive companies are going to take the risks and assume that [ government ] policies will help out . ”
General Motors has talked about a $ 40,000 price tag for the Volt .
That may be too costly for most Americans .
The Obama administration has talked about a $ 7,500 tax break for PHEV buyers .
Still others say that the cost of new battery power for PHEVs may drop faster and already be lower than what has been widely reported at perhaps $ 500 per kilowatt - hour or even less , says Suba Arunkumar , analyst for market researcher Frost & Sullivan .
“ I do expect the price will come down to perhaps as low as $ 200 per kilowatt - hour when mass production begins in 2010 and 2011 , ” she says .
With steady progress on all four fronts of lithium - ion cells – cost , safety , durability , and performance – Matthew Keyser , a battery researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo. , says attention is flowing to riskier , longer - term battery research of the sort “ more likely to one - day produce a kind of Holy Grail battery . ”
All batteries degrade with time .
Right now , the Volt ’s new battery is expected to last five to eight years .
But with a typical car ’s lifetime now about 17 years , automakers want a “ life of the car ” battery .
With proper research funding , that goal is achievable , Mr. Keyser and Sadoway agree .
The next generation of battery materials – perhaps vanadium oxide or nickelates – will lower costs by increasing capacity , they say .
“ What we ’ve done is to create a situation with a lot of people who smell big money and they ’re working very hard , ” says John Goodenough , the University of Texas at Austin professor who invented the lithium - ion battery .
“ I ’m optimistic that in a few years , they ’re going to lick the problem . ”

The BBC has refused to broadcast a national humanitarian appeal for Gaza , leaving aid agencies with a potential shortfall of millions of pounds in donations .
The Disasters Emergency Committee ( DEC ) , an umbrella group for 13 aid charities , launched its appeal yesterday saying the devastation in Gaza was " so huge British aid agencies were compelled to act " .
But the BBC made a rare breach of an agreement dating to 1963 , saying it would not give free airtime to the appeal .
Other broadcasters followed suit .
Previously , broadcasters had agreed on the video and script to be used with the DEC , to be shown after primetime news bulletins .
The BBC , which has been criticised in the past over alleged bias in its coverage of the Middle East , said it did not want to risk public confidence in its impartiality .
A BBC spokesperson said : " The decision was made because of question marks about the delivery of aid in a volatile situation and also to avoid any risk of compromising public confidence in the BBC 's impartiality in the context of [ a ] news story . "
The DEC 's chief executive , Brendan Gormley , said : " We are totally apolitical ... this appeal is a response to humanitarian principles .
The BBC seems to be confusing impartiality with equal airtime . "
DEC appeals have recently raised £ 10 m for the Congo and £ 18 m for Burma .
An ITV spokesman said the broadcasters , after assessing the DEC 's needs , had been unable " to reach a consensus necessary for an appeal " .
Sky said : " By convention , if all broadcasters do not carry the appeal , then none do .
The decision was effectively made for us . "
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) -
An Australian court has issued a blunt warning about the sexual predators a young driver faces in jail if he does not stop speeding , as authorities struggle to stop teenagers street racing .
“ You ’ll find big , ugly , hairy strong men ( in jail ) who ’ve got faces only a mother could love that will pay a lot of attention to you -- and your anatomy , ” said Magistrate Brian Maloney .
The 19 - year - old male appeared in Sydney ’s Downing Center Court on Monday charged with driving without a license , failing to stop at a police alcohol check point and driving dangerously .
It was his third time before the courts for driving offences , prompting the magistrate ’s warning he would be jailed next time .
Maloney barred the teenager from driving until 2013 , placed him on a 12 - month good behavior bond and ordered him to do 150 hours of community work .
Breaching any of these conditions would see the teenager jailed where he would “ shower with the gorillas in the mist down at Long Bay jail , ” said Maloney , his comments confirmed by the court on Tuesday .
“ Out of control ” was the frontpage headline in Sydney ’s The Daily Telegraph newspaper on Tuesday for a story on four teenagers either booked for street racing , speeding , driving without a license or crashing their car and killing a passenger .
The newspaper ’s editorial backed the magistrate ’s warning of life behind bars , saying his comments were “ a vision in clarity ” and gave the teenager “ a reality check of his future . ”
“ We can only hope this strategy helps .
Hope it ends the slaughter of young innocents on the roads through stupidity ... , ” said the Telegraph .
“ Road safety has become a war zone and any tactics are permissible ... ”
Police in the southern state of Victoria impounded 42 cars in the past six days after drivers were caught speeding .
One driver , aged 78 , was clocked in Melbourne on New Year ’s Day at 170 kph ( 105 mph ) -- 70 kph ( 44 mph ) over the limit .
The 78 - year - old was the “ oldest hoon ” in Victoria to have his car confiscated for speeding , local media said on Tuesday .
“ It is disappointing to see a senior member of our community being so irresponsible , ” Acting Police Sergeant Carlo Visser told Melbourne ’s Herald - Sun newspaper .
“ What example does this set for younger drivers ? ” said Visser .
On 13 January , George W Bush presented presidential “ medals of freedom ” , said to be America ’s highest recognition of devotion to freedom and peace .
Among the recipients were Tony Blair , the epic liar who , with Bush , bears responsibility for the physical , social and cultural destruction of an ­entire nation ; John Howard , the former prime minister of Australia and minor American vassal who led the most openly racist government in his country ’s modern era ; and Alvaro Uribe , the president of Colombia , whose government , according to the latest study of that murderous state , is “ responsible for more than 90 per cent of all cases of torture ” .
As satire was made redundant years ago when Henry Kissinger and Rupert Murdoch were ­honoured for their contributions to the betterment of humanity , Bush 's ceremony was , at least , telling of a system of which he and his freshly minted successor are products .
Although more spectacular in its choreographed histrionics , Barack Obama 's inauguration carried a similar Orwellian message of inverted truth .
The continuity between the two administrations has been as seamless as the transfer of the odious Bono 's allegiance , symbolised by President Obama 's oath - taking on the steps of Congress - where , only days earlier , the House of Representatives , dominated by the new president 's party , the Democrats , voted 390 - 5 to back Israel 's massacres in Gaza .
The supply of American weapons used in the massacres was authorised previously by such a margin .
These included the Hellfire missile , which sucks the air out of lungs , ruptures livers and amputates arms and legs without the necessity of shrapnel : a " major advance " , according to the specialist literature .
As a senator , the then President - elect Obama raised no objection to these state - of - the - art [ sic ] weapons being rushed to Israel - worth $ 22bn in 2008 - in time for the long - planned assault on Gaza 's fenced and helpless population .
This is ­understandable ; it is how the system works .
On no other issue does Congress and the president , Republicans or Democrats , conservatives or liberals , give such absolute support .
By comparison , the ­German Reichstag in the 1930s was a treasure of ­democratic and principled debate .
Listen to newsreaders use pejoratives for Palestinians , calling them militants when they are resisters to invasion
This is not to say that presidents and members of Congress fail to recognise the Israel " lobbyists " in their midst as thugs and political blackmailers , though they never say so in public , because they fear them .
For their part , the Israelis ' current , phoney " unilateral ceasefire " in Gaza is designed not to embarrass , not yet , its new man in the White House .
Obama 's single acknowledgement of the " suffering " of the Palestinians has been long eclipsed by his loyalty oaths to Tel Aviv ( even promising Jerusalem as Israel 's capital , which not even Bush did ) and his appointment of probably the most pro-Zionist administration for a generation .
As deserving as Blair , Howard and Uribe are of the Bush freedom medal , others cry out for a place in their company .
With the assault on Gaza a defining moment of truth and lies , principle and cowardice , peace and war , justice and injustice , I have two nominees .
My first is the government and society of Israel .
( I checked ; the freedom medal can be awarded collectively . )
" Few of us , " wrote Arthur Miller , " can easily surrender our belief that society must somehow make sense .
The thought that the state has lost its mind and is punishing so many innocent people is intolerable .
And so the evidence has to be internally denied . "
The bleak irony of this should be clear to all in Israel , yet its denial has emboldened a militarist , racist cult that uses every epithet against the Palestinians that was once directed at Jews , with the exception of extermination - and even that is not entirely excluded , as the deputy ­defence minister , Matan Vilnai , noted last year with his threat of a shoah ( holocaust ) .
In 1948 , the year Israel 's right to exist was granted and Palestine 's annulled , Albert Einstein , Hannah Arendt and other leading Jews in the United States warned the administration not to get involved with " fascists " such as Menachem Begin , who became an Israeli prime minister .
This fascism , which was not often flouted openly , was the harbinger of Likud and Kadima .
These are today " mainstream " political parties , whose influence , in the treatment of the Palestinians , covers a national " consensus " - that is the source of the present terror in Palestine : the brutal dispossessions and perfidious controls , the humiliation and cruelty by statute .
The mirror of this is domestic violence at home .
Conscripted soldiers return from their " war " on Palestinian women and children and make war on their own .
Young whites drafted into South Africa 's apartheid army did the same .
Inhumanity on such a scale cannot be buried indefinitely .
When Desmond Tutu described his experience ?
in Palestine and Israel as " worse than apartheid " , he pointed out that not even in white supremacist South Africa were there the equivalent of " Jews only " roads .
Uri Avnery , one of Israel 's bravest dissidents , says his country 's leaders suffer from " moral insanity " : a prerequisite , I should add , for the award of a Bush freedom medal .
My other nominee for a Bush freedom medal is that amorphous group known as western­­ ­journalism , which has always made much of its freedom and impartiality .
Listen to the way Israeli " spokespersons " and ambassadors are interviewed .
How respectfully their official lies are received ; how minimally they are challenged .
They are one of us , you see : calm and western - sounding , even blonde , female and attractive .
The frightened , jabbering voice on the line from Gaza is not one of us .
That is the sub­liminal message .
Listen to newsreaders use only the pejoratives for the Palestinians , describing them as " militants " when they are resisters to invasion , even heroes , a word never used .
Mark the timeless propaganda that suggests there are two equal powers fighting a " war " , not a stricken people , attacked and starved by the world 's fourth - largest military power and which ensures they have no places of refuge .
And note the omissions - the BBC does not preface its reports with the warning that a foreign power controls its reporters ' movements , as it did in Serbia and Argentina , neither does it explain why it shows only glimpses of the remarkable coverage of al - Jazeera from within Gaza .
There are , too , the ubiquitous myths : that Israel has suffered terribly from thousands of missiles fired from Gaza .
In truth , the first homemade Qassam rocket was fired across the Israeli border in October 2001 ; the first fatality occurred in June 2004 .
Some 24 Israelis have been killed in this way , compared with 5,000 Palestinians killed , more than half of them in Gaza , at least a third of them children .
Now imagine if the 1.5 million Gazans had been Jewish , or Kosovar refugees .
" The only honorable course for Europe and America is to use military force to try to protect the people of Kosovo . . . " declared the Guardian on 23 March 1999 .
Inexplicably , the Guardian has yet to call for such " an honorable course " to protect the people of Gaza .
Such is the rule of acceptable victims and unacceptable victims .
When reporters break this rule they are accused of " anti-Israel bias " and worse , and their life is made a misery by a hyperactive cyber-army that drafts complaints , provides generic material and coaches people all over the world on how to smear as " anti-Jewish " work they have not seen .
These vociferous campaigns are complemented by anonymous death threats , which I and others have experienced .
The latest tactic is malicious hacking into websites .
But that is desperate , since the times are changing .
Across the world , people once indifferent to the arcane " conflict " in the Middle East now ask the question the BBC and CNN rarely ask :
Why does Israel have a right to exist , but Palestine does not ?
They ask , too , why do the lawless enjoy such special immunity in the pristine world of balance and objectivity ?
The perfectly spoken Israeli " spokesman " represents the most lawless regime on earth , ­exotic tyrannies included , according to a tally of United Nations resolutions defied and Geneva Conventions defiled .
In France , 80 organisations are working to bring war crimes indictments against Israel 's leaders .
On 15 January , the fine ­Israeli reporter , Gideon Levy , wrote in Ha'aretz that Israeli generals " will not be the only ones to hide in El Al planes lest they be arrested [ overseas ] " .
One day , other journalists and their editors and producers may be called on to not only explain why they did not tell the truth about these criminals but even to stand in the dock with them .
No Bush freedom medal is worth that .
While reading the Parents Television Council 's latest report :
The " New " Tube : A Content Analysis of YouTube — the Most Popular Online Video Destination , I kept thinking of Supreme Court Justice William Brennan 's eloquent dissent to Pacifica vs. FCC .
The 1978 ruling upheld the Federal Communications Commission 's sanctioning of a radio station for broadcasting George Carlin's " seven dirty words " routine , but Brennan did not concur .
" There are many who think , act , and talk differently from the Members of this Court , and who do not share their fragile sensibilities , " he wrote .
" It is only an acute ethnocentric myopia that enables the Court to approve the censorship of communications solely because of the words they contain . "
Back then , there was no Internet as we love it or hate it today , but Brennan would n't be surprised at the PTC 's latest broadside , which targets the naughty pictures , sounds , and talk on Google 's online video showcase .
The survey finds that the top - ranking videos that appear in the sites ' most frequently accessed search phrases yield " an extraordinary amount of graphic and adult - themed content . "
PTC wants something done about that , and about all those gnarly user comments that get posted below the vids , too .
The Council 's conclusions come from an analysis of 280 YouTube offerings .
When PTC inspectors searched for the term " porn , " for example , over a quarter of the videos returned did n't ask for age verification , they claim .
Many included ads or links to pornographic Web sites .
" Clicking a link would instantly take the user to a webpage containing extremely graphic photos and videos of homosexual and heterosexual oral and anal sex , " PTC complains .
The Council also does not like the words that are sometimes spoken in these videos ; we could provide a list of the milder terms its inspectors found , but suspect that they were further horrified by items even we avoid using .
While the survey praises YouTube for prohibiting outright pornographic videos and " algorithmically demoting " sexually suggestive fare , the decency group criticizes the company for taking no steps to reign in user comments , which its authors find at least as disturbing as the videos themselves .
From July 1 , 2008 through August 5 , 2008 , the PTC's " analysts , " as they call themselves , collected not only videos , but user remarks .
PTC 's researchers did searches using what they defined as " child friendly " terms .
These included " Miley Cyrus , " " Jonas Brothers , " " High School Musical , " and " Hannah Montana , " which they say resulted in " highly offensive " content in the text commentary areas below the videos produced by the search . "
The Hannah Montana search supposedly picked up a variety of obscenities that indicated YouTube users have a low opinion of the character herself , and suspect her of engaging in various sexual activities .
Just out of curiosity , I did my own search on the same name .
Here are the first four comments below the first video that I got .
Hannah Montana rules
I love shows and music everyday I listen to her music I love the music the most I almost forgot do n't let anyone bring you down like monkeygirl324 is trying to do she 's jealou .
This is the real Miley !
i love you miley im your number 1 fan
hey how are u ?
Not exactly the most scintillating online dialogue I 've run into , but pretty far from the PTC 's excerpts .
In any event , the group wants YouTube to take action on the terrible comments they supposedly found , " by formulating and adopting a thorough , accurate and transparent content rating system which would allow a parent to block a child from viewing age - inappropriate material . "
Because YouTube is an Internet service , the Council can't launch the same kind of complaint - driven pressure campaign that it constantly runs against broadcast TV using the FCC 's indecency rules .
But it can still conduct a moral pressure campaign on advertisers .
" Sponsors must maintain a diligent awareness of the material whose distribution they are underwriting with their advertising dollars , " the document 's conclusion warns .
Apparently , it did not occur to PTC 's analysts that the Hannah Montana commentaries they cite may have been written by the very children that the morals group says it wants to protect .
Frankly , the comments ' tone reminds me of some the more heated comments that occasionally get posted in response stories at Ars Technica .
Ars is n't about to implement a system that censored posts without considering their content , and I would n't want one the world 's most popular Web sites pressured into cooking up a filtering system that blocks words that are used by millions of passionate people to express themselves online about politics and government .
Pacifica vs. FCC , Justice Brennan predicted , will have its biggest impact on broadcasters seeking to reach people " who do not share the Court 's view as to which words or expressions are acceptable and who , for a variety of reasons , including a conscious desire to flout majoritarian conventions , express themselves using words that may be regarded as offensive by those from different socio- economic backgrounds . "
" In this context , " he added , " the Court 's decision may be seen for what , in the broader perspective , it really is : another of the dominant culture 's inevitable efforts to force those groups who do not share its mores to conform to its way of thinking , acting , and speaking . "

The LRA are notorious for abducting children and mutilating victims
More than 400 people have been killed by Ugandan rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo in attacks since Christmas day , aid agency Caritas says .
The head of Caritas in DR Congo told the BBC some 20,000 people had fled to the mountains from the rebels , who have denied carrying out the attacks .
An eyewitness told the BBC that five people in Faradje had their lips cut off by Lord 's Resistance Army fighters .
They were told that it was a warning not to speak ill of the rebels .
The armies of Uganda , South Sudan and DR Congo carried out a joint offensive against the rebels in mid-December after LRA leader Joseph Kony again refused to sign a peace deal .
The LRA leader , who has lived in a jungle hideout in north - eastern DR Congo for the last few years , is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Uganda 's government had been involved in lengthy peace negotiations with the LRA , hosted by the South Sudanese government .
But Mr Kony has demanded that arrest warrants for him and his associates be dropped before any agreement can be struck .
' Hacked to death '
News of the attacks in north - eastern DR Congo began to come out after the weekend when the Ugandan army accused the LRA of hacking to death 45 civilians in a Catholic church near Doruma .
All villages were burned by rebels
Caritas 's Bruno Mitewo
Congo terror after LRA rebel raids Bruno Mitewo , head of the Catholic aid agency , says that from information they have collated from their parishes on the ground , more than 400 civilians have died in the attacks .
He said that in Faradje 150 civilians had died , almost 75 people in Duru and 215 in Doruma .
The victims had been hacked to death and forced into fires , he said .
" All villages were burned by rebels ... we do n't know where exactly the population is because all the villages are empty , " he told the BBC .
" We have almost 6,500 displaced who are refugees in the parishes of the Catholic Church around the city of Dungu , more than 20,000 people displaced are running to the mountains , " he said .
Those who were hiding in the bush and forest were mainly the young , as the LRA tends to kidnap children and recruit them as fighters , he said .
An eyewitness in Faradje said the people who had their lips cut off were being treated for their injuries .
Earlier , LRA spokesman David Nekorach Matsanga told the BBC that the allegations that the massacres had been perpetrated by LRA fighters were untrue .
He said rebel units were not in the areas concerned and said a group of LRA defectors who joined the Ugandan army may have been responsible .
Many thousands of Congolese villagers fled their homes after LRA attacks near Dungu in October .
Countries from Uganda to the Central African Republic have suffered 20 years of terror inflicted by the LRA .
Tens of thousands of children have been abducted to be fighters and sex slaves .
Uganda 's government said the joint offensive had destroyed some 70 % of the LRA camps in DR Congo .
BBC Africa analyst Martin Plaut says that Mr Kony 's force is relatively small - about 650 strong - but the difficulty is that when it is hit , it scatters and then regroups .

This is a guide that , if followed , will unchain your Apple TV from its cruel iTunes tether , turning it into the useful living room conduit of music , video and web - based content it should have been all along via the media center software Boxee .
Boxee can be installed fairly easily via the ATV's USB port to bring Hulu and Comedy Central streaming , playback of any video or music file anywhere on your network in virtually any file type imagineable , and a bevy of internet A/V sources like Flickr , Last.fm , NPR and BBC podcasts and tons of others - all upping the usefulness and fun of Apple 's notoriously underachieving box by a factor of 10 , easily .
If you have an ATV , Boxee is a must - install , and it 's 100 % free .
Let 's get started .

The stock Apple TV has never been able to decide what it 's supposed to do .
Is it a device to store all your videos ?
Its built - in hard drive would suggest yes , but the fact that everything needs to be piped through iTunes makes this a hassle if you store your videos in any other way .
And why are we downloading and storing anyway ?
Streaming is the way things are headed , and for streaming , Apple TV does n't make a ton of sense , especially when a box a quarter its size and a less than half its price can bring Netflix 's massive library into your living room with zero download delays and zero added cost , soon in HD , even .

Aside from adding the golden goose of Hulu streaming , Boxee 's other main advantage is freeing your Apple TV from its direct connection with your iTunes library .
No longer will it be necessary to convert all of your video files into iTunes compatible formats to get them to your TV - Boxee will let your Apple TV read just about any video codec you can throw at it ( full list of codecs here - only thing it chokes on is 1080 p video ; 720 p works fine ) from any computer or network - attached storage device on your network , or read files off the Apple TV 's own hard disk - all while leaving the default OS untouched and 100 % functional .
So let 's do this .
What You 'll Need :
• Apple TV with software version 2.0 or higher
• A USB flash drive 512MB or larger
• ATV USB Creator [ download : 1.0.b7 version - Mac only , for now ]
• An invite into Boxee 's semi-public alpha ( use this link especially for Giz readers to jump the line a bit )
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Prepare Your USB Drive
Just like the iPhone , the Apple TV is basically an OS X computer ( running a 1GHz Intel processor ) , so Boxee installs just like a regular desktop app in the Applications folder , which is hidden normally .
Why Apple has n't opened up the Apple TV to third party developers is anyone 's guess , but thankfully , with a prepared USB stick it 's all pretty painless .

1 . After unpacking the ATV USB Creator application , start it up with the USB flash drive you intend to use mounted .
Select " ATV - Patchstic " as your installation option and " Boxee for Mac " as the installation type .
At the bottom , select the BSD location of your flash disk .
You can find this with System Profiler under the USB section ( probably a good idea to unmount any other USB drives so you do n't accidentally wipe them ) .
2. Click " Create Using -> " and your USB stick will be formatted and loaded up with the appropriate software .
Advertisement
3 . Power off your Apple TV ( by unplugging it ) , drop your USB patchstick into the ATV's USB slot , and plug it back in .
You 'll see Tux and a bunch of code streaming on your screen as the software installs .

Download Boxee via the Boxee Launcher
5 . The USB patchstick installs a launcher that can then pull down the latest version of Boxee from the web .
The first thing you 'll want to do , then , to ensure you have the latest version , is update the launcher itself .
Go to the new option " Boxee " in the ATV menu , choose " Update " and then update the Launcher .
6 . Now , go to the new Boxee menu and choose " Update " ->
" Boxee alpha ... " to pull down and install Boxee itself .
Once it installs , select " Boxee " from the new menu " Boxee / XBMC " menu to start it up .

What 's Next For Boxee
Boxee is on the move .
Over the course of three alphas I 've used ( I can't believe this is alpha software ) over only the last month or so , this thing has improved by incredible bounds - interface is getting better , weirdness and inconsistencies getting less common , all good signs .
Eventually , Boxee wants to be in set top boxes and on every platform ( Windows is coming before the end of the year ) - since it supports practically every audio and video codec known , it 's aiming to be the Firefox of multi-platform connected AV setups , featuring plug-ins and add - ons of its own .
It does n't support DRM of any kind , so do n't hold your breath for Boxee to be picked up by any of the majors .
Fine with me .

Silicon Valley has n’t been a prominent player in the pitched fundraising battle over whether to ban same - sex marriage in California — until now .
Google co-founder and president Sergey Brin this week donated $ 100,000 to the No on 8 campaign , while co-founder Larry Page added a $ 40,000 donation , a Mercury News analysis of state campaign finance records show .
With the contribution , Brin matches talk show host Ellen DeGeneres for the largest individual donation during the campaign ’s final weeks to oppose a proposed constitutional ban on same - sex marriage .
Google did not respond to initial requests for comment Thursday on the donations by Brin and Page , but the Mountain View Internet search giant is one of a very few Silicon Valley corporations officially on record opposing Prop .
8 .
“ While there are many objections to this proposition — further government encroachment on personal lives , ambiguously written text — it is the chilling and discriminatory effect of the proposition on many of our employees that brings Google to publicly oppose Proposition 8 , ” Brin wrote in an item he posted Sept. 26 on the official Google blog .
“ While we respect the strongly held beliefs that people have on both sides of this argument , we see this fundamentally as an issue of equality . ”
The six - figure donations by DeGeneres and Brin were among a group of large donations from celebrities and other prominent figures that recently have flowed into Equality California , the lead organization battling Prop .
8 . Marin County resident and “ Indiana Jones ” filmmaker George Lucas gave $ 50,000 , while Lucasfilm donated an additional $ 50,000 , both this week .
Actor T.R. Knight of “ Grey ’s Anatomy ” gave two $ 50,000 donations , while Monica Rosenthal , an actress in the comedy series “ Everybody Loves Raymond ” and the wife of series writer and executive producer Phil Rosenthal , gave $ 25,000 .
Those large donations are among $ 9.2 million in large donations received by Equality California ( www.noonprop8.com ) since Oct. 6 , when the dueling Prop. 8 campaigns last filed their extensive fundraising reports , according to records filed with the California Secretary of State .
ProtectMarriage.com , the lead political organization supporting a ban on same - sex marriage , has raised about $ 1.7 million in large donations since Oct. 6 , state records show .

‘ WASILLA HILLBILLIES LOOTING NEIMAN MARCUS ’….
There ’s plenty of time for the Republican recriminations to get completely out of hand , but in the meantime , would you believe McCain campaign aides are still fighting over Sarah Palin ’s wardrobe ?
NEWSWEEK has also learned that Palin ’s shopping spree at high - end department stores was more extensive than previously reported .
While publicly supporting Palin , McCain ’s top advisers privately fumed at what they regarded as her outrageous profligacy .
One senior aide said that Nicolle Wallace had told Palin to buy three suits for the convention and hire a stylist .
But instead , the vice presidential nominee began buying for herself and her family — clothes and accessories from top stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus .
According to two knowledgeable sources , a vast majority of the clothes were bought by a wealthy donor , who was shocked when he got the bill .
Palin also used low - level staffers to buy some of the clothes on their credit cards .
The McCain campaign found out last week when the aides sought reimbursement .
One aide estimated that she spent “ tens of thousands ” more than the reported $ 150,000 , and that $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 went to buy clothes for her husband .
Some articles of clothing have apparently been lost .
An angry aide characterized the shopping spree as “ Wasilla hillbillies looting Neiman Marcus from coast to coast , ” and said the truth will eventually come out when the Republican Party audits its books .
Also yesterday , Steve Schmidt refused to say that adding Palin to the ticket was a good idea , and someone dished to Newsweek that McCain “ rarely spoke to Palin during the campaign . ”
The point here is n’t whether the Palin family behaved like “ Wasilla hillbillies looting Neiman Marcus ” ; the point is that these reports suggest Palin will get the blame for much of what went wrong .
It started with McCain aides calling her a “ diva , ” and progressed to at least one aide calling her a “ whack job . ”
Now she ’s a “ Wasilla hillbilly ” ?
McCain ’s team could n’t destroy Obama , but they can certainly ruin Palin ’s future .
Pentagon planners say that it is possible that Mr. Obama ’s goal could be accomplished at least in part by relabeling some units , so that those currently counted as combat troops could be “ re-missioned , ” their efforts redefined as training and support for the Iraqis .

In Iraq today , there are 15 brigades defined as combat forces in this debate , with one on its way home .
But the overall number of troops on the ground is more than 50 brigade equivalents , for a total of 146,000 troops , including service and support personnel .
Even now , after the departure of the five “ surge ” brigades that President Bush sent to Iraq in January 2006 , the overall number of troops in Iraq remains higher than when Mr. Bush ordered the troop increase , owing to the number of support and service personnel remaining .
At his news conference in Chicago on Monday , Mr. Obama emphasized his willingness to listen to the advice from senior officers and that of his new national security team , which includes Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , the first Pentagon chief in history to continue serving under a newly elected president ; Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ; and , as national security adviser , Gen. James L. Jones , the retired four - star Marine officer who served as NATO ’s supreme commander .
Since the election , Mr. Obama has held unannounced consultations with both Mr. Gates and Admiral Mullen , described by Obama aides and Pentagon officials as having focused less on tactics and operations and more on broad , strategic views for American national security .
On Wednesday , he made a telephone call to Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , Iraq ’s prime minister , according to the Obama transition office .
To date , there has been no significant criticism from the antiwar left of the Democratic Party of the prospect that Mr. Obama will keep tens of thousands of troops in Iraq for at least several years to come .
At the Pentagon and the military headquarters in Iraq , the response to the statements this week from Mr. Obama and his national security team has been akin to the senior officer corps ’ letting out its collective breath ; the words sounded to them like the new president would take a measured approach on the question of troop levels .
“ I believe that 16 months is the right time frame , but , as I ’ve said consistently , I will listen to the recommendations of my commanders , ” Mr. Obama said at that news conference on Monday .
“ And my No. 1 priority is making sure that our troops remain safe in this transition phase , and that the Iraqi people are well served by a government that is taking on increased responsibility for its own security . ”

10,000 bone pieces confirm Argentina death camp 10,000 pieces found in pit where bodies were tossed , burned
Inside a once - secret detention center where political dissidents were tortured and killed during Argentina 's dictatorship 25 years ago , forensic anthropologists have discovered a pit containing 10,000 bone fragments .
The first discovery of human remains inside a detention center confirms the testimonies of hundreds of survivors who have said for years that authorities tortured , killed and burned the bodies of political opponents , they said this week .
" This scientifically confirms the testimonies of the detained , " said Luis Fondebrider , a forensic anthropologist who helped uncover the remains inside the former detention center in La Plata known as Arana .
The 10,000 bone fragments were unearthed between February and September , and on Tuesday Fondebrider and his team said the remains were human .
Now months of laboratory work is needed to determine even the minimum number of bodies that were destroyed in the pit .
But the evidence already shows that bodies were thrown into the pit , covered in fuel and burned along with tires , to mask the smell of burning flesh .
More than 200 bullet marks were found along a wall bordering the mass grave .
The bones were n't completely reduced to ash , allowing for genetic analysis to identify the dead .
But Fondebrider cautioned that it wo n't be possible to identify many of the victims , since prolonged exposure to fire destroys most DNA .
" This is the first time there is proof that Arana was n't only a detention and torture center , but also a center of elimination , " said Maria Vedio , 47 , legal chairwoman for the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights La Plata .
Some supporters of the military dictatorship have denied that detainees were tortured or killed , despite the well - documented toll from the " dirty war " crackdown in which political opponents of the junta were made to " disappear , " along with their spouses , children and other innocent people unlucky enough to appear in their address books .
Official records put the number of disappeared at 13,000 , while human rights groups say 30,000 were killed .
Much of the evidence disappeared as well - their bodies were thrown into the sea from airplanes in what were called death flights , while others were buried or burned in mass graves far from detention centers .
The confirmation of human remains at Arana refutes any efforts to deny this history , Vedio said .
The military and police operated about 10 detention centers during the 1976 - 83 dictatorship in La Plata , a city of universities south of Buenos Aires where the crackdown 's toll on college students was particularly severe .
The Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team has identified 350 bodies in Argentina over more than two decades .
At least 14 former Argentine state security agents and their civilian allies have been found guilty of human rights crimes , including forced disappearances and kidnapping .
Another 358 are awaiting trial , according to the Buenos Aires - based Center for Legal and Social Studies .
We live in our world that tells us that we need to be careful about what we eat .
Every day we are bombarded by stories about what is good for us and what is bad .
How do we distinguish between all of this chaos that goes around in our lives .
Life is already a challenge and having to eat a certain way makes it more stressful .
What is good and what is bad when eating ?
If you go to a supermarket , you will find an organic section which defies all the other sections in the store .
We question ourselves almost everyday on what we should or should n’t eat but at the end what makes sense .
Alan John McEwan had been convicted in the Parramatta Local Court of possessing child pornography and of using a carriage service to access child pornography material , the latter of which has a maximum penalty of 10 years ' jail .
The male figures in the cartoons had what appeared to be human genitalia , as did the mother and the girl depicted in the cartoons .
The magistrate said that , had the images involved real children , McEwan would have been jailed .
However , he was fined $ 3000 and required to enter into a two - year good behaviour bond in respect to each of the charges .
McEwan appealed against the decision , arguing that fictional cartoon characters could not be considered people as they " plainly and deliberately " departed from the human form .
" If the persons were real , such depictions could never be permitted , " Justice Adams said in his judgment .
" Their creation would constitute crimes at the very highest end of the criminal calendar . "
But Justice Adams agreed with the magistrate .
He found that , while The Simpsons characters had hands with four fingers and their faces were " markedly and deliberately different to those of any possible human being " , the mere fact that they were not realistic representations of human beings did not mean that they could not be considered people .
Justice Adams said the purpose of the legislation was to stop sexual exploitation and child abuse where images of " real " children are depicted .
However it was also to deter the production of other material , including cartoons , that could " fuel demand for material that does involve the abuse of children " .
He dismissed the appeal and ordered each party to pay its own costs as it was " the first case dealing with [ this ] difficult issue " .
Editor 's note : David Paterson , a Democrat , is governor of New York .
New York Gov. David Paterson says taxing soft drinks could help combat obesity .
ALBANY , New York ( CNN ) -- Like many New Yorkers , I remember a time when nearly everyone smoked .
In 1950 , Collier 's reported that more than three - quarters of adult men smoked .
This epidemic had a devastating and long - lasting impact on public health .
Today , we find ourselves in the midst of a new public health epidemic : childhood obesity .
What smoking was to my parents ' generation , obesity is to my children 's generation .
Nearly one out of every four New Yorkers under the age of 18 is obese .
In many high - poverty areas , the rate is closer to one out of three .
That is why , in the state budget I presented last Tuesday , I proposed a tax on sugared beverages like soda .
Research has demonstrated that soft - drink consumption is one of the main drivers of childhood obesity .
For example , a study by Harvard researchers found that each additional 12 - ounce soft drink consumed per day increases the risk of a child becoming obese by 60 percent .
For adults , the association is similar .
If we are to succeed in reducing childhood obesity , we must reduce consumption of sugared beverages .
That is the purpose of our proposed tax .
We estimate that an 18 percent tax will reduce consumption by five percent .
Our tax would apply only to sugared drinks -- including fruit drinks that are less than 70 percent juice -- that are nondiet .
The $ 404 million this tax would raise next year will go toward funding public health programs , including obesity prevention programs , across New York state .
The surgeon general estimates that obesity was associated with 112,000 deaths in the United States every year .
Here in New York state , we spend almost $ 6.1 billion on health care related to adult obesity -- the second - highest level of spending in the nation .
Last year , legitimate concerns about links between consumption of fast food and the prevalence of heart disease prompted New York City to ban the use of trans fats in restaurant food .
No one can deny the urgency of reducing the rate of obesity , including childhood obesity .
Obesity causes serious health problems like type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol .
It puts children at much greater risk for life - threatening conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer .
We must never stigmatize children who are overweight or obese .
Yet , for the sake of our children 's health , we have an obligation to address this crisis .
I believe we can ultimately curb the obesity epidemic the same way we curbed smoking : through smart public policy .
In recent decades , anti-smoking campaigns have raised awareness .
Smoking bans have been enacted and enforced .
And , perhaps most importantly , we have raised the price of cigarettes .
In June , New York state raised the state cigarette tax an additional $ 1.25 .
According to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids , this increase alone will prevent more than 243,000 kids from smoking , save more than 37,000 lives and produce more than $ 5 billion in health care savings .
These taxes may be unpopular , but their benefits are undeniable .
Last month , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that , for the first time in generations , fewer than 20 percent of Americans smoked .
Lung cancer rates have finally begun to decline .
As a result , we are all healthier .
Just as the cigarette tax has helped reduce the number of smokers and smoking - related deaths , a tax on highly caloric , non-nutritional beverages can help reduce the prevalence of obesity .
To address the obesity crisis , we need more than just a surcharge on soda .
We need to take junk food out of our schools .
We need to encourage our children to exercise more .
And we need to increase the availability of healthy food in underserved communities .
But to make serious progress in this effort , we need to reduce the consumption of high - calorie drinks like nondiet soda among children and adults .
I understand that New Yorkers may not like paying a surcharge for their favorite drinks .
But surely it 's a small price to pay for our children 's health .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Paterson .

Cover Awards notices that Angelina Jolie got " duped " by German Cosmopolitan , because she looks weird .
Well , she also got duplicated , as a tipster points out to us .
International Cosmo has used the same few pouty , one - leg - out Jolie shots for many of her international covers .
They just kinda Photoshop a new dress color on , maybe move the arm position a bit .
( The new German issue is identical to the shot used on Italian Cosmo in October 2003 . )
But they 're all essentially the same couple of alien , hyper - airbrushed images .
Take a look at a gallery below .
The Outsiders ' work is actually chosen very subjectively .
It 's just a collection of work I admire , as do other people it seems from the numbers .
The Outsiders ' show that we have running in New York , has , since 26 September , had more than 30,000 visitors , and this is without any advertising for the show .
This more than anything gives an indication of the populist nature of the work , and how far it has come in the past decade .
The internet has played a huge part in the popularity of the Outsider artists .
What other museum is open 24 hours a day , seven days a week , with no entry fee ?
All the artists have websites and a considerable net presence .
Mostly , though , the art we show is so popular now because people enjoy its aesthetics as well as its messages , even if they do n't agree with them .
We live in highly politicised times and that does n't get addressed a great deal by culture .
The majority of the Outsiders ' work is very accessible – you do n't need an art history degree to understand it ; the same way an idea is n't necessarily any less powerful if not communicated in a complex manner .
Both the book and the show are entitled " Outsiders " because a considerable proportion of the artists included have chosen to display their work in the public domain of the street .
But equally they 're Outsiders because they 've made their name without taking the traditional path .
Many have n't had any formal art training .
Some landed on my desk by chance .
But most I took the first step in approaching after seeing their work in – or on – their chosen medium of the " outside " world .
These artists ' greatest claim to the tag of " Outsiders " , however , is that while they 've regularly been accused of " not being art " they 've ended up gracing major museums and art galleries .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
From the start our supporters have ranged from landed gentry to teenagers .
We 've always encouraged gallery visitors to simply come and see the art – the last thing I want is for them to feel at all nervous around the work , or that they do n't have the credentials to be there .
All they have in common is a personality that 's drawn to the new and is n't swayed by orthodoxy .
I believe most people generally find contemporary art to be quite personal and also rather intimidating .
They want to be excited and entertained , which is maybe something they 've missed out on in the age of white boxes and private views , where it 's all as much about commodity as the work itself .
Hob - nobbing and money may be fun , but the Outsider artists are n't producing their work just so a millionaire can put their work up in his Swiss chalet .
They do it to communicate their message to a mass audience .
Some of these artists travel the world exposing their work and ploughing the money they gain from selling pieces back into even more ambitious projects .
This purity of purpose is easy for everyone to admire .

Polly Morgan
Traditionally , taxidermists place their preserved animal corpses in scenes which replicate their natural surroundings , mimicking and containing what we think to be " nature " in a glass box .
Polly Morgan subverts this craft to create an art form , by constructing sculptural moments that often ask us to look again at the beauty of nature and the artifice of modern life .
A dead rat , for example , becomes less about disease and squalor when placed inside the context of a champagne glass , just as the glass becomes less about decadence and luxury .
Polly 's art fits in with the rest of the Outsiders in that it inventively jolts the viewer into re-evaluating their environment .
Rabbits sleep on hats rather than being pulled out of them , and dead birds are served on golden platters .
Our relationship to the natural world seems less predictable and straightforward when Polly Morgan creates her taxidermy situations .
3D
Robert Del Naja 's painting and graphic design work have visually represented the music of his band , Massive Attack , for almost two decades .
Under his tag 3D was a central figure in the Bristol graffiti movement , and his more recent work has a hypnotic quality to it .
Often depicting faceless zombie - like figures , his powerful and haunting work has been a massive influence on many of today 's Outsider artists .
Jonathan Yeo
Jonathan
Yeo might be termed an inside - Outsider .
A talented self - taught portrait painter , he 's nonetheless created of some of the most controversial and amusing artworks of the past few years .
His representations of the great and the good are often coloured by a very scampish sense of irony , even in his traditional portraiture .
For instance , when commissioned as official artist of the 2001 General Election , each of the party leaders was scaled according to their electoral popularity .
It is , however , with his more recent porn collages of public figures like George Bush , Gordon Brown , Lucian Freud and Paris Hilton that Yeo has become legendary .
Pushing his irreverent attitude to celebrity as far as decency will allow , his work comments wittily on the proliferation and disposability of images of today 's elite .
Antony Micallef
Antony Micallef is an accomplished painter and sculptor who has managed to achieve recognition within the art establishment ( in November his work will feature in the Royal Academy 's GSK Contemporary season ) , and yet continue to maintain an uneasy relationship with the mainstream .
His work , at once beautiful and troubling , examines the tensions and hypocrisies in our relationships with consumerism and capitalism .
Micallef 's art often evokes that very contemporary sense of loneliness that is felt when we make friends with brands rather than people , and questions how we can profess to be suspicious or critical of multinational companies , and yet allow ourselves to be repeatedly seduced by their wares .
Paul Insect
Paul Insect is one of cult art 's most colourful talents , and an increasingly daring one .
His last exhibition , which was held in a former sex shop and Victorian bath house in King 's Cross , north London , featured an extraordinary body of work – literally , a body of work , as bronze casts of skeletons and skulls decked out in Playboy Bunny gear savagely and wittily forced the viewer to think about the commodification of sex in our modern world .
In both sculpture and his paintings and graphic work , Paul is at his core a satirist .
As he strips layers off the most recognisable motifs of mass media to reveal the violence , greed and depravity that often lie beneath , we wonder at the seamy world we seem to have made for ourselves .
Conor Harrington
In both style and subject , Conor 's work presents a colourful fusion of the traditional and the contemporary .
Painted figures of heroic men in military attire might be found in any stately home or museum , but as handled by Conor , such images take on an intriguing modern resonance .
His uniformed figures are less about some historic military elite , and more about modern men , and how they connect to " old- fashioned " values like courage , dignity and stoicism .
The graffiti and vibrantly graphic elements refer to alternative cultures of contemporary masculinity , such as hip - hop , and immediately ask us if there is such a thing as some timeless quality of manliness that carries through the ages .
Mark Jenkins
Mark Jenkins is undoubtedly the mischief - maker of the Outsiders , a prankster who nonetheless reveals a serious purpose with his urban interventions .
Using Scotch Tape ( well , Sellotape – he's from Washington DC , so we 'll forgive him ) , he makes empty life - scale casts of human forms , dresses them in his own hand - me - down clothes , and then leaves them in alarming , surreal or impossible situations on our streets .
These dummies , fabricated from the most disposable of materials yet clad in recycled garb , startle passers - by into remembering to look at the homeless and outcast of the modern city , and reflect on the things , and people , we allow ourselves to throw away .
Vhils
Portuguese - born Alexandre Farto ranges in his work from collage to portraiture , and has recently focused on the creative use of found materials .
The idea of Vandalism As Art is taken to its conclusion , as advertising billboards are torn away to make fresh images , and plaster is drilled away until the remaining relief forms the work .
Faile
This New York collective is responsible for some of the smartest and most instantly recognisable art in the Outsiders movement .
Their work both uses and pastiches the throw - away pop imagery of advertising , flyposting , comic books and TV , to create paintings , many of which are layered and collaged , which hum with a quintessentially American energy .

An appeal to review my game , Forumwarz .
Dear Brian Crecente ,
My name is Robin Ward , I go by the alias Evil Trout .
( this is an open letter , also published on the Forumwarz blog . )
I ’m the creator of a web - based RPG game called Forumwarz .
It parodies the Internet .
Instead of traditional RPG games where you might play a thief in a dungeon battling orcs , you play an Internet user , pwning message boards .
We currently have about 100k accounts , and a small ( yet awesome ) community .
It ’s an indie effort .
It was self - financed and made over the period of several years by a team of people working for very little money .
To say it ’s a labor of love is a huge understatement .
I have personally emailed you and members of your team several times about the game , hoping you ’d mention us on your blog or to see if you ’d want a review copy .
Every single time it has fallen on deaf ears .
I ’m not sure if you know this or not , but for an Indie Game , getting one mention on a mainstream blog such as your own can make a huge difference .
It might not seem like it , but a single link to our game can generate thousands of dollars in revenue , which can mean we can keep working on improving the game and making it better .
It costs you nothing to do this .
You ’re not alone in ignoring us .
We have tried to contact pretty much every major online gaming publication , including your competitors and large review sites .
People just are n’t interested in what we have to say because we do n’t have the backing of a major publisher .
I understand that as the editor , the content of your site is completely at your discretion .
Maybe you think our game is immature or not fit for your audience .
It ’s your right to publish whatever you want .
However , when I see articles published in the Pantsu tag featuring the panty shots of Nintendo characters , while our hard work goes ignored , it does sting a bit .
This letter is an appeal to you : please consider the small games like my own alongside the games from major publishers .
Yes , Gears of War 2 and Smash Brothers Melee are awesome games , but they get dozens of mentions on your blog while most indie games get none .
I ’m aware Braid got coverage , but that game is the exception and not the rule .
Obviously I ’m biased , but I think a lot of your users would appreciate my game and would be glad you mentioned it .
Recently you posted a blog entry asking people for review ideas .
Besides my own , there are tons of other indie games that could use reviews .
If you ’re looking for examples , check out the Indie Games Festival entries .
There are literally hundreds of submissions , many of which are playable right now if you click on the game profiles .
Thank you very much ,
Robin “ Evil Trout ” Ward
JAMES PACKER may not be able to rely on return visits from all of his high rollers when his keenly awaited Macau casino City of Dreams opens later this year .
Revenues at high - roller casinos in Macau are down due to a lack in repeat business because many of their big - spending patrons do n't make it back to the tables for the roll of the dice .
Casino owner James Packer .
According to a study of 99 high rollers from mainland China whose gambling habits propelled them into the headlines , 44 per cent were either sentenced to death , murdered , committed suicide or were serving long jail sentences after committing crimes to fund their visits .
Zeng Zhonglu , a professor at the Macau Polytechnic Institute , found 15 of the gamblers were sentenced to death , seven committed suicide or were " killed by others " , two were given a death sentence reprieve and 20 were serving long jail sentences .
At least 10 Chinese companies collapsed , casualties of the massive gambling losses by big - spending players , known in the industry as " whales " .
Arar v. Ashcroft was a federal lawsuit challenging the rendition to torture of Canadian citizen Maher Arar by U.S. government officials .
Mr. Arar was detained at JFK airport in September 2002 while on his way home to Canada from abroad .
He was interrogated , detained for two weeks , denied access to a court and meaningful access to counsel , and secretly rendered to Syria where he was tortured and held in a grave - like underground cell for over ten months .
He was never charged with a crime .
Mr. Arar ’s lawsuit was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Attorney General John Ashcroft , Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson , FBI Director Robert Mueller , and several U.S. immigration officials for violating his constitutional right to due process and the Torture Victim Protection Act.
Mr. Arar alleged that the officials violated his Fifth Amendment rights by conspiring to subject him to arbitrary detention and torture in Syria and by blocking his access to court to ensure that he could not stop them .
The U.S. government official defendants challenged the suit , claiming that even if Mr. Arar ’s allegations were true , he had no judicial remedy .
The U.S. government also asked that the court dismiss the case , arguing it would expose “ state secrets ” and harm national security .
In 2006 , Judge Trager dismissed Mr. Arar ’s claims , finding that “ national security ” and “ foreign policy ” considerations prevented him from holding U.S. officials liable .
Mr. Arar appealed this decision to a three - judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals , which affirmed the dismissal 2 - 1 in June 2008 , agreeing with the lower court that Mr. Arar ’s claims would interfere with national security .
In an extremely rare move , the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decided that Mr. Arar ’s appeal would be reheard by the full active court in December 2008 .
On November 2 , 2009 , the full Court of Appeals dismissed the case 7 - 4 , concluding that in cases of extraordinary rendition , it is not the court ’s role to decide whether U.S. officials can be held accountable , because of foreign policy , national security , and secrecy concerns .
In a strongly worded dissent , Judge Guido Calabresi wrote , “ I believe that when the history of this distinguished court is written , today ’s majority decision will be viewed with dismay . ”
For more information , read CCR 's factsheet and report on his rendition and watch Mr. Arar speak about his experience .
Peter Schiff identifies real cause of financial disaster , CNN cuts the feed

Thursday , December 4 , 2008
Technical difficulties or deliberate censorship ?
CNN does not usually afford a soapbox to Peter Schiff because he ’s one of a rare breed of financial analysts , he can actually identify the root of the problem – the Federal Reserve .
So when Schiff was cut off during the height of his rant against the Fed , many of our readers questioned whether it was a deliberate act of sabotage .
Used to doling out a steady diet of bailout propaganda on a daily basis , CNN bosses were probably not amused when Schiff started to blame the government ’s obsession with rescuing failed companies for the deepening severity of the economic crisis .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Capitalism is not about propping up failed companies , we need to let them fail , ” said Schiff , before adding , “ Now of course behind it all is the Federal Reserve , if the Federal Reserve had not intervened …. had they not poured all this alcohol then Wall Street would n’t have got drunk , but they did . ”
“ I am convinced that everything the government is doing to fight this off is gonna make …. ” said Schiff before the feed was cut .
Conspiracy or technical gremlins ?
Either way , it ’s unlikely that CNN will invite Schiff back on should he continue to dare tell the truth about the real culprits behind the grand larceny undertaken by the government and the Federal Reserve , the cost of which now stands at $ 8.5 trillion dollars .

Snow splatters the suburbs
Sun weather coverage Las Vegas weather conditions and forecast
Snow Day Heavy snow came to the Spring Mountains and the Red Rock Canyon area of the Las Vegas Valley .
UPDATED STORY : Snow begins melting off in Las Vegas
A rare snowstorm blanketed the Las Vegas Valley on Wednesday , delaying flights , causing widespread fender - benders and canceling events .
As much as 8 inches of snow fell in parts of the valley , forecasters said this morning .
The rarities continued Wednesday night with the Clark County School District 's announcement that students are getting a snow day today .
It 's the first snow day for Clark County students since 1979 , when a storm dropped 9.9 inches of snow in January that year .
With ice and snow on the roads , and district buses responsible for transporting more than 80,000 students , closing school was the prudent move , Superintendent Walt Rulffes said .
Bus drivers , teachers and other classroom employees will also have the day off .
Administrators , 12 - month employees and office staff are expected to be at work , since some students might show up at school and require adult assistance , Rulffes explained in an e-mail to staff .
In a statement this morning , the school district said all school - based food service personnel , food service truck drivers and warehouse employees are not to report for work .
However , all other food service personnel shall report for work or contact their supervisor .
School Board President Mary Beth Scow said she planned to spend the day watching holiday movies and baking cookies with her grandchildren , who will have the day off from school .
She said she did n't envy the teachers who will have a hard enough time keeping students ' attention on Friday , the last day before the two - week winter break .
A makeup day might be scheduled later in the school year .
Additional information on school closures will be posted on the district 's Web site at ccsd .
net .
The National Weather Service finally lifted a winter storm warning at 6 a.m. today .
The weather service said its Las Vegas office had reported 3.6 inches of snow by 9:50 p.m. Wednesday .
And there was a report of 8 inches measured in Henderson shortly after 9 p.m. Wednesday .
The weather service said the main low pressure area was centered over northern Clark County at 3:30 a.m. today and was moving slowly east .
Heavy snow had already fallen over much of the warning area and another 2 to 4 inches would be possible above the 2,500 - foot level elevations through early morning , the weather service said .
The weather service this morning urged travelers to take with them warm clothing , an extra flashlight , food and water in their vehicles in case of an emergency and to be alert for slippery spots on roads .
The warning area included Las Vegas , North Las Vegas , Henderson and Boulder City .
An advisory from the weather service Wednesday afternoon called the snow event " extremely rare . "
The 3.6 inches of snow through late Wednesday at the weather service office two miles southwest of McCarran International Airport set a record for the most snow ever in the month of December in Las Vegas since the beginning of official records in 1937 , the weather service said .
The office is the official recording station for weather in the Las Vegas Valley .
Measurable snow has only fallen on four other occasions since 1937 in December , the weather service said : 2 inches on Dec. 15 , 1967 ; 0.4 inches on Dec. 5 , 1972 ; 1 inch on Dec. 6 , 1998 ; and 1.3 inches on Dec. 30 , 2003 .
Not all areas of the Las Vegas Valley had snow accumulations because a mix of rain and snow fell much of the time .
Also , warm ground temperatures kept the snow from sticking in some areas , the weather service said .
Downtown Las Vegas and the northern parts of the Strip saw snow , but little to no accumulation , the weather service said .
However , 1.7 inches of snow was measured on The Strip at the " Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas , Nevada " sign .
Areas of heaviest snow measured between 3 to 6 inches , with local amounts of 8 - plus inches in Henderson , the weather service said .
Flights at McCarran resume
The heavy snow caused numerous delays at McCarran International Airport on Wednesday , but airport officials announced this morning that arriving and departing flights operations resumed around 6 a.m .
While McCarran did n't close overnight , low visibility caused by the snow had stopped activity from late Wednesday afternoon until early this morning .
The airport is the seventh busiest in the country .
Airport officials said the snow that accumulated overnight on McCarran 's runways is melting under the morning sunlight and each of the airport 's three runways is open for flight operations .
Because of the poor weather condition Wednesday , many airlines cancelled flights and the Federal Aviation Administration issued a national ground stop that temporarily kept most aircraft bound for Las Vegas from departing .
Travelers who want to fly out of the airport today should contact their air carrier to find out their flight status , airport officials said .
Those expecting arriving passengers should also contact the appropriate airlines directly , officials said .
Flight information can also be obtained at www.mccarran.com.
Texans stranded at airport
More than 100 residents of a tiny Texas town who flew to Las Vegas last week paid for by the Las Vegas Convention and Tourism Authority remained stranded at the airport Wednesday night .
Men in cowboy hats slept next to each other near the McCarran exits after finding out their 3 p.m. flight to Cranfills Gap , Texas , was postponed until 9 a.m. Thursday morning .
" We thought we would be able to get back to the Gap and enjoy the sunshine , " said Laura Rose , a Cranfills Gap resident .
" Did n't think that we 'd end up in the desert in the snow . "
The Las Vegas tourism group paid for nearly half of the town 's 350 residents to visit Las Vegas for five days as part of a marketing campaign to promote the city .
Power outage
Along with the snow , NV Energy reported power outages Wednesday evening along Desert Inn Road , near Maryland Parkway , Mohave Avenue , Pecos Road , Eastern Avenue , Boulder Highway and Seneca Street ; Rancho Drive and Valley View Boulevard , Rancho Drive and Washington Avenue ; Lake Mead Parkway and Martin Luther King Boulevard ; and Washington Avenue and Martin Luther King Blvd .
NV Energy said crews were working to fix the outages .
It was unclear what caused the outages .
Police were directing traffic along Maryland Parkway to Pecos Road due to stoplight outages .
Traffic accidents numerous
Streets around the valley were becoming slick and slushy through the evening and into the morning .
Heavy traffic and snow - covered slick streets made the uphill climb troublesome on Eastern Avenue in Henderson , leading to heavy congestion Wednesday night .
The city of Henderson road crews were continuing today to focus efforts to clear snow off Eastern Avenue from Intestate 215 south to the Anthem community , according to Cindy Herman , Henderson 's public information manager .
Herman said residents are asked to remove abandoned vehicles to assist with the clean - up efforts .
" Commuters along Eastern Avenue should use caution as the weather , change in grade and abandoned vehicles are contributing to hazardous travel conditions .
If possible , Anthem residents are asked to avoid the area and find alternate routes for morning commutes , " Herman said in a statement released this morning .
The Nevada Department of Transportation announced this morning that Interstate 15 is still closed south of Las Vegas in each direction and is expected to open by noon between Primm and Baker .
The I - 15 southbound lanes are closed at St. Rose Parkway because of a truck accident and diesel spill at mile post 27 , according to Robert McKenzie , NDOT public information officer .
U.S. Highway 95's southbound lanes are closed at Railroad Pass to Nevada State Route 163 because of snow and icy conditions , McKenzie said .
State routes 161 , 164 and 165 are closed to traffic .
U.S. Highway 93's north and south lanes to Boulder City are now open again .
State Routes 160 and 159 are open to traffic with no controls , McKenzie said .
He said chains , snow tires or four - wheel drive vehicle restrictions are in place for State Route 156 to Mount Charleston .
State Route 157 to Mount Charleston is open only to residents until further notice , McKenzie said .
The Nevada Highway Patrol and Metro Police said there had been numerous fender - benders on wet roads , but no serious injuries through Wednesday evening .
As snow continued to pile up , so did the number of car crashes .
Metro Police have been working several accidents since the snow began to fall .
One included a pickup truck that had rolled over about 7:15 p.m. in the southbound lane in the 2300 block of Green Valley Parkway outside of the Wild Horse Estate Apartments .
The pickup truck knocked down two small trees before it came to a stop in front of the street light .
The vehicle rolled once and was on its side , perpendicular to the traffic , blocking the lanes .
At 7:55 p.m. , Metro officers were working 26 accidents with four injuries , a hit - and - run , nine other traffic accidents and 11 traffic problems , which range from a stalled car to traffic light outages .
The number of traffic incidents decreased into the night as fewer cars were on the roads .
Metro updates its traffic site every 15 minutes with accidents and traffic problems officers are currently working .
Officer Jay Rivera said the most common accident officers are seeing involve cars colliding into other vehicles from behind , mostly at traffic lights .
There had been no fatalities through Wednesday evening , he said .
“ People are use to following at a certain distance in dry conditions and are following at that same distance in these wet conditions and then rear - ending other cars , " Rivera said .
" People are n't used to the snow , " Officer Barbara Morgan said .
" You need to drive the way conditions dictate . "
Metro Police reported 18 wrecks between 2:15 and 3:25 p.m. , including two hit - and - runs .
" People are driving silly , " Morgan said .
" They need to just slow down . "
The Nevada Highway Patrol reported two crashes in the Henderson area during the same time frame — one at U.S. 95 and Wagon Wheel Drive and another at U.S. 95 and Horizon Drive .
Additionally , U.S. 95 to Searchlight was closed beginning at Railroad Pass .
Motorists traveling to California and outside the Las Vegas Valley were finding major delays on Interstate 15 and other highways .
The Nevada Department of Transportation reported the highway was closed in both direction between Primm and Baker , Calif. , because of snowy weather .
Officials also said U.S. 95 was closed from the California line to U.S. 93 because of a traffic accident , and State Road 163 , State Road 164 and State Road 165 were closed .
NDOT will be deicing bridges and ramps on U.S. 95 and I - 15 during the night .
Blue Diamond Highway ( SR 160 ) was closed and motorists were advised to detour using U.S. 95 north to SR 160 south to access Pahrump .
Chains , snow tires , or four - wheel drive vehicle restrictions are in place for Mountain Springs and Mount Charleston .
North Las Vegas officials were urging motorists to stay off the streets .
“ Motorists should slow down and be aware of their surroundings to avoid slamming on the breaks or jerking the steering wheel on frozen roads , ” public works director Qiong Liu said .
“ These actions could cause a vehicle to veer or slide out of control , posing a risk to the driver and other vehicles on the road . ”
The Nevada Highway Patrol was preparing to close Interstate 515 southbound at Railroad Pass , blocking traffic into Boulder City for all but Boulder City residents , Police Chief Thomas Finn said .
In addition , traffic along U.S. 93 from Hoover Dam into Boulder City was to be diverted , Finn said .
Traffic will be routed onto Lake Shore Road and through Henderson to get to the Las Vegas area , National Park Service spokesman Andrew Munoz said .
Finn said Boulder City residents would be allowed through .
The Regional Transportation Commission has closed a portion of its 402 Route from Nevada State College to Boulder City , and officials cautioned that other bus routes that serve higher elevations may be detoured or delayed as well .
" It ca n't make it to Boulder City because of the road closures , " spokesman Tracy Bower said .
A change of scenery
As Daniel Florez , a pharmacy employee at the CVS Pharmacy on Maryland Parkway and Silverado Ranch Boulevard , scraped a couple of inches of snow off the top of his car using a notebook , he said the snow was a nice change from the usual scenery .
" We were staring out the window all day saying ' I hope it sticks , I hope it sticks , ' " he said .
He was , however , a little worried about the drive to his home in the Blue Diamond Road and Durango Road area that he would have to make at the end of his shift .
" It 's a little scary out there , " he said .
" I do n't know , Las Vegas people are n't used to this .
I hope they can handle it . "
J.T. Trainer , a Silverado - area resident who was leaving CVS as the snow piled up , said having grown up in Alaska and in Washington , where his dad used to take him out to do donuts on the snow - covered roads , he was not so much worried about himself , but was concerned about how other people were driving .
" I 've seen three car accidents just on my way home from work , " he said .
Two were on the freeway and another was when someone was trying to make a turn and slid into a pole , he said .
The weather prompted the city of Henderson to close city offices at 3 p.m. Wednesday .
The city announced this morning that offices will resume regular operations today , however , recreation centers wo n't open until 8 a.m.
The Henderson Safekey and Teen Scene sites are closed because of the Clark County school closures .
Outside the Summerlin Library on Dec. 17 , Becker Middle School students Aaron Zambrano and Emre Keskintepe were holding up plastic bags collecting snowflakes .
The two 13 - year - olds were just like thousands of other local residents taking in the rare snowstorm that struck the Las Vegas Valley .
“ They ’re pretty big flakes , ” Aaron said .
“ We ’re trying to have a snowball fight . ”
Emre said he had seen snow before , but never like this in Summerlin .
“ It ’s weird to see snow covering the palm trees , ” Emre said .
At the Boca Park shopping center near the corner of Rampart Boulevard and Charleston Boulevard , Casey Greenberg and her friend Thomas Jokerst watched the falling snow while having dinner at the Kona Grill .
“ I think it ’s amazing , ” said Jokerst , a resident of San Francisco who was in town visiting friends .
“ I have n’t seen snow in like 15 years . ”
“ I ’ve lived here for 17 years and this is freakish , ” Greenberg said .
“ It snows every once in awhile , but only an inch or so .
Nothing like this . ”
Clark County has five daytime warming stations open through Friday .
The locations are Catholic Charities ( 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. ) , 1501 N. Las Vegas Blvd. ; Salvation Army ( 6 a.m. - 7 p.m. ) , 33 W. Owens Ave. ; Cambridge Recreation Center ( 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. ) , 3930 Cambridge St. ; Dula Gym ( 7 a.m. - 6 p.m. ) , 441 E.

March 20 , 2003 , exactly 555 days after Sept 11 , 2001 attacks on WTC .
57 years , 6 months and 18 days after the end of WWII , and 88 years , 8 months and 13 days since the start of WW1 .
The Real Cause of WW1 According to Albert Pike , the First World War was designed to enable the Czarist Government in Russia to be finally and completely overthrown and replaced with a new atheist , Communist government .
History records that this First World War did indeed occur as predicted .
The Western powers in Europe , in conjunction with the United States , financed Lenin 's expedition into Russia , and financed his government consistently .
The US has financed Russian Communism at least once per decade since then .
A little closer to home , in 1909 , the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace was tasked to answer the following question posed by the US government : " If it is desirable to alter the lives of an entire nation , is there any means more efficient than war ? "
After a year of research , the answer came back : " There are no known means more efficient than war , assuming the objective is altering the life of an entire nation . "
And for what reason would anyone want to alter the lives of an entire nation ?
Historian Walter Mills wrote the following about the purpose of the war and about Colonel House 's basic intent : " The Colonel 's sole justification for preparing such a batch of blood for his countrymen was his hope of establishing a new world order , [ a world government ] of peace and security .... "
The Real Cause of WW2 The Second World War was foreseen to originate between Great Britain and Germany .
However , one of the planned results of this war was to strengthen the new Communist Russian government , so that it could weaken and destroy other governments and religions .
History again records that the Second World War did indeed accomplish this objective .
The war started when Germany invaded Poland , causing Great Britain to declare war on Germany .
Very soon , the troika ( 3's ) of powers were set up to wage this war .
Germany , Italy and Japan vs. Great Britain , United States and Russia .
The Pike vision of the Second World War building Russian Communism into a super power was fulfilled to a startling degree .
Historians have always been mystified as to how Churchill and Roosevelt could have given away all of Eastern Europe to the Soviets , when the preponderance of power was clearly against the Soviets .
Clearly , when Roosevelt and Churchill ceded all of Eastern Europe to Russia , the Communist Government of Russia , completed its transition to a super power , exactly as Pike 's vision had foretold .
Intego , a maker of anti-virus and firewall software , has issued an alert to warn Mac users not to download Apple iWork ’09 installers from sites offering pirated software .
The risk of infection is serious , and users may face extremely serious consequences if their Macs are accessible to malicious users says Intego .
Intego reports at least 20,000 people have already downloaded this installer .
The OSX .
Trojan.iServices .
A Trojan Horse was discovered on Wednesday 21 January , and is classed as ‘ serious ’ by Intego .
The version of iWork ’09 is reportedly currently available on BitTorrent tracker sites and popular ‘ warez ’ websites and forums .
Once downloaded iWork ’09 is complete and functional , but the installer contains an additional package called iWorkServices.pkg says Intego .
The Intego alert explains what happens next .
“ When installing iWork 09 , the iWorkServices package is installed .
The installer for the Trojan horse is launched as soon as a user begins the installation of iWork , following the installer ’s request of an administrator password ( in older versions of Mac OS X , 10.5.1 or earlier , there will be no password request ) . ”
“ This software is installed as a startup item ( in / System / Library / StartupItems / iWorkServices , a location reserved normally for Apple startup items ) , where it has read - write - execute permissions for root . ”
“ The malicious software connects to a remote server over the Internet ; this means that a malicious user will be alerted that this Trojan horse is installed on different Macs , and will have the ability to connect to them and perform various actions remotely .
The Trojan horse may also download additional components to an infected Mac . ”
Earlier this week Apple removed the need to enter a serial number when iWork ’09 is purchased boxed , leading some to speculate the company abandoning anti-piracy measures .

Complex programmable logic devices ( CPLDs ) contain the building blocks for hundreds of 7400 - serries logic ICs .
Complete circuits can be designed on a PC and then uploaded to a CPLD for instant implementation .
A microcontroller connected to a CPLD is like a microcontroller paired with a reprogrammable circuit board and a fully stocked electronics store .
At first we were n’t sure of the wide appeal and application of CPLDs in hobbyist projects , but we ’ve been convinced .
A custom logic device can eliminate days of reading datasheets , finding the ideal logic IC combination , and then waiting for chips to arrive .
Circuit boards are simpler with CPLDs because a single chip with programmable pin placement can replace 100s of individual logic ICs .
Circuit mistakes can be corrected by uploading a new design , rather than etching and stuffing a new circuit board .
CPLDs are fast , with reaction times starting at 100MHz .
Despite their extreme versatility , CPLDs are a mature technology with chips starting at $ 1 .
We ’ve got a home - etchable , self programming development board to get you started .
Do n’t worry , this board has a serial port interface for working with the CPLD , and does n’t require a separate ( usually parallel port ) JTAG programmer .
Intro to CPLDs
When to use a CPLD
Consider using a CPLD when a design calls for more than one 7400 series logic ICs .
A CPLD will be cheaper , faster , and can be programmed with your ideal pin-out configuration for simpler PCBs .
Use a CPLD in tricky designs that might require several iterations .
It ’s easier to design a new circuit in software and upload it to the CPLD than it is to design , etch , and stuff a new circuit board .
For maximum speed and instant response , choose a CPLD .
The difference in speed is amazing ; CPLDs start at a 100MHz , while microcontrollers respond to interrupts at a few MHz .
CPLD designs form circuits that react to external stimulus , reactions occur almost instantaneously .
A microcontroller executes code to react to events , even interrupt routines have comparatively high latency .
CPLD vs FPGA
FPGAs are better known than CPLDs , but they share many characteristics .
This analogy is n’t perfect , but we like it : where FPGAs are a reprogrammable processor core , a CPLD is a reprogrammable circuit board or breadboard .
FPGAs replace microcontrollers , memory , and other components .
CPLDs absorb logic ICs , and work well with a microcontroller .
Manufacturers
Altera and Xilinx , the biggest CPLD manufacturers , are better known for their FPGAs .
Lattice Semiconductor is another large CPLD manufacturer with less community following .
Atmel makes pin-compatible versions of old industry - standard CPLDs .
If you plan to work at 5volts , your options are limited .
Xilinx XC9500 CPLDs are still available as new old stock , but cost four times more than newer 3.3 volt equivalents .
Atmel ’s ATF1502 series works at 5volts , but they do n’t offer a free development environment .
At 3.3 volts there ’s more options , but new CPLDs increasingly have a core that runs at 2.5 volts , 1.8volts , or lower .
The Altera MAXII and the Xilinx XC9500XL series are probably the most popular 3.3 volt CPLDs .
Xilinx also makes the CoolrunnerII CPLD , but it only comes in a TQFP package and requires a separate 1.8 volt supply for the core .
Packages
Most manufacturers offer one or two CPLDs in a hobbyist friendly PLCC 44 package , though this is starting to disappear .
PLCC is an SOIC - sized surface mount chip with pins on all four sides .
PLCC44 sockets are commonly available in through - hole and SMD versions .
Unfortunately , newer CPLD families are starting to eliminate the PLCC package and offer only 44 pin and larger TQFP chips , such as Xilinx ’s CoolrunnerII .
Development environments
Most manufacturers offer a free development environment that supports design entry using simple schematics , as well as Verilog or VHDL .
Many wo n’t support the latest FPGAs in the free version , but we only need the CPLD parts anyway .
Altera has Quartus , Xilinx has ISE , and Lattice has ispLever .
Atmel has ProChip Designer for the ATF15 xx series , but they only offer a 6 month trial license — which they would n’t actually give us .
Programmers
The development board we present does n’t need a separate JTAG programmer because the PIC microcontroller already programs the CPLD .
If you want an external programmer , the cheapest are the parallel port programmers : Parallel Cable III for Xilinx and BytleBlaster for Altera .
Inexpensive clones , and schematics , are available at SparkFun .
The OpenOCD is a generic USB JTAG programmer that will work with many CPLDs , FPGAs , and ARMs .
Our choice
We eventually settled on the Xilinx XC9500XL series because it had a cheap development kit we could use to test our JTAG programmer prior to implementing an entire design .
The DO - CPLD - DK from Digilent includes a XC9572XL , a CoolrunnerII , and parallel port programmer .
Nu Horizons has some old non-ROHS models for $ 40 , but due to sloppy variable type handling in their credit card processing scripts , we could n’t complete an order online .
We tried to do it over the phone but they refused to take such a small order on the phone , even during a website malfunction .
In the end , it was cheaper to pay full price at Digikey ( #122-1512 - ND ) after including New Horizon ’s exorbitant shipping charges .
We would n’t normally mention this , but with only two places to buy the board it ’s probably worth noting our experience .

The circuit and PCB are designed using the freeware version of Cadsoft Eagle .
All the files for this project are included in the project archive linked at the end of the article .
Circuit
A PIC 24FJ64GA002 microcontroller ( IC1 ) provides the user and programming interface to the CPLD .
We use this $ 4 PIC in a lot of projects because the peripheral pin select feature makes board routing really easy .
Check out our introduction to the PIC24 F for more details .
The PIC needs to communicate with a PC serial port , so we added an inexpensive MAX3232 RS232 transceiver .
The serial interface should work with a USB -> serial adapter .
Our choice of CPLD ( IC3 ) , a Xilinx XC9572XL ( PDF ) , is connected between the PIC and several other components .
We can create an endless variety of circuitry between the PIC and other chips using the reprogrammable logic inside the CPLD .
The PIC will program the CPLD with code sent from a PC serial port , but we still brought the JTAG pins to a header for easy external debugging .
A DS1085 digital programmable oscillator ( IC4 ) generates clock frequencies between 8KHz and 133MHz , at 10 KHz increments .
This is very similar to the DS1077 we covered earlier , but it has even steps between all frequencies .
The DS1085 requires a 5 volt supply ( VR2 ) .
The I2C interface also runs at 5volts , so we connected it to 5 volt tolerant PIC pins .
It ’s possible to use the 3.3 volt 66MHz 1085L instead , and remove the 5volt supply .
We used a cheap 3.3 volt SOT223 voltage regulator ( VR1 ) to power most of the circuit .
The 5volt supply ( VR2 ) can be excluded if you use a slower 1085L 3.3 volt oscillator .
CPLDs are commonly used as a memory controller , so we included 32 K of SRAM ( IC5 ) on the development board .
A 3.3 volt latch with 5 volt tolerant inputs interface the memory inputs to a wide range of external voltages ( IC6 ) .
The latch inputs are held low with a 1 Mohm resistor network ( RN1 ) .
We ’ll discuss this section extensively in an upcoming article .
PCB
The board is a quasi one - sided design .
We made several compromises so we could prototype this highly experimental PCB ourselves .
We present the board ‘ as is ’ for other die - hards that might want to etch this board at home .
If you send the PCB to a board house , try to correct these issues prior to producing a ‘ real ’ double - sided board .
One power pin of the CPLD is missing a decoupling capacitor entirely ; there was no way to put a capacitor in that area .
One CPLD decoupling capacitor , and the SRAM decoupling capacitor , are through - hole parts .
Using these through - hole parts eliminated a few jumper wires .
The jumper wires on the back of the board are optimized for single - sided production , rather than good design practices .
We faked a double - sided board by soldering the power bus on the back .
A real double - sided board design should route the power bus to avoid crossing signal paths , and include the missing decoupling capacitors .
We used an surface mount PLCC chip socket , but a through - hole version is definitely a better idea .
We though the SMD version would be easy to solder , but it turned out to be a nightmare .
We really wanted the CPLD to be on the front of the board for the coolest possible presentation .
A proper two - sided board with plated through - holes can have a through - hole socket on the front , but this was n’t possible with our 1 - sided prototype board .

Firmware
The firmware is written in C using the free demonstration version of the PIC C30 compiler .
Learn all about working with this PIC in our introduction to the PIC 24 F series .
The firmware is included in the project archive at the end of the article .
We wanted a super easy way to interact with the hardware on the board without endless compile - program - test cycles .
We made a custom version of the Bus Pirate firmware that provides a simple ASCII terminal interface to the DS1085 clock chip ( I2C ) , the CPLD programing interface ( JTAG ) , and a 3 wire ( SPI ) interface to the CPLD .
Check out the Bus Pirate tutorial for background on the simple syntax used with the firmware .
The original Bus Pirate firmware handles several protocols that share the same pins .
For the CPLD version , we changed the pin assignments to fit the connections on the development board .
We also removed unused modules and options .
CPLD blinky LED examples
We prepared several designs in Xilinx ’s ISE development environment .
The schematics , pin placement files , and compiled designs ( XSVF ) are included in the project archive linked at the end of the article .
A full explanation of ISE is beyond the scope of this article ; we found the help files sufficiently useful to make these examples .
The first design simply lights the LED connected to pin 8 of the CPLD .
Prepare the XSVF file
XSVF is a compressed JTAG programming format , as described by Xilinx in this application note ( PDF ) .
XSVF is n’t limited to programming Xilinx devices , and can be prepared for any chip that provides a common BSDL JTAG definition file .
Open the iMPACT programming tool from the ISE Design Suite project panel under Configure target device ->iMPACT .
Choose the option to create a boundary scan file , and set the type to XSVF .
Give the XSVF output a file name and then add a compiled CPLD image ( ex1.jed ) when prompted to add a device .
You should see a JTAG chain that contains a single device .
Click on the device and choose program ; iMPACT will record the programming sequences to an XSVF file .
With XSVF file in hand , it ’s time to open up a terminal and program the CPLD .
We like Tera Term and Hercules on Windows .
You must enable XON / XOFF flow control in the client to use the JTAG interface .
The default PC side setting for the development board terminal is 115200 bps , 8N1 .

In the terminal we enter the mode menu ( m ) , and choose JTAG ( 3 ) .
Macro 2 probes the JTAG chain , in our case this is just the CPLD .
The chain report tells us that the chip is connected and responding .
Read more about the JTAG interface .
Now we can run the XSVF programmer , macro ( 3 ) , and upload the XSVF file from the terminal in binary mode .
The first example just lights the LED on pin 8 .
If the LED lights , we can verify that programming was successful .
If your LED does n’t light , do n’t despair ; sometimes the JTAG programmer sticks and a reset macro ( 1 ) will get the chip going .

74LS32/4071 OR gate , blink at half rate ( /2 )
A major component of the CPLD development board is the 1085 ( L ) frequency synthesizer connected to pin 7 of the CPLD .
The next example uses a logic OR gate , like a 74LS32 or 4071 IC , to blink the LED whenever the clock signal is high .
At even the slowest clock rate the blinking will be too fast to see , but we should get a nice PWM dimming effect compared to the first example .

The DS1085 is almost exactly like the DS1077 we covered earlier , but has a DAC controlled oscillator for even steps between all frequencies .
We programmed the clock to the slowest frequency using the commands shown above .
The LED is dimmed by the pulse - width modulation effect of the clock signal .
LED at half brightness .
74F269 16bit synchronous counter , blink slowly ( / 65535 )
We just programmed the CPLD with a logic OR gate similar to a 74LS32 .
Now , we ’re going to reprogram the chip with a 16 bit counter like two cascaded 74F269s .
At $ 1.15 each , two 74F269 Ics are more expensive than the XC9572XL CPLD .
A 16 bit counter rolls over once per 65535 ticks , so a LED attached to the last bit will toggle once every 65535 / 2 ticks .
Now we can see the cool part of CPLDs .
The CPLD is like a programmable breadboard ; we just popped out the 74LS32 and put in a 74F269 , without buying parts , reading datasheets , etching , wiring , etc .
A microcontroller connected to a CPLD can reconfigure its own circuit board to fix errors , add features , or re-purpose it for entirely different applications .
We upload the new design as before , but now the clock is divided by 65535 and the LED toggles about once per second .
Taking it further
Next time we ’ll look at discrete 7400 - series logic chips , and implement a ton of them in the CPLD to make a high - speed bus sniffer and logic analyzer .

LA VENTOSA , Mexico  Mexico inaugurated one of the world 's largest wind farm projects Thursday as the nation looks for alternative energy , in part to compensate for falling oil production .
Mexico is trying to exploit its rich wind and solar potential after relying almost exclusively on petroleum for decades .
With oil production down by 9.2 % in 2008 , Mexico now is turning to foreign companies , mainly Spanish , to tap its renewable riches .
" If we do n't do something about this problem of climate change it probably could become — I 'm sure it already is — one of the biggest threats to humanity , " said President Felipe Calderon at the inaugural ceremony attended by about 1,000 residents , many of whom held on to their cowboy hats on this wind - swept day .
The new , $ 550 million project is in a region so breezy that the main town is named La Ventosa , or " Windy . "
It 's on the narrow isthmus between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean , where winds blow at 15 mph to 22 mph , a near - ideal rate for turbines .
Gusts have been known to topple tractor trailers .
Spanish energy company Acciona Energia says the 6,180 - acre farm should generate 250 megawatts of electricity with 167 turbines , 25 of which are already operating .
The rest should be on line by the end of the year , making the project the largest of its kind in Latin America .
It will produce enough energy to power a city of 500,000 people , while reducing carbon monoxide emissions by 600,000 metric tons each year , according to the company .
Esteban Morras , Acciona board member , said the project could be just the start for Mexico .
" This country has great potential for wind development and should take advantage , " he said .
The project is also a joint venture with Cemex Inc. and will provide 25 % of the Mexican cement giant 's energy needs , fulfilling the company 's goal of using alternative fuels .
Mexico hopes to boost the nation 's wind energy capacity , mainly at La Ventosa , to 5,000 megawatts — about 10 times its current output .
Wind energy now accounts for less than 2 % of electricity production .
Energy Secretary Georgina Kessel said the government is planning a series of wind projects that by 2012 should generate 2,500 megawatts of electricity .
" The intensity of wind in various parts of the country can make our plants among the most efficient in the world , " she said .
But the project has n't been welcomed by local residents , who say they see few benefits and are n't being paid enough for use of their lands .
Several hundred protesters blocked a road leading to the site , holding a banner reading " no to the project . "
The mayor of Juchitan , the municipality where La Ventosa is located , attended the ceremony but called for more benefits for the local community .
" We want to be part of a project that does not consider us just cheap labor but property owners and partners , " Mariano Santana Lopez said .
Critics argue that foreign companies build the turbines , rent the land , run the project and produce the power for companies like U.S. - owned retailer Wal - Mart .
" They promise progress and jobs , and talk about millions in investment in clean energy from the winds that blow through our region , " a leftist farm group known as the Assembly in Defense of the Land said in a statement .
" But the investments will only benefit businessmen , all the technology will be imported ... and the power wo n't be for local inhabitants . "
The group is calling on supporters to " defend the land we inherited from our ancestors . "
But so far it has n't been able to stop the project .
Acciona , for its part , says the construction of the project created 850 jobs .
Local residents , largely Zapotec Indians , are accustomed to foreigners ' coveting their land .
The United States demanded rights to transport goods over the isthmus in the 1850s , and foreigners tried to build a railway alternative to the Panama Canal there .

Rudy Guede was tonight found guilty of killing Meredith Kercher , while former lovers American Amanda Knox and Italian Raffaele Sollecito will stand trial for the murder .
Ivorian Guede was sentenced to 30 years in prison by a judge in Perugia in Italy .
All three were accused of killing the 21 - year - old Leeds University exchange student in a violent sex game in the city last November and have spent nearly a year behind bars awaiting today 's decisions .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The semi-naked body of Miss Kercher was found in her room in the cottage she shared with Knox and others on her year abroad .
She had died of stab wounds after her throat was slit .
Knox , 21 , from Seattle - nicknamed Foxy Knoxy - and her former lover Sollecito , 24 , are accused of killing Miss Kercher in a bungled sex game with Guede .
Lawyer Francesco Maresca , who represents Miss Kercher 's family , said : " We are very satisfied , even though this was a young man who faces a very heavy sentence . "
The trial is set to begin on December 4 .
The key piece of evidence used by prosecutors to link Sollecito to the crime is a trace of his DNA on the clasp of Miss Kercher 's bra .
His lawyers argued this was due to accidental contamination during the investigation .
They have also said that if Sollecito had removed the victim's bra there would be more traces of his DNA on it and they would not only be on the clasp .
Prosecutor Manuela Comodi contested this yesterday by bringing her own bra into court to demonstrate how Miss Kercher 's could have been removed , according to reports in the Italian press .
Knox 's parents Edda Mellas and Curt Knox were in Perugia while their daughter 's fate was decided behind closed doors .
Miss Kercher 's family were also in the Umbrian hilltop town to hear the judge 's decision and will be seeking 25 million euros ( £ 19.3 million ) in compensation for the " grave tragedy " they have suffered , their lawyer said last week .
While the claim currently applies only to Guede , Francesco Maresca said he would make a similar request if Knox and Sollecito were brought to trial .
But Mr Maresca stressed the amount applied to all three cases collectively , calling it a " symbolic request " .

Southerners are more like to die from the effects of the weather than people living in any other region of the US .
But for all the attention garnered by catastrophic hurricanes such as Katrina and Andrew , simple heatwaves kill far more people than all natural disasters combined , according to a newly published county - by - county map of natural hazard deaths ( see the maps here ) .
Other extreme summer hazards , such as floods , and cold winter weather also outranked hurricanes , earthquakes , and wildfires , according to geographers Kevin Borden and Susan Cutter , of the University of South Carolina in Columbia .
Overall , natural disasters account for less than 5 % of natural hazard deaths across the US .
Large cities like San Francisco and New York are among the safest places to live , but if city living is n’t for you , the odds of dying from the weather are lowest in the Midwest .

Your brand new 1080 p home theater rig is finally installed and ready to go .
You 're all set to sit back and watch your favorite classic , Casablanca , like you 've never seen it before , with stunning clarity and contrast .
Your Blu-ray player outputs 1080 p / 24 , the signal format everyone is raving about .
You 've got the Blu-ray edition of Casablanca .
Your 1080 p projector displays the Blu-ray signal in native 24 fps format -- everything is as pure and pristine as it can get .
So , you hit the play button .
The Warner Bros logo splashes onto the screen .
The globe rotates slowly .
The map of the Mediterranean is rendered in breathtaking sharp detail .
You smile in deep satisfaction with your new system .
And then it happens .
At two minutes and 3 seconds into the film , the camera holds the skyline for a moment , then pans slowly down to street level .
You recoil in horror as the picture comes completely unhinged .
It stutters and shakes like a delirious madman .
The buildings are seemingly in the throes of a bizarre earthquake .
It hurts to watch it .
You blink repeatedly in disbelief .
How could your brand new state - of - the - art 1080 p projection system with pure , native 24 p transmission come so dramatically unglued ?
Welcome to 24 p .
What you just experienced was motion judder , an extremely annoying artifact that derives from the fact that movies are filmed at 24 frames per second ( fps ) .
The 24 fps sampling rate was adopted as a de facto standard in 1926 when the budding film industry recognized they needed a sampling rate fast enough to support a coherent audio track .
( The first talkie , The Jazz Singer , was released in 1927 ) .
Prior to audio - enabled movies , they were filmed at even slower speeds , in part to save film , and in part because film exposure speeds were a lot slower back then .
The industry standard 24 fps film rate is an albatross that we 've been stuck with ever since .
As it turns out , it is way too slow to resolve camera panning motion cleanly .
So when a movie camera pans at an unfortunate speed , you get motion judder .
Sometimes you get it in spades .
The sad fact is , your high resolution 1080 p / 24 system is simply showing you the picture as encoded on the Blu-ray disc in its authentic naked form .
We just never saw it in our homes quite as naked before the advent of Blu-ray and HD DVD .
Actually , we 've never seen 24 fps film quite this naked even in a commercial movie theater since the double shuttering action of the movie theater 's projection system reduces the experience of judder and flicker .
You can see some judder in the movie theater , but it is not as pronounced as it is on a digital home theater projector playing Blu-ray or HD DVD at 24p .
But wait , wait , wait , you say ......
" I thought these judder problems were related to this 3:2 pulldown thing , and once we went to 24 p , we 'd have a clean picture . "
Well , a lot of people anticipated that , because all we 've seen in the NTSC world until recently is 24 fps film converted to 30 fps display .
That conversion from 24 fps to 30 fps ( typically referred to as 3:2 pulldown ) does indeed introduce a slightly different kind of judder , as well as some blur , when the camera pans .
So it is perfectly natural to assume that a native signal that has n't been compromised by this nasty 3:2 pulldown conversion process would look better .
As it turns out , the opposite is often the case .
The motion judder in native 24 p can be atrocious .
You can test it yourself if you have the equipment to do it .
We 'll assume that if you have a Blu-ray player , you are more likely to have a copy of Casino Royale than Casablanca .
If you do , find a messy panning scene in Casino Royale .
There are lots of them , but there 's a real beauty in the 9th chapter , starting at 1 hour , 11 minutes and 13 seconds .
The dealer is dealing , and the camera pans slowly around the table .
In 24 p playback , this scene is a pure , unmitigated disaster .
The people seated at the table come apart at the seams , the tuxes flash and strobe , the Casino Royale logo on the card table blinks like a neon sign .
Once you 've replayed this travesty a few times , switch your Blu-ray player to 60 p output and run it again .
Yes , it is still a mess .
But look at it closely ... the juddering effect is actually reduced .
That is because the 3:2 pulldown is blurring and masking some of the latent motion judder in the film .
There is certainly a separate conversion judder that is added to the visual stew with 3:2 pulldown , but oddly enough it works in contravention of the latent 24 p judder .
The net effect is that the image is a bit blurred , and the overall judder is noticeably reduced .
Scenes like this do not look great in 60 p , but they look worse in 24 p .
After all the hype over 24 p ( the benefits of which we eagerly anticipated as much as anyone ) , it must be admitted that 60 p playback can , in the final analysis , be less distracting for many people .
Having been told that 3:2 pulldown judder is the scourge of humanity , it may be shocking to hear that it is not the worst fate that can befall the home theater enthusiast .
But the fact is , the antiquated 24 frames per second sampling rate is the more onerous problem .
And this is no secret .
Professional cinematographers are acutely aware of the limitations of 24 fps capture rates .
They go to great lengths to control the camera in such a way that juddering effects are minimized , because directors do n't like it any more than we do .
One common technique is to put the camera on a track and move the camera at the same pace as a moving subject , so that the subject remains stationary in the frame .
If the subject does not move across the screen , the subject does not judder .
However , if the background is moving behind the subject , the background will indeed judder .
If you 've still got your Casino Royale disc in the Blu-ray player , you can see a good example of this .
Go to chapter 9 again , and to 1 hour , 9 min , 6 seconds .
Here Bond is walking through the hotel .
Notice that the cinematographer places
Bond in the right half of the frame , and the camera retreats as Bond approaches to keep him in a stationary position while the background pans .
Bond turns to his right , and the cinematographer continues to hold him in the right half of the frame .
When this scene is played in 24 p , Bond remains stable and in focus while the background judders like crazy .
When you play it back in 60 p , the juddering effect in the background is still there , but it is reduced -- it is easier to live with .
Notice further that the background in this scene is somewhat out of focus .
In situations like this , cinematographers can use larger apertures to minimize the camera 's optical depth of field .
By doing so , they can focus on the foreground subject and intentionally throw the background out of focus .
This causes the motion judder in the background to become less apparent to the viewer .
In this particular scene they did not fully accomplish the objective , but it helps .
Therefore , there are two basic conclusions we can draw .
First , motion judder is a natural byproduct of the 24 fps film rate .
You will see it if you play a Blu-ray or HD DVD movie in native 24 p transmission .
How much of it you see will be directly related to how much moderate speed camera panning there is in the movie .
Second , 3:2 pulldown conversions are a secondary source of judder .
However , they tend to blur and soften the more aggressive instances of motion judder that you 'd see in native 24 p display .
Leaving conventional wisdom aside , if you have the option to play your Blu-ray movies in either 24 p or 60 p , do n't be surprised if you prefer the relative stability of 60p .
So , is there any way to get rid of judder ?
Absolutely .
One solution to the problem is called frame interpolation .
But before we get to that , let 's get clear on the root problem : the reason the picture judders when the camera pans is because the standard sampling rate of 24 frames per second is not fast enough to fully resolve the motion .
If we captured movies at 60 fps and played them back at 60 p , juddering artifacts would be pretty much nonexistent .
Frame interpolation is a process by which the projector ( or video processor ) approximates what a film would have looked like if it had been captured at a much faster sampling rate to begin with .
What it does it this :
It buffers two or more sequential frames of the film , and evaluates the motion shifts between them .
Then it uses this information to create interim frames that are partial steps in the motion sequence between each real frame .
For example , the Panasonic AE3000's " Frame Creation " system will look at either two or three prior frames ( depending on the mode you select ) , and create three interim frames that are each 25 % incremental steps in the motion between two real frames .
These are fed out at the rate of 96 Hz each .
So in reality , in each 1 / 24 second , what you are actually seeing on the screen is one original frame from the Blu-ray disc , and three subsequent " motion adjusted " interim frames , all four of which are being displayed in sequence at 96 Hz .
To put it another way , when using the AE3000's Frame Creation mode , a total of 75 % of the image information on the screen is not on the Blu-ray disc at all , but rather is being created by the projector !
The result is this :
When you watch Casablanca , and you get to the point where the camera pans down from the skyline to street level , the picture is smooth , stable , and clear with no hint of motion judder .
After seeing conventional 24 p playback side by side with this , it is no contest .
One delivers a visual nightmare , the other gives you a smooth , clear image .
Panasonic is not the only vendor to have included frame interpolation on its home theater projectors this fall .
Several others will have it also .
These include the Sanyo PLV - Z3000 , and several of the Epson home theater models .
Each vendor has a different implementation of frame interpolation .
But they all address the basic problem of film judder by creating interim frames that represent small steps in the motion sequence .
One way or another , they will enable you to experience the film pretty much as if it had been captured at 60 fps to begin with .
As a caveat , we should point out that frame interpolation is a brand new feature on home theater projectors .
As such , it might introduce artifacts of its own until the wrinkles are ironed out .
The only model we 've seen to date with this feature is the Panasonic AE3000 , and we have not seen any artifacts that could be attributed to the Frame Creation system .
However , frame interpolation does increase video delay on the AE3000 , and we expect it will do so on every model .
So users will want to incorporate an audio delay into the system in order to resolve lip - synch issues .
Now , before we conclude , it is important to acknowledge that many videophiles today prefer the judder of the 24 fps film experience .
To some film buffs , tampering with the natural judder is a sin , because it just does n't look like authentic film if it lacks the inherent instability of the low sampling rate .
And indeed , they are right , it does n't .
Frame interpolation techniques can make the picture look too clear , too stable , to the point that it can be unnerving if you are not used to it .
( For this reason , the AE3000 gives it to you as an option , and you can turn it on or off as you see fit . )
But think about this .
Back in the early days of silent films , there was no standard frame exposure rate .
The cinematographer manually turned the crank on the camera and exposed film at anywhere from 12 to 24 frames per second or more .
The ideal goal of the professional projectionist in a movie theater was to play back that film at the rate at which it had been exposed , in order to make motion look natural .
But all too often , theater management wanted it played back faster than it had been exposed .
After all , time was money , even back then .
And truth be known , some of those films did in fact have better entertainment value when they were showed at modestly accelerated projection speeds .
Artificially rapid motion was an aesthetic that many movie viewers came to enjoy .
Sometimes , when action and comedy movies were projected at the rate they were filmed , people would complain that they were too slow .
Romantic films , on the other hand , looked absurd when played back faster than the rate they were filmed .
But the point is that people back then had their own ideas about what film should look like .
Today , the 24 p sampling rate defines our own aesthetic reality about what a film should look like , judder and all .
However , we are in a period of rapid technological transformation .
Someday , in the not too distant future , films will be made at 60 fps .
The generations to follow us will experience films captured at 60 fps as the aesthetic norm .
They will be accustomed to the crystal clear motion that high resolution 60 fps capture will deliver ( and that frame interpolation can give us a glimpse of today ) .
When they look back at the 20th century and early 21st century films produced in the old 24 fps format , they will think it quaint that we could have lived with the juddering limitations of our technology .
That is worth bearing in mind as we think back with bemused nostalgia on the era of the silent films .

The clock is ticking on Sony’s
recurrent pledge
to release an open beta for its PS3 social network
Home by the end of the year – and a report in yesterday ’s issue of
The Sunday Times
suggests that December 17th may be the day .
The piece reads :
To try Home , which is slated for release in the next 10 days , players must download a piece of free software from Sony ’s PlayStation store onto their own PS3 . ”
Whether or not the date is true , it ’s certainly the case that the Home bandwagon has picked up considerable pace of late .
And were Sony planning on slipping the release until 2009 , it ’s certainly waiting until the very final moment before dropping the bombshell .
Thanks , CVG .

New Jersey took a step toward becoming the 14th medical marijuana state Monday as a Senate committee heard testimony , then voted 6 - 1 ( with two abstentions ) to send Senate Bill 119 , the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act , to the Senate floor , where it could be voted on as early as next month .
The state Assembly has yet to vote on the bill , but Gov. Jon Corzine ( D ) has indicated he would sign the bill if it reaches his desk .

The bill , passed by the Senate 's Health , Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee , would set up a registry program with the Department of Health and Senior Services for people with debilitating medical conditions , including cancer , glaucoma , HIV or AIDS , or other diseases that cause wasting , chronic pain , severe nausea , seizures , or severe and persistent muscle spasms .
Registered patients or their caregivers could possess up to six marijuana plants and an ounce of usable marijuana .
The bill would also address what has been a thorny issue in some states that have approved medical marijuana laws : the question of supply for people who cannot grow their own .
To address the supply problem , the bill foresees the licensing of collective gardens where patients could obtain medical marijuana .
Monday 's hearing featured testimony from patients , experts , and drug reformers , as well as written testimony from the New Jersey Academy of Family Physicians , the New Jersey League for Nursing , the New Jersey chapters of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society , and the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in support of the bill .
It began with an impassioned argument by Sen. Nick Scutari ( D - Union County ) , the bill 's original sponsor .
" There is no price we would not pay , no limits to which we would not go " to prevent loved ones from suffering needlessly , Scutari told his colleagues on the Senate Health , Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee .
Scutari addressed opponents who argued that the state should wait for the US Food and Drug Administration to approve marijuana .
" There is little comfort in the promise of a better drug 10 years from now , " he said , noting that the federal government has ignored recommendations to conduct clinical trials with medical marijuana .
Dr. Denis Petro , a board - certified neurologist in neighboring Pennsylvania with a quarter - century of experience in neurology , clinical pharmacology , and marijuana research also testified .
He told the committee how he conducted the first American study of marijuana 's beneficial effects for multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patients 1981 .
It was time for New Jersey to approve a medical marijuana bill , he told the committee .
" There is no doubt that medical marijuana will eventually be allowed in New Jersey " , said Kenneth Wolski , an RN , who with Jim Miller , the widow of New Jersey medical marijuana patient / activist Cheryl Miller , co-founded the Coalition for Medical Marijuana -- New Jersey to press for such a bill five years ago .
" There is too much logic , common sense , compassion and science that supports it .
Logic says that doctors prescribe far more dangerous and addicting drugs than marijuana ; common sense says that this issue ought to be decided in the privacy of the doctor - patient relationship , in the best interest of the patient ; Compassion says that no patient should suffer needlessly ; and there is a wealth of scientific evidence that supports the safety and efficacy of medical marijuana , " Wolski concluded .
Although medical marijuana legislation had been offered each year since 2004 , it had failed to move .
But the Senate Health committee made up for lost time Monday , immediately voting to send the bill to the Senate floor with its stamp of approval .
Patients and advocates were quick to thank the committee .
" It really brings me to tears , not just for me as someone suffering from multiple sclerosis , but as a registered nurse and for all the people that I 've treated , " said Elise Segal , who had testified in support of the bill earlier in the day .
" We want to thank the senators on the committee for voting for the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act , " said Roseanne Scotti , director of the Drug Policy Alliance New Jersey office and a tireless campaigner in Trenton .
" The bottom line is about compassion .
If you or someone you love is seriously ill and none of the available medications relieved the suffering , would n't you want access to medical marijuana if a doctor recommended it ?
New Jerseyans overwhelmingly support this legislation and we are grateful to the committee for hearing their voices . "
" I am pleased to see the support of the committee for Senate Bill 119 , " said Dr. Petro .
" With passage of the legislation , patients with serious and life - threatening disorders can be offered a safe and effective alternative when conventional therapy is inadequate .
The bill represents a positive step toward a rational policy regarding medical marijuana . "
" I am thrilled that today members of the Senate Health Committee supported the common sense and compassionate response to suffering , " said Nora Bertocci , a registered nurse and chair of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization , which works with sick and dying patients on a daily basis .
" Medical marijuana is used very successfully in other states and in other countries .
We should not be asking ' why should we legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes ? ' but rather ' why should n't we ? ' "
Since California led the way in 1996 , 13 states have passed laws providing for the medicinal use of marijuana : Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington State .
Last month , Michigan voters made it the first Midwest state to join the list .
If the New Jersey Assembly acts next year , it could become the first Mid-Atlantic state to join .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
If you have n't yet had your credit limit slashed on one of your credit cards , it 's highly likely you will -- if Meredith Whitney is right , that is .
Whitney , an analyst and managing director at Oppenheimer & Co. who predicted the current financial - services industry meltdown , now says credit - card issuers will eliminate more than $ 2 trillion in available credit over the next 18 months .
Already , lenders have cut back on available credit due to their heightened aversion to risk and difficulty in funding loans .
Before the financial crisis , consumer loans could be sold on a secondary market and the proceeds could help to spur more lending , but that market has largely dried up .
See Consumer Watch on card issuers raising interest rates , fees .
Whitney warns that new accounting rules that will force lenders to record outstanding credit - card loans on their balance sheets , combined with the Federal Reserve 's expected changes in credit card regulations -- including limiting lenders ' ability to raise rates on consumers ' existing debt -- will prompt them to cut access to credit lines even more .
" Restricting lenders ' ability to reprice an unsecured loan will cause them to stop lending or to lend less , " Whitney said in a recent opinion piece in the Financial Times .
Whitney was unavailable to comment for this article .
See story on Federal Reserve 's upcoming changes to credit - card rules .
To the degree that limited access to credit dampens consumer spending further , that could severely hinder an economic recovery .
See story on biggest drop in consumer spending in seven years .
" Specific to the credit - card industry , we believe that well over $ 2 trillion of lines will be pulled over the next 18 months , the result of risk aversion and funding challenges , but also regulatory and accounting changes , " Whitney and her colleagues wrote in a Nov. 30 research report .
" The severe consequence of this can not be overstated , " the report said .
" While just over 70 % of U.S. households have credit cards , over 90 % of those households revolve credit at some point during the year , or in other words use credit card lines as a cash management vehicle .
" Pulling credit at a time when job losses are increasing by over 50 % year on year in most key states is a dangerous and unprecedented combination , in our view , " the report said .
Still , some economists note that many consumers have access to credit lines -- often tens of thousands of dollars ' worth -- that they do n't use .
" There are plenty of middle - to higher - income folks out there who may have a $ 20,000 line on their credit card but they rarely use more than $ 2,000 of it .
If you knock that line down to $ 4,000 or $ 5,000 , so what ? " said Scott Hoyt , senior director of consumer economics at Moody's Economy.com .
" There is another set of consumers who may have a $ 2,000 credit line and are borrowing $ 1,500 , $ 1,800 on an ongoing basis .
If you whack their credit line , that 's going to impact them pretty severely , " he said .
" Without knowing how the distribution [ of the pull - back in credit ] is going to fall among consumers and how much of a utilized line is going to be cut , it 's really hard to say what the overall impact is going to be , " Hoyt said .
Cutting $ 2 trillion still leaves $ 2 trillion
Bill Hampel , chief economist with the Credit Union National Association , noted that there 's almost $ 1 trillion in outstanding credit - card debt currently -- it 's about $ 976 billion according to the latest Federal Reserve figures -- and the current ratio of borrowing against available credit is about 20 % , according to FDIC figures .
" That means there is about $ 5 trillion outstanding now of available lines of credit , " he said , with about $ 1 trillion of it borrowed .
If Whitney is right and about $ 2 trillion of available credit is eliminated , that still leaves about $ 2 trillion available -- twice as much as is currently tapped by consumers , Hampel said .
Still , he 's quick to add that " does n't mean [ further credit cuts ] would have no effect . "
For instance , consider consumers who are carrying a balance and for whom a decrease in credit limit would put them much closer to their limit .
" Bingo .
They 'd stop spending on that card , " Hampel said .
Plus , there 's a psychological effect on consumers .
" If households thought they had less of a liquidity back - up available on their credit cards than they did before , that would reduce spending . "
Others agreed the overall effect is hard to judge , as it depends heavily on which consumers are affected .
Thus far , credit - card issuers appear to be both focusing their efforts on the least creditworthy borrowers as well as making across - the - board changes regardless of borrowers ' credit standing .
Some lenders have pulled lines " from certain perceived high - risk ZIP codes or areas of weakened home values ; others have pulled more uniformly , " according to the Oppenheimer report , which focused on the five biggest credit - card issuers .
Peter Morici , an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland , said that his own credit - card interest rate has been raised .
" Everybody is getting their rates raised , no matter what their status is .
I have sparkling credit , I have n't borrowed in years , and [ I have ] a large income ... they raised my rate , " he said .
" It does n't affect us ... but it does affect those people who do carry balances and there are a lot of them out there , " he said .
" It 's people often with small incomes who get in a jam -- they need to fix their car .
This is going to come down really hard on the working poor or the lower middle class .
The banks are trying to balance their books on the backs of the poor , " he said .
Plus , the current state of the job market poses a major risk .
" A lot of people have n't been using credit .
If they lose their jobs , they 're going to start to , " Morici said .
What you can do
For consumers who find their credit limit cut or interest rate raised , there are not a lot of options :
Depending on the terms of your credit - card agreement and the laws governing the credit - card issuer , which vary depending on the state in which the company is chartered , the credit - card issuer may offer an opt - out provision when raising interest rates .
That means you can contact your lender to tell them you will pay off your balance at the current rate but will close your account ( that may happen immediately or after the balance is paid off , depending on the lender 's terms ) .
A lower credit limit will often ding your credit score .
One way to bring your score up is to pay down your debt .
If you can't do that immediately , another solution is to call your lender and seek a higher limit .
They may listen to a borrower with top - tier credit .
Another option is to seek credit elsewhere .
Try a small regional bank or a credit union .
If you have good credit , " credit unions , and I suspect small banks , too , still have room on their balance sheets to take on additional loans , " Hampel said .
If you find yourself falling into a financial vortex due to rising credit - card bills , consider contacting a consumer credit counseling agency .
Try the National Foundation for Credit Counseling at NFCC.org or the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San Francisco , which works with consumers nationwide , at CCCSSF.org .
You wo n't be alone .
Calls to NFCC increased 87 % in the second week of November and 170 % in the third week of November , compared with the same time periods a year ago .
Also , the traditional personal - finance advice exhorting consumers to pay off credit cards before doing anything else may be turned on its head these days .
" The old advice was that you would pay off your credit cards and the credit cards would be there as emergency backup , " said Gerri Detweiler , a credit adviser with Credit.com .
" You might want to start stockpiling some savings before you aggressively pay down cards , so you have liquid savings as a back - up in case your issuer does close the credit line .
Once you have at least somewhat of a cushion , then you can go ahead aggressively try to pay down your credit card , " she said .
" Financially it 's not going to save you the most money , but it 's the new reality for a lot of consumers who have assumed that credit would always be there for them . "
There have been more violent scenes in the Greek capital , Athens , as riots triggered by the police shooting of a teenager continued for a fourth day .
Riot police clashed with protesters outside parliament , as a march to protest against the killing of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos turned violent .
After the teenager 's funeral in the south of the city , groups of youths threw stones at police and set rubbish bins on fire .
Violence was reported elsewhere in the country .
In the second city of Thessaloniki , police battled groups of young people after a demonstration .
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged since the rioting began on Saturday and dozens of people have been arrested .
On Monday , protesters burned down the Christmas tree in Syntagma Square in the centre of Athens .
The country 's top leaders have held emergency talks on the situation .
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said young people should not use the " tragic incident " as an excuse for violence .

「ソフトウェアの将来はクラウドコンピューティングにある」と、モバイルサービスを提供する企業FunambolのCEOを務めるFabrizio Capobianco氏は述べる。そしてFOSS（フリー/オープンソースソフトウェア）がその新しい市場で生き残ろうとするならば、コミュニティは、特にSaaS（software as a service） 向けに設けられたライセンスAGPL（GNU Affero General Public License、Affero一般公衆利用許諾契約書）が広く使用されるよう推進することにより、この状況に対応していくことが必要だと同氏は言う。
「オープンソースを将来にわたって繁栄させたいのならば、われわれはこれをSaaSにも適用していかなければならない。クラウドの世界にコピーレフトを存続させるライセンスが必要だ」と、Capobianco氏は警告する。
Capobianco氏の見解は、15年にわたってFOSSに携わってきた経験に基づくものである。同氏はイタリアのパヴィア大学の大学院生だったとき、初めてFOSSコミュニティを知った。そこでLinuxマウスドライバの作成者であり、『
Linux Device Drivers 』の共同著者であ るAlessandro Rubini氏と出会う。 「 彼が Linuxに従事している姿と、コミュニティにおいて彼が成し遂げた仕事を見た。世界中の人々がデバイスドライバやテストの実施において彼を支援していた。オープンソースやコミュニティという概念にすっかり魅了された」とCapobianco氏は当時を述懐している。
大学を卒業し、自身が呼ぶところの「 serial entrepreneur（連続起業家）」としての仕事を開始しても、Capobianco氏のFOSSへの関心が失われることはなかった。イタリア初のウェブ企業Internet Graffitiや、主要なイタリアの顧客を得た情報ポータルStigma Onlineにおいて、同氏は企業のバックエンドの構築にFOSSを使用した。FOSSとは無縁のReutersに勤めていたときでさえ、Unix OSファミリにおいてGNU/Linuxの従兄弟に相当するSolarisを使用していた。
しかし同氏の関心が実際に形となって現れたのはFunambolにおいてであった。2001年にFOSSプロジェクトとして発足したFunambolは、シリコンバレーのベンチャーキャピタリストらの支援の下、2005年に企業となった。Capobianco氏によると、Funambolは、市場における任意のモバイル機器で利用可能なソフトウェアサービスを提供することにより、「BlackBerryの経験を一般大衆に届けること」を専門とする企業であるという。Funambolではこのプロジェクトを、「MobileWe」と呼んでいる。Appleの「MobileMe」をもじったもので、コミュニティルーツを強調している。Funambolのクライアント製品であるCommunity
Editionは、FOSSとして配布されており、サービスプロバイダ向けのCarrier Editionは、プロプライエタリなライセンスの下、販売されている。
しか しFunambolは、FOSSの上に構築されているだけではない。Capobianco氏によると、FOSSコミュニティなしでは同社は成り立たないという。世界中で使用されている携帯電話の台数は約20億台にものぼるとされる中、Capobianco氏はどのような企業であってもそれらすべてに対してサポートを提供するのは不可能であると指摘する。「世界中のすべての種類の電話を購入して、すべての国に飛んでいき、すべての通信事業者の接続サービスを購入しなければならなくなる。営利目的の団体がそれを行うのは実質不可能だ。しかしわれわれのコミュニティではそれができている。われわれのコミュニティはすべての国に存在し、ありとあらゆる種類の電話を使用している。そして彼らの多くは開発者だ。彼らは（われわれのサービスを）テストし、コードを作成し、そのコードをコミュニティに提供してくれる」と同氏は述べる。それによって、「Funambolはワイヤレスの分野における最大規模のオープンソースプロジェクトとなっている」と同氏は主張する。
Affero GPLの提唱
Funambol設立後の早い時期に、Capobianco氏はGPL（GNU
General Public License、GNU一般公衆許諾契約書）に大きな抜け穴が存在することに気付いた。GPLでは、ソフトウェア配布者がソースコードを公開することが求められるが、クラウドサービスを提供する企業は、「ソフトウェアをサービスとして稼働しているのであり、ソフトウェアを配布しているわけではないと主張してこの要件を回避していた。『G』で始まり『oogle』で終わる企業など、一部の大企業もそうしていたのである。抜け穴が利用されていると私は確信した」と同氏は述べる。このような抜け穴が存在したのは、GPLのバージョン2が公開されたのが1991年であり、当時は「サーバ上でソフトウェアを稼働させるという概念は存在せず、その場合著作権はどうなるのかなど誰も考えていなかった」ためである。
この状況に対処するため 、Funambol はHonest Public Licenseを使用し始めた。これは、サービスとして配布されるソフトウェアも、ソフトウェアの配布とみなすと明記した一行を、GPLバージョン2に追加したものであった。
Capobianco氏もFunambolのその他の社員も、GPLのバージョン3の策定中にFree Software Foundationが助言を求めた委員会のいずれにも名を連ねていないが、同バージョンの策定にはコミュニティの意見も取り入れられ、Capobianco氏は、Honest Public Licenseとほぼ同一のAffero GPLの策定を求める提唱者となった。
「 AGPLがリリースされると同時に 、Funambolはこれ をOpen Source Initiative （OSI）に承認申請した。OSIの承認が得られたため、すぐにこれに切り替えた」と同氏は述べる。それ以来Capobianco氏は、自身のブログや、公の場で発言する機会において、AGPLの使用を提唱し続けている。
同氏の理論はいたって単純明快である。「人々に普通のGPLv3を適用させて抜け穴を利用させるならば、コピーレフトの概念は消滅してしまう。私にとってそれはオープンソースを消滅させようとする癌のようなものだ。私はソフトウェアの将来において、コピーレフトを存続させていきたいと思っている。AGPLを提唱するのはそのためである。これを見過ごすとしたら、われわれは誤りを犯すことになる」と同氏は言う。
同氏は 、AGPL が「他の多くのケースよりも、私のビジネスと私の製品に適したものだ」ということは認めている。「しかし私は、『どのような製品であっても将来はサービスとしてパッケージ化される可能性がある。したがってライセンスを選択するならば、AGPLを選択するのがよい』と人々に伝えている」と同氏は述べた。
徐々に得られつつある賛同
AGPL使用の推進におい てCapobianco氏が最大の障害であると考えるのは、これがあまり宣伝促進されておらず、多くの人々に知られていないという点である。GPLバージョン3の策定はライセンスに対する広い関心を集めたが、「人々はもうそれを忘れつつある」と同氏は述べる。またAGPLの相違点は、重要であるにもかかわらず「些細な点」であり、人々に見落とされがちである。このような理由から、「AGPLとGPLv3の違いが明確には理解されておらず、標準だからという理由でGPLが選ばれてしまう」と同氏は言う。
それでも希望の兆しはあるとCapobianco氏は見ている。GPLv3の採用状況を追跡するPalamidaのページには、公開されてからの1年間で、AGPLを採用する企業は0社から181社に増加したと記載されていることを同氏は指摘した。通常のGPLv3ライセンスを使用する企業が3300社以上存在することと比較するとこの数字は小さなものだが、四半期あたりほぼ100％の増加率に相当するとCapobianco氏は指摘する。「数年はかかるものだ」とだけCapobianco氏は述べた。
しか しCapobianco氏は、AGPLの採用が必須であると見ている。「自分の経験から、モバイル市場はオープンソースにとって最適な市場であると信じている。モバイルから発生するイノベーションも多い。コンピューティングはモバイルの方向へと進んでおり、それはクラウドサービスを意味する。それが将来のコンピューティングである。つまり、ノートPCや携帯電話といった多数のデバイスとSaaSだ。そしてそれが将来の方向性であるとしたら、クラウドサービスの世界においてオープンソースを保護し、その精神を存続させるためのAGPLのようなライセンスが必要となる」と同氏は言う。

The Free and Open - Source Developers ' Meeting ( FOSDEM ) is an annual event held in Brussels , Belgium , in February .
The 2009 edition will take place on Saturday the 7th and Sunday the 8th of February .
Ada-Belgium has organized a series of presentations related to Ada , to be held in a dedicated Developer Room , on both days of the event .
Ada is a general - purpose language originally designed for safety - and mission - critical software engineering .
It is used extensively in air traffic control , rail transportation , aerospace , nuclear , financial services and medical devices .
The new Ada 2005 standard which was published by ISO in 2007 , starts to spread thanks to the advent of its first full implementation which is none other than the GNU Compiler Collection ( GNAT ) .
This DevRoom aims to present a couple of the possibilities offered by the Ada Language ( object - oriented , multi- core , embedded programming ) and some of the very useful existing tools ( GNAT Programming Studio , GNATBench , ... ) .

Proposal for Developer Room -
Ada at the Free and Open source Software Developers ' European Meeting ( FOSDEM '2009 )
Ada-Belgium made a proposal for a Developer Room to hold presentations on Ada and related technologies at the Free and Open Source Software Developers ' European Meeting ( FOSDEM 2009 ) on 7 - 8 February 2009 in Brussels , Belgium .
At the time of submission ( Fri Nov 21 2008 ) 7 speakers from various origins ( universities , compiler assessment laboratory , companies ) and countries ( Belgium , France , and Spain ) have confirmed their will to participate to the event , and another one still had to ensure his contribution .
They propose to give talks about Ada and related Free Software technologies .
Ada-Belgium coordinates their joint DevRoom request .
At FOSDEM 2006 the full - day Ada DevRoom received a warm welcome from its public ( up to 65 participants at several presentations ) .
We hope to have this opportunity again , especially considering recent developments .
The use of the new Ada 2005 standard , which was published by ISO in 2007 , starts to spread thanks to the advent of its first full implementation , which is none other than the GNU Compiler Collection ( GNAT ) .
We present 11 talks below ( ordered by related themes ) .
They would be enough to fill a DevRoom for the entire duration of the FOSDEM event ( i.e. Saturday 7th from 12:00 to 18:00 and Sunday 8th from 10:00 to 17:00 ) .

Are you seeking a “ green ” way to build your next home ?
We ’re operating on the principle that one person ’s trash is another person ’s castle .
While ‘ trash ’ is n’t always free , using cast - offs to build a home is a great way to recycle .
While the homes below use tires , cans , earth , plastic water bottles and other items – or a combination of these items – the possibilities are as limitless as your imagination and your local building codes .
If you ’re expecting ‘ trashy ’ results with this recycling effort , we hope that our choices listed below will surprise you with their depth of creativity , beauty and charm .
Although the homes are listed in no particular order , this does not mean that we favor one ‘ trash ’ method over another or one design above any other layout .
Did you enjoy this article ?
Harry Shutt is shocked that the Financial Times has published one of his letters .
This does n’t normally happen , despite his firing off regular missives .
He thinks it might be a sign of the times .
For if the house organ of the global financial establishment is prepared to give space to the views of someone like him , something must be seriously amiss .
‘ I ’m sure that this would never have been published a year ago .
Now perhaps people see that the writing is on the wall , ’ he says .
Shutt is an economist who occupies the dissident edge of his profession .
At the height of the boom , while the masters of the universe where hiring the Palace of Versailles for weddings and Jennifer Lopez for birthday parties , Shutt was busy writing densely argued , if casually dismissed , counterblasts such as The Decline of Capitalism .
Barely a decade after its victory over communism , and just at the point of its hegemonic conquest of China and India , capitalism , he argued , was far less healthy than it appeared to be .
In fact , it was heading for a fall .
Now , in the midst of the worst global downturn for 70 years , Shutt ’s words have an eerie prescience .
‘ The lies and financial crimes that have underpinned this evanescent economic ‘ miracle ’ are only now being exposed as a result of a financial crisis , which , it is already clear , is the most catastrophic to hit the world since that of 1929 - 31 , which heralded the Depression of the 1930s , ’ he wrote in 2004 .
Greed is not to blame
But now that the crisis that Shutt predicted has finally arrived , he is concerned that blame is being pinned on the wrong culprit .
‘ People are hitting on greed , ’ he says .
‘ But greed is not a cause of things , greed is a symptom .
Greed has been with us since the Garden of Eden . ’
And it ’s not just greed .
For Shutt , many of the headline features of the economic crisis – sub - prime mortgages , liberalisation , fraud and unsustainable personal debt – are mere symptoms of something more fundamentally wrong .
That something , in his view , is the deepening stagnation of the capitalist system over the last 30 years and increasingly desperate measures on the part of western governments and financial elites to avert a major collapse .
‘ Instead of the promised revival of economic growth from the 1970s the rate of increase in global output has continued to decline in each succeeding decade , ’ he says .
You do n’t have to be a starry - eyed cheerleader for the market economy to retain a certain scepticism about claims for a fatal crisis of capitalism .
This is a system that has shrugged off perennial Marxist predictions of its imminent demise and penetrated into every corner of the globe .
But Shutt claims that through ‘ Orwellian processes of deception ’ the global establishment has been able to divert attention from the reality of deepening economic crisis and maintain the illusion that the system was working well .
Until reality got too real to ignore .
In order to understand Shutt ’s explanation for the crisis , it is necessary to take a brief detour through Marx .
According to Marx , capitalism is a system of accumulation .
Profits are made but ca n’t all be consumed by owners .
Extra profits need to be recycled through the market .
‘ The only way you can successfully recycle them is to either expand your existing business or diversify into another business , ’ says Shutt .
‘ It all depends on the ultimate consumer , consuming more and more .
It has to grow , growth is built in . ’
The problem is that as profits are invested into the market , generating more profits that in turn have to be reinvested , production expands until it reaches a level that can no longer be absorbed by consumers .
The market is glutted , and recession results .
But the destruction of capital and jobs creates pent up demand for the whole process to begin again in time .
That , in brief , is the business cycle .
But Shutt ’s argument is that western political leaders have , for years , based their economic strategy on avoiding or limiting the downside of the cycle , a doctrine encapsulated in Gordon Brown ’s famous boast of an ‘ end to boom and bust ’ .
Credit expansion has been fuelled , household debt recklessly encouraged , state services privatised , financial institutions subsidised and regulations banished all in order to find profitable outlets for a burgeoning ‘ wall of money ’ generated by the system .
A high rate of growth is needed to maintain this process , but ca n’t be sustained because of the weakness of demand in the economy .
The consequence is that money , frustrated in its search for productive activities to invest in , has turned to speculation .
‘ When you get to the point that you ca n’t actually make profits by producing more stuff – organic growth – profits get recycled into speculation , ’ says Shutt .
‘ In other words , you start placing bets that certain assets will increase in value . ’
And once speculation takes hold , it becomes advantageous to bring even more money into the market , because that pushes up the value of assets .
Hence , the ‘ leveraging ’ by speculators – the borrowing of more and more money to speculate on financial assets .
‘ Over the last 30 years you ’ve had a progressive postponing of the evil day , ’ he says .
‘ 1974/ 5 was the first financial crisis since the second world war , then you had the 1987 crash , which was inflated away by pumping lots of money into the banks .
Then it was shifted offshore .
We ’ve had the Mexican crisis , the East Asian crisis and the Russian crisis .
The big one was the dotcom bubble eight years ago .
And since then , we ’ve been building up to this one . ’
What the prolonged amassing of this huge surplus of capital cum fraud - driven credit bubble , means , according to Shutt , is the inevitable crash – the inexorable end of the business cycle – is going to be far more severe that it would otherwise have been .
‘ I think we are looking at negative growth , for an absolute minimum of two or three years and I would n’t be surprised if it ’s five or ten .
That would be a depression , ’ he says .
No light at the end of the tunnel
It ’s not a cheering prognosis – a protracted downturn of several years with the likely side effects of military conflict and scapegoating of minorities .
But Shutt has n’t finished yet .
There is no light at the end of the tunnel , or if there is , it ’s very dim .
He believes that that this slump will be much more difficult to emerge from than in previous downturns because traditional engines of growth are no longer available to drag us out .
Remove debt - fuelled consumption and property speculation from the equation , and you are left with anaemic subsititues such as the internet , the service sector and green technology .
The arguments of centre - left Keynesian commentators that the answer lies in re-regulating the financial sector and encouraging consumer spending , ignore the fact , says Shutt , that the demand for capital – the availability of new profitable productive activities to invest in – is in long - term decline , and consumer spending power has been exhausted .
‘ It is easy to say that we ’ll emerge from the slump eventually , but to quote Keynes , “ in the long run we are all dead ” , ’ he says .
‘ In other words there has to be a huge contraction in the meantime and the impact on livelihoods and lives is likely to be intolerable .
The fundamental misconception of mainstream commentators is that people can and should be induced to consume more when they ’re already ‘ maxed out ’ on credit .
In practice it is right and necessary that they should now be forced to rebuild their personal balance sheets , which means saving rather than spending .
Only once they ’ve done this , probably after several years will they be able to start spending again .
This pinpoints a fundamental weakness of capitalism .
In order to function it requires the perpetuation of unsustainable levels of consumption in order to absorb the endlessly expanding stock of capital . ’
The bust and its consequences demonstrate that the profit maximising model results in an unacceptably large number of losers says Shutt .
‘ And people , as we know from long historical experience , do n’t accept being losers forever .
Destitution and hopelessness is not something they will accept peacefully and indefinitely . ’
We need a rational alternative .
But he is not advocating taking control of the commanding heights of the economy , in erstwhile Marxist fashion .
He is not advocating nationalisation at all .
Instead , he says , enterprise should be made answerable to the public interest .
‘ I would n’t say abolish private property .
If people want to invest in risky ventures , such as gold mining in Angola and they want to maximise profits from that , that ’s fine , go off and do it .
They can even do it in Scotland , provided they adhere to environmental standards .
But if it fails you ’re on your own , ’ he says .
‘ On their own ’ means that investors would no longer enjoy the protection of limited liability , which restricts their financial liability to the amount they have invested .
If enterprises wanted the legal privilege of limited liability , they would have to demonstrate that what they were doing was in the public interest and they respected the public interest in the way they ran their business :
‘ As an entrepreneur , you must tailor your policies and what you do in terms of investment , employment , wages and prices in the interests of the public , and we are going to have a veto over what you do . ’
Growth would cease to be seen as a public good .
Any bank , which sought public funds , would be subject to these conditions .
Shutt is not delusional .
He is quite aware that such proposals are nowhere near even being contemplated in any mainstream circles .
But he is also convinced that the ruling elites of western societies are also clueless about the nature of their predicament .
‘ The confidence of our rulers , be they business leaders , politicians , or journalists , is shot to bits , ’ he says .
‘ They do n’t know a thing and they are floundering . ’
But despite his comparison of today ’s elites with the French aristocracy before 1789 and the Soviet regime prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall , Shutt believes there will come a point when reality has to be confronted .
‘ There are limits to denial , ’ he says .
‘ If the consequence of this is that nobody can step out of their house in Mayfair without being mugged , they maybe they might think differently .
All I can do is to try and get people to recognise the realities . ’

From Pete Eyre of Bureaucrash :
This past Friday afternoon when coming home from work I noticed a cop car parked in a no parking zone .
I contemplated just walking by to start enjoying some down time but concluded that if I do n’t speak up , even against such trivial law - breaking , who else would ?
As you ’ll see in the video below , despite having received a complaint by a citizen ( me ) the responding officer failed to hold his fellow officer to the same standard that he stated he would if a civilian engaged in similar activity .
And rather than apologizing for blatantly breaking the law , the officer who parked in the no parking zone thanked me by following me on foot – actions that unsurprisingly made me just a bit uncomfortable .
I share this video to document not just this situation but the mindset that unfortunately is all - too prevalent in policing today .
And to hopefully help hold accountability those who swear an oath to uphold the law but who in practice – at least in this case – are willing to not only flaunt that law but intimidate those who question them .
( CNN ) -- U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel will bring a " tough - minded " and " pragmatic " approach to the White House when he becomes President - elect Barack Obama 's chief of staff , according to people who know the Chicago , Illinois , native .
Rep. Rahm Emanuel has experience in the White House , on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill .
Emanuel , a former top aide to President Clinton , has accepted the position in the new administration , Obama confirmed in a statement Thursday .
" I announce this appointment first because the chief of staff is central to the ability of a president and administration to accomplish an agenda , " Obama said .
" And no one I know is better at getting things done than Rahm Emanuel . "
In the job , Emanuel would oversee the White House staff .
The chief of staff is usually involved in all the major decisions that the president makes and is responsible for making sure the administration carries out the president 's wishes .
Watch Emanuel call himself " fortunate " »
The chief of staff also often is involved in negotiations with congressional leaders when major legislation is under consideration .
Jim Manley , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , called Emanuel : " An excellent choice . "
" Rahm knows the Hill .
And he knows the White House .
He is a brilliant strategic thinker and someone who knows how to get things done , " Manley said .
Manley also rejected the idea that Emanuel is a true partisan that could not work with Republicans .
" That 's ridiculous .
Rahm understands politics is the art of compromise .
He 's got a deeply held set of views but he also understands to get things done you have to compromise , " he said .
After leaving the Clinton White House , Emanuel , 48 , was an investment banker on Wall Street and later was elected to the House of Representatives in 2002 from a heavily Democratic Chicago district .
He quickly rose to become the fourth - ranking Democrat in the House .
Watch what Emanuel brings to the White House »
It is Emanuel 's combination of experiences -- plus his strong personal relationship with Obama -- that would make him a strong chief of staff , said CNN political analyst Paul Begala , a fellow Clinton veteran .
" He has spent more time in the White House than President - elect Obama has .
That matters a lot .
It is a special place with its own rhythms , " Begala said .
See who Obama may be considering for his Cabinet »
" But , maybe most importantly , he 's got the relationship .
He has known Barack and Michelle Obama for a number of years . "
Before reports emerged that he had accepted the position , Emanuel told WLS - TV in Chicago that he had to consider the possible impact on his family .
Watch how Obama is starting his transition »
" I have a lot to weigh : the basis of public service , which I have given my life to , a career choice .
And most importantly , what I want to do as a parent , " Emanuel said in an interview that aired Wednesday .
Emanuel added : " This is not a professional choice .
This is a personal choice about what my wife and I want to do for our family , as much as what to do with my career . "
Emanuel 's at - times blunt approach would ensure the White House runs smoothly for the new president , said Mack McLarty , Clinton 's former chief of staff .
Watch as McLarty calls Emanuel an " excellent choice " »
" Rahm is high energy .
He 's direct .
He 's a tough - minded pragmatist .
So I think the years have been good to him in that regard , " McLarty said .
" I think the high - energy directness will serve him well .
" Rahm , like a lot of us , made mistakes , but he quickly corrected them . "
However , the lawmaker 's direct style has ruffled a number of feathers in Washington , and Emanuel is known as one of the toughest partisan fighters on Capitol Hill .
After reports that Emanuel had agreed to be Obama 's chief of staff on Thursday , the top Republican in the House , Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio , questioned the president - elect 's pick .
Election T - shirt : Obama inspires historic victory
" This is an ironic choice for a president - elect who has promised to change Washington , make politics more civil and govern from the center , " Boehner said .
According to a 2006 profile of Emanuel in Fortune magazine , Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma warned his fellow Republicans of Emanuel 's ferocity in a letter two years ago .
" He 's dangerous , " Cole told Fortune then .
" He has a closing intensity .
When he's got a political kill in sight , he 's absolutely relentless . "
But David Gergen , a CNN senior political analyst who has worked in five administrations , said the contrasting styles between Obama and Emanuel could help the new president get things done in Washington .
" They are obviously setting up a good cop / bad cop routine in the White House .
... Barack Obama can be the good guy , " Gergen said .
iReport.com : Who should be in Obama 's cabinet ?
Emanuel has made a career of being the tough guy .
In the 2006 Fortune profile , Begala described Emanuel 's aggressive style as a " cross between a hemorrhoid and a toothache . "
" I love Rahm , but that 's a small group of us , " he told Fortune .
CNN 's Ted Barrett and Don Lemon contributed to this report .
All About Rahm Emanuel • Barack Obama • The White House
Lately I ’ve been acting as the unofficial Git consultant for Skribit , usually in response to @ Stammy saying something on Twitter along the lines of “ Hey , git just did something totally nonintuitive and now I ca n’t figure out what to do next . ”
I ’ve been using Git long enough to know the answer , usually , or at least to be able to figure it out , plus I still remember how people used to SVN think , which helps .
image provided by twictur .es | original tweet here
I think I ’ve mentioned before how much I love Git .
I ’ve been a version control geek for a really long time : I remember getting way too excited about a feature that was like ‘ git cherry - pick ’ in some proprietary VCS we evaluated in 2000 or 2001 .
I still say that Darcs is the one I wish we had settled on , but I ’ve grown to love Git over the past year or so , especially with GitHub making some of the rough spots so much easier .
The thing that ’s hard about Git for most people is the same thing that ’s hard about all DVCS tools : if you ’re used to centralized systems , they work weird .
GitHub does n’t actually help with this : it ’s really easy to use Git + GitHub like SVN , and not take full advantage of all the cool stuff you get in a DVCS .
It ’s also really easy to never grok DVCS , so when something unusual happens , you do n’t know how to fix it .
There are lots of really good articles to help you get Git , and I ’m not going to try to duplicate them , nor am I going to make you a comprehensive list .
Ask in the comments if you ca n’t find what you need , and feel free to share good resources in the comments as well .
One I ’ll throw out there now is Git for Computer Scientists … if you want to really know what Git is doing , this is the way to go .
What I will do is give you a snapshot of my personal Git workflow (s ) .
I have several , depending on the kind of project .
Small team : one or two person project
A lot of my projects involve either just me , or me and Don , or me and someone else .
For these projects I do n’t usually take much advantage of the power of Git .
It goes something like this .
git pull
Hack some stuff
git commit - a -m " hacked some stuff "
git push
I rarely use topic branches when I ’m in this mode , and I do n’t pay too much attention to keeping a clean commit history .
In short , I use it alot like I would use SVN .
Every now and then I ’ll get distracted by a quick bug fix when I have a bunch of code I do n’t want to commit yet .
That ’s where stashing comes in .
git stash ( all my changes are saved away , and I have a clean tree )
( all my changes are saved away , and I have a clean tree )
Fix the bug
git commit - a -m " bugfix "
git stash pop ( changes are back )

Larger team
Lately , I ’ve been doing some client work to pay the bills , which means I ’m working with a group of other developers with a lot of tickets being handled all at once .
To minimize my pain ( and to keep nice and clean commit logs ) I use my own version of the SSP : Simplified Software Process .
git co master
git pull
Find a ticket to work on .
Let ’s say it ’s “ Add flanges to the WangleController ”
git co -b flanges_in_wangle
Write a test , write some code , etc .
Commit only what I know I want to commit .
I use git add -p to be selective .
to be selective .
git commit -- amend ( I write really nice commit messages when there are other people looking at the code , and I use amend to bundle all my changes into one commit )
( I write really nice commit messages when there are other people looking at the code , and I use amend to bundle all my changes into one commit )
Run the tests and make sure they pass
git co master
git pull
git co flanges_in_wangle
git rebase master
At this point , either it goes well or I have merge conflicts .
If I have conflicts , I fix them , and keep going .
It ’s better to have conflicts on a topic branch than in master .
Run the tests again .
If there are any code changes , commit , then repeat from checking out master again .
The idea is to make sure that when you finally merge flanges_in_wangle into master , it ’s going to be a clean fast - forward merge with no conflicts .
Once I ’m sure flanges_in_wangle is ready , git co master
git merge flanges_in_wangle
git push
Enlightenment
On my most recent large project that I started from scratch , I use something like the above , with one major exception : there is no ‘ master ’ .
Using ‘ origin ’ as the name of your remote and ‘ master ’ as the name of your main branch is just the default settings git gives you .
Neither name is magic .
So , I renamed ‘ origin ’ to ‘ github ’ in .git / config to be explicit about where the code is going .
Then , I created a new branch ‘ development ’ to reflect the code that is under the mainline of development .
Then I deleted ‘ master ’ .
Yeah , you heard me .
Who needs it ?
Once I was ready for stuff to go to staging , I made a ‘ staging ’ branch , and likewise for ‘ production ’ .
Topic branches merge into ‘ development ’ , which is merged periodically into ‘ staging ’ , which gets promoted to ‘ production ’ when it ’s ready for deployment .
There ’s never any doubt about what code is on each environment ; just look in the git repo .
The downside to this is that when you first clone the repo , it ’s broken , because git tries to checkout ‘ master ’ and it does n’t exist .
Not a big deal , just setup the right branches and all is well .
And you ?
So what ’s your git workflow ?
Share it in the comments , or blog about it and tell us about it .

Here is the Japanese version of the new trailer that will be shown tonight on Entertainment Tonight .
A better international version of this trailer is now available along with the domestic trailer in HD .
Did Israel – or its enemy , Hamas – commit war crimes during 22 days and nights of aerial assault , rocket launches and ground fighting in Gaza ?
In one sense the question is academic , because Israel will not recognise the conflict as an international one , and has not signed the 1977 Geneva protocol designed to apply to the victims of internal conflicts .
But international lawyers say general principles can be drawn from the laws of war , which may have been violated in several ways .
The main issues are these :
Proportionality
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Up to 10 times as many Palestinians were killed as Israelis .
The Palestinian Ministry of Health says 1,314 Palestinians were killed , of whom 412 were children or teenagers under 18 , and 110 were women .
On the Israeli side , there were 13 deaths between 27 December and 17 January , of whom three were civilians killed by rockets fired from Gaza .
Of the 10 soldiers killed , four were lost to " friendly fire " .
Even if the Palestinian figure is disputed , it is clear that the death toll was massively higher for Palestinians than Israelis .
Proportionality is not simply a matter of numbers , however .
There will also be a debate over whether the destruction wrought by Israel 's huge land , sea and air arsenal was proportionate to the threat posed by Hamas militants to civilians – itself also a violation of international humanitarian law .
With foreign journalists barred from Gaza by Israel throughout the war , it is especially hard to come by hard information on the exact circumstances in which all civilian casualties were caused .
But unofficial comment from senior military officers in the Israeli media have suggested that a deliberate choice was made to put the protection of its soldiers first , and that of civilians second .
If true , it appears to have been successful , but even if it was n't , the " collateral damage " inflicted on civilians appears to have significantly exceeded the norms even of previous Israeli operations in Gaza , suggesting looser rules of engagement for military operations .
The head of Human Rights Watch , Kenneth Roth , pointed out that there was an " expansive " definition of military targets , to include civilian government offices , police stations and the parliament building , on the grounds they at least indirectly helped Hamas .
Firing into urban areas
Israeli forces did not penetrate into the heart of Gaza City or Khan Yunis .
But many of the areas where they deployed their forces were heavily built up .
Probably the most lethal incident was the 6 January mortar attack that hit the UN school being used as a shelter for hundreds who had fled their homes in the northern Gaza town of Jabalya .
It killed 30 straight away , and an estimated 13 more died from their critical injuries in subsequent days .
Israel 's initial claim in this and several other incidents was that it was responding to fire from Hamas .
The militants could be at fault for " locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas " , in the words of the Geneva Conventions .
But the conventions also forbid any attack expected to cause death or injury to civilians " which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated " – a rule Israel is accused of breaking several times .
Though it fortunately caused no deaths and only two injuries , the incident in which shells containing phosphorus hit the UN Relief and Works Agency headquarters – where many were also sheltering – was almost as high profile .
Not only did they set fire to food and medical supply warehouses , they landed as the UN Secretary - General , Ban Ki-moon , was holding meetings with Israeli leaders .
UN chiefs vigorously denied Israeli suggestions made in the media , though apparently not to the UN itself , that Hamas gunmen had been sheltering in UN premises .
In the first case Chris Gunness , UNRWA 's chief spokesman , revealed that diplomats had been told by the Israeli authorities that Hamas was not operating from the school .
And in the second , Mr Ban said that Israel 's Defence Minister , Ehud Barak , had acknowledged a " grave mistake " .
White phosphorus
White phosphorus – which can cause horrific injuries , and is heavily restricted in international law – is now widely accepted to have been used by Israel in this war at several locations .
Dating originally from the First World War , white phosphorus and its distinctive plumes of white smoke can legally be used to mark objectives , spread smoke for concealment or set fire to military targets , but not in civilian areas .
Israel first denied using it at all , then claimed it was being used only in uninhabited areas , and then last week announced an investigation into its use .
A high school student Mahmoud al - Jamal , 18 , was lucky to have been hit by phosphorus shelling during the third week of the war .
By the time he reached the care of Gaza City 's Shifa hospital , unconscious and severely burned in his left arm , legs and chest , the head of the burns unit , Dr Nafez abu Shaban knew the only hope of saving him lay with surgery .
Shifa had no experience of it before 27 December , but " by the last week of the war we knew that we had to get the patient to the operating room and excise all the burnt tissue " .

Mahmoud was running from the heavy fighting between Hamas gunmen and Israeli forces in the southern Gaza city district of Tel Al Hawa when a shell dropped in front of him .
" I could feel my whole body burning , " he said .
" I fell and asked someone next to me to help .
But he was dead .
Then I fainted . "
Part of his body was still smouldering when he was being anaesthetised in theatre .
" A piece extracted itself from his body and burned the anaesthetist on his chest , " said Dr Shaban .
Mahmoud will live ; unconfirmed estimates are that dozens of others burned by phosphorus have not survived .
Dime bombs and other unusual weapons
While the vast majority of Palestinians were killed by conventional weapons , a Norwegian doctor , Erik Fosse , said injuries he had seen in Gaza were consistent with the use of Dime ( dense inert metal explosive ) bombs .
" It was as if [ patients ] had stepped on a mine , but there was no shrapnel in the wounds , " he said .
A UN convention , which Israel has signed , prohibits " the use of any weapon the primary effect of which is to injure by fragments which in the human body escape detection by X - rays " .
This could apply to Dime bombs , but by their nature it is extremely difficult to prove they have been used .
Amnesty International last week called on Israel to give details of weapons beside phosphorus it had used in Gaza , so that medics could better treat the injuries they inflict .
Donatella Rovera of Amnesty , currently on a munitions fact - finding mission to Gaza , said doctors were encountering " new and unexplained injuries , including charred and sharply severed limbs " after air strikes .
The UK human rights agency also quoted Dr Subhi Skeik of Shifa hospital 's surgery department as saying : " We have many cases of amputations and vascular reconstructions where patients would be expected to recover in the normal way .
But to our surprise , many of them died an hour or two after operation .
It is dramatic . "
Dr Shaban of Shifa 's burns unit said surgical colleagues had encountered bloodless amputations of limbs after attacks during the war , and that some Egyptian and Jordanian doctors with experience in Lebanon and Iraq had suggested that Dime bombs could be responsible .
But both Amnesty and Human Rights Watch 's weapons expert Mark Galasco , who is also in Gaza , are highly cautious about speculating on the possibility of Dime , not least because of the difficulty of finding provable traces of it .
Israel has always insisted that its weaponry – including controversial flechette darts , which have been used in Gaza before and have been found so far in two northern Gaza locations this time – is legal .
There is no outright ban on Dime bombs , flechettes or even white phosphorus .
It is the time and the manner in which they are used that can be illegal .
Targeting of civilians
Israel has continued to contrast what it says are its strenuous efforts to avoid civilian casualties with Hamas 's undoubtedly deliberate targeting of civilians with Qassam rockets .
There have , however , been several cases in which Palestinian civilians were hit while taking shelter .
In other incidents , people in Gaza said they were fired on while seeking to flee to safety , in some cases waving white flags .
In the most widely publicised case , the UN says 80 members of the Samouni family were sheltering in a warehouse hit by missiles early on 5 January , killing 29 .
Several survivors said they had been ordered by the army to go there the previous day .
Meanwhile , Khaled Abed Rabbo said a single soldier shot three of his young daughters from a tank , killing two , as they obeyed orders to flee their home on the outer edge of Jabalya .
He suggested it was a deliberate act ,
The army is investigating , but reaffirms that " the IDF does not target civilians " .
Yesterday Mr Rabbo's mother Suad , 54 , who was shot in the arm and abdomen at the same time , corroborated his account .
She said she , her daughter and her seven - year - old granddaughter were all carrying white flags when they were shot .
She did not see the soldier who fired , but insisted there were no Palestinian fighters in the vicinity .
Humanitarian aid
While basic humanitarian supplies , including medicine , continued to flow into Gaza from Israel during the war , the UN and other agencies complained more than once that there were severe problems in distributing food and other aid within Gaza because of continuing security problems .
These were compounded when a driver contracted by UNRWA was shot dead near the Erez crossing as he prepared to load food , ready for moving it south during a three - hour humanitarian pause .
There were also several complaints from the Red Cross and Israeli human rights agencies that medics and rescue services were prevented from reaching the wounded and dead .
Four weak and terrified children from the Samouni family were finally found by the Red Cross , two days after the attack that killed 29 other family members .
After the ground attack started , one convoy , consisting of an ICRC truck and a Palestinian Ministry of Health truck , both carrying medical supplies for hospitals in southern Gaza , and 13 ambulances carrying intensive care patients to Egyptian hospitals , had to turn back after the ICRC driver was shot and injured near a military checkpoint in the centre of the strip .
Fuel shortages and power cuts continued to deprive about a million Gazans of electricity at any one time .
Sewage and water supplies were badly hit , because pumps could not operate .
David Cameron said the Tories ' promise to match Labour 's planned spending up to 2011 was now unsustainable .
In a significant shift of policy , the Conservative leader said the Government 's investment plans were based on " heroic assumptions " about the country 's economic recovery .
" Labour 's economic mismanagement makes it vital for the long - term health of our economy that we set a new path for restraining the growth of spending , " he told reporters .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" That means for the year 2010 / 11 we need change , not more of the same .
" That means reducing planned government spending growth and not matching Labour 's spending plans .
" To be absolutely clear - to stop future tax rises the growth rate of spending in 2010 / 11 will have to be lower than the growth rate laid out by Labour .
" The growth rates of spending in the years beyond 2010 / 11 , pencilled in by the Chancellor last year , are also now unsustainably high . "
Mr Cameron also warned that Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's proposed " fiscal stimulus " was merely storing up tax rises for the years to come .
A £ 30bn injection to the economy would mean an 8 per cent rise in income tax later , he claimed .
Mr Cameron said recent forecasts meant the British economy could not withstand previous spending commitments without inflicting bigger tax rises on the public later .
Tax cuts now would make the situation even worse , he added .
Speaking at a Westminster press conference , he said : " What once looked affordable in boom times is now clearly unsustainable .
" Let me put this as clearly as I can - unless we curb the growth of spending , taxes will need to rise in future .
" Without such restraint the borrowing bombshell will turn into a tax bombshell and if Gordon Brown cuts taxes now the bombshell will be even bigger . "

The Tory leader said senior Labour figures had already admitted as much .
He pointed to Business Secretary Lord Mandelson 's comments yesterday that a fiscal boost to the economy now would require a " medium - term adjustment " in the years ahead .
Mr Cameron said the change did not represent a cut in spending , although he would not specify at this stage where spending priorities would lie .
He said : " Of course Labour will try their old lies about Tory cuts .
If they do , we will know they are planning tax rises .
" But they do n't understand what has changed : no - one believes them any more , no - one listens to that kind of lie any more , no one 's interested in the old politics any more .
" People are not fools - they can see that reducing the increase in Government spending is not a cut , but what it says it is : less of an increase .
" They can see all around them that if anyone is actually cutting public services it is Labour with its targets , bureaucracy and incompetence leading to maternity services , accident and emergency units and GP surgeries all closing down . "
Mr Cameron urged Chancellor Alistair Darling to reduce his plans for 2010 / 11 spending growth in next week 's Pre-Budget Report .
And he repeated the Conservatives ' demand for an independent Office of Budget Responsibility to be set up to hold the Government to account .
The Tory leader also promised to look at further short - term measures to " help people directly " .
" We will continue to see what more can be done right now to put money in people 's pockets without adding to borrowing and our ballooning national debt , " he said .
" That 's why , in my conference speech , I asked all my shadow ministers to review all over again every spending programme to see if it is really necessary and really justifiable . "
Mr Cameron said he wanted to get Britain on " the path to permanent tax cuts in the future " .
Mr Cameron said he could not say whether the party would vote against any specific tax cuts proposed by the Government next week until it had seen the detail of the Pre-Budget Report .
Asked if education and health spending would be protected , he said : " We are not announcing the make - up of 2010 spending today .
It would be difficult to do that .
" The Government itself has said that , when it comes to health and education spending in 2010 , its own plans are under review .
" What we do know is that the NHS is our number one priority ; that we do believe in real - terms spending in the health service and that 's what will happen . "
Only one government in history had cut NHS spending , he said - Labour in 1977 .
" That was the result of a failure to observe fiscal prudence and I think it is quite an important lesson : the time when you experience cuts is when your government tears up the rule book , maxes out on the credit card and bankrupts the nation .
" That 's the lesson that I learn from the history books . "
He accused the Prime Minister of risking the long - term health of the economy in a bid to ensure he won the next General Election .
" What Gordon Brown is trying to do is find an international cover for what he wants to do for electoral and political reasons in the UK .
I think that is a great mistake . "
No responsible politician could promise that taxes would not rise , he said , but the Tories would do " everything we can to stop those tax rises coming down the track at you " .
Mr Cameron told reporters : " My profound sense in politics is that the British public are not fools by any imagination .
They are very sharp , they are very perceptive , they know exactly what is going on right now .
" They know that the nation has maxed out on its credit card .
They know that we cannot really afford a tax giveaway paid for by another borrowing splurge .
And they know that if that happens it will mean tax rises in the future .
" Why do they know this ?
Because they have experience the last decade .
After the last two elections , the Government put up taxes on average by £ 9bn .
" That would be peanuts compared to what would happen after the next election if Gordon Brown borrowed and spends £ 30bn . "
The Tory leader also said " even more action " was needed to resolve the banking crisis and ensure money was being lent to house - buyers and businesses .
But he refused to give details of specific proposals , pointing only to moves by the US Federal Reserve to lend money directly to firms in America .
Fast - growing salmon .
Pork containing heart - healthy omega - 3 fatty acids .
These are two examples of products you might see in your local supermarket soon -- animals developed not through conventional breeding but through genetic engineering .
On Jan. 15 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration decided how it will regulate genetically engineered animals , for the first time paving the way for such animals or their products to be sold as food and medicine .
The agency has decided to categorize genetically engineered farm animals , also called transgenic animals , as an “ animal drug . ”
They will be held to the same requirements already existing for conventionally bred animals treated with hormones or antibiotics .
( In the case of transgenic animals , the “ drug ” is a snippet of DNA . )
Products derived from them or containing them as an ingredient will not necessarily require labeling .
A wide range of interested parties , including companies developing genetically engineered animals and consumer protection groups , are generally comfortable with the FDA decision .
And yet , consumer acceptance of transgenic animals , particularly as food products , is still an unknown .
American consumers have been eating food from genetically engineered crops , such as corn , soybeans and canola , for a decade .
However , transgenic animals have not been sold , pending the FDA deliberations on how to regulate them .

Why would someone want to genetically engineer animals ?
Genetic engineering is a high - tech way to “ breed ” desirable traits into livestock .
The benefits might be for the producer , such as a disease - resistant cow or an easy - to - raise salmon .
It might be for the environment -- pigs that produce milder manure , for example -- or for the consumer , say , more nutritious meat .
The old - fashioned way of breeding farmed animals requires selecting offspring with desired traits over successive generations .
Ron Stotish , chief executive of Aqua Bounty Technologies in Waltham , Mass. , says the power of genetic engineering is that the same end is achieved in “ one fell swoop . ”
Transgenic animals also can be fitted with traits they probably would never develop naturally , as in the case of omega - 3 - producing pigs .

How is an animal genetically engineered ?
An extra piece of genetic material ( DNA ) is inserted into the animal ’s genome at the earliest stages of development .
Sometimes the method involves manipulating a fertilized egg that is then implanted into a surrogate mother ; other times , it alters a cell from which an animal will be cloned .
As the embryo grows , the DNA splice is replicated with the rest of the genetic material so that it ends up in every cell of the individual .
In fast - growing salmon developed by Aqua Bounty , the inserted gene is a salmon growth hormone , identical to the one the fish have naturally .
The benefit comes from the precise placement of the added gene , which makes it active at times that the natural gene is not .
“ Normal salmon grow very , very slowly , and when it is cold they do n’t grow at all , ” Stotish says .
“ Our gene is active under a broader range of conditions and it allows the animals to grow . ”
At 1 year old , a normal salmon might weigh 30 grams , but the transgenic fish weigh a kilogram , he says .

In pigs developed to contain omega - 3 fatty acids , the added gene directs formation of an enzyme that converts naturally occurring omega - 6 fatty acids to omega - 3s .
The gene is derived from tiny roundworms but is modified to make it more mammalian , says Randall Prather , co-director of the National Swine Resource and Research Center at the University of Missouri in Columbia , who developed these pigs .

Why did the FDA opt to regulate genetically engineered animals in this manner and what criteria are used to assess safety ?
The FDA is responsible for food safety and already regulates genetically modified crops .
By considering a DNA segment a drug , the agency will regulate transgenic animals in the same way it oversees dairy cows that receive growth hormone or beef cattle that get antibiotics , says FDA spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey .
Advertisement
By using existing guidelines for so - called animal drugs , the FDA can put those products seeking approval into a process that is already up and running .
“ They have the staff and the process that allows them to look at this .
They do it every day , ” says Stotish of Aqua Bounty , which has been seeking FDA approval for its fast - growing salmon for years .
Companies must show that their genetic manipulation is safe to the animal and that any food or animal - feed products derived from the animal are safe for the consumer and safe for the environment .
Companies must also demonstrate that their claims about the gene - carried traits do occur .

Are there concerns beyond what the FDA can regulate ?

Gregory Jaffe , who follows biotechnology for the consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest , says the adopted guidelines are a good start “ in the sense that the federal government has acknowledged that these animals are on the horizon and there needs to be oversight to ensure their safety . ”
But , he adds , genes are not the same as drugs .
Drugs may have long - lasting effects on an individual , but they would n’t get passed on to future generations .
In the case of biotech animals , however , “ you ’re altering the DNA of that animal , which gets carried on to its offspring . ”
( Aqua Bounty says all the fish it markets will be sterile . )
Such lasting effects may have implications for preventing escape of the genes to natural populations , Jaffe says -- an issue that is beyond the FDA ’s expertise or authority .
Jaffe thinks the safety review should be more open and transparent .
“ Our regulatory processes for drugs ” -- including animal drugs -- “ are , on the whole , secret and done behind closed doors , ” he says .
By law , the company controls what information is made public .
Advertisement
Other regulatory processes , such as those for pesticides at the Environmental Protection Agency , have been opened in past decades to invite public participation .
“ Genetically engineered animals are highly controversial , ” Jaffe says .
“ I think that they [ the FDA ] need to have a transparent and participatory regulatory system -- where the public can review safety data and . . . expert scientists can provide comments to the agency . ”

Why did the FDA decide that food from genetically engineered animals does n’t have to be labeled ?
Advertisement
The FDA labels food based on nutritional content , not manufacturing process , says the agency ’s DeLancey .
“ So , if the food product is ‘ materially different ’ from a conventional product , then FDA can require that it be labeled .
But the FDA does n’t require that a pork chop label specify whether it came from a pig produced through artificial insemination versus conventional breeding . ”
And similarly , now , if it came from genetically engineered animals .
“ We understand that consumers want transparency and labeling , but we are constrained by the regulations put in place by Congress , ” DeLancey says .

How will I know if the food I buy is from genetically engineered animals ?
Pork from an omega - 3 pig , should it gain approval , will be labeled because nutritional enhancement is a selling point -- and because the product is different from regular pork .
In other cases you may not know , although producers can voluntarily label their products .
Researchers at the University of Guelph in Canada , who developed the so - called Enviropig with “ greener ” manure , say they intend to do so .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has guidelines for labeling “ natural meats , ” which would allow meat from non-transgenic animals to call attention to that fact .

Terry Childs , the allegedly rogue sysadmin accused of locking San Francisco authorities out of their own network at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars , will stand trial on four charges of tampering with a computer network .
At a preliminary hearing last week , a judge ruled there was enough evidence of his probable guilt to go forward to trial , the San Francisco Chronicle reports .
His arraignment hearing was scheduled for January 13 .
Childs , 44 , from Pittsburg , has been held on $ 5 m bail since July .
He allegedly withheld a master password to San Francisco 's new FiberWAN municipal network , which he created and ran .
FiberWAN reportedly handles about 60 per cent of the city 's data , including police and payroll records .
Officials were locked out of the network for almost two weeks in July .
Childs eventually gave up the password after a jail visit from San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom .
In an unsuccessful bid to have his bail reduced , Childs ' lawyer argued that he had created the password to protect FiberWAN .
" Mr Childs had good reason to be protective of that network , " said defence lawyer Erin Crane .
" His co-workers and supervisors had in the past maliciously damaged the system themselves .
" He was the only person in the department capable of running that system . "
Prosecutors have claimed that Childs created and withheld the password as an " insurance policy " against being fired .
Prior to the lockout he was the subject of disciplinary procedures for allegedly poor performance , they said .
In September it was reported that the total cost of the incident could exceed $ 1 m . ®
Kanye
West has just learned a valuable lesson when it comes to doing things on the Internet : do n't use the same password for everything .
We 're only half kidding , but Kanye claims that nearly every account he had across the web has been " hacked " and that those behind the hacks are spreading rumors that he has starred in not just any porn , but bisexual porn .
In a gloriously all - caps blog post , Kanye said that his Twitter account , MySpace account , and personal Gmail account have all been hacked since sometime last week .
He expressed extreme frustration that his fans have believed some of the claims made on these accounts , and that Rolling Stone magazine had even reprinted an allegedly fake statement made on Twitter about Steven Colbert .
He even found out that he has 12 " unauthorized "
Skype accounts under his name .
" I JUST GAVE THE PERFORMANCE OF MY LIFETIME FOR OUR NEW PRESIDENT ...
THEN I FLEW TO PARIS AND THEY DEBUTED MY NEW SHOES THAT I DESIGNED WITH LOUIE VUITTON WHICH WAS A DREAM COME TRUE .
PLEASE I BEG YOU , GIVE ME A BREAK !!!!!
PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! , " wrote West .
" I HAD THE TWO GREATEST DAYS OF MY LIFE AND WHEN I GET BACK FROM THE LOUIE SHOW I READ SOME SHIT CLAIMING I SAID I'M DOWN TO DO PORN AND SOME BISEXUAL PORN !!!! "
It 's not immediately clear from Kanye 's post as to whether an actual hack was involved or just incredibly poor security measures on his and the sites ' part .
Either way , he is clearly not pleased .
The incident follows a growing trend of people gaining access into high - profile celebrities ' personal accounts .
There was , of course , the infamous Paris Hilton cell phone hack of 2005 , but other , similar events have happened in recent years , such as the " hack " of former - Vice - President - candidate Sarah Palin 's personal Yahoo e-mail account and numerous other celebrity blogs , Twitter accounts , and MySpace accounts .
In some of these incidents , the root cause has ultimately come down to an easy - to - guess ( or at least easy - to - brute - force - crack ) password and little security on the provider 's end to protect from an unauthorized party gaining access .
If this is what has happened to poor Kanye , we 've got two pieces of advice : use unique and tough - to - guess passwords , and remember that which does n't kill you will only make you stronger .

All that is needed , at a bare minimum , are the most common of tools — a pad and pencil .
Even the acquisition of a computer has fallen within the means of most people with an inclination for putting words on paper .
And , it appears that writing requires only a primary education to get started .
If , however , we look more closely at this craft , to examine just what it is that a writer does , we find that the wordsmith is in reality an artist who merely happens to use different tools .
Instead of brush and oils he paints his canvas with pen and ink .
Instead of a musical instrument using notes and scales , he composes his melodies with syllables , words , and sentences .
Instead of hammer and chisel he painstakingly sculpts paragraphs , chapters , and entire books .
Instead of camera and film , he takes snapshots of his thoughts and develops them on his notepad or keyboard .
Instead of stimulating our brains with a flood of colors , shapes , or sounds , he tickles our senses with metaphors and similes that send us on flights of fancy .
The author ’s interpretation of personal experiences , and the world in which we live , is the tapestry from which he creates and displays his artistry .
Like all other artists , however , the writer has a vision of the world that the casual observer overlooks , or must be induced to see .
The writer is like an architect , but one who designs his buildings with ideas riveted into the girders of common speech .
He toils in solitude , coping with the fact that his art form is under - appreciated because it seems that anyone can do it and indeed many try .
Yet , to be successful , the writer must be extraordinarily creative , applying his talent in ways that others can only appreciate as readers .
In spite of the obvious artistry involved and pleasure derived , writing as a profession is becoming an endangered species .
Although there is no shortage of writing talent in this modern age , the written word is surely under attack from many directions .
It is in the process of being eclipsed by the proliferation of electronic devices in today ’s marketplace .
The shorthand of text messaging is but one example of writing ’s demise .
This nuveau method of communication uses the barest of syllables and words , totally unencumbered by the elegance of language , all in order to feed society ’s ever - increasing need for instant gratification .
Booksellers are struggling .
Publishers produce fewer titles and refuse to print books by unknown authors .
Many newspapers no longer do book reviews , the irony of which seems to be lost on them .
Think about it — the very same people who are in the business of selling the printed word , are doing less and less to promote reading of the self - same printed word , all in the name of cost effectiveness .
How long will it be before they convince their remaining customers that they too are obsolete ?

TALLAHASSEE , Fla. , Dec. 7 ( UPI ) -- Florida taxpayers paid $ 430,000 for Gov. Charlie Crist 's 12 - day European tour this summer , a newspaper investigation found .
The Republican governor 's trade mission to London , Paris , Madrid and St. Petersburg , Russia , was supposed to cost taxpayers $ 255,000 , but the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported Sunday that the tab was actually more than $ 430,000 .

The newspaper said taxpayers footed the bill for Crist and his entourage of more than two dozen people , including a photographer , a spokeswoman , four aides , two agency heads and nine bodyguards .
The Sun-Sentinel 's investigation found that the governor 's bodyguards alone spent more than $ 148,000 on meals , hotels , transportation and incidentals , including nearly $ 630 in dry cleaning .
Crist 's expenses , which totaled more than $ 30,000 , were not paid by taxpayers but by business executives who went on the trip .
His London hotel suite cost $ 2,179 , the Sun Sentinel learned .
To get to Europe , Crist flew first class for about $ 8,000 round - trip , courtesy of a Miami travel agency .
" I think it 's important to promote free trade , " Crist said .
" You want to have it be as economical as you can , and when you consider that it should produce hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in Florida , I think it 's important to do . "
Three Canadian soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan Friday , raising the Canadian death toll there above the sombre milestone of 100 .
Cpl. Mark Robert McLaren , based in Petawawa , Ont. , was killed along with two other Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan on Friday .
( Department of National Defence )
All three — Cpl. Mark Robert McLaren , Pte. Demetrios Diplaros and Warrant Officer Robert Wilson — were based at CFB Petawawa in eastern Ontario .
Canada has now lost 100 soldiers and one diplomat since it first began the military mission six years ago .
As with many of the deaths , the latest casualties came from an improvised explosive device ( IED ) — one of the Taliban 's weapons of choice .
The three were in an armoured vehicle when it struck the IED west of Kandahar city around 9 a.m. local time .
According to the CBC's David Common , the explosion left a crater in the road that was nine metres deep .
" The road was just separated in two , " Commons told CBC.ca .
In an unrelated incident , two soldiers were also injured Friday , one of them seriously , by an explosion while on foot patrol in the Zhari district , west of Kandahar city .
PM offers condolences to tight - knit base
Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered his condolences directly to the troops at the Petawawa base while attending a Christmas charity event for military families .
Pte. Demetrios Diplaros was killed in the IED attack on his armoured vehicle during a joint patrol with Afghan National Army soldiers in the Arghandab district .
( ( DND ) )
" Bases like this are tight knit .
They are an extended family in every sense of the word , " Harper told the solemn crowd at the base , located about 170 kilometres from Ottawa .
" This family suffered a terrible loss , three terrible losses . "
The deaths were a first for the new rotation of troops who had arrived in Kandahar in September .
While Diplaros was on his first tour , McLaren had returned for his second tour despite suffering injuries previously in Afghanistan .
Information about Wilson , whose name was temporarily withheld earlier Friday at his family 's request , was not immediately available .
Back in 2006 , McLaren was injured by shrapnel when two American warplanes accidentally killed a Canadian and injured 30 others .
" [ Cpl. McLaren ] was anxious to return and assist the Afghan national army to bring peace and stability to this country , " Brig . - Gen. Denis Thompson , commander of Canadian troops , said .
Thompson said McLaren , 23 , also risked his life several weeks ago by crawling towards an Afghan soldier , who had been shot , while under fire in order to provide him with first aid .
Warrant Officer Robert Wilson also died in Friday 's attack .
His name was released late Friday .
( ( DND ) ) McLaren 's father , Alan , described his son as a passionate man who wanted to make a difference and believed in the Afghanistan mission .
" [ He ] was living a dream , did what he wanted to do , put his life on the line .
Now we 're remembering him for that , " his father told CBC News by telephone from Peterborough , Ont .
He said his son planned to attend university and make a life with his fiancée , Michelle , when he returned .
The general , meanwhile , described 24 - year - old Diplaros as an " exceptional gunner and driver . "
" He was generally known to his friends and colleagues as Dip because of their inability to pronounce his last name , " said Thompson .
Speaking from his home in Scarborough , Ont. , Anargyros Diplaros commended his son's bravery , saying he will proudly remember him as " my boy , my sweetheart , my braveness . "
" I was prepared for this .
It 's very hard , but I was prepared for it , " the elder Diplaros told CBC News .
When asked if he had a message for politicians in the wake of his son's death , Diplaros said there were many other ways the Canadian government could spend " millions or billions or trillions to help other countries instead of killing each other .
" I strongly believe that there are many , many other ways we can bring all the countries together , all the nationalities together , instead of killing each other and fighting . "
McLaren said his son's death has n't affected his belief in the importance of the mission .
" People always tend to refocus when someone passes away but if Mark were here , I 'd agree with him that he was considering the greater good rather than his own safety , " he said .
" Even after I heard my son passed away , my position on it benefiting the Afghan people has n't changed . "
Milestone may revive Afghanistan debate
Soldiers at Petawawa were upset that the latest casualty came three weeks before Christmas , especially after a three - month lull in fatalities for the Canadian Forces .
Before Friday , the last Canadian death was on Sept. 7 , when Sgt. Scott Shipway was killed under similar circumstances after his armoured vehicle struck an improvised explosive device during a security patrol .
Two Canadian aid workers — an education specialist from Montreal and an educator from B.C. — were shot dead in eastern Afghanistan in August .
" To have gone for three straight months gave soldiers here perhaps a little bit of cautious optimism , " said CBC's David Common .
" That optimism , of course , shattered … tonight , as there are many solemn faces . "
The Canadian milestone is expected to revive debate about the country 's role in Afghanistan , though soldiers at Petawawa were focused solely on the individual deaths .
" For some it could be a number , for some it could be a milestone , " said one soldier , who did n't give his name .
" We do n't think about the numbers .
We think about our fallen comrades , our brothers in arms . "
The general , too , sought to downplay the talk of the death toll and keep the spotlight on the individual lives lost .
" Already there is talk of numbers and milestones , but it is my hope that the focus remains on the lives and the sacrifices of these brave soldiers as they serve Canada in the effort to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan , " said Thompson .
One military expert told CBC News that Friday 's deaths are unlikely to have an impact on Canada 's military mission .
" There 's a lot of anger and sadness after something like this , but [ the soldiers ] are professionals [ who are ] trained to deal with it and will continue with their job at hand , as they believe the soldiers who have been killed would have wanted them to , " said Mercedes Stephenson , a military analyst .
In the recent election campaign , Harper vowed to withdraw Canadian troops from Afghanistan in 2011 and said Canadians did n't have an appetite to keep soldiers stationed there any longer .
About 2,500 Canadian soldiers are among the 50,700 soldiers from around the world serving in Afghanistan .
Forces pursuing more aggressive strategy
Canadian soldiers have been fighting in the Arghandab district , a hotbed of insurgent activity , for many months .
The past summer was a particularly violent one in Afghanistan , with insurgents carrying out several high - profile attacks on troops from the NATO - commanded International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) .
As the temperature dropped , militant attacks subsided with it .
The Canadian Forces are hoping to take advantage of the lull in insurgent activity .
Thompson said in October that Canadian and other ISAF forces would be stepping up their attacks on insurgents in the winter , with the help of a more experienced Afghan army .
The strategy marks a change in approach from previous winters , when fighting traditionally died down due to harsher weather .
A month before Thompson 's announcement , Harper pledged to bring home the bulk of combat forces in Afghanistan by 2011 .
Harper said at the time that Canada will have " done its bit at that point . "
The rising costs of the Afghan mission likely played a factor in his decision .
Parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page tabled a report in October that said the price tag of the Canadian mission could be as high as $ 18.1 billion by 2011 .
An explosion equal to more than a kiloton of TNT rocked the sky over a remote part of northern Sudan late Monday night , ending a 20 - hour scramble to track the first Earth impacting meteoroid to be discovered before impact .
Though the meteoroid was not expected to reach Earth 's surface , the astronomers ' goal was to refine the trajectory and predict where the automobile - sized rock was headed to test their ability to track potentially dangerous asteroids in the future .
There are three reported " sightings " of the resulting fireball so far :
The first was from a weather satellite over Europe and Africa that imaged the fireball as a cluster of pixels ;
The second was a seismometer in Kenya that picked up the kiloton blast ;
And the third was a KLM pilot who saw the streak of light from 750 nautical miles away .
On the map above , the plane is marked by the cross and the asteroid by the circle .
The space rock graciously targeted a very rural part of the world , allowing its gigantic fireball to serve as a warning to keep an eye on the sky .
It also proved to be a good dry run for scientists to see how quickly they could coordinate observations and calculate trajectories .
The real question is , if it had been bigger ( in which case we might have had a few days more warning ) , and headed towards a major city , what could we have done ?
This is the very scenario Apollo astronaut Rusty Schweickart has been asking the world to address .
The time to make an emergency plan is not after you know where it is going to hit .
Then only the impacted country will be concerned about it , and there might not be much they can do on their own .
However if we come up with a global plan ahead of time , it could end up coming to the aid of my country just as well as yours .

New comments cause more outrage after leftist historian said he did n’t care about what really happened on 9/11
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Friday , Nov 21 , 2008
Just days after left - wing anti-war icon Howard Zinn told an audience that he did n’t care if 9/11 was an inside job , he has repeated the sentiment , stating that questions regarding the attacks have “ no practical political significance ” and that 9/11 truth activists are “ fanatics ” who are wasting their time .
During a lecture at UQAM university in Montréal , Zinn was once again asked if he would support a new 9/11 investigation .
Zinn responded :
“ I have said that what happened on 9/11 deserves to be investigated more than it has been because I do n’t accept and believe official investigations and official reports .
But having said that , and I want to say that this has really annoyed a lot of people , but why not , and I will annoy more people by saying that I think there are many people who have become fanatics about 9/11 .
By fanatics I mean , they think we should drop everything and just concentrate our energies on finding out what happened on 9/11 .
I do n’t think the question of what really happened on 9/11 is the most important question we can ask . ”
Zinn then took a direct swipe at the 9/11 truth movement by stating :
“ To tell a movement of citizens in the United States that this is something that we really have to make an issue of , I do n’t believe it because we do n’t need what happened on 9/11 , we do n’t need that to tell us about the crimes of the Bush administration .
I believe there are certain things that happen in history and certainly questions that are asked that divert us from the important things that we have to do at hand .
The truth is I do n’t think anyone will ever really know what happened on 9/11 just as I do n’t think anyone will really know who killed John F. Kennedy , and there are a lot of people who wasted a huge amount of time working on something that did not have any practical political significance . ”
Zinn then asserted that his previous comments at a lecture in Colorado has been distorted and that he never said he did not care about 9/11 or the fact that it was in the past .
Zinn ’s exact words that day were “ I do n’t know enough about it ( the 9/11 conspiracy ) and the truth is I do n’t much care , that ’s past . ”

( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
In our previous article we analysed how other leftist luminaries such as Noam Chomsky have belittled the efforts of 9/11 truth activists and attempted to dismiss the political significance of asking questions and highlighting evidence of government complicity in the attacks , while at the same time clearly acknowledging that the truth remains covered up and withheld .
This cements commentators such as Zinn and Chomsky as intellectual cowards and allows them to be used as leftist gatekeepers by an establishment that even they admit has used 9/11 as a means to facilitate aggressive and monstrous foreign and domestic agendas .
What really happened on 9/11 is not a distraction , it is the key to everything :
Without 9/11 there would be no “ war on terror ” .
Without 9/11 there would be no “ clash of civilizations ”
Without 9/11 there would be no war in Afghanistan .
Without 9/11 there would be no war in Iraq .
Without 9/11 there would be no war in Iran .
Without 9/11 there would be no war in …
( insert any country classified as part of the “ axis of evil ” or defined as being “ with the terrorists ” )
Without 9/11 thousands of U.S. troops would not have been sent to their deaths .
Without 9/11 hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan would not have been sentenced to their deaths .
Without 9/11 there would be no inaction on the Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
Without 9/11 there would be no civilian contractors in Iraq and the scandal that has followed them would have been averted .
Without 9/11 there would be no false military reporting ( Pat Tillman , Jessica Lynch ) , and no crack down on the freedom of the press ( banning photographing the returning coffins ) .
Without 9/11 there would be no Patriot Act .
Without 9/11 there would be no NSA warrantless wiretapping program .
Without 9/11 there would be no Camp Delta and no Camp X - ray at Guantanamo Bay .
Without 9/11 there would be no Military Commissions
Act and no coordinated program of extraordinary rendition , indefinite detention and torture of those defined as “ enemy combatants ” .
Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in secrecy and complete militarization of intelligence under the newly created office of the Director of National Intelligence .
Without 9/11 there would not be thousands of dead and dying emergency workers who are suffering crippling and fatal respiratory illnesses .
Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in military and security spending that goes arm in arm with huge cutbacks in other key social programs ( such as levees in New Orleans ) .
Without 9/11 there would have been no total abandonment of fiscal restraint , which has contributed to plunging the nation into an abyss of debt and looks likely to tip the world into a deep recession if not a complete depression .
And on and on and on .
Perhaps most importantly , without 9/11 there would be no “ post 9/11 society / mentality ” .
The ongoing ignorance of official 9/11 lies will continue to feed the fear and hostility that this post 9/11 environment is founded upon .
If it is “ fanatical ” to attempt to pay attention to the man behind the curtain , so to speak , then every member of the 9/11 truth movement should plead guilty .
The definition of a “ fanatic ” is , in this writer ’s humble opinion , much closer to the actions of the fawning audience at both of Howard Zinn ’s afore mentioned lectures , who proceeded to inanely cheer their hero no matter what came out of his mouth .
Much more fanatical are the kind of pocket radicals who latch on to one way of thinking , stick steadfastly to one political paradigm , completely close their minds to the wider picture , proceeding to repeat adfinum to their friends in the “ coffee revolution ” shops what Zinn , Chomsky , Vidal and their ilk have said , in between conversations about the finer points of Jack Kerouac ’s stream of consciousness prose , their understanding of the term ‘ multiculturalism ’ and the origins of Che Guevara ’s seminal manual on the theory and practice of guerrilla warfare .
Such people can groan all they like when questions over 9/11 are raised , it does n’t change the fact that every single significant action the Bush administration has taken over the last seven years , every attack on freedom and crime against humanity that they have committed stems from the events of 9/11 .
Yes Mr Zinn , you have angered a great many politically minded people with your comments , but what do you expect when you state that you do not care about what really happened on the most historically significant day in our recent history , and in the lifetimes of many of us ?
Indeed , this is the key to Zinn ’s comments .
To him , what really happened on 9/11 is not significant because it is HE who represents the past , it is HE who is wasting his time and it is HE who is politically insignificant .

For more than three decades , Eugene Allen worked in the White House , a black man unknown to the headlines .
During some of those years , harsh segregation laws lay upon the land .
He trekked home every night to his wife , Helene , who kept him out of her kitchen .
At the White House , he worked closer to the dirty dishes than to the Oval Office .
Helene did n’t care ; she just beamed with pride .
President Truman called him Gene. President Ford liked to talk golf with him .
He saw eight presidential administrations come and go , often working six days a week .
Advertisement
“ I never missed a day of work , ” Allen said .
He was there while racial history was made : Brown vs. Board of Education , the Little Rock school crisis , the 1963 March on Washington , the cities burning , the civil rights bills , the assassinations .
When he started at the White House in 1952 , he could n’t even use the public restrooms when he ventured back to his native Virginia .
“ We had never had anything , ” Allen , 89 , recalled of black America at the time .
“ I was always hoping things would get better . ”
In its long history , the White House -- note the name -- has had a complex and vexing relationship with black Americans .
Advertisement
“ The history is not so uneven at the lower level , in the kitchen , ” said Ted Sorensen , who served as counselor to President Kennedy .
“ In the kitchen , the folks have always been black .
Even the folks at the door -- black . ”
Before Gene Allen landed his White House job , he worked as a waiter at a resort in Hot Springs , Va. , and then at a country club in Washington .
He and wife Helene , 86 , were sitting in the living room of their Washington home .
Her voice was musical , in a Lena Horne kind of way .
She called him “ Honey . ”
They met at a birthday party in 1942 .
He was too shy to ask for her number , so she tracked his down .
They married a year later .
In 1952 , a lady told him of a job opening in the White House .
“ I was n’t even looking for a job , ” he said .
“ I was happy where I was working , but she told me to go on over there and meet with a guy by the name of Alonzo Fields . ”
Advertisement
Fields was a maitre d’ , and he immediately liked Allen .
Allen was offered a job as a “ pantry man . ”
He washed dishes , stocked cabinets and shined silverware .
He started at $ 2,400 a year .
There was , in time , a promotion to butler .
“ Shook the hand of all the presidents I ever worked for , ” he said .
“ I was there , honey , ” Helene said .
“ In the back maybe .
But I shook their hands too . ”
She was referring to White House holiday parties , Easter egg hunts .
Advertisement
They have one son , Charles , who works as an investigator with the State Department .
“ President Ford ’s birthday and my birthday were on the same day , ” he said .
“ He ’d have a birthday party at the White House .
Everybody would be there .
And Mrs. Ford would say , ‘ It ’s Gene ’s birthday too ! ’ ”
And so they ’d sing a little ditty to the butler .
And the butler , who wore a tuxedo to work every day , would blush .
“ Jack Kennedy was very nice , ” he went on .
“ And so was Mrs. Kennedy . ”
Advertisement
He was in the White House kitchen the day Kennedy was slain .
He got an invitation to the funeral .
But he volunteered for other duty : “ Somebody had to be at the White House to serve everyone after they came from the funeral . ”
The whole family of President Carter made Helene chuckle : “ They were country .
And I ’m talking Lillian and Rosalynn both . ”
It came out as the highest compliment .
First Lady Nancy Reagan came looking for him in the kitchen one day .
She wanted to remind him about the upcoming state dinner for German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
She told him he would not be working that night .
“ She said , ‘ You and Helene are coming to the state dinner as guests of President Reagan and myself . ’
I ’m telling you !
I believe I ’m the only butler to get invited to a state dinner . ”
Advertisement
Husbands and wives do n’t sit together at these events , and Helene was nervous about trying to make small talk with world leaders .
“ And my son said , ‘ Momma , just talk about your high school .
They wo n’t know the difference . ’
“ The senators were all talking about the colleges and universities that they went to , ” she said .
“ I was doing as much talking as they were .
“ Had champagne that night , ” she said , looking over at her husband .
He just grinned : He was the man who stacked the champagne at the White House .

Colin L. Powell would become the highest ranking black of any White House to that point when he was named Reagan ’s national security advisor in 1987 .
Condoleezza Rice would have that position under President George W. Bush .
Gene Allen was promoted to maitre d’ in 1980 .
He left the White House in 1986 , after 34 years .
President Reagan wrote him a sweet note .
Nancy Reagan hugged him tight .
Interviewed at their home last week , Gene and Helene speculated about what it would mean if a black man were elected president .
“ Just imagine , ” she said .
Advertisement
“ It ’d be really something , ” he said .
“ We ’re pretty much past the going - out stage , ” she said .
“ But you never know .
If he gets in there , it ’d sure be nice to go over there again . ”
They talked about praying to help Barack Obama get to the White House .
They ’d go vote together .
She ’d lean on her cane with one hand , and him with the other , while walking down to the precinct .
And she ’d get supper going afterward .
They went over their election day plans more than once .
“ Imagine , ” she said .
Advertisement
“ That ’s right , ” he said .
On Monday , Helene had a doctor ’s appointment .
Gene woke and nudged her once , then again .
He shuffled around to her side of the bed .
He nudged Helene again .
He was all alone .
“ I woke up and my wife did n’t , ” he said later .
Advertisement
Some friends and family members rushed over .
He wanted to make coffee .
They had to shoo the butler out of the kitchen .
The lady he married 65 years ago will be buried today .
The butler cast his vote for Obama on Tuesday .
He so missed telling his Helene about the black man bound for the Oval Office .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. securities regulators obtained an emergency court order to stop an alleged Ponzi scheme that collected more than $ 23 million from thousands of investors in Florida ’s Haitian - American community , the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday .
The SEC alleged that Creative Capital and its principal , George Theodule , launched a scheme as early as November 2007 urging investors to form investment clubs to funnel funds to Theodule and Creative Capital .
The SEC alleged Theodule has lost at least $ 18 million trading stocks and options over the last year and that Creative Capital repaid early investors with money from later investors .
Theodule combined investor funds with his personal funds and misappropriated at least $ 3.8 million for himself and his family , the SEC alleged .
A judge late Saturday halted the Bush administration ’s efforts to open 110,000 acres of federal land in Utah to oil and gas exploration , ruling that the danger of damaging the pristine land required further study before leases were awarded .
The leases to the parcels had been auctioned off Dec. 19 in a move that environmental groups said was a last - minute gift to the energy industry before President Bush left office .
A coalition of seven groups sued for a temporary restraining order , and the ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Ricardo M. Urbina means the checks written by energy companies for the land cannot be cashed .
Urbina ’s order postpones any sale until after he can hear arguments on the merits of the case , a delay that will potentially place the fate of the land into the hands of the Obama administration .
Aides to President - elect Barack Obama have objected to the sale .

“ We ’re thrilled with this decision , ” said Stephen Bloch of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance .
The Bureau of Land Management ’s “ attempt to sell these leases just before the Bush administration left office has been showcased for what it really is -- a parting gift to the oil and gas industry . ”
The original package of 360,000 acres included land that abutted national parks .
After the National Park Service objected , some of the leases were discarded , but environmentalists said the remaining parcels still included key parts of Utah ’s red-rock country .

knife boots the kids are into these days ?
That could have done some damage .
In all fairness to the Secret Service , they have tightened security up a lot in the last forty years .

But upon further reflection , the Secret Service agents probably handled this as effectively as possible .
The guy was throwing shoes - although they probably could have shot him before he got that second shoe off , what do you have then ?
A dead guy with no shoes on , that 's what , and then you 're asked to leave the country and never come back .
Considering how widely loved Bush is in Iraq ( check back this time next year for the Iraqi 's first National " Fuck Bush Day " ) it 's probably a minor miracle that he 's able to go there at all and come home alive , much less with a tread mark on his skull .
Third reaction : Oh , good work Bundy .
The Iraq war has kind of fallen out of the American public 's consciousness the last year or so , mainly because it just leaves everyoneI guess .
So this little stunt has , on the surface , brought it back to the forefront .
But in a completely trivial way .
Like every other type of protest , the only thing people talk about is the protest itself , not the message being raised .
There are a lot of things about the Iraq war that deserve to be treated with a certain level of seriousness ( all the dead people for one . )
But instead of talking about that we 've now got newsrooms across the country racking their brains looking for shoe puns .
If I could offer a bit of friendly advice to the President - speaking as someone who has things thrown at him with great regularity - here 's a handy list of responses I 've developed for many common things that may get hurled at you in the future .
With the help of a specially modified batting practice machine , you 'll be able to hone your clearly already sharp reflexes further , which should be of some help in your future career , whatever it is you wind up fucking up next .
Infrared light can stimulate neurons in the inner ear as precisely as sound waves , a discovery that could lead to better cochlear implants ( Image : Steve Gschmeissner / SPL )
INFRARED light can stimulate neurons in the inner ear as precisely as sound waves , a discovery that could lead to better cochlear implants for deaf people .
A healthy inner ear uses hair cells that respond to sound to stimulate neurons that send signals to the brain .
But hair cells can be destroyed by disease or injury , or can contain defects at birth , leading to deafness .
In such cases , cochlear implants can directly stimulate neurons . …
But such warnings do n’t work .
Worldwide , people continue to inhale 5.7 trillion cigarettes annually  a figure that does n’t even take into account duty - free or black - market cigarettes .
According to World Bank projections , the number of smokers is expected to reach 1.6 billion by 2025 , from the current 1.3 billion .

A brain - imaging experiment I conducted in 2006 explains why antismoking scare tactics have been so futile .
I examined people ’s brain activity as they reacted to cigarette warning labels by using functional magnetic resonance imaging , a scanning technique that can show how much oxygen and glucose a particular area of the brain uses while it works , allowing us to observe which specific regions are active at any given time .
We tested 32 people ( from Britain , China , Germany , Japan and the United States ) , some of whom were social smokers and some of whom were two - pack - a - day addicts .
Most of these subjects reported that cigarette warning labels reduced their craving for a cigarette , but their brains told us a different story .
Each subject lay in the scanner for about an hour while we projected on a small screen a series of cigarette package labels from various countries  including statements like “ smoking kills ” and “ smoking causes fatal lung cancers . ”
We found that the warnings prompted no blood flow to the amygdala , the part of the brain that registers alarm , or to the part of the cortex that would be involved in any effort to register disapproval .
To the contrary , the warning labels backfired : they stimulated the nucleus accumbens , sometimes called the “ craving spot , ” which lights up on f.M.R.I. whenever a person craves something , whether it ’s alcohol , drugs , tobacco or gambling .
The Xiph .
Org Foundation announces the release of Theora 1.0 .
Theora is a video codec with a small CPU footprint that offers easy portability and requires no patent royalties .
While the Theora bitstream format was standardized in 2004 and our beta releases have been used by millions , this 1.0 release is an important milestone reflecting the maturity and stability of the Theora codebase .
A number of leading multimedia web groups already support Theora .
Upcoming releases of Mozilla Firefox , the world 's most popular open source browser , will support Theora natively , as will releases of the multi-platform Opera browser .
Top -10 website Wikipedia uses Theora for all of its video .
" Open media formats are critical for ensuring a future where everyone can create and share media freely , " says Kat Walsh , Wikimedia Foundation board member , " and so we congratulate Xiph.org on this important achievement . "
Theora 's success in these applications paves the way for wider adoption .
The Theora 1.0 package includes a reference library using the revised 3 - clause BSD license , allowing use in all software , free or proprietary .
The reference library uses a new decoder which supports the entire Theora specification and is significantly faster than earlier versions .
This high - performance decoder is already used on the XO laptop from the OLPC project .
The package also supplies numerous resources for developers : a 190 page format specification , API documentation , example encoder and decoder software , and a draft RTP specification for real - time streaming .
Theora development does not stop with the 1.0 release .
With sponsorship from Red Hat Inc. , Xiph .
Org has been working on a next - generation encoder , codenamed ' Thusnelda ' , which has already demonstrated substantial quality improvements without breaking backward compatibility .
While Theora is already the preferred format for applications where freedom , CPU consumption , and cost are important , Thusnelda will make Theora more attractive for applications where quality and bit-rate are the only considerations .
The new encoder is slated for inclusion in the upcoming 1.1 release of Theora .
Theora 1.0 is available for download from the following URLs :
Technical support is available through the official general and developer - specific mailing lists .
Theora is mature software ; do not be afraid to try it .
This release reflects countless hours of debugging , manual code audits and fuzz testing .
A scan by the Coverity static analysis tool revealed only two defects : one false alarm and the other now fixed .
We would like to thank all the volunteers involved in this project throughout the years for their hard work .
Your dedication helped improve Theora ; this release is dedicated to you .

Greek militants have warned of new protests after an attack on an Athens police station in the latest clashes over the police killing of a teenager .
About 100 protesters attacked a police station where two officers accused over the December 6 death of 15 - year - old Alexis Grigoropoulos are based .
The police station is near the Exarchia district where the shooting took place and where Athens Polytechnic student protest leaders met on Sunday ( local time ) to plan new action .
Pamphlets announced rallies at the Athens police headquarters on Monday ( local time ) and at parliament square on Thursday , while students in Thessaloniki distributed manifestos via motorbike .
The new unrest erupted after vigils were held to mark the week since Alexis Grigoropoulos 's death and triggered a wave of violence with banks targeted and a late - night standoff between riot police and youths outside parliament .
Greece 's constitution bans police from entering educational establishments , a legacy of a crackdown on a 1973 student protest against the then military dictatorship in which 44 demonstrators were killed .
The week of protests have reignited radical groups against Greece 's right - wing government .
A Sunday poll suggested most Greeks see the violent protests as a " popular uprising , " not driven by " minority activists . "
Of those questioned , 76 per cent were " dissatisfied " with the police response while just 20 per cent approved of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis 's handling .

KINGSTON ( Reuters ) - Tropical Storm Gustav hit Jamaica with near hurricane - force winds on Thursday after killing at least 59 people elsewhere in the Caribbean , and was on a path to reach New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico oil fields as potentially a powerful hurricane .
As Gustav churned through the Caribbean , Tropical Storm Hanna formed in the Atlantic Ocean with 40 - mph ( 65 - kph ) winds and took a track that could threaten the Bahamas and Florida , also next week , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said .
Energy companies prepared for Gustav to deliver what could be the hardest hit to the heart of the U.S. Gulf oil patch since the devastating 2005 hurricane season .
Oil prices rose above $ 120 a barrel in early trade on Thursday , adding to two days of gains as Gustav aimed deep into the heavy concentration of oil and natural gas platforms off Louisiana and Texas .
But crude price fell back more than $ 2 after the U.S. government and the International Energy Agency pledged to release emergency stockpiles if Gustav disrupts production in an area that provides the United States with a quarter of its crude oil and 15 percent of its natural gas .
The seventh storm of a busy Atlantic hurricane season was 15 miles east - northeast of Kingston , Jamaica , at 5 p.m. EDT ( 2100 GMT ) , the hurricane center said .
Its top sustained winds were 70 mph ( 110 kph ) , just short of the 74 - mph ( 119 kph ) hurricane threshold .
Forecasters said it could become a hurricane by Friday .
POSSIBLE EVACUATIONS
New Orleans , the southern U.S. city ravaged by Hurricane Katrina three years ago , remained near the middle of the range of possible landfall locations on the U.S. Gulf Coast .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal put New Orleans residents on alert for possible evacuations from Friday , the third anniversary of Katrina ’s strike , and issued a precautionary disaster declaration .
A state of emergency was declared in neighboring Mississippi , which was also devastated by Katrina .
In Jamaica , shops , post offices and schools shut their doors and authorities ordered nonessential workers to stay home as Gustav neared and began buffeting the lush , mountainous island with high winds and torrential rains that soaked some sugar cane fields .
“ I just saw part of my roof blow away , ” said Phillip Wright , resident of an eastern parish where extensive damage to some homes was reported .
“ This looks very serious .
It is windy , rainy , trees are also falling down and we have no electricity , ” Wright told Reuters by telephone .
Gustav barged ashore as a hurricane in Haiti on Tuesday and its driving rains killed at least 59 people there and in the neighboring Dominican Republic .

“ There are 51 people killed , ” Alta Jean - Baptiste , director of Haiti ’s civil protection office , told Reuters on Thursday .
She said the deaths occurred primarily as a result of flooding and mudslides in western and southern Haiti .
GAPS REMAIN
Gustav is the first serious Atlantic storm since the 2005 hurricane season to threaten New Orleans and the 4,000 U.S. energy platforms in the Gulf .
Slideshow ( 14 images )
Katrina and Rita destroyed 124 platforms and severed pipelines when they swept through as Category 5 storms .
Katrina came ashore near New Orleans on August 29 , 2005 , as a Category 3 hurricane and flooded the city .
It killed 1,500 people along the Gulf Coast and caused $ 80 billion in damage .
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers program manager Bill Irwin told a news conference on Thursday that gaps remain in New Orlean ’s flood control system and that it is still vulnerable despite improvements made after Katrina .
The agency was rushing to install temporary flood - prevention structures , Irwin said .
Energy companies shut down production and pulled workers from Gulf offshore rigs .
The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , the nation ’s only deepwater oil port which normally offloads about 1 million barrels of foreign crude per day , expected to stop working over the weekend .
On its current path Gustav will threaten the Cayman Islands and western Cuba before entering the Gulf .
Energy traders also warily watched newborn Hanna , 260 miles
northeast of the northern Leeward Islands .
The storm was moving west - northwest at 12 mph ( 19 kph ) and could become a hurricane by next week .
Intego , makers of VirusBarrier and other security software for the Macintosh , issued a security alert for Mac users on Thursday , advising them about the existence of a new Trojan Horse , which they ’ve named OSX .
Trojan .iServices .A.
This new Trojan Horse can be found in pirated copies of Apple ’s iWork ‘09 application suite , which has been downloaded over 20,000 times , according to Intego ’s numbers .
When installing an infected pirated copy of iWork ‘ 09 , an extra iWorkServices package is installed ; this installation begins as soon as the user launches the iWork ‘ 09 installer .
This package is installed as a system - wide startup item , where it has read - write permissions as root .
In other words , this code can do anything to any part of the system , with full authorization .
The malicious software connects to remote servers over the internet , so a malicious remote user will know that the program has been installed .
The malicious user will be able to connect to the infected Mac and perform various actions ; the Trojan horse may also download additional components to an infected Mac .
It should also be noted that this exploit is out and about in the real world ; see this post as an example of what it can do .
This is not a virus — it cannot spread from one Mac to another on its own .
It ’s also not a remote exploit ; the user must download and install a pirated copy of iWork ‘ 09 to become infected .
To check if you ’ve been infected , look in / System / Library / StartupItems for an item named iWorkServices .
If it exists , you ’ve been infected with this Trojan horse .
Once infected , the clean - up process may be quite painful .
As the Trojan horse has the ability to install additional components , it ’s not sufficient to remove the known pieces .
Instead , the safest recovery method starts with a reformat and a clean install of OS X .
Because the Trojan may also modify installed applications ( this is possible because the Trojan is running as root ) , programs should be reinstalled from their master discs , not from backups .
Finally , the user should copy over their data files from backups .
As always , the best preventive medicine is to simply avoid downlaoding files from unknown and untrusted sources .
Intego ’s VirusBarrier X4 and X5 will detect the Trojan horse , prevent it from installing in the first place , and remove the currently - known pieces of the Trojan horse if you ’ve been infected .
If you download software from untrusted sources , you should strongly consider using an anti-virus package of some sort to minimize the risk from this sort of attack .

See why large companies , government agencies , and universities choose Oblong 's solutions for their business
Heaving with heavy goods , the A67 from Eindhoven barrels through the flat , featureless fields of the south - eastern Netherlands on its way to the German border .
On a frozen December morning , nothing very much moves beyond the road 's edge ; a horse stamps at a trough , a tractor pushes along a narrow track .
Every half mile or so , behind a stand of poplars , a neat brick farmhouse - raked gravel drive , lace curtains at the windows - slides into view .
Next to it is a large , windowless and vaguely ominous shed , the size , perhaps , of a small aircraft hangar .
It will hold , almost certainly , several hundred pigs .
In a country famed for the unnatural feats of its intensive farming sector ( the Netherlands occupies less than one - thousandth of the world 's surface , but is its third largest exporter of agricultural produce ) , this area , known as De Peel , is more densely populated with pigs than anywhere else on the planet .
Some of the sheds are multistorey ; they 're called pig-flats .
There 's a fair chance - especially if you 're partial to bacon - that you 've eaten meat from one of them .
A good proportion of the 20 m pigs born , fattened , sent abroad or slaughtered each year in the Netherlands come from here , and the Netherlands has become the biggest single supplier of our morning rasher .
" This , " Hans Baij of the animal welfare group Varkens in Nood , or Pigs in Distress , had told me the day before in his office in Amsterdam , " is advanced industrial pig farming .
There 's nothing natural about this whatsoever .
It 's about science , sperm selection , antibiotics , piglets per sow , grams per day , muscle - to - fat ratios .
It 's what this country does .
Welfare does n't come into it . "
Picture , for a moment , a pig .
Engaging , maybe .
Large , pink , ungainly , certainly ( though that 's not how they always were ; the original pig was compact and capable of speeds up to 40 m ph ) .
That strong , muscular snout was designed for rooting around in soil and undergrowth ; a sense of smell acute enough to snuffle out buried truffles was plainly intended for forensic foraging .
In many languages , pigs are a byword for anything gross , unpleasant , unhygienic .
They 're actually very clean ; they hate a dirty bed , and will select a latrine area and use it .
They are the most curious and intelligent farmyard animals .
( A professor from Pennsylvania State University has demonstrated that pigs learn problem - solving games faster than dogs and as quickly as chimps , and will remember the lessons for three years or more . )
Orwell , of course , knew that .
Winston Churchill , a serious pig fancier , saw it too .
" I like pigs , " he said .
" Dogs look up to you ; cats look down on you ; pigs treat you as equal . "
A shame , then , that we treat pigs the way we do .
Britons ate 1.6 m tonnes of pork in 2007 .
We 're so fond of the meat that we now import more than 60 % , including 40 % of all fresh and frozen pork and an astonishing 80 % of all bacon .
In fact , our pig meat imports - mainly from Denmark , the Netherlands and Germany - have been soaring for nearly a decade ; the Netherlands , and those sheds , account for almost half our bacon imports .
Demand for UK pork , meanwhile , has slumped 36 % .
There is one very good reason for this , say British farmers .
It is that in 1999 , we introduced standards on pig welfare - regarding the space in which they are reared - that have yet to come into force across the rest of the EU .
They have made our pork a great deal more expensive .
" To rear our pigs the way we do , " says Vicky Scott , who with her sister and father , Kate and David Morgan , wean more than 500 piglets a week on their 1,000 - sow intensive farm near Driffield in Yorkshire , " costs us about 12 p a kilo extra .
Will that be reflected in the price we get for it ?
What do you think ? "
Some Dutch and Danish producers do rear pigs for the UK market to UK rules .
But according to the British Pig Executive , an alarming 70 % of the 970,000 tonnes of pig meat we import each year does not meet British welfare standards .
What 's more , you are probably buying it without knowing it : retailers are perfectly entitled to label foreign meat British if it has been processed here .
The pigs from which much of that foreign meat comes will have led very different lives to many of those reared in Britain .
Here , for example - and in Sweden , Switzerland and Norway - the use of a particularly nasty piece of kit called a sow stall has now been outlawed ; it is legal in the rest of the EU until 2013 .
A sow stall is a narrow metal cage , on a bare concrete and slatted floor , in which pregnant sows spend all three months , three weeks and three days of their gestation .
They can move a few inches back and forwards , but not turn around .
Lying down and getting up is difficult , too .
" It prevents almost all their natural activities , " says Phil Brooke , welfare development manager for Compassion in World Farming ( CIWF ) .
" They can't forage , they can't root around , they can't prepare a nest for their young .
They 're subject to bone and muscle weakness , digestive and urinary illnesses , cardiovascular problems .
Many display signs of severe psychological problems , stress and frustration . "
In much of mainland Europe , too , and on a by no means negligible percentage of British farms , naturally boisterous and playful fattening pigs also spend their days and nights on bare concrete and slatted floors ; their faeces and urine fall through and are flushed away .
In theory , EU regulations require plentiful " environmental enrichment " - straw , in other words - for bedding and rooting , but an undercover report by CIWF last month showed that 100 % of farms surveyed in Spain , 89 % in Germany and 88 % in the Netherlands provided none .
Such rules are , it seems , not very easy to enforce when animal welfare is weighed against export earnings .
If they 're lucky , the animals may get a chain or a plastic football to play with .
But since there is rarely enough light to see by ( pigs are quieter in the dark ) , fighting and biting are more common than playing .
To minimise the effects of this , the vast majority of piglets ' tails are routinely docked soon after birth , and their teeth clipped , again in breach of EU rules .
Routine tail - docking in particular , Brooke and Baaij both argue , is a good general indication of pig welfare : pigs reared on extensive farms , outdoors , with plenty of scope for foraging and rooting , rarely need their tails docked .
" If they 've got plenty to do , they 're happy , " says Baaij .
Otherwise , basically , they go for each other , with tails and ears the favoured targets .
And once a pen full of pigs gets the scent of blood , the consequences can be catastrophic ; pigs are , after all , omnivores .
In much of Europe too , male piglets are routinely castrated .
That 's because the powerful flavour of male pig meat - boar taint - is distasteful to many consumers .
The operation is performed without pain relief , although the Dutch plan to adopt a gas anaesthetic , voluntarily , later this year .
( British pigs are not castrated because they are slaughtered younger , before the taint develops . )
" Across Europe , we found examples of poor welfare and excessive use of confinement systems and mutilations in lieu of good welfare practice , " the CIWF report concluded , lamenting the effects of " an industrial system on a highly sentient , intelligent " animal .
" Pigs looked uncared for , they showed aggressive behaviour and there was nothing for them to do .
Across Europe , pig legislation is being ignored and welfare conditions are often appalling . "
So is that what it 's like , then , in those Dutch pig farms ?
Perhaps unsurprisingly , it is n't all that easy to find out .
The big farms at least seem distinctly wary of allowing a journalist access .
Any number of Dutch welfare groups , including the highly vocal Varkens in Nood , backed by an array of Dutch writers and artists , are now on their case .
CIWF has accused them , along with most other continental pig farmers , of routinely breaking EU laws .
This month they might also have to face up to Jamie Oliver , in a TV special aiming to do for intensively reared pigs what the TV chef did last year for battery chickens .
At the pristine and gargantuan Houbensteyn Group in Ysselsteyn , home to a barely imaginable 25,000 pigs , a manager tells me bluntly that they can't let me in as they have too much work on in the run-up to Christmas .
Another factory farm near Helmond cites stringent hygiene laws that mean no one can so much as poke a nose round the door without taking their outdoor clothes off , donning disinfected boots and laundered boiler suit , even taking a shower .
Introduced after a catastrophic outbreak of swine fever in 1997 that saw 10 m
Dutch pigs slaughtered , they 're a useful deterrent for the curious visitor .
" Too much of a bloody performance , " says Jaap , the chief stockman .
" What do you want to see , anyway ?
Look , everything here 's spotless .
You can't even smell this place from the outside .
We put in a new air filtration system last year . "
Smaller farms prove more open .
A few have even installed neat little viewing windows so visitors can gaze into a couple of presumably carefully selected pens - Step in the Shed , the scheme is called , and it 's very popular with Dutch primary schools .
John Rooijakkers , who runs a farm of 750 breeding sows with his brother Martin at Aarle - Rixtel , near Eindhoven , will not tolerate British farmers ' accusations of unfair competition .
" I 'm losing money , " he says .
" Most Dutch pig farmers are .
Only the most efficient 20 - 30 % are making any .
The European pig market is cut - throat , and it 's swings and roundabouts - you may have tougher welfare regulations , but we have far more stringent environment and hygiene laws .
Holland is much smaller , much more densely populated than Britain .
Do n't talk to me about regulations . "
Rooijakkers is unusual in the Netherlands in keeping some of his pregnant sows on a mountain of straw , because a portion of his pigs are destined for " a big British supermarket " which he declines to name .
For the same reason , some of his male piglets are not castrated .
( He does , though , dock their tails : " Show me a single intensive pig farmer who does n't . " )
Elsewhere , tiny piglets - Rooijakkers says proudly that he averages 15 in a litter , where a free - range sow will typically deliver 10 or 12 - scrabble around their mothers on a blue plastic grate .
The sows are locked into farrowing crates , similar but slightly bigger than sow stalls and used by many intensive pig farms in Britain too .
The sows find it just as difficult to move in them , but they protect the baby pigs from being crushed .
" I have a 0.2 % mortality rate , " boasts Rooijakkers .
" On organic farms they 're lucky to get away with 16 % .
Where 's the animal welfare there , then , when you 're talking dead piglets ?
Anyway , you have to be realistic : today 's pigs would all be sick within a week if you started raising them outside .
They could n't take it .
All those germs . "
But next door to the farrowing crates , weaned piglets squal and leap viciously at each other in a bare concrete pen , a punctured yellow ball their only distraction .
When you open the door to the small viewing room Rooijakkers has installed , they 're suddenly bathed in fluorescent light .
Hang around for a while , and the light goes off : it 's there for the visitors .
Unless you 're looking at them , the pigs live in near - total darkness .
Upstairs in his office , Rooijakkers blames the system .
" We 're supplying what the market wants , " he insists .
" And where are we , the farmers , in the chain ?
The retailers tell the slaughterhouses what they 'll pay , the slaughterhouses set their prices for us .
Everyone takes their margin , and right at the bottom it 's the farmer .
People , consumers , just are n't being realistic ; they want cheap meat , then they 're worried about welfare .
Buy organic , then !
Pay twice the price .
But no one will do that . "
A few miles down the road in Panningen , Lowie and Jeanette Kersten are similarly blunt .
Their farm , Op den Haegh , is small : around 300 sows .
Through their viewing windows , you can see pregnant sows lumbering around a barren concrete pen .
They are fed automatically .
It 's an ingenious system .
When each pig sticks her head round the feeder door , a computer reads an electronic chip clipped in her ear and calculates whether or not she she has had her daily fill .
If she has , the door stays shut ; if she has n't , she 's allowed in .
Next door are sows and piglets in spotless but desolate crates .
Signs explain that the climate is computer controlled , and make much of how modern pig- farming is doing all it can to minimise the risk of disease , and reduce its impact on the environment .
Weaned pigs are on stark concrete and slats ; a chain swings from the ceiling and a piglet makes a desultory grab .
And there is a whole long side of this big shed whose darkened windows you simply cannot see through ; inside is a pale pink mass of occasionally writhing forms .
And the occasional furious squeal .
The Kerstens are a charming , and plainly thoughtful , couple in their 50s .
They invite me into their immaculate farmhouse kitchen for coffee .
" It 's all a compromise , " says Lowie .
" Everyone would like to see better conditions for pigs , but change demands time , good laws , an effort from everyone in the chain and responsibility , from the producer , the retailer , the consumer and the politician .
The cold fact is that better welfare means more expensive meat .
We 'd love to produce it ; are people ready to buy it ? "
In fact Lowie already does produce some more expensive meat .
Half of his piglets are of a different race to the others .
They are taken off the farm and raised , in the open air and with special feed , on the grounds of a monastery , under a new label he has developed with colleagues .
" The meat from my monastery pigs is tastier , with good fat - supermarkets do n't want fat , they want pure lean , and modern pigs are bred to deliver that , " he says .
" But good restaurants want flavour , and they want meat with a story .
Something distinctive . "
Would n't he like to raise all his pigs that way ?
" Look , " says Jeanette firmly , gesturing at the shed behind her .
" We 're producers .
We do this to earn money .
That 's what I tell the schoolkids who come here .
There 's been a whole lot of research to see if we could produce the amount of meat we need any other way ...
We 're very professional .
And pigs are n't people . "
On the whole , if you 're concerned about pig welfare , you generally are better off buying British ( assuming , of course , you can be sure it actually was reared in Britain ) .
Things are not perfect here , but they are quite a lot better : CIWF 's undercover inspectors found only 36 % of British farms they visited did not use straw , although 54 % still carried out routine tail docking .
But Vicky Scott and Kate Morgan 's farm in Yorkshire feels a world removed from those stifling Dutch sheds .
Their pigs are reared on straw , in huge , open - sided sheds that let in all the daylight and - on another chill winter morning - the fresh air you could want .
Scott uses farrowing crates for birthing , although she prefers the term maternity units .
" It may look like factory farming , " she says , " and it 's not very nice to see , but I really believe no better system 's been invented . "
She docks her animals ' tails ( " We 're planning on doing a trial without it , but if they start tailbiting , really , it 's horrendous " ) and clips their teeth ( " We've tried not doing it , but they make such a mess of their pen mates .
Pigs ' teeth are incredibly sharp . " )
Both operations are done when the piglets are a day old .
But the most important thing , for her , is the straw .
" I would never , ever finish [ fatten ] pigs on slats , " she says .
" I 've always said that .
You only have to look at them .
They need it , it 's the way they 're made .
It 's inconceivable to deny them it . "
And the family 's pigs do , indeed , look pretty damn happy .
But there 's precious little encouragement from the market to do things that way , or to refund the extra pence per kilo of pork that the straw - and the extra labour to muck it out and replace it - costs them .
The business is tough enough as it is : when animal feed prices went through the roof last summer , Morgan and farmers like her were losing £ 26 on every pig they sold .
" The retailers always say the customer likes the cheapest , " she says .
" We say we think the customer would actually like the choice .
But the bottom line is , if people do n't want to pay for higher welfare , farmers will stop doing it . "
The best conditions , of course , are free - range , although there is a lot of confusion about what that means .
Some 40 % of breeding sows in Britain are kept outdoors , compared to fewer than 1 % in the Netherlands ; but only 7 % of the piglets born to them are reared outdoors after they 're weaned and only 2 % are fattened , or finished , outdoors .
" Outdoor bred " is not the same as " outdoor reared " .
The best guarantee of all is organic , but that comes at a considerable cost .
On a magnificent high field bordered by the Ridgeway near the Wiltshire village of Bishopstone , Helen Browning keeps her 250 saddleback sows producing some 65 piglets a week , about 3,500 a year .
The pigs sleep in spacious , clean , straw - filled arks and have free access to the open field around them .
Eastbrook farm is a mixed farm and the pigs are integrated into the agricultural cycle ; they 'll spend a couple of months trashing - and very effectively fertilising - a patch of land and then move on , to be replaced by grass or an arable crop for a few years .
Unlike high - intensity systems , in which pigs are removed from their mothers at three weeks or even earlier , Browning 's piglets are weaned at a more natural eight weeks .
" They 're stronger , maturer , they do n't need antibiotics , " she says .
Farrowing crates and the like , Browning believes , have bred the maternal instincts out of most modern sows .
And the never - ending , retailer - led search for ever - leaner meat means they simply do n't have enough fat on them to nurse their litters for long anyway .
Browning 's pigs are kept in the same family group , and they have an awful lot of room to create an unholy mess of their field .
The day I was there , wading through the mud , they were positively gambolling : racing round the field , playing ( there 's no other word ) games .
In 20 years of raising pigs , Eastbrook farm has not experienced a single case of tail biting .
" Pigs are clever animals , curious animals , they 're clean animals , they tell you about their problems , " Browning says .
" They 're not like cows , they 're not stoics , they vocalise .
They wear their hearts on their sleeves .
And they 're funny .
They have pretty simple needs , really : space , lots to do . "
But all this comes at a price .
Tim Finney , managing director of Eastbrook 's organic meats business , reckons that amounts to an extra 30 or 40 p a kilo just to keep the system running , plus another 70 p a kilo for the organic feed .
" Overall , " he says , " it probably costs us about double what it costs to produce a conventional pig .
Although if we were n't organic , we could run the farm the same way and produce meat that was maybe 25 % more expensive .
That would still be a huge step forwards in welfare terms . "
High - welfare organic meat is of course a niche market , recession - sensitive , and Finney admits he's is budgeting for zero growth for the coming year .
But the alarming thing is that today , even moderately good welfare standards are coming under pressure .
When it comes to pig welfare Britain is , Browning reckons , " genuinely squeaky clean " compared to much of the rest of the world ; " probably the best in the world , in fact , for conventional pig- keeping " .
But what counts , it seems , is price .
Some years ago , the late Lyall Watson , who devoted his last book to The Extraordinary Potential of Pigs , wrote that if you look properly behind the eyes of any pig , you will see " a liveliness , an intelligence for which you are just not prepared " .
These are not like other animals .
If it matters to us that our morning rasher or chop or pork pie does not comes from a genetically engineered fat - free pig that spent its brief life in a dark , bare , windowless shed stuffed full of antibiotics and reduced to attacking its pen-mates for entertainment - a pathetic parody , in short , of a pig - we 're going to have to reach deeper into our pockets .
Right now , that seems increasingly unlikely .

Author 's note :
The statements Cheney made this week during an interview with the Washington Times about his role in approving the waterboarding of three Guantanamo detainees and the so - called " enhanced interrogation " of 33 prisoners was , disturbingly , not covered at all by the mainstream media .
Also published at my web magazine , The Public Record .
Vice President Dick Cheney , in another stunning admission during his campaign to burnish the Bush administration ’s legacy , said he personally authorized the “ enhanced interrogations ” of 33 suspected terrorist detainees and approved the waterboarding of three so - called “ high - value ” prisoners .
“ I signed off on it ; others did , as well , too , ” Cheney said about the waterboarding , a practice of simulated drowning done by strapping a person to a board , covering the face with a cloth and then pouring water over it , a torture technique dating back at least to the Spanish Inquisition .
The victim feels as if he is drowning .
Cheney identified the three waterboarded detainees as al - Qaeda figures Abu Zubaydah , Khalid Sheik Mohammed and al Nashiri .
“ That 's it , those three guys , ” Cheney said in an interview with the right - wing Washington Times .
Other detainees at secret CIA prisons and at Guantanamo Bay were subjected to harsh treatment , including being stripped naked , forced into painful stress positions , placed in extremes of heat or cold and prevented from sleeping – actions that international human rights organizations , and previously the U.S. government , have denounced as torture and illegal abuse .
“ I thought that it was absolutely the right thing to do , ” Cheney said of what he called the “ enhanced interrogation ” of the detainees .
“ I thought the [ administration ’s ] legal opinions that were rendered [ endorsing the harsh treatment ] were sound .
I think the techniques were reasonable in terms of what they [ the CIA interrogators ] were asking to be able to do .
And I think it produced the desired result . ”
Cheney also took issue with the notion that waterboarding was torture .
“ Was it torture ?
I do n't believe it was torture , ” Cheney said .
“ The CIA handled itself , I think , very appropriately .
They came to us in the administration , talked to me , talked to others in the administration , about what they felt they needed to do in order to obtain the intelligence that we believe these people were in possession of . ”
Other experts , including some military and intelligence interrogators , have disputed Cheney ’s claims of success in extracting reliable information through waterboarding and other harsh techniques .
Much of the confessed information turned out to be dubious or incorrect .
The First Case
Zubaydah was the first “ war on terror ” detainee to be subjected to the Bush administration ’s waterboarding , according to Pentagon and Justice Department documents , news reports and several books written about the Bush administration ’s interrogation methods .
However , according to author Ron Suskind who interviewed CIA and other insiders , Abu Zubaydah was not the " high - value detainee " that the Bush administration had claimed .
Rather , Zubaydah was a minor player in the al - Qaeda organization , handling travel for associates and their families , Suskind wrote in his book The One Percent Doctrine .
Nevertheless , Suskind said President George W. Bush became obsessed with Zubaydah and the information he might have about pending terrorist plots against the United States .
" Bush was fixated on how to get Zubaydah to tell us the truth , " Suskind wrote .
Bush questioned one CIA briefer , " Do some of these harsh methods really work ? "
Abu Zubaydah 's captors soon discovered that their prisoner was mentally ill and knew nothing about terrorist operations or impending plots .
That realization was " echoed at the top of CIA and was , of course , briefed to the President and Vice President , " Suskind wrote .
But Bush did not want to " lose face " because he had stated Zubaydah ’s importance publicly , according to Suskind .

Researchers believe lunar craters shaded from the sun could have ice
Ice on the Moon is most likely to be found in shaded polar craters , UK scientists have concluded .
Researchers from Glasgow and Durham universities analysed data from Nasa 's 1998 Lunar Prospector probe to pinpoint likely locations .
They found that polar craters , which are shaded from the Sun , could have ice in concentrations of up to 10 grams per kilo of rock .
Their findings are published in the scientific journal Icarus .
Lunar base
Dr Luis Teodoro , of Glasgow University 's physics and astronomy department , said : " We used a newly developed technique to show that the hydrogen on the moon is concentrated into permanently shaded craters near to the lunar poles .
" Hydrogen , together with the oxygen that is abundant within Moon rock , is a key element in making water .
" Water ice should be stable for billions of years on the Moon provided that it receives no sunlight .
" If the hydrogen is present as water - ice then our results imply that the top metre of the Moon holds about 200 billion litres of water . "
Scientists believe the presence of water on the Moon could pave the way for a future manned base there .
It is life sustaining and a potential source of rocket fuel .
He wrote , " I question the appropriateness of depleting the capital that taxpayers just injected into the banks through the payment of billions of dollars in bonuses , especially after one of the financial industry 's worst years on record . "
Though what 's commonly known as the Wall Street bailout package includes modest restrictions on CEO pay , it hardly prevents participating financial firms from paying bonuses to top executives and others .
And it seems many on Wall Street are expecting some big money .
eFinancialCareers tells Fast Money , " We thought you'd be interested in the results of post - bailout survey of Wall Street professionals on their bonuses expectations .
2/3 are expecting a 2008 bonus ; 36 % are expecting that bonus to be higher than their 2007 bonuses .
There 's even a minority - 10 % - that expect this year 's bonus to the 33 % higher . "
Dylan Ratigan is outraged by the news in general .
He can't believe that financial services sector could take on so much risk that they need a $ 750 billion taxpayer funded bailout and then turn around still provide their upper echelon with bonuses .
What do you think ?
Should regulators limit Wall Street bonuses this year ?

Please let this be true .
According to a barely literate MySpace message , Sarah Palin is snubbing the family of Levi Johnston , the jock who knocked up Bristol , because they 're " white trash . "
( Not that we 'd disagree . )
[ Update : Yep , it 's true . ]
The message was supposedly left by Mercede Johnston , Levi's 18 - year - old sister , on the page of Mellissa Wilfong , a former Wasilla resident who now lives in Florida , to tell her about an upcoming trip to Orlando .
As an aside , she notes that she and her mom ( that would be Sherry , the one who was busted for dealing OxyContin ) are n't allowed to visit Bristol and Levi 's love child .
For those who have trouble reading the prose of this fine product of the Wasilla school system , here 's a translation :
Levi is in a bit of a haze right now ...
Umm , I 'm not allowed to see my nephew and my mom is n't either .
We are n't Palins so therefore we are white trash and Bristol does n't want her baby around us .
So mom and I are really upset over it .
I just hope Levi pulls his head out of his butt and lets us see our nephew and her grandbaby .
It 's not just the utter inability to spell that makes us think this is the real Mercede .
Her MySpace page ( which is set to private ) has been the source of other fun Palin family revelations .
In happier days , i.e. last year , Mercede visited the Palin household soon after Sarah 's magical baby Trig was born ( see above ) .
And Wilfong appears to be in the Palin orbit as well .
Last September , while everyone was claiming that Trig was actually Bristol 's baby , she piped up on Fox News ' web site to tell everyone to shut up , note that her sons used to attend school with Bristol , and that she would n't be voting for her former Mayor .
( Smart lady . )
( Yep , her name is spelled Mercede .
Wasilla names are so damn creative . )
Interesting segment on Larry King Live with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford last night that I thought would get more attention today :
KING : What about the UAW in all of this ?
FORD : Well , the UAW obviously has been our partner through all of this .
Have they made mistakes and have we made mistakes ?
Of course .
The UAW has come a long way .
I think their leader , Ron Gettelfinger , is an excellent leader and he really understands our business .
In this last contract , he gave up a lot .
He ’s also indicated they ’re willing to come to the table to do more .
And so for anybody to blame the UAW as the sole reason for this is frankly wrong .
One other thing is , when I look at the people who work in our plants , I do n’t think of them as UAW .
I think of them as Ford employees , Ford employees who take tremendous pride in building quality and safety into our products .
If you ask someone in our plant , where do they work , they say I work at Ford .
To me , everybody who works in our plant is part of our extended family .
So the stated position of Ford , the one company that may survive this with or without a bailout , is that the UAW has made concessions and is not the problem .
I ’d like to hear Bob Corker ’s thoughts on that .
On second thought , no , I really would n’t .
Also , this Pat Buchanan quote scores an eleven on a scale of awesome :
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The New York Federal Reserve is lending up to $ 37.8 billion to American International Group to give the troubled insurer access to much - needed cash .
In exchange , AIG is giving the New York Fed investment - grade , fixed - income securities that it had previously lent out to other institutions for a fee .
Those institutions are now returning these securities and want their money back .
The new program , announced Wednesday , is on top of the $ 85 billion the federal government agreed to lend to AIG last month to prevent the global company from collapsing .
AIG said last Friday it had drawn down $ 61 billion .
The lending program is a way for AIG to get funding for its businesses , said a New York Fed spokesman .
The system is similar to lending facilities the Fed provides to banks , which can also exchange collateral for cash .
The latest announcement does not jeopardize the government 's ability to recoup its loan to AIG , experts said .
" AIG will repay the loan , " said Stewart Johnson , portfolio manager at Philo Smith , an investment bank specializing in insurance .
" It 's just a matter of how much of themselves they will have to sell . "
Paying back a big debt
On Sept. 16 , the Federal Reserve Board agreed to lend AIG $ 85 billion , using the company 's assets as collateral .
The loan is expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the asset sales .
Interest on the line of credit is steep , and the government took a 79.9 % stake in the company .
Last week , AIG said it planned to hold onto its property - and - casualty insurance businesses , while selling off the rest of the company to pay the massive debt .
Those other business lines include its aircraft leasing unit ; asset - management division ; retirement services ; and U.S. life insurance operations .
AIG chief executive Edward Liddy , who was installed by the Federal Reserve last month after the bailout , on a conference call last Friday was optimistic about the potential for the asset sales .
" We fully expect to emerge from this with a capital structure that 's fit to fight , " he said .
" Our insurance businesses ... are strong and well - capitalized . "
But some analysts are more skeptical .
" The current disruption in the credit markets could make it difficult to sell businesses at attractive valuations , " ratings agency Standard and Poor 's said .
CreditSights valued the units AIG planned to sell at $ 32.9 billion and the divisions it will keep at $ 86 billion .
These figures do not include the sale of a minority stake in its foreign life insurance operations , valued at $ 133.1 billion .
First to hit the market will likely be units tied to airline leasing and consumer lending , both of which require funding from the debt markets , which is hard to come by these days .

Considering the News …
At one time or another everyone has been mentally scarred by images of the 1960s feminist hippie fashion rebellion , namely the unabashed bra-less look that insulted man ’s imagination the country over .
Certain staples of the era will never be forgotten ; melodies and visions of reckless jubilation seared permanently into the senses .
There was the free - flowing music , the psychedelic drugs , the unbridled locks of hair …and millions upon millions of pointy nipples challenging the barriers of flimsy fabrics .
At times , there was no fabric whatsoever – just millions of pointy nipples .
But we progressed as a society , eventually arriving at point in the 1990s when lift bras gave every woman ( ok , many women ) the seductive boost of long - forgotten Greek goddesses .
Women and men everywhere rejoiced , as it seemed fashion , comfort and lust had finally arrived at that distant apex of visual sensation .
And times were damn good for all of us .
However , recent negligence by America ’s favorite bra-maker – Victoria ’s Secret – risks erasing decades of work .
A class action lawsuit has been filed against the sex tease conglomerate , and the looming implications are dire .
Apparently the latest lines have been causing rashes , hives , scars , and even welts on the bosoms of society , and the country ’s women are answering with vigor .
Which , of course , spells imminent doom for the curious and admiring gentlemen of the world .
Today it ’s a class action lawsuit , tomorrow it ’s a complete rejection of the technology altogether .
We could be facing a savage return to the past , to a time dominated by drooping flesh and vulgar fabric penetration .
Indeed , it ’s a sad day .
Hopefully Victoria ’s Secret gets its shit together and fixes the glitches .
Rebellion would lead to misery .
Salvation is in their hands .
If not for the comfort of our women , then at least for the sake of our treasured catalogues .
Only time will tell .

BART officials said Saturday that they will investigate the actions of one of the transit agency 's police officers after a video surfaced showing the officer striking a passenger - apparently Oscar Grant - minutes before the unarmed young man was fatally shot by another officer early on New Year 's Day .
The cell phone video , one of a handful that have surfaced , aired Friday night on KTVU - TV .
It shows a male BART police officer walking over to three men lined up against a wall near a female officer , and then striking one in the face .
The victim of the punch - identified by Channel 2 as 22 - year - old Grant - slides to the ground .
The video then shows the moments preceding the shooting , then the shooting itself .
It appears that the officer who punches the man is the same person who later is seen kneeling on Grant 's head when he was shot .
Sources have identified that officer as Tony Pirone .
He and the other officers present at the time of Grant 's shooting all remain on paid administrative leave while the investigation continues , but until Saturday BART was not investigating the conduct of anyone besides Johannes Mehserle , 27 , who shot Grant .
Mehserle later resigned from the force and was charged with murder .
He pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail .
Police investigators have said Grant put up a brief struggle with officers but was restrained and had both arms behind his back when he was shot .
It was not clear whether the struggle investigators referred to was the same incident caught on the new video .
But Peter Keane , a professor at Golden Gate University Law School and police expert , said Saturday night the video shows a " vicious , unprovoked and inexcusable assault " by the other police officer that should be prosecuted and that seems to have set off events that led to the shooting .
" With that powerful punch , he slams Mr. Grant in the side of his head and knocks him down even though it does n't appear Grant is doing anything but talking - maybe he is mouthing off but there was no physical provocation , " Keane said .
" Why is the other officer not being prosecuted ?
It was a clearly a deliberate , abusive use of force . "
He said the video is damning to Mehserle , too .
In a written statement released Saturday evening , BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger said she takes the " new allegation of police use of unreasonable force extremely seriously " and has directed BART Police Chief Gary Gee to conduct an internal affairs investigation .
The officer was not identified in the statement .
Noting that the investigation into Grant 's shooting is ongoing , Dugger vowed to " fully examine " any new evidence and urged KTVU to provide the agency and Alameda County district attorney 's office - which is prosecuting Mehserle - with the video .
BART 's board of directors voted unanimously on Jan. 12 to create a special committee that will provide additional oversight of the agency 's Police Department .
In the same statement released Saturday , BART board Director Carole Ward Allen - who chairs the committee - insisted that the agency does not tolerate police misconduct and will hold its police force to the " highest standards of professionalism and ethical conduct . "
We should be clear from the very first moment that it is very important to keep your movable type publishing platform updated to the most recent release .
The movable type publishing platform often offers upgrades with new releases .
Most of the upgraded versions contain new features and bug fixes , but sometimes there are critical security issues that you should immediately address .
Since Six Apart Japan purchased movable type from the former Six Apart US , the japanese crew continued and actually intensified the effort to make movable type an even better platform .
They 've decided to review the product whole source code and as a result they came up with an important number of fixes and mandatory security updates .
As a movable type developer , consultant , partner and consumer myself , I 've been pleased to see that apart from the fixes and security fixes I 've mentioned above , Six Apart continues to further develop the project with juicy new features focus both on productivity , as well as security .
Latest Versions
Since January 2010 , when Six Apart announced movable type v5 ( more precisely v5.01 ) and until mid 2012 the movable type platform was available as two products .
One called movable type v4.38 and which was continuing the v4.x series , but limiting to only implementing security fixes and the other called movable type v5.x with its latest v5.2.13 version .
Starting from December the 31st , 2013 , movable type v4.38 reached its ' end of life ' cycle .
Then , on September the 30th , 2015 , movable type v5.2.x reached its ' end of life ' cycle .
It is now the time for movable type v6.3.x to reach its ' end of life ' cycle on May the 16th , 2019 .
Movable Type v7.x was launched on May the 29th , 2018 and some may want to upgrade directly to it .
However , since it is a completely new product , some users may try to keep running movable type v6.x for a while and for them Six Apart decided to launch Movable Type v6.5 which is going to continue the Movable Type v6.3.9 development and will last until 2022 .
If you 're running an older version , it is extremely important to upgrade either to movable type v6.6.2 , or to movable type v7.3.1 .
Why do you have to upgrade ?
You wo n't imagine how important is to keep your installation secure and how hard and time consuming is to clean up after a security issue being exploited .
How long would v4.38 last ?
After mid 2012 , Six Apart decided to stop offering movable type v4.38 for download and to continue offering only movable type v5.x , this being a normal action in the product evolution .
According to the movable type product life cycle policy announced at the end of December 2012 ( right on the Christmas as a kind of Christmas gift ) , movable type v4.3 x would be considered to have reached the end of its life span on December the 31st , 2013 .
Six Apart initially planned to consider movable type v4.38 as having reached its life span at the end of December 2012 , but I 'm glad that they gave a grace period of one more year .
This is the right time to upgrade your movable type installation to the 6th series , more specifically to v6.6.2 or to the 7th series , more specifically to v7.3.1 .

Avoid Being Exploited , Address Security Issues !
Some people would think that a security exploit wo n't happen to them .
They probably think this way because they imagine that a badly intentioned person launches this kind of attacks manually and only if they have a dispute with somebody else .
Unfortunately things are a lot more dangerous because these e-criminals are scanning for vulnerabilities and would penetrate automatically those resources where their scanning methods identify vulnerabilities .
You wo n't like to know what experience I 've had with I 've seen the first customer being attacked .
It all started with a vulnerability being exploited in the same way Sony and Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) have been attacked in June 2011 .
Some website pages were injected with malware , some others with open door scripts and trojans and that made Google mark the site as dangerous .
When arriving to the site , people were seeing a large red window warning them that the site is dangerous and could infect their computers .
The client was getting lots of phone calls and emails from visitors , some alerting him about this problem and some others complaining that they fear that their computers have been infected .
There were visitors that were to upset that they 've told my client they will never visit his website again .
At that time I did n't have experience with such things .
I 've been a very experienced and talented developer with excellent results in my work , but with no experience at all about website attacks and exploits and that might be also because I 've always insisted with my customers to upgrade their installations , especially when the upgrade included security fixes .
Though I 've had a very busy schedule , I had to ask some of my customers if we could delay a little bit the jobs we were working on and spend time on this critical matter .
They 've been very kind , appreciated the way I work and the quality of my work , as well as the fact that I 'm respecting customers and I want to help one of my customers which was risking to kill his business .
This was the moment when the hide and seek game started .
I 've studied the vulnerabilities and learned how to fix all of them .
When I was saying that the cleanup is done , within 2 hours the exploit was back .
At some point a person was playing with the server files and folders and that was disturbing also other people 's projects .
I 've seen it with my own eyes when I 've renamed a folder that the hacker was cloning into „ _name - WHO " and a few minutes later the jerk renamed the folder into „ _name - HACK " .
That was the moment when I 've got very nervous !
Apart from the above , we 've noticed that the website was hijacked to pharma sites selling all kind of medicine like viagra , cialis etc .
This diminuished the search engines placement and forced Google to almost exclude the site from its index , basically pushing it very far from the first page because it considered it a spam site .
The battle took a total of 120 hours , within this time frame being includes also a few white nights of study and experiences on how to secure each and every vulnerability .
In the end all vulnerabilities were closed , the person that attacked localized and the data sent to the client which decided to address it with FBI 's Cyberterrorism division .
When I look back at this story I 'm glad that it forced me to learn a lot of things about how to secure data , to investigate an attack , to study and to fix vulnerabilities .
When it happened , it was a disaster both for my personal life ( very long hours and a couple of nights with absolutely no sleep at all ) , for my schedule , as well as for my customer .
Since then my customer had no more problems and I 've had the chance to be engaged on other similar tasks of fixing vulnerabilities , not only for movable type , but also for other platforms .

After years of rumors and brusque denials , it appears the Zune phone is the real deal .
According to Trip Chowdhry , an analyst at Global Equities Research , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer will announce a Zune - style mobile device during his keynote address at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , on January 7 , 2009 .
In an article in Barron's , Chowdhry claims that the company 's new centerpiece will combine the best features of the Zune media player with the hardware design of Danger 's mobile Sidekick , in addition to " motion enhancement features , " like an accelerometer .
Basically , this means the device will come with a physical keyboard like HTC's G1 and will likely feature a larger screen to accommodate heavy multimedia elements .
And since we 're all here copying each other 's mobile phone features , we 'll be shocked if the Zune phone does n't feature multitouch capabilities .
This report seems to confirm an earlier one revealing that Microsoft was working on a phone code - named " Pink . "
It 's a long way from Ballmer 's original statement in April 2007 regarding the iPhone : " It 's not a concept you 'll ever get from us .
We 're in the Windows Mobile business . "
In fact , this was always the excuse Microsoft gave as to why it could n't build a phone -– its WinMo business was too successful and it could n't afford to cannibalize the market .
This year , Microsoft 's WinMo profits are expected to be near $ 300 million in revenue .
Not bad if you can shake that amount of cash , but it seems positively paltry next to the $ 4.6 billion in revenue that Apple just made in the last quarter from its iPhone sales .
If Microsoft releases the Zunephone within six months of a January announcement , it might also mean that Windows Mobile 7 will be available to its hardware partners within that time .
No one wants to be played for a fool , and the imminent Zune phone would cut into their profits .
The pre-Zunephone timeline reveals MS ' unwillingness to reveal its plans .
In September ' 07 , a Microsoft rep warned that expecting a phone from the company was " not unreasonable . "
In the intermittent 15 months , however , the company limited its enthusiasm and its leaks .
Several top executives consistently batted down rumors of a full - on Microsoft phone .
In January ' 08 , Bill Gates simply said " No , we wo n't do that . "
Then , this past summer , a leaked internal e-mail by CEO Steve Ballmer strongly suggested Microsoft was working on a phone : " We 're changing the way we work with hardware vendors to ensure that we can provide complete experiences with absolutely no compromises .
We 'll do the same with phones . "
By October 2008 , Ballmer was revealing that the software used on the Zune was ready to be ported to PCs and to Windows Mobile devices .
Some believed he was admitting that the WinMo system was flawed and that a phone version of the well - received Zune UI was the next logical step .
Add the chatter that revealed that NVidia is making a special chip purely for a mobile Microsoft product , and it 's pretty clear the Zunephone is at hand .
Or is it ?
One way the rumors could turn out to be true while allowing for Microsoft 's continual denials would be for the mythical phone to instead be a web - enabled portable XBox Zune , for gaming .
Either way , here 's the one question we really care about :
Will it squirt ?

SACRAMENTO — Reacting to a gaping $ 11.2 billion hole in the California state budget he signed just six weeks ago , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger today announced a proposal to raise the state sales tax by 1.5 cent .
In addition , he proposed implementing a brand new tax on services , such as those offered by veterinary clinics , auto repair and golfing fees .
He also plans to implement a tax on producers that extract oil from California ground , and increase alcohol excise taxes by five cents a drink
His tax package would bring $ 4.7 billion new revenue .
Most of the rest of the budget shortfall would come in the form of cuts to education , prisons , public safety , Medi-Cal and social services .
Although the Republican governor spent the spring and summer telling Californians the state suffered from a spending problem that led to a $ 15 billion budget deficit , the world economic downturn has since pushed the state into having a revenue problem .
“ A drastic situation like this , ” Schwarzenegger told a news conference , “ takes drastic measures . ”
Anticipating the tax proposal , Republican legislative leaders this week said they would oppose any such plan .
Schwarzenegger , however , was hopeful lawmakers would understand the unprecedented situation and vote to revise the budget .
By Norm Kent , Esq. , NORML Board member
On July 1st of 2008 , Florida enacted a new law which enhanced penalties for marijuana grow houses .
Authorities heralded it as the ‘ Marijuana Grow House Eradication Act . ’
It is just another excuse to lock decent people up for longer times .
There are some provisions of the act which bring back the dark days of the draconian Rockefeller drug laws in New York , legislation which sent small marijuana growers to jail for thirty years .
Some might first be getting out today .
Law enforcement argued that they needed the new law because of the increasing number of grow houses operating in the state and violent crime which tend to be associated with these operations .
Sure they did .
“ Grow houses are not only furthering this dangerous drug trade within our state , they are bringing violent crime into our neighborhoods , ” said Attorney General McCollum .
“ This new law will help protect our families and communities . ”
No , it wo n’t .
There was no accompanying empirical or independent study or statistical backup to lend truth to the public statements of Mr. McCollum .
Nor was there any journalist anywhere in the state that took him to task or asked for documentation to sustain his claims .
They just regurgitated and repeated the pablum they were fed by law enforcement .
The new law makes it a second - degree felony to grow 25 or more plants , no matter how small or large those plants are .
Baby seedlings or mature daddies , 25 plants can get you 15 years .
It used to take 300 plants to reach that harsh a penalty .
Put it in perspective .
If you lived in California , and you were given a medical marijuana card , you would be allowed to grow up to six plants of your own .
Thus , if the cast of Real World was growing its own medicine in San Francisco they could film some great episodes .
If they were doing it in St. Pete , Florida , they could be doing those episodes for the next 25 years from the State Penitentiary .
The Florida law also changed to make it a first - degree felony to grow 25 or more plants in a home with children present .
That penalty is now 30 years .
Already , I am representing a 50 year old gentleman , who was a schoolteacher in Miami for 20 years ; who retired because of a disability .
He grew his own pot in an outdoor shed behind the garage , apart from his children , used it for himself , and knew nothing about the law .
He is now facing the rest of his life in jail .
“ Marijuana is the most commonly used illegal drug in America and we must take a stand against the for - profit growers who were previously exploiting higher thresholds , ” said one of the bill ’s sponsors .
“ By lowering the number of plants necessary for criminal charges , we ’ve given Florida ’s authorities valuable tools in the fight against these criminal operations , ” he foolishly added .
No , they have not given law enforcement any more tools .
They have just given decent people longer sentences for essentially innocent conduct .
Many of the larger grow houses I have seen over the past 30 years as a criminal defense lawyer are truly marijuana cultivation operations designed solely for entrepreneurial reasons and major marketing .
Exclusive homes in gated communities worth hundreds of thousands of dollars have been rented , sealed , and converted into home grown hydroponic laboratories .
When they are inadvertently discovered , law enforcement makes an entry only to find no one lives there , and the place was being used to solely grow pot which would be commercially marketed for a profit .
If pot is going to be against the law , you can understand that type of operation being targeted .
Greedy people violating the law go to jail .
The new law enhances penalties .
The difference in changing the law is significant , because what the legislature has done is gone from targeting entrepreneurial operations to including individuals simply trying to cultivate their own medicine .
The less you grow , the more you are likely to now face a greater penalty .
Two of the individuals I currently represent are domestic partners who purposely started a grow house in their backyard exclusively because , at the age of 45 , they did not “ want to go purchasing pot on the streets in their car during the dark of night . ”
My client said they thought this was the smart and safest way not to commit a crime , but to “ tend to their own garden . ”
And the price they pay for a safer way to acquire pot is a speedier way to go to jail for a longer time .
Another individual I represent who was growing pot is an artist .
He and his wife have two children .
They are painters .
They paint , they smoke , they raise their children .
At six a .m. one morning last summer , agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency knocked on their door to say they were investigating grow houses .
Separating wife and husband , they argued they smelled pot and had a right to enter .
They warned the couple that “ if they did not cooperate , ” they would have to take their children to the local family services agency , the typical bureaucratic disaster in this city that it is in your own .
They reminded them that under the new law they could lose their children and face 30 years in prison .
The couple had no guns , ran no gangs , and committed no violent acts .
They grew some weed to fulfill a passion they had engaged for 20 years .
These are the types of people these new laws target .
In this operation , the one law enforcement authorities bragged about as Operation D Day , sixteen agencies combined on one single day in Florida to bust 150 grow houses which would have netted purportedly $ 41 million worth of marijuana plants .
I guess we will never know now .
Overall , on that day , April 28 , over 9,000 plants were seized and 135 arrests were made throughout the state .
A review of the county wide press releases said very little about finding any guns , weapons , AK - 47s , or rifles .
About ten guns were found in South Florida , and a bullet proof vest .
If you were Noel Llorente , you might have needed one .
Mr. Llorente , you see , lives in Opa - Locka with his wife , Isabel .
He was leaving for work when unmarked cars pulled up , DEA agents jumped out , yanked him out of his vehicle , threw him down with guns drawn , handcuffed him , and then stormed into his home searching for drugs , smashing in the front door along the way .
Panicked , Isabel tried to call 911 .
Agents grabbed the phone from her .
A few minutes later , agents realized they were in the wrong house .
Whoops !
“ Sorry , they told me , Sorry , ” Noel Llorente said .
Then the agents went on their way .
“ So it goes , ” said the Little Prince , “ so it goes . ”
Marijuana is , of course , against the law in Florida .
The agencies had a right to make the arrests , conduct the seizures , and raid the grow houses .
They were doing their job enforcing the law .
We cannot castigate them for doing their duty .
We can condemn , censure and criticize the legislators who enhanced the penalties for the acts , instead of adjusting the laws to respond to the practical realities of marijuana use .
Authorities correctly point out there is an emerging trend that identifies an increasing number of indoor cannabis operations statewide .
One law enforcement officer said that the number is growing exponentially , at a rate they will never catch up to .
Well , does that also not say to those same agents of justice that people see their prosecution as an injustice ?
If so many are defying the law , should we not be reducing the penalties rather than enhancing them ?
I understand that law enforcement correctly stated that many ‘ Cuban nationals ’ were arrested in this operation , intimating that it is all part of a foreign conspiracy .
I understand too , that each county sheriff talked about how some of these major grow houses have led to more serious crimes .
I understand also that if Floridians were allowed to grow their own plants in their own backyards without the threat of law enforcement breaking in their doors and taking away their children there would be no need for Cuban nationals or terrorism .
Finally , I understand how the terrible law terrifies the decent citizen and creates the very terrorism the government seeks to end .
There is a very simple way to end the problems these law enforcement officers want to cease .
Legalize the pot they criminalize .
Medicalize it as over a dozen states have now done .
Thomas Jefferson once said that “ That government which governs least governs best . ”
And like his friend , George Washington , not to shabby an American himself , Thomas Jefferson was a hemp farmer .
Maybe America today needs more cultivators and more grow houses , not less .
Maybe like the patriots who threw tea off a British ship in a Boston harbor , the families who have grow houses in their backyards are today ’s revolutionaries .
Maybe tomorrow , history will prove them right .
Who knows , if I am right , maybe someday someone will make a TV show about it and call it ‘ Weeds ’ .
Then the show will win awards , people will laugh at it , and we will all look up and say how stupid these laws were .
After all , families who grow together , grow together .

Between current economic conditions and the technological evolution of the Internet , the traditional approach most job seekers have taken in the past is no longer viable .
The approach — developing a resume and cover letter , locating jobs on and submitting your resume to corporate sites and job banks , and crossing your fingers in hopes of receiving a call from a hiring manager — is , for the most part , a thing of the past .
The new approach is far different .
It boils down to the fact that there are fewer jobs available , more competition for those jobs and more touch points for recruiters and seekers to interact .
The current environment
In 2008 , there were 1.2 million job losses , unemployment is currently at 6.5 % , and the largest companies are shedding as much as 10 % of their workforces .
There will be 1.5 million college graduates this year , yet the job growth rate is at a six year low , at 1.3 % !
The amount of jobs posted online is decreasing at over 13 % , which has all led to the ratio of 3.3 job seekers per each job .
Social networks are starting to become part of the criteria that both hiring managers and college admissions officers are using to weed out applicants .
One in five hiring managers conduct background checks using social networks ( primarily Facebook ) , while one in ten college admissions officers do the same .
It 's time for you to be open - minded and think differently about how you 're going to get your next job and keep it .
I 'm not saying you should n't submit your resume to job banks , corporate websites , vertical job agents ( Simply Hired / Indeed ) or attend job fairs , but these should only consume 10 % of your time .
The other 90 % should be concentrated on the following seven social media secrets , which will not only get you a job , but help you create your own dream job !
1. Conduct a people search instead of a job search
The majority of jobs are n't posted online .
Hiring managers get a list of employee referral candidates before they even bother to view resumes from those who submit them online .
Sometimes the listed jobs are n't available or never existed in the first place .
Many studies have noted that 80 % of jobs are taken through networking , but few have sought to use the web to search and locate people they would actually enjoy working for at companies that they get excited about .
The 3 - step people search :
1. Identify the top five companies that you would like to work for .
Use a focused approach instead of flooding thousands of inboxes with spam .
You want to brand yourself , not just as the person of best fit for a job , but as someone who is eager and ecstatic to work for the company .
2 . Use search engines to track employees that currently work there .
There are over 130 million blogs in Technorati and you can search through them to possibly find someone who works at one of your top five companies .
You can search through corporate groups , pages and people on Facebook .
You can even do the same on Twitter .
Then there are people search engines such as pipl , peek you , and wink .
Once you find a contact name , try googling it to see if there is any additional information about that person .
3. Connect with the person directly .
Social media has broken down barriers , to a point where you can message someone you are n't friends with and do n't have contact information for , without any hassles .
Before you message a target employee , realize that they receive messages from people asking for jobs all the time and that they might not want to be bothered on Facebook , where their true friends are .
As long as you 've done your homework on the company and them , tailor a message that states who you are and your interest , without asking for a job at first .
Get to know them and then by the 3rd or 4th messages , ask if there is an available opportunity .
2 . Use attraction - based marketing to get job offers
The traditional way of searching for a job was proactive , forcing you to start a job that you might not have enjoyed .
The new approach is about building a powerful personal brand and attracting job opportunities directly into your doorstep .
How do you do this ?
You become a content producer instead of just a consumer and the number one way to do that on the web is to launch a blog that centers around both your expertise and passions .
You need to be passionate to be committed to this project because it requires a lot of writing , creativity and consistency in order for it to actually help you .
A blog is a non-intrusive , harmless and generous way of getting recruiters interested in your brand , without you even asking for a job !
Make the recruiters fall in love with you and only send you opportunities that are related to your blog content , so you end up happy in the end .
This works a lot and is expected for new - age marketing jobs that require experience in social media and can even help you jump - start a new business off of your blog platform .
By pulling recruiters into your world , you are able to impress them with what you want them to see and they can make a quick decision whether to hire you or not , without you hearing about rejection .
Start a blog today using Wordpress.com ( for beginners ) or install Wordpress.org onto your own host ( such as GoDaddy or Bluehost ) .
3 . Be proactive on Twitter
Twitter has become the ultimate utility to connect directly with recruiters and employees at companies you want to work for .
By conducting Twitter searches , following recruiters on your account and using the " @ " sign to communicate with them on occasion , you will start to learn a lot about them and their companies .
Before you follow anyone on Twitter , you HAVE TO have a completed profile .
This means , you should have a short bio , the location where you 're from , a link to a site that recruiters can go to for more information ( I recommend your blog or your Linked In profile ) and an avatar of yourself ( not a clown or Homer Simpson please ) .
This way , you stand a better chance of securing an opportunity or a relationship with people who care enough to read your profile .
Most people get jobs on Twitter by already having hundreds or thousands of followers .
For example , I 've heard of at least ten people getting a job by tweeting " just got laid off , looking for a job in finance " and then receiving a few direct messages with people who want to help them .
Of course , these individuals had built trust , credibility and relationships with their followers over time , so they were more inclined to come to their rescue .
You can do the same , just start right now !
4. Capitalize on LinkedIn
It 's no surprise that LinkedIn has been extremely profitable and successful as of late .
Recruiters are starting to use LinkedIn as the main place for sourcing candidates because it's free and the top professionals are on there .
Many people do n't use LinkedIn to the best of their ability and fail to complete their entire profile , such that it says " 100 % complete . "
Just like any other search engine recruiters are using , keywords are extremely important .
You want to fill out your entire profile , just like you would a resume , but include the same avatar you are using on Twitter ( see above ) and ensure that the summary section is complete .
You 'll also want to get at least one recommendation from a supervisor or friend , which will give you a " 1 " next to a " thumbs up " graphic when people search for you .
Then , you should import all your contacts from Outlook , Gmail , etc , so that you can start to build your network or grow your existing network .
The more people you 're connected to the better because you 're only able to reach other people in your network ( 1st , 2nd & 3rd degrees ) by having these connections .
You may want to pay for a premium account , so you can contact other recruiters that may help you .
Finally , you should conduct searches on there for jobs that you may be interested in and reach out to those individuals that may supply you with an interview or referral .
5. Advertise your brand using AdWords and Facebook Social Ads
Google AdWords is Google ’s advertising platform , which offers CPC ( cost - per- click ) and CPI ( cost - per- impression ) pricing for advertisements on Google and partner sites .
Some of their partner sites are newspapers , radio and TV .
Before running your advertisement , you need a landing page .
If you have a website or blog , then use the resume page within it to display through advertising .
This works beautifully because recruiters can see that single resume page and notice all the other pages / options on your website , to get a better sense of your brand .
Here 's how to create your ad :
Title .
When you create your ad , label yourself as a specialist , expert or guru on the title tag .
You might want to state the fact that it ’s your resume first .
Description .
In the next two description tags , pull out your biggest achievements in 6 words or less and list your personal brand statement or a few descriptors .
URL .
For your URL , do n’t use the URL for your resume page .
Instead use yourname.com for personal branding purposes .
Drop the " www " from the domain you want to promote because it 's unnecessary .
Facebook Social
Ads allow businesses and individuals to advertise using Facebook ’s news feed or left rail ( will change to 2 ad spots on the right when the new interface swaps over ) .
This program works similar to Google ’s but you can use a picture and it ’s more “ word - of - mouth friendly ” because ads travel through the news feed of friends .
Here 's how to create your ad :
Title .
What is the ad for ?
The title is the most important piece of your ad because it has the most “ text ” emphasis .
I would say “ I want to work for < insert company name > ” or “ Resume for < insert position type > . ”
Try and be as specific as you can .
Picture .
Just like your Facebook picture , do n’t use a picture that you would n’t want shown to your future employer .
I would go for a professional yet personal picture .
Description .
Do n’t write your resume , but instead give the viewer a quick description of who you are , what you do and what job you want in 25 words .
Once you create your ad , either link it to your Facebook page , Linked In profile or blog / website .
These ads are all about targeting a specific group that would care about your resume or hiring you for that matter .
When you select your target audience , keep your major in mind , as well as the company and location .
6. Construct a video resume and upload it to YouTube
A search for " video resume " on YouTube will give you over 1,700 results .
Many video resumes are good , while others are so amateur and rehearsed that they subtract from a given candidates marketing program .
The key with a video resume is that very few people have actually created one , so they serve as a differentiator in the recruiting process .
A good video resume is short , describes the value you can contribute to a given position , explains why you 're the best person for the job and talks about your background in a story - like format .
If you are n't a person with an outgoing and lively personality , then do n't bother creating one .
Since you 're filming yourself , do n't rush because you can always try it a hundred times before you upload the final version to YouTube .
7. Subscribe to blogs that have job listings
We all subscribe to blogs to receive information based on our interests , at least I hope .
Over time we rely on these sources for information to keep us updated on what is happening in certain industries or different trends that are developing .
In the past few years , the larger blogs have started to integrate job banks into their own websites , using software / hosting from companies such as Job-a - matic .
Blogs that have taken this approach include Guy Kawasaki 's blog , GigaOM , and Jeremiah Owyang 's Web Strategy Blog .
Other blogs , such as Darren Rowse 's Problogger Blog offer blogging jobs , and Mashable has a job board highlighting jobs in social media and tech .
This targeting will save you from hours searching and help escort you to jobs that you 'd actually want .
Integrate the traditional and social media approach
These seven secrets are extremely important in your next job search .
The most successful job searches come from those who have already built up strong networks , both online and off .
You need to integrate this new - age approach with the traditional approach you 've already been using , in order to be consistent , so there are no surprises from the recruiter 's perspective .
They want the candidate they see on paper or online .
I would recommend that you use a link to your blog , Linked In profile and YouTube video resume on your traditional resume .
You 'll also want to link your existence on all social networks together .
You need to be where recruiters are searching , as well as become a content producer so you can attract them directly to you .
That is how you have a successful job search and stand out for years to come .

Everyone ’s a critic , and apparently it ’s never too soon to start .
That ’s why David Fishman , an Upper West Sider who turned 12 last month , decided to take himself out for dinner one night last week .
His parents had called him at home to say they were running late , suggesting that he grab some takeout at the usual hummus place .
Hummus , again ?
David thought he could do better than that .
He had recently passed by the newly opened Salumeria Rosi , a few blocks from his home , and had been intrigued by the reflective black back wall , the cuts of dried pork hanging from the ceiling , the little jars of cured olives and artichokes adorning the walls .
If it was O.K. with his mom ( and it turned out it was ) , he wanted to try that instead .
David aspires to be a food critic  he has some vague notion that he could make a living writing for the Zagat guides  and the new Italian spot on Amsterdam Avenue near 73rd Street seemed worthy of investigation .
That night , Tuesday , turned out to be one of the first that the restaurant was open to the public .
David requested a menu , which the hostess handed him , and decided that it was within his budget ( $ 25 ) .
Then he asked for a table for one and waited to see what she ’d say .
A year before , he had been turned away from a half - empty restaurant in Montauk and told that it did not serve children unaccompanied by adults .
“ I was angry , but I did n’t show it , ” he said .
“ What can you do ? ”

The closer teens live to where alcohol is sold , the greater the seeming risk of binge drinking and driving under the influence .
Researchers from the Pardee Rand Graduate School in Santa Monica researched the relationship between proximity to alcohol retailers in zones around homes in California and drinking in children ages 12 to 17 .
They found an association among homes within walking distance ( about half a mile ) of places selling alcohol and evidence of binge drinking and driving after drinking .
The study , published online this month in the American Journal of Public Health , also noted that alcohol is more readily available in minority and lower - income areas .
In predominantly white neighborhoods , within a half - mile there are an average 5.5 locations with active alcohol licenses .
In predominantly African American neighborhoods it ’s 6.4 locations ; in predominantly Latino , 8.6 ; and in predominantly Asian , 9.5 .
Researchers point out that living in areas with higher alcohol sales could also mean more exposure to violent crime and drunk driving .
“ Our study suggests that living in close proximity to alcohol outlets is a risk factor for youth , ” write the authors .
“ In California , retail licenses are not typically approved within 100 feet of a residence or within 600 feet of schools , public playgrounds and nonprofit youth facilities , but proximity by itself is not sufficient to deny a license .
. . .
More attention on the proximity rule is needed and environmental interventions need to curb opportunities for youth to get alcohol from commercial sources . ”

Sterling was hammered down to a five - year low against the dollar today and the FTSE 100 dropped by almost 200 points as Gordon Brown echoed gloomy comments from Mervyn King and admitted for the first time that the UK is likley to slip into a recession .
The Dow Jones industrial average shed more than 400 points in the first four hours of trading following a slew of bad financial data from major companies including Wachovia , the struggling bank , and drug - maker Merck .
Wachovia , which is in the process of being rescued by rival Wells Fargo , reported a quarterly loss of just under $ 24bn ( £ 14.74bn ) today as it took a significant writedown and warned of further exposure to the American mortgage market .
At 6.30 pm BST the Dow was down 412 points at 8621 - a decline of 4.5 % .
The pound began tumbling last night as the Bank of England governor told business leaders in Leeds that the economy is shrinking and hinted at fresh interest rate cuts .
The prime minister compounded his comments this afternoon by admitting that the global credit crisis will probably push Britain into a recession .
By 5 pm BST sterling had fallen by more than seven cents to $ 1.6177 , a drop of more than 4 % , as traders reported frantic selling as investors rushed to cut their losses by selling the UK currency .
Sterling also fell against the euro , slipping to € 1.2761 this afternoon .
The euro itself fell sharply against other currencies , hitting a four - and - a - half - year low against the yen , and its lowest value against the dollar since November 2006 .
In the City , the FTSE 100 shed more than 100 points in early trading and it closed down 188 points at 4040 , a 4.5 % decline .
Mining firms , which will suffer badly from a global downturn , dominated the list of the top fallers .
Traders said the bad news emanating from the US was also depressing stocks across the Atlantic .
" We have had a raft of poor earnings figures in the US and the fear continues to accelerate , " said Howard Wheeldon , senior strategist at BGC Partners .
Ewen Stewart , equity strategist at Investec , said : " The truth is dawning that we are in a pretty long and difficult economic period and there 's a realisation that earnings forecasts ... remain too high , and that is driving equity valuations low . "
Blake Jorgensen , Yahoo's chief financial officer , said on Tuesday that the US economy was entering " what is very clearly a recession mode . "
The pound had already been hit yesterday by unexpectedly gloomy manufacturing data showing that confidence has collapsed , and King 's comments appear to have added to concern over quite how weak the British economy now is .
Describing the banking system turmoil of recent weeks as " extraordinary , almost unimaginable , " he said the financial system had come closer to collapse two weeks ago than at any time in the past 90 years .
" The combination of a squeeze on real take - home pay and a decline in the availability of credit poses the risk of a sharp and prolonged slowdown in domestic demand .
Indeed , it now seems likely that the UK economy is entering a recession , " King said .
" It is surely probable that the drama of the banking crisis , which is unprecedented in the lifetime of almost all of us , will damage business and consumer confidence more generally . "
His fears were confirmed yesterday as the CBI reported that confidence among British manufacturers had tumbled to its lowest since July 1980 , with output and orders also collapsing .
The prime minister also conceded for the first time that a recession is likely in the UK .
Brown told MPs : " Having taken action on the banking system , we must now take action on the global financial recession . "
He said this would probably result in " recession in America , France , Italy , Germany , Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too " .
The thinktank the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said today that Britain entered a recession in the third quarter of the year and warns the slump will probably last for a year or more , making it every bit as painful as the recessions of the early 1990s or early 1980s .
City commentator David Buik said that King 's speech has " put sterling to the sword for the time being " .
The Bank of England cut the cost of borrowing by half a point to 4.5 % earlier this month , as part of coordinated global action , and King hinted that rates may come down again soon .
" During the past month , the balance of risks to inflation in the medium - term shifted decisively to the downside , " he said .
CMC Markets analyst James Hughes said that the possibility of interest rate cuts across Europe have made the greenback more attractive - after months in which traders bet against the dollar .
" Investors continue to flock to the dollar as speculation mounts that central banks elsewhere will continue with aggressive rate cuts in an attempt to stimulate growth in the near term , " said Hughes .
Official data out on Friday will almost certainly show that the economy contracted in the July to September period , having not grown at all in the second quarter .
A " technical " recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction , which experts say is the least Britain can expect this time round .
CARACAS , Venezuela ( CNN ) --
Armed men forced their way into a Caracas synagogue , defacing its administrative offices with anti-Semitic graffiti and vandalizing an interior room where the Torah is kept , officials said .
Vandals smashed items in an interior room where the Torah is kept , officials said .
About 15 men forced their way into the Mariperez Synagogue in Venezuela 's capital about 10 p.m.
Friday , staying until about 3 a.m. , police said .
They tied up a security guard at the synagogue before vandalizing the rooms .
Graffiti left at the scene included the phrases " Damn the Jews , " " Jews out of here " and " Israel assassins . "
The men also left behind a picture of a devil , authorities said .
The men stole computers and administrative papers or documents , officials said .
They did not cover their faces , but took the recordings from security cameras with them .
Watch destruction caused by vandals »
The synagogue had canceled services in recent weeks because of a feared backlash from the Israeli military operations in Gaza , which resulted in the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador from Venezuela .

Hamilton became the youngest ever F1 drivers ' champion at 23 Lewis Hamilton said he felt " humbled " after becoming an MBE in the Queen 's New Year Honours .
The Stevenage - born driver , 23 , became the youngest winner of the Formula One championship after a dramatic finish to the Brazilian Grand Prix in November .
" It is a massive honour and incredible privilege to receive an MBE from Her Majesty the Queen , " said Hamilton .
" It is the most amazing culmination to what has been quite a year for me and something I am very appreciative of . "
Having come close to claiming the F1 drivers ' championship in his debut season , Hamilton secured the 2008 title with a fifth - place finish at Interlagos .
The Englishman 's title rival and local hero Felipe Massa won the race in his Ferrari but Hamilton passed Timo Glock at the final corner to push the Brazilian into second place in the drivers ' championship .
" The support I have received from the UK as a whole has been fantastic and a huge motivation , " added Hamilton , who turns 24 next month and now lives in Switzerland .

The Census Bureau reports that retail sales collapsed in November :
The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that advance estimates of U.S. retail and food services sales for November , adjusted for seasonal variation and holiday and trading - day differences , but not for price changes , were $ 355.7 billion , a decrease of 1.8 percent from the previous month and 7.4 percent below November 2007 .
Total sales for the September through November 2008 period were down 4.5 percent from the same period a year ago .
The September to October 2008 percent change was revised from - 2.8 percent to - 2.9 percent .
Retail trade sales were down 2.0 percent from October 2008 and were 8.5 percent below last year .
Motor vehicle and parts dealers sales were down 25.2 percent from November 2007 and gasoline stations sales were down 22.0 percent from last year .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The following graph shows the year - over - year change in nominal and real retail sales since 1993 .
To calculate the real change , the monthly PCE price index from the BEA was used ( November PCE prices was estimated as the same as October ) .
Although the Census Bureau reported that nominal retail sales decreased 8.4 % year - over - year ( retail and food services decreased 7.4 % ) , real retail sales declined by 10.1 % ( on a YoY basis ) .
This is the largest YoY decline since the Census Bureau started keeping data .
Retail sales are a key portion of consumer spending and real retail sales have fallen off a cliff .
Having demonstrated a year ago an effective nanotech method for shutting down specific gene expression in a mouse model of colitis , a team of researchers at Tel Aviv University is preparing to test this method in clinical trials for blood , pancreatic , breast and brain cancers .
From “ A Fantastic Voyage Brought To Life “ :
Ever since the 1966 Hollywood movie , doctors have imagined a real - life Fantastic Voyage — a medical vehicle shrunk small enough to “ submarine ” in and fix faulty cells in the body .
Thanks to new research by Tel Aviv University scientists , that reality may be only three years away .
The blueprints for the submarine and a map of its proposed maiden voyage were published [ last year ] in Science [ abstract ] by Dr. Dan Peer , who now leads the Tel Aviv University team at the Department of Cell Research and Immunology .
The team will build and test - run the actual “ machine ” in human bodies .
Dr. Peer originally developed the scenario at Harvard University . …
“ Our lab is creating biological nano - machines , ” says Dr. Peer .
“ These machines can target specific cells .
In fact , we can target any protein that might be causing disease or disorder in the human body .
This new invention treats the source , not the symptoms . ”
Dr. Peer ’s recent paper reported on the device ’s ability to target leukocytes ( immune cells ) in the guts of mice with ulcerative colitis .
Calling his new invention a submarine , Dr. Peer has developed a nano - sized carrier which operates like a GPS system to locate and target cells .
In the case of Crohn ’s disease , for example , it will target overactive immune system cells in the gut .
In other diseases such as cancer , the submarine can aim for and deliver material to specific cancer cells , leaving the surrounding healthy cells intact .
While other researchers are working in the area of nano - medicine and drug delivery , Dr. Peer ’s submarines are among the first to combine a drug candidate with a drug delivery system .
As the submarines float through the body , they latch onto the target cell and deliver their payload , a drug based on RNAi .
This new kind of drug can affect faulty RNA machinery and reprogram cells to operate in normal ways .
In essence , RNAi can essentially restore health to diseased cells or cause cells to die ( like in the case of cancer cells ) . …
Currently , the Tel Aviv University lab is pairing its medical submarine with different RNAi compounds to target different pathologies , such as cancer , inflammation , and neurodegenerative diseases .
“ We have tapped into the same ancient system the human body uses to protect itself from viruses , ” says Dr. Peer , who is also investigating a number of topical applications for his medical subs .
“ And the beauty of it is the basic material of our nano - carriers is natural , ” he says .
The Tel Aviv University team plans to launch their medical submarines , following FDA regulations , within three to five years .
Their immediate focus is on blood , pancreatic , breast and brain cancers .
Faith Healing Parents Assert Religious Rights Parents want charges dropped in faith healing death of their toddler daughter .
Dec. 10 , 2008  -- A Clackamas County , Ore. , couple accused of letting their infant daughter die by relying on prayer , rather than medicine , today asked that the charges be dropped , arguing that they infringe on their freedom of religion and their right to raise their children in their own way .
Carl Worthington , 28 , and his wife , Raylene , 25 , belong to a church that believes in faith healing , and police said that , instead of going to a doctor when their 15 - month - old daughter Ava got sick , they turned to prayer .
The infant girl died March 2 from bacterial bronchial pneumonia and an infection , both of which could have been cured with common antibiotics , the medical examiner said .
The Worthingtons face charges of second degree manslaughter and criminal mistreatment charges .
They surrendered to police in March , but were subsequently released after each posted $ 25,000 bail .
The motion filed in Clackamas County Circuit Court by the Worthingtons ' lawyer today claims that their prosecution is a violation of the rights guaranteed them under both the state and federal constitutions .
" Mr. and Mrs. Worthington maintain that their prosecution contravenes their right ' to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences , ' as guaranteed by the Constitution of the State of Oregon and the Constitution of the United States , " the motion said .
" Further , Mr. and Mrs. Worthington urge that this prosecution contravenes their fundamental right to raise their children without interference by the State . "
A hearing on the motion is scheduled for Jan. 7 , 2009 .
The Worthingtons are members of the Followers of Christ Church in Oregon City , that has a history of shunning medical care in favor of faith healing .
Another Oregon City couple who belong to the same church face similar charges , after their son -- who was Ava Worthington 's uncle -- died in June .
Jeffrey Dean Beagley , 50 , and Marci Rae Beagley , 46 , pleaded not guilty Oct. 3 to criminally negligent homicide charges in the death of their son , 16 - year - old Neil Jeffrey Beagley .
Neil died June 17 from complications of a urinary tract blockage , according to medical examiners .
The condition , which doctors say is easily treatable , caused kidney and heart failure .
A decade ago , the church received national attention after ABC News affiliate KATU - TV in Portland , Ore. , reported that the state medical examiner believed approximately 20 children , whose parents belonged to the church , had died from untreated illnesses that were curable .
For more of KATU 's coverage of the case , click here .
After that story broke , the Oregon state legislature changed the law to bar defendants , in most cases , from claiming their religious beliefs prevented them from seeking medical help .
According to the Worthingtons ' motion filed today , their case is the first application of that revised statute .
Though the revised law removed the so - called " spiritual healing defense , " there is still a provision that allows judges to give parents a lighter sentence , based on their beliefs .

NEW DELHI / ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan canceled army leave and redeployed some troops Friday in a sign of rising tension with India .

The United States urged both sides to refrain from further raising tensions , already high after India blamed Islamist militants based in Pakistan for attacks on Mumbai last month that killed 179 people .
The latest strains followed media reports in Pakistan and India that “ several ” Indian nationals had been held in the last two days after bombings in the Pakistani cities of Lahore and Multan .
The foreign ministry in New Delhi warned Indian citizens on Friday that “ it would be unsafe for them to travel ( to ) or be in Pakistan . ”
Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh had earlier discussed tension with Pakistan during a scheduled meeting about military pay with the chiefs of the army , navy and air force , his office said .
“ The prime minister met the tri-services chiefs to discuss the pay commission issues but obviously the situation in the region was also discussed , ” said an official from Singh ’s office , who requested anonymity .
The South Asian neighbors both tested nuclear weapons in 1998 .
They have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 , and came to the brink of a fourth after gunmen attacked the Indian parliament in December 2001 .
Although many analysts say war is very unlikely , international unease is growing .
“ We hope that both sides will avoid taking steps that will unnecessarily raise tensions during these already tense times , ” U.S. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
“ We continue to be in close contact with both countries to urge closer cooperation in investigating the Mumbai attacks and in fighting terrorism generally . ”
Brooke Anderson , chief national security spokesperson for President - elect Barack Obama , who will be inaugurated on January 20 , declined to comment on the current tensions .
“ There is one president at a time , and we intend to respect that , ” Anderson said .
While there had been no significant troop movements in either India or Pakistan , military officials in Islamabad said army personnel had been ordered to report to barracks and some troops had been moved off the Afghan border .
“ A limited number of troops from snow - bound areas and areas where operations are not being conducted have been pulled out , ” said a senior security official who declined to be identified .
WORRYING DISTRACTION
That is likely to worry Washington , which does not want Pakistan distracted from the battle against al Qaeda and Taliban militants on its western border .
The official declined to say where the troops had been moved to , citing the sensitivity of the issue .
Pakistani media have reported some troops had been redeployed to the Indian border .

India , the United States and Britain have blamed the Mumbai attack on Pakistan - based Islamist group Lashkar - e - Taiba , set up to fight Indian rule in the disputed Kashmir region .
Pakistan has condemned the attacks and has denied any state role , blaming “ non-state actors . ”
It has offered to cooperate with India but denies Indian claims that it has been handed firm evidence of links to militants in Pakistan .
Islamabad has said that it will defend itself if attacked .
A senior police official in Pakistan ’s Punjab province denied that any Indians had been arrested over the Lahore and Multan blasts but an intelligence agency official , who declined to be identified , said an Indian had been detained Wednesday .
Several more Indians had been detained based on information obtained from that suspect , the intelligence official said .
Increasingly frenzied media reporting on both sides of the border has fueled war speculation , affecting India ’s government bond market Friday , although leaders from both countries have said war would serve no one ’s interests .
Washington has joined Britain in urging restraint from India , but at the same time has demanded Pakistan act decisively to wipe out banned groups such as Lashkar - e - Taiba .
Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi also called his counterparts in New Delhi and Islamabad in the past two days .
China has long been a close ally of Pakistan , while India and Washington have been building close ties .
A Chinese foreign ministry statement said Yang urged both sides to continue dialogue .
China was willing to work with the international community to protect peace and security in South Asia .
A senior government official in New Delhi said Yang had suggested a meeting between Indian and Pakistani officials .
Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee told Yang Pakistan must crack down on militants before a meeting would be possible , the official said .
A crackdown on Pakistan - based militants after the 2001 parliament attack was seen by India as a sham .
The Arcata and Eureka Youth Protection Acts -- measures F and J , respectively -- aim to keep military recruiters from targeting minors : " Stop Recruiting Kids ! " demands the website for the citizen initiatives ( stoprecruitingkids.org ) .
In order to defend the defenseless from the nation 's defenders , the acts must first face the voters .
If they win that battle , the Youth Protection Acts could face challenges on legal grounds .
The identical measures were born through the efforts of former Arcata City Councilmember Dave Meserve , along with 83 - year - old Eureka resident and infantry veteran Winfield Sample and a host of volunteers , all of whom say these ordinances are necessary to guard against unscrupulous recruiters who , in their quota - fueled zeal , bamboozle impressionable youths -- filling their sponge - like minds with glorified notions of honor , patriotism and adventure while downplaying the potential for death , dismemberment and traumatic stress .
" They 're coming here , and they want to take our kids to war , " Meserve said .
While it 's already illegal to enlist minors unless they 're 17 and have parental consent , Meserve explained that there 's more to recruiting than enlistment .
" Recruiting is the act of encouraging or enticing someone to join , " he said , " and recruiting starts way earlier ...
The Army handbook encourages recruiters to gain the trust of even seventh and eighth graders . "
Said handbook is an 11 - chapter guide to successful conscription techniques that couches the recruiters ' mission in marketing terms :
An initial meeting with a student , for example , is called a " sales presentation . "
Like most marketing experts , the guide suggests gettin ' ’em while they 're young .
" If you wait until they 're seniors , it 's probably too late , " the handbook reasons .
Recruiters aim to make " first contact " during the summer after junior year .
" This plants awareness of the Army in their minds , " the guidebook continues .
" Remember , first to contact , first to contract . "
Measure J volunteer Jane Stock said there 's hard science behind this approach .
" Brain research shows that youths age 16 and 17 find the military more attractive , " she said .
" They 're more aggressive , they 're prone to making impulsive decisions and they 're vulnerable to outside pressures . "
Eureka activist and former school principal Jack Nounnan agrees , saying recruiters feed into the gun-happy , consequence - free violence of popular culture .
By the end of the pitch , Nounnan said , young students are " so pumped up , it 's almost like a video game experience . "
Ridiculous , says Marine Corps Sgt. Matt DeBoard , the marketing and public affairs representative for the recruiting station in San Francisco .
" We 're trying to be a positive influence in the schools , " he said via phone interview last week .
" We 're not abducting people in the middle of night .
They want to be Marines . "
The local military recruiting offices sit in a trash - strewn corner of the Victoria Place strip mall .
The walls inside the Marines office are adorned with framed ads ( " The few .
The proud . " ) , photos of recent recruits and a mural depicting the flag - raising at Iwo Jima .
Atop a science - fair - style diorama sits an AT4 rocket launcher and a small stuffed bulldog in fatigues , its plush head wrapped in a keffiyeh -- a souvenir brought home by a soldier who served in Iraq .
Sitting behind his desk last week , Gunnery Sgt. Dan Sage said he enjoys being a recruiter .
He likes seeing the difference in the men and women he sends off to training .
When they come back into his office , he can see that they 're on a good path .
The simple fact , he says , is that many teens want to go into the military -- no arm - twisting required .
" They seek us out , " he said .
And invariably , he added , they 're happy to have done so .
" I have yet to have an individual that I 've put in the Marines come back and say they regret going in , " Sage said .
They 're out there , Meserve insists .
The Humboldt Committee for Conscientious Objectors fields hundreds of phone calls from disgruntled soldiers through its G.I. Rights Hotline , Meserve said -- soldiers who say recruiters misled them , promising jobs or benefits that never came through .
While gathering signatures for Measures F and J , volunteers heard stories from angry parents and students who said they struggled to fend off pushy recruiters .
The Youth Protection Acts would n't prevent minors from approaching recruiters ; it would just prevent recruiters from approaching minors .
Enforcement would be complaint - driven .
But legal experts say the ordinances could potentially violate federal law .
The No Child Left Behind
Act stipulates that schools receiving funding under the Act must provide the same access to recruiters as colleges provide or lose said funding .
Beyond that , the measures could be deemed unconstitutional .
As reported in the Journal earlier this year ( " First to Contact , First to Contract , " April 17 ) , legal experts say the acts may violate recruiters ' freedom of speech and the federal government 's authority to raise a military .
Meserve is confident , however , that the measures will stand .
The purse strings attached to No Child Left Behind are n't at risk , he said , because it 's the voters -- not the schools -- making restrictions .
As for the First Amendment , he says it was designed to protect the people from the government , not vice versa .
" People think we 're anti-American or anti-military , " he said .
" We are not trying to stop recruiting ; we 're not expecting to end the war or change the whole structure of the military .
We 're just saying , bottom line , it 's wrong to recruit kids .
That 's it . "
Sgt. DeBoard said the military has its own absolute : " Bottom line :
We 've got a mission , and we 're going to make it happen no matter what . "
Something has to give .
The Bush administration has not yet lifted the regulation barring people with HIV from entering the United States , despite the law lifting the ban overwhelmingly passed by the Congress and signed by president Bush last July .
Yesterday , they simply reiterated their previous plans to " streamline " the process , which , in fact , does nothing but make it more bureaucratically cumbersome for temporary visitors with HIV to enter the country as tourists or for conferences .
They have done nothing to end the ban as the law clearly asked for .
As it currently stands , I will still be required to leave the US for good next March .
And many more are in much worse straits .
They say they will change the regs .
And that it takes time .
My guess is that it will take until after the election .
But does anyone believe a Palin administration would make life any easier for people with HIV ?
For people with HIV , the Palin nomination should be terrifying .

Enlarge By Rich Pedroncelli , AP A hiker found a pilot 's license and a torn $ 100 bill that investigators believe belonged to adventurer Steve Fossett , who vanished during a solo flight more than a year ago .
Steve Fossett AP file photo Enlarge Handouts via AP Searchers found the wreckage of Steve Fossett 's plane in California 's rugged Sierra Nevada just over a year after the millionaire vanished .
Enlarge By Rich Pedr Preston Morrow , here with his dog Kona , discovered some of missing millionaire Steve Fossett 's belongings while hiking off regular trails near Mammoth Lakes , Calif .
Fossett joins the many mysteries of the Sierras
The mystery of Steve Fossett is most likely solved , but the gray granite peaks of the Sierra Nevada may never give up the secrets they hold of missing aviators and long ago wrecked planes .
Searchers spotted Fossett 's battered single - engine plane Wednesday night , more than a year after he took off from a Nevada ranch .
Wreckage indicated a high - speed impact at about 10,000 feet .
Small pieces of human remains were found with the wreckage , said National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Mark Rosenker .
The location — far from the main search areas farther north — did n't surprise the amateur sleuths who spend years in search of missing planes in these mountains .
" The Sierra probably holds the majority of the airplanes that were n't found for a while due to its remoteness and its ruggedness , " says Craig Fuller , who studies plane crashes .
He runs a website called Aviation Archaeological Investigation and Research .
ON DEADLINE : Latest on search for Fossett Unforgiving terrain
The mountain range , which runs up California 's eastern side and has the highest peak in the continental U.S. , has been the backdrop of many aviation mysteries .
An Air Force pilot who bailed out of his jet in 1957 survived for weeks in the backcountry only to be unjustly accused of faking his story after he was rescued .
A father spent 14 years combing the mountains in search of the bomber that his son had co-piloted .
A World War II fighter plane crashed within a mile of where the pilot parachuted to safety in 1941 but has never been found despite dozens of searches .
" When you are looking for an airplane like Fossett 's , it 's not looking for a needle in one haystack .
It 's like looking for a needle in many haystacks , " says G. Pat Macha , a retired high school teacher who has spent 35 years searching for plane wrecks .
Fossett , 63 when he died , left a ranch in Nevada owned by hotel magnate Barron Hilton on the morning of Sept. 3 , 2007 , for a flight in a Bellanca Super Decathlon propeller plane .
He was looking for dry lake beds on which to try to break the land speed record in a rocket - propelled car .
He never filed a flight plan , which was routine for small private planes in that remote section of Nevada .
So it 's not known how he ended up flying about 90 miles south of the ranch over the pine forests and massive rock formations of the Sierras .
Fossett , an adventurer inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame , was an experienced pilot .
But his flight over the Sierras had risks .
" We do have a higher number of accidents because the terrain is less forgiving , " said Bruce Landsberg , executive director of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association 's Air Safety Foundation .
At 10,000 feet , his plane would have been short on power , Landsberg said .
According to local pilots , that section of the Sierras is known for its rough winds .
A downdraft could easily have pushed the plane down faster than it was capable of climbing , Landsberg said .
Weather reports that day reported gusty winds .
Mountains are ' brutal ' Lt. David Steeves made it out of the Sierra alive after his T - 33 trainer jet crashed .
He lived for 54 days in the wilderness after ejecting and making his way to an unoccupied cabin .
Soon after his rescue , people began to doubt his story .
Where was the wreck , they asked .
Steeves died in 1965 in a small - plane crash in Idaho .
It was n't until 1977 that Boy Scouts found the canopy of his jet .
To this day , the wreckage has never been located , Macha said .
In 1943 , a B - 24 bomber crashed in the mountains .
Co-pilot 2nd Lt. Robert Hester 's father , Clinton , was determined to find the plane .
" He basically spent every summer that he was physically able hiking in the Sierras looking for his son , " Fuller said .
In 1960 , a year after Clinton Hester died , a survey team found the bomber in a remote lake .
It 's now known as Hester Lake .
Lt. Leonard C. Lydon parachuted to safety in 1941 after his Army fighter squadron got lost over the mountains .
His P - 40 fell within a mile of where he landed in the remote Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks , Macha says .
" To this day , nobody has been able to come up with ( the plane ) , " he says .
" But when you see the geography , it is brutal and mind boggling . "

Edward Richardson , douche bag , got what he deserved this week when a jury of his peers convicted him of murdering wife Sarah Richardson , after she changed her Facebook status from " married " to " single . "
Advertisement
Richardson received a life sentence for stabbing his estranged wife to death last May .
She was living at her parent 's home at the time following a falling out .
When she later changed her status to " single , " Richardson broke in and killed her .
Later , he tried and failed to kill himself .
This is the third U.K. - based Facebook murder story to happen in the past year .
As ComputerWeekly reports , last year in Barnsley , South Yorkshire , " a man murdered his wife and then killed himself after she told visitors to her Facebook page that she was splitting up with him . "
In October , a Croydon , Surrey , man murdered his wife when she also changed her status to single .
Somehow I do n't think it 's Facebook that 's to blame in these cases , as they 'd probably play out the same way , sadly , regardless of the method use to break off the marriage .

HAMPTON � Hampton Beach residents came together Wednesday morning , Dec. 3 , to have their own Boston Tea Party of sorts in revolt over a recent town revaluation that saw their property assessments and tax bills skyrocket .
HAMPTON � Hampton Beach residents came together Wednesday morning , Dec. 3 , to have their own Boston Tea Party of sorts in revolt over a recent town revaluation that saw their property assessments and tax bills skyrocket .
� We are being taxed out of our homes , � Eugene Rogers said .
� It �s too much to handle .
I don�t know if they just want to put up a chain - link fence around our property and say they own it now or what . �
Residents in symbolic gesture recreated the Boston Tea Party to show the town of Hampton they are not happy .
Instead of crates of tea they used Lipton tea bags , and instead of throwing them into Hampton Harbor , they just opened them up because they didn�t want to litter .
� They really hit us hard , � said Rogers , who came up with the idea for a tea party .
� If it was just a gradual increase every year , which they do anyways , it would be one thing , but this one hit is unbelievable . �
The tea party at the Route A1 bridge preceded a meeting at the Coffee Break Cafe , where roughly 30 residents showed up to voice their displeasure about the recent revaluation .
Residents say they are upset because property assessments went up as the housing market continues to collapse .
At the meeting the members gave themselves an official name , The Coalition for a Fair Assessment , and brainstormed ways they can get their message out and what they can do to fight what they say are unfair assessments .
Linda Gebhart , who was elected as president of the group , said the increases don�t make sense .
Her 75 - year - old beach cottage went up 35 percent in value , meaning a higher tax bill that will have to be paid .
� We want to be able to pass this cottage on to our two kids , � Gebhart said .
� We plan to retire here and I don�t know if we are going to be able to last that long .
� At this rate no one but the very rich will be able to live here , it seems the town has shifted the tax burden onto the beach property owners . �
Many in the group said they too were afraid they won�t be able to afford to live at the beach any longer .
� My land value more than doubled from $ 117,600 to $ 238,900 , � said Richard Perkins .
� I was stunned when I got my latest tax bill , � said Jeanne Lilienthal , who lives on J Street .
� My taxes went up over $ 1,000 .
In this economy , the sharp rise in assessed values is , quite frankly , unbelievable . �
The group discussed the possibility of hiring a lawyer for a class - action lawsuit and requesting an official meeting with the Board of Selectmen and Town Assessor Bob Estey .
They want to know the criteria used by Estey on how assessments were determined .
Estey has said one reason why the beach was hit hardest is because prior to the revaluation the beach was an estimated 65 percent of valuation , while the town was in the 85 percent range .
The revaluation , which is required to be done every five years , used home sales from the last two years to determine the new assessments .
One resident urged everyone at the meeting to file an abatement by the March 1 deadline to fight the increases .
Alicia Preston said they need to fight as a group or they will be ignored .
� We have to make it so they can not ignore us , � she said .
Preston�s mother , Judy , said the assessments were out of whack .
� My assessment went up to a third of a million dollars , � Judy Preston said .
� I couldn�t get a third of a million if my life depended on it .
Otherwise I would sell my house and move to Florida . �
Gebhart , who recently hired an appraiser to get a second opinion on her assessment , said the group plans to hold other meetings in the future .
Anyone interested in joining the group should call Gebhart at 929-3850 .

The following is Chapter 44 of The Irrepressible Rothbard .
How can anyone , finding himself surrounded by a rising tide of evil , fail to do his utmost to fight against it ?
In our century , we have been inundated by a flood of evil , in the form of collectivism , socialism , egalitarianism , and nihilism .
It has always been crystal clear to me that we have a compelling moral obligation , for the sake of ourselves , our loved ones , our posterity , our friends , our neighbors , and our country , to do battle against that evil .
It has therefore always been a mystery to me how people who have seen and identified this evil and have therefore entered the lists against it , either gradually or suddenly abandon that fight .
How can one see the truth , understand one ’s compelling duty , and then , simply give up and even go on to betray the cause and its comrades ?
And yet , in the two movements and their variations that I have been associated with , libertarian and conservative , this happens all the time .
Conservatism and libertarianism , after all , are “ radical ” movements , that is , they are radically and strongly opposed to existing trends of statism and immorality .
How , then , can someone who has joined such a movement , as an ideologue or activist or financial supporter , simply give up the fight ?
Recently , I asked a perceptive friend of mine how so - and - so could abandon the fight ?
He answered that “ he ’s the sort of person who wants a quiet life , who wants to sit in front of the TV , and who does n’t want to hear about any trouble . ”
But in that case , I said in anguish , “ why do these people become ‘ radicals ’ in the first place ?
Why do they proudly call themselves ‘ conservatives ’ or ‘ libertarians ’ ? ”
Unfortunately , no answer was forthcoming .
Sometimes , people give up the fight because , they say , the cause is hopeless .
We ’ve lost , they say .
Defeat is inevitable .
The great economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote in 1942 that socialism is inevitable , that capitalism is doomed not by its failures but by its very successes , which had given rise to a group of envious and malevolent intellectuals who would subvert and destroy capitalism from within .
His critics charged Schumpeter with counseling defeatism to the defenders of capitalism .
Schumpeter replied that if someone points out that a rowboat is inevitably sinking , is that the same thing as saying : do n’t do the best you can to bail out the boat ?
In the same vein , assume for a minute that the fight against the statist evil is a lost cause , why should that imply abandoning the battle ?
In the first place , as gloomy as things may look , the inevitable may be postponed a bit .
Why is n’t that worthwhile ?
Is n’t it better to lose in thirty years than to lose now ?
Second , at the very worst , it ’s great fun to tweak and annoy and upset the enemy , to get back at the monster .
This in itself is worthwhile .
One should n’t think of the process of fighting the enemy as dour gloom and misery .
On the contrary , it is highly inspiring and invigorating to take up arms against a sea of troubles instead of meeting them in supine surrender , and by opposing , perhaps to end them , and if not at least to give it a good try , to get in one ’s licks .
And finally , what the heck , if you fight the enemy , you might win !
Think of the brave fighters against Communism in Poland and the Soviet Union who never gave up , who fought on against seemingly impossible odds , and then , bingo , one day Communism collapsed .
Certainly the chances of winning are a lot greater if you put up a fight than if you simply give up .
In the conservative and libertarian movements there have been two major forms of surrender , of abandonment of the cause .
The most common and most glaringly obvious form is one we are all too familiar with : the sellout .
The young libertarian or conservative arrives in Washington , at some think - tank or in Congress or as an administrative aide , ready and eager to do battle , to roll back the State in service to his cherished radical cause .
And then something happens : sometimes gradually , sometimes with startling suddenness .
You go to some cocktail parties , you find that the Enemy seems very pleasant , you start getting enmeshed in Beltway marginalia , and pretty soon you are placing the highest importance on some trivial committee vote , or on some piddling little tax cut or amendment , and eventually you are willing to abandon the battle altogether for a cushy contract , or a plush government job .
And as this sellout process continues , you find that your major source of irritation is not the statist enemy , but the troublemakers out in the field who are always yapping about principle and even attacking you for selling out the cause .
And pretty soon you and The Enemy have an indistinguishable face .
We are all too familiar with this sellout route and it is easy and proper to become indignant at this moral treason to a cause that is just , to the battle against evil , and to your own once cherished comrades .
But there is another form of abandonment that is not as evident and is more insidious  and I do n’t mean simply loss of energy or interest .
In this form , which has been common in the libertarian movement but is also prevalent in sectors of conservatism , the militant decides that the cause is hopeless , and gives up by deciding to abandon the corrupt and rotten world , and retreat in some way to a pure and noble community of one ’s own .
To Randians , it ’s “ Galt ’s Gulch , ” from Rand ’s novel , Atlas Shrugged .
Other libertarians keep seeking to form some underground community , to “ capture ” a small town in the West , to go “ underground ” in the forest , or even to build a new libertarian country on an island , in the hills , or whatever .
Conservatives have their own forms of retreatism .
In each case , the call arises to abandon the wicked world , and to form some tiny alternative community in some backwoods retreat .
Long ago , I labeled this view , “ retreatism . ”
You could call this strategy “ neo - Amish , ” except that the Amish are productive farmers , and these groups , I ’m afraid , never make it up to that stage .
The rationale for retreatism always comes couched in High Moral as well as pseudo - psychological terms .
These “ purists , ” for example , claim that they , in contrast to us benighted fighters , are “ living liberty , ” that they are emphasizing “ the positive ” instead of focusing on the “ negative , ” that they are “ living liberty ” and living a “ pure libertarian life , ” whereas we grubby souls are still living in the corrupt and contaminated real world .
For years , I have been replying to these sets of retreatists that the real world , after all , is good ; that we libertarians may be anti-State , but that we are emphatically not anti-society or opposed to the real world , however contaminated it might be .
We propose to continue to fight to save the values and the principles and the people we hold dear , even though the battlefield may get muddy .
Also , I would cite the great libertarian Randolph Bourne , who proclaimed that we are American patriots , not in the sense of patriotic adherents to the State but to the country , the nation , to our glorious traditions and culture that are under dire attack .
Our stance should be , in the famous words of Dos Passos , even though he said them as a Marxist , “ all right , we are two nations . ” “ America ” as it exists today is two nations ; one is their nation , the nation of the corrupt enemy , of their Washington , D.C. , their brainwashing public school system , their bureaucracies , their media , and the other is our , much larger , nation , the majority , the far nobler nation that represents the older and the truer America .
We are the nation that is going to win , that is going to take America back , no matter how long it takes .
It is indeed a grave sin to abandon that nation and that America short of victory .
But are we then emphasizing “ the negative ” ?
In a sense , yes , but what else are we to stress when our values , our principles , our very being are under attack from a relentless foe ?
But we have to realize , first , that in the very course of accentuating the negative we are also emphasizing the positive .
Why do we fight against , yes even hate , the evil ?
Only because we love the good , and our stress on the “ negative ” is only the other side of the coin , the logical consequence , of our devotion to the good , to the positive values and principles that we cherish .
There is no reason why we ca n’t stress and spread our positive values at the same time that we battle against their enemies .
The two actually go hand in hand .
Among conservatives and some libertarians , these retreats sometimes took the form of holing up in the woods or in a cave , huddling amidst a year ’s supply of canned peaches and guns and ammo , waiting resolutely to guard the peaches and the cave from the nuclear explosion or from the Communist army .
They never came ; and even the cans of peaches must be deteriorating by now .
The retreat was futile .
But now , in 1993 , the opposite danger is looming : namely , retreatist groups face the awful menace of being burned out and massacred by the intrepid forces of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms in their endless quest for shotguns one millimeter shorter than some regulation decrees , or for possible child abuse .
Retreatism is beginning to loom as a quick road to disaster .
Of course , in the last analysis , none of these retreats , generally announced with great fanfare as the way to purity if not victory , have amounted to a hill of beans ; they are simply a rationale , a half - way house , to total abandonment of the cause , and to disappearance from the stage of history .
The fascinating and crucial point to note is that both of these routes  even though seemingly diametrically opposite , end up inexorably at the same place .
The sellout abandons the cause and betrays his comrades , for money or status or power ; the retreatist , properly loathing the sellouts , concludes that the real world is impure and retreats out of it ; in both cases , whether in the name of “ pragmatism ” or in the name of “ purity , ” the cause , the fight against evil in the real world , is abandoned .
Clearly , there is a vast moral difference in the two courses of action .
The sellouter is morally evil ; the retreatist , in contrast , is , to put it kindly , terribly misguided .
The sellouts are not worth talking to ; the retreatists must realize that it is not betraying the cause , far from it , to fight against evil ; and not to abandon the real world .
The retreatist becomes indifferent to power and oppression , likes to relax and say who cares about material oppression when the inner soul is free .
Well sure , it ’s good to have freedom of the inner soul .
I know the old bromides about how thought is free and how the prisoner is free in his inner heart .
But call me a low - life materialist if you wish , but I believe , and I thought all libertarians and conservatives believed to their core , that man deserves more than that , that we are not content with the inner freedom of the prisoner in his cell , that we raise the good old cry of “ Liberty and Property , ” that we demand liberty in our external , real world of space and dimension .
I thought that that ’s what the fight was all about .
Let ’s put it this way : we must not abandon our lives , our properties , our America , the real world , to the barbarians .
Never .
Let us act in the spirit of that magnificent hymn that James Russell Lowell set to a lovely Welsh melody :
Once to every man and nation Comes the moment to decide ,
In the strife of truth with falsehood , For the good or evil side ;
Some great cause , God ’s new Messiah , Offering each the bloom or blight , And the choice goes by forever Twixt that darkness and that light .
Though the cause of evil prosper , Yet ’tis truth alone is strong ;
Though her portion be the scaffold , And upon the throne be wrong , Yet that scaffold sways the future , And , behind the dim unknown , Standeth God within the shadow Keeping watch above His own .

According to Wikipedia , it was the work of 4 chan activity , and the HTML numeric character reference for the symbol had been posted on / b/ , requesting readers to perform a Google search for the string .
Looks like something similar might have happened this morning .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
This year one of the best performing asset classes is cash .
People used to boast about hot stocks they owned .
Now they crow about how much of their money is in cash .
Those holding cash have been richly rewarded with no losses and opportunities to buy assets ( condos and equities ) at huge discounts .
As prices continue to decline , those that moved too quickly to buy at the bottom are seen as fools .
Consider the massive losses of the sovereign wealth funds , Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % and Countrywide , and even Warren Buffett 's latest foray into General Electric GE , - 1.29 % and Goldman Sachs GS , - 1.14 % .
Investors , convinced that prices will continue to decline , sit with their liquid resources on the sidelines .
As that investment demand takes a holiday , prices will decline further .
This phenomenon is well understood .
In the 1930s , it was called the liquidity trap .
People took their money out of the bank and literally buried in the backyard or stuck it under a mattress .
When that happened , the money supply contracted another notch and the lack of transactions cut into the velocity of money .
As the supply of money and bank reserves dried up , credit availability declined and asset prices fell yet again .
Today , because of FDIC insurance it is not the households that lack trust in the banking system but , rather , the bankers themselves .
Even with fed funds at 1 % , the lending rate among banks ( LIBOR ) until recently was stuck above 4 % .
Even now with four week LIBOR down to 1.21 % it is 100 basis points above Treasurys .
Incredibly , the four - week bill is yielding one lonely basis point .
We saw the same effect in Japan in the 1990s , when their banks were clogged with bad loans and were unwilling to lend despite funding costs at zero-percent .
The largest banks instituted strategies to refuse additional institutional deposits because they had no loans they wanted to make .
It took more than a decade for a modicum of liquidity and transactional velocity to return to the Japanese economy .
We can hope that our leaders today would benefit from the experience of the 1930s .
Some of the mistakes made during that era have been carefully chronicled as extending and deepening the crisis .
Chief among them were higher marginal tax rates , increases in import tariffs and a lack of international coordination producing round after round of competitive currency devaluations .
Unfortunately , the history is still too fresh to have a completely rational perspective and the debate now raging among economists is being filtered through a political lens that has as its focal point the historical standing of Franklin D. Roosevelt .
The editorial exchanges between Paul Krugman and others found him stretching to defend a political ideology which had little to do with economics .
Before we get to far a field , the data show that the Depression as measured by economic activity and unemployment got slightly better , then worse , then stabilized at a very low level compared to the 1920s .
The one thing perhaps all can agree on is that the true end of the Great Depression did not occur until after the start of World War II .
Employing millions of men in the activity of destroying most of the economically productive assets on the planet was , after all , an obvious solution .
At once demand was created with all those new jobs and supply was severely constricted .
Naturally prices began to rise ( rapidly after the war ) and the deflationary spiral was broken .
To be sure , global conflagration is not a policy direction anyone would endorse no matter what the effectiveness .
Learning from the New Deal
So why did n't the New Deal produce the desired results ?
One concept now gaining a following is the crowding out effect of government intervention in large areas of economic activity .
As new projects were created under government control , the productive assets got sucked out of private hands .
The government could pay higher wages and command lower materials costs essentially pushing any hope of private sector competition aside .
To enhance their commanding position , laws were passed to favor the government entities over private business .
As an example , suppose the Big Three of Detroit are nationalized .
How long would it take some enterprising congressman to introduce legislation making it more difficult for Toyota TM , - 1.29 % , Honda HMC , - 1.18 % and Nissan NSANY , +2.27 % to compete ?
To use a catchphrase we hear all too frequently these days , they would do it to " protect the taxpayers ' interests . "
Soon cars would be more expensive and quality would decline .
Jobs would vanish as foreign manufacturers moved to other more friendly markets .
Finally , the shrinking private sector would be unable to cope with the ever increasing tax burden needed to pay for the expenditures required by more government intervention .
If you want a small example of what happened in the New Deal consider the recent distortions in our mortgage market delivered by Fannie Mae FNM , and Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.49 % .
The bigger worry is the case of Japan , where for more than a decade they followed every policy prescription western economists could devise .
The failure of these measures is often attributed to their lack of intestinal fortitude in dealing with a banking sector awash in bad loans .
Pretending bad loans were solid did not increase trust in the banks or increase their propensity to lend .
Now , we also are hearing policy ideas intended to " keep people in their homes " .
A bad mortgage loan will not become a good loan even with some government edict .
In fact , the edict will ruin the market 's ability to make loans to creditworthy borrowers because they will never know when the government will allow them to enforce their legal rights to the collateral .
A sort of Gresham 's law of lending will ensue with the bad quality lender crowding out the good quality private lender .
The disturbing bottom line is we do n't really understanding what happened in Japan .
There appears to be a consensus that the economy was over - levered from households to corporations to government - sponsored entities .
Leverage as measured by total debt to GDP grew from 140 % 30 years ago to over 220 % today .
If that defines the problem then the solution should be a de-leveraging over the next thirty years .
That de-leveraging will cause prices to fall dramatically as the credit supply shrinks , money supply falls and velocity slows .
The policy agenda currently in vogue is to maintain the leverage and the asset prices by shifting all that debt from the private sector to the public .
Why are we doing this ?
Because the near - term political heat from a deep recession and re-pricing of assets is more than any of our leaders can handle .
Eventually that massive intervention and concomitant increase in the money supply will come with a hefty price tag .
Anna Swartz , co-author with Milton Friedman of " A Monetary History of the United States , " addressed that question in a recent Barron 's interview .
She speculated that the deflationary impact of collapsing credit will be offset by the inflationary momentum of liquidity currently flooding in from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury .
Pulling off that balancing act would be the central banking tour de force of the modern era .
We wonder if working that delicate arrangement is n't perhaps riskier than simply allowing the short and harsh brutality of the market to work its wonders of creative destruction .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
An elderly woman has been living with two skeletons and a badly decomposed body of her siblings in a suburb of Chicago , one of whom may have died at least 20 years ago , authorities said on Saturday .
The remains were found covered by sheets in various parts of the house in Evanston on Friday but no foul play was suspected .
Authorities said one of the siblings was last seen alive in the 1980s , the second in 2003 and the third in May .
The woman living in the house , described as “ upwards of 90 years of age , ” was cooperating in the investigation and was taken to a facility for care .
Authorities , who did not release the names of the deceased , said a care worker had alerted them to the situation .
Autopsies were due to be performed on Saturday .
LED Lights : The Next Big Thing in Wireless Technology ?
October 8th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
LED lights are more than an energy - efficient lighting alternative — they ’re also a potential Wi-Fi replacement technology .
Researcher at Boston University are working on Smart Lighting , a wireless technology based on visible light instead of radio frequency .
Data is transferred through the Smart Lighting system with LED light , so each light is essentially a Wi -Fi hotspot .
Initial speeds of the network will be about 1 to 10 megabits per second , and data transmission will occur over existing electrical wiring .
And since LED bulbs are energy efficient , an LED wireless network will also be efficient — significantly more so than a radio frequency - based network .
Additionally , since light does n’t travel through walls or other opaque objects , chances of eavesdropping are lowered .
BU ’s technology is still in the prototype stage , but it could potentially rival radio frequency networks for wireless dominance .

[ Python - Dev ]
The endless GIL debate : why not remove thread support instead ?
Last month there was a discussion on Python - Dev regarding removal of reference counting to remove the GIL .
I hope you forgive me for continuing the debate .
I think reference counting is a good feature .
It prevents huge piles of garbage from building up .
It makes the interpreter run more smoothly .
It is not just important for games and multimedia applications , but also servers under high load .
Python does not pause to look for garbage like Java or .
NET .
It only pauses to look for dead reference cycles .
This can be safely turned off temporarily ; it can be turned off completely if you do not create reference cycles .
With Java and .NET , no garbage is ever reclaimed except by the intermittent garbage collection .
Python always reclaims an object when the reference count drops to zero  whether the GC is enabled or not .
This makes Python programs well - behaved .
For this reason , I think removing reference counting is a genuinely bad idea .
Even if the GIL is evil , this remedy is even worse .
I am not a Python core developer ; I am a research scientist who use Python because Matlab is ( or used to be ) a bad programming language , albeit a good computing environment .
As most people who have worked with scientific computing know , there are better paradigms for concurrency than threads .
In particular , there are message - passing systems like MPI and Erlang , and there are autovectorizing compilers for OpenMP and Fortran 90/95 .
There are special LAPACK , BLAS and FFT libraries for parallel computer architectures .
There are fork - join systems like cilk and java.util.concurrent .
Threads seem to be used only because mediocre programmers do n't know what else to use .
I genuinely think the use of threads should be discouraged .
It leads to code that are full of bugs and difficult to maintain - race conditions , deadlocks , and livelocks are common pitfalls .
Very few developers are capable of implementing efficient load - balancing by hand .
Multi - threaded programs tend to scale badly because they are badly written .
If the GIL discourages the abuse of threads , it serves a purpose albeit being evil like the Linux kernel 's BKL .
Python could be better off doing what tcl does .
Allow each process to embed multiple interpreters ; run each interpreter in its own thread .
Implement a fast message - passing system between the interpreters ( e.g. copy - on - write by making communicated objects immutable ) , and Python would be closer to Erlang than Java .
I thus think the main offender is the thread and threading modules - not the GIL .
Without thread support in the interpreter , there would be no threads .
Without threads , there would be no need for a GIL .
Both sources of evil can be removed by just removing thread support from the Python interpreter .
In addition , it would make Python faster at executing linear code .
Just copy the concurrency model of Erlang instead of Java and get rid of those nasty threads .
In the meanwhile , I 'll continue to experiment with multiprocessing .
Removing reference counting to encourage the use of threads is like shooting ourselves in the leg twice .
That s my two cents on this issue .
There is another issue to note as well :
If you can endure a 200 x loss of efficacy by using Python instead of Fortran , scalability on dual or quad - core processors may not be that important .
Just move the bottlenecks out of Python and you are much better off .

An FBI agent ’s claim that Omar Khadr had seen Maher Arar at terrorist “ safe houses ” in Afghanistan was severely undermined today when a military court was told that Arar was in North America during the time in question .
FBI Special Agent Robert Fuller testified Monday that Khadr said he recognized a photo of Arar during an October 2002 interrogation .
Under questioning Tuesday , Fuller said Khadr saw Arar in Afghanistan during late September or October 2001 .
A Canadian judicial inquiry determined in 2006 that Arar was working in San Diego on a business trip on the day of the 9/11 terror attacks — and back in Canada in October .
In fact , Arar first drew the interest of the RCMP when he met another man they were watching in an Ottawa cafe Oct. 12 , 2001 .
The FBI claim has drawn ire in Canada and in Ottawa Tuesday Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said the government has not been shaken from its belief that Arar is an innocent man .
Arar has denied ever being in Afghanistan .
Fuller ’s evidence was further undercut by revelations that the FBI notes taken during the interrogation stated Khadr was shown a photograph of Arar and at first said he “ looked familiar . ”
The notes recorded that “ in time ” Khadr stated “ he felt he had seen ” Arar .
Tuesday ’s pre-trial hearing was cut short after only two hours so Guantanamo ’s military personnel could watch the televised swearing in of their new commander - in - chief .
Photos of former president George W. Bush on the U.S. naval base were replaced with framed pictures of Barack Obama shortly after his inauguration .
That ’s not all that ’s expected to change .
Obama has vowed to shut Guantanamo ’s prison and there ’s speculation he will halt the military trials where Khadr is charged with killing a U.S. soldier and four war crimes .
Khadr ’s lawyers had tried repeatedly to have this week ’s hearing delayed so as not to end on the government ’s evidence if Obama stops the trial .
Cannon stood by the results of the Canadian inquiry in which Justice Dennis O’Connor concluded Arar was a wronged man .
“ Justice O’Connor did a fulsome report ... ( and ) the government acknowledged and accepted its recommendations , ” Cannon told the Star .
Arar was awarded $ 10.5 million in compensation and an apology from Prime Minister Stephen Harper following the federal inquiry that revealed the RCMP had passed erroneous information connecting Arar to terrorism to their U.S. counterparts .
NDP critic Joe Comartin said the security and intelligence agencies involved in the Arar and Khadr cases continually “ try and cover themselves even when the evidence is overwhelmingly the other way .
If you told a story once , you have to keep telling it . ”
Arar himself declined requests Tuesday for comment .
Kerry Pither , Arar ’s former spokesperson , and the author of Dark Days about the arrest and torture of Arar and three other Canadians in Syria , condemned the FBI for “ gratuitously smearing ” Arar in the final days of the Bush administration .
“ Who benefits from this ?
The people and the officials who benefit are those who are implicated in Maher Arar ’s rendition and torture in Syria , and that includes the FBI , the CIA , CSIS and the RCMP . ”
Paul Cavalluzzo , the commission counsel to Justice O’Connor , noted that the report concluded there was no evidence Arar was engaged in terrorist activity .
Cavalluzzo said that “ given what ’s happening at Guantanamo Bay , it would n’t surprise me if it was a product of torture , which means that it ’s meaningless and useless information . ”
Navy Lt. - Cmdr .
Billl Kuebler , Khadr ’s Pentagon - appointed lawyer said Tuesday outside court that Khadr , who was 15 and gravely injured when he arrived at the U.S. base in Bagram , would have “ confessed to seeing the Pope , ” to make his interrogations stop .
Military interrogators questioned Khadr more than 40 times at Bagram before FBI agent Fuller questioned him .
Some of those Bagram interrogators were later convicted for the death of an innocent Afghan taxi driver .
The timing of Khadr ’s interrogation with Fuller is also revealing .
Arar was arrested at JFK airport in late September 2002 en route back to Canada from a family holiday and held for two weeks before being rendered to Syria Oct. 8 - one day after Khadr ’s interrogation began .
Khadr , now 22 , was scheduled to go on trial Monday but Army Col.
Patrick Parrish , the military judge presiding over the case , said he would set a new date because pre-trial hearings would not be completed by Friday .
Parrish said the case resumes Wednesday morning unless he is “ otherwise ordered . ”

AFTER all the trouble in the economy , no one needs to persuade me of the importance of saving money for a rainy day .
What is hard is actually doing it .
The standard advice is to save three to six months ’ worth of living expenses  which sounds wise .
But really , how are you supposed to salt away that much cash , given all the other demands on your income ?
Saving is a deceptively difficult task for many people ( born savers , I salute you ! ) .
Actually saving some money  let alone the thousands you might need to weather a crisis  results from a chain of habits and choices that does not , for many people , come naturally .
You may know that your job is at risk , or that your nest egg would not last you a week  and you really ought to start saving right now .
But as with many other acts of self - discipline , “ we have great intentions , but our follow - through is abysmal , ” said David Laibson , professor of economics at Harvard , whose primary focus is people ’s saving behavior , particularly retirement .

Federal Reserve Study Paper # 666
On October 23 , 2008 the research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis issued an important paper .
Its title is " Facts and Myths about the Financial Crisis of 2008 . "
The authors of this paper do not dispute that the United States is going through a financial crisis as witnessed by major financial institutions having failed and the fact that various stock markets have fallen dramatically .
They strongly disagree , however , with the most widely voiced claims about the nature of the crisis and the extent to which the problems of the financial sector are spilling over to the rest of the economy .
Four primary claims have been made about the current crisis by financial institutions themselves , public policymakers and the financial press , as follows :
Bank lending to nonfinancial corporations and to individuals have declined sharply .
Interbank lending is essentially nonexistent .
Commercial paper issuance by nonfinancial corporations has declined sharply and rates have risen to unprecedented levels .
Banks play a large role in channeling funds from savers to borrowers .
Using data from the Federal Reserve Board itself through October 8 , 2008 the authors of this myth shattering paper vigorously dispute all four of these claims .
They show that aggregate bank credit has not declined during the financial crisis and , in fact , that total bank credit available actually increased in September of 2008 .
Along the same lines , the paper shows that loans and leases made by U.S. commercial banks have not declined during the financial crisis nor have commercial and industrial loans to nonfinancial businesses .
Finally , data for consumer loans highlighted in the paper show no evidence that the financial crisis has affected consumer lending .
All of the figures cited prove that the first claim about the impact of the financial crisis — bank lending of all kinds has declined sharply — is false .
Data found in the paper regarding interbank loans by all U.S. commercial banks demonstrate that " at least in the aggregate " interbank lending is healthy and has not been adversely affected by the financial crisis .
Thus , the second claim made about its impact is false on its face .
With respect to the commercial paper market , the authors point to data that shows that such issues by financial institutions have declined , mostly because huge increases in customer deposits have lessened the needs of banks to raise money in this way .
On the other hand , commercial paper issued by nonfinancial institutions has been essentially unchanged during the financial crisis .
Also , the authors maintain that interest rates on commercial paper have " barely budged . "
The third claim about the financial crisis — that the commercial paper market has dried up and the interest rates on such issues have risen dramatically — is a myth , to put a kind face on the nature of these claims .
Finally , the paper explores the nature of bank lending to nonfinancial corporate businesses and concludes that such lending does not constitute the bulk of borrowing of these businesses .
In the second quarter of 2008 direct bank lending to businesses totaled $ 1 trillion .
Funds obtained by nonfinancial corporate businesses through the issuance of public corporate bonds , however , is currently four times as great ( at $ 4.5 trillion ) as the total from direct bank lending to these companies .
Obviously , banks do not play the most major role in channeling capital to businesses and the fourth claim about the nature of the current financial crisis is proven to be false by this paper .
The authors also discuss the abnormally high spread between Treasury bill interest rates and those of short - term corporate debt issues .
Since — as we have seen — the latter interest rates have remained stable , the spread is due to the historically low rates currently being paid on treasury bills .
If one compares , on the other hand , interest rates paid on investment - grade corporate bonds to those paid on Treasury bonds of similar maturities , the spreads between them has remained at historic norms throughout the financial crisis .
Once the current panic over short - term interest rate spreads and so forth subsides , Treasury bill interest rates can be expected to rise to more normal levels .
So , if the major claims about the impact of our country 's financial crisis are myths and / or lies , why all the panic ?
Do the financial institutions most affected by the crisis ( i.e. , investment banking firms and those commercial banks truly in trouble ) , public policymakers and the financial press not know the facts or have they deliberately kept them from the American people ?
Have we been stampeded into the Panic of 2008 and , if so , why ?
Will some benefit much , much more than others of us from this stampeding ?

" This is not going to be easy .
This is not work for the faint of heart .
This is going to take sacrifice all around the table , " said DFL House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher .
She was joined by Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller , left , and House Majority Leader Tony Sertich .

Four days into December , state finance officials finally delivered their November economic forecast .
Tom Hanson , commissioner of the Department of Management and Budget , presented the gloomy financial assessment that had been predicted for weeks .
" The economy , as is no secret to everyone , has body - slammed our state budget , " said Hanson .
[ image ]
Hanson says Minnesota is not alone .
He knows of 41 other states facing similar red ink .
The current two - year budget cycle began 18 months ago , with state spending and revenues appearing to be balanced through 2011 .
But spending has been higher than expected , especially for health care .
At the same time , revenues from all tax sources have declined .
With the housing market sagging , consumers not spending and jobs disappearing , state economist Tom Stinson described the economy as " just plain ugly . "
" This will be the worst economy in 25 years .
It could be the worst economy since World War II .
It 's certainly going to be the worst in most Minnesotans ' recent memory , " said Stinson .
In dollars , the deficit is the biggest the state has ever faced .
But Stinson says shortfalls in the early 1980s represented a bigger share of the state budget .
Gov. Tim Pawlenty said Thursday he remains opposed to raising taxes to close the state 's $ 4.27 billion budget shortfall .

State lawmakers say they 'll begin working immediately to solve the the $ 426 million hole in the current budget year , which ends on June 30 , 2009 .
Part of that solution could include the $ 155 million currently in the state budget reserve .
Work on the projected $ 4.8 billion deficit will dominate the 2009 Legislative session , which begins Jan . 6 .
Gov. Pawlenty says Minnesota has overcome tough times before , and he 's confident it will again .
" This is no doubt a big challenge , but it's also a big opportunity for reform , to streamline government and to change the way that state government delivers services in a way that 's better and more efficient , " said Pawlenty .
" And we 're going to do that without adding additional burdens to the hardworking families and taxpayers of Minnesota , by making sure we do n't raise taxes as part of this process . "
Pawlenty says there would be no deficit if state government simply lived within existing revenues .
Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Tom Hanson said the state 's budget has been " body - slammed " by the poor economy .

The Republican governor says he 'll present a budget proposal in late January that does n't spend any more than the $ 32 billion in revenue that 's expected in the next two years .
That 's some $ 2 billion less than what the state will have spent by the end of the current biennium .
Pawlenty says his proposal will prioritize military and veterans affairs , public safety and K - 12 education .
Democrats in the House and Senate say they plan to set priorities too , and like the governor , they plan to build a new spending plan from the ground up .
DFL leaders blame the deficit in large part on lost jobs .
And one of their targets for reform is the state agency that oversees job creation and economic development .
DFL House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher says the state needs to work its way back to prosperity .
She 's also not ruling out tax increases .
" We plan on weathering this storm together .
We plan on working with the governor as well , " said Kelliher .
" And we know that through that , we can actually make a better Minnesota . "
Kelliher and DFL Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller are scheduled to meet with the governor for a breakfast meeting Friday morning to begin working on a solution to the current budget shortfall of $ 426 million .
House and Senate budget committees will also meet soon to discuss the potential cuts .
If an agreement with legislators cannot be reached by next month , Gov. Pawlenty has said he will use his own emergency budget cutting authority to make the necessary spending cuts .
The Hotel Royal haikyo is the grand - daddy of all love hotels , streaking 7 empty stories up into the big blue sky , a giant vermillion flag on the lakeshore calling out to all and sundry in a mega - watt alto - ‘ Need some discreet time alone with your loved one ?
Come on down !’
I couldn`t find out any historical information about this haikyo , and I doubt there is anything much to be found .
It probably went up in the last 10 years , came down in the last 5 , and for the most part passed unremarked in the life of the area .
It just seems like a bad idea , for several reasons .
First off , it`s basically a classy love hotel , across 7 floors with around 35 rooms of varying sizes , all of them decorated in a unique manner - some of them a bit wacky , most fairly plain .
It`s in a quiet area , on a road far from the nearest train station , overlooking a peaceful lake .
So who was the target audience ?
Young people looking to sow their wild oats in private would unlikely have access to a car , so we can rule most of them out .
Couples trying to get away from the kids would be going out of their way to come here , so why not then have a properly classy time in a ryokan , where they could still do any of the deeds a love hotel is famous for .
That leaves a third class - married men and women on surreptitious affairs , looking for an out of the way place where they wouldn`t be seen conducting their illicit liaisons .
And how many of them could there be ?
Obviously not enough .
Add to all that - the idea is just tawdry , like Las Vegas without the limbo- ish in - between location or any of the relaxed local laws .
I went to this haikyo with my buddy Geoff - the first time for him , and now the last , since he ’s going back to the USA in a week or so .
Ah , what a transient place Japan is .
The Love Hotels go up and come down , and friends come and go .
There are two types of haikyo really - the old ones and the new ones .
The old ones may be anything abandoned for longer than 20 or so years , the new ones for less .
They have very different charms - with the old ones you get the creative destruction of Nature rippling through the fabric , but not so much of the just - lived - in feel of the newer ones .
But - that feel from the new ones is often not that interesting , because the people in question are only distanced from us by a short time .
So , I like the old ones better .
As for this place - it could almost have been closed just a few days ago , for all the chance nature has had to get in .
First off , as is my usual style , we cased the place thoroughly front and back .
Out back there were steps down to a utilities / generator room , which was filled with pipes and engines more tired and overwrought than any other part of the structure .
Were they perhaps overclocking ?
Back up the steps and behind the kitchen were a bunch of old arcade machines , and these tarred gloves , left to ‘ dry ’ on a rusted shelving unit .
Entering the place was remarkably easy , all the doors were open , so we breezed right in .
The kitchen was just a junked up kitchen , stuff lying all over the place .
Through the door and down the hall was the lobby - pitch black inside .
This is how you choose your room in a Love Hotel - there ’s a whole board of these photos of each room .
You choose the one you like - then tell it to the attendant , who is in a walled - off booth with normally only their hands showing .
Discreet .
Of course we went to 701 , though it was less impressive without the LED rings lit up .
We went on to the second floor , me snapping photos , Geoff pausing to examine the remainders of life to backwards - engineer the hotel ’s last few moments .
At an ash - tray : Look at this , 3 butts , all facing different angles - looks like 3 different people , maybe the same 3 who had the final 3 drinks in the lobby ?
In a room filled with porn and bits of food : Look at the date on this cheese receipt , only 2 years ago , you think it was closed then , or this was from a homeless person ?
It was weird how the place had been neither overtaken by Nature nor yet vandalized .
A few rooms had had fire extinguishers let off in them , and one or two had broken windows , but for the most part every room looked like it must have the day the place closed down .
Not a wreck , just bed sheets slightly rumpled , bits of trash in the trash cans .
Between the first and second floors was a cool fire - safety chute .
Geoff climbed up it halfway , then came back down and we just took the stairs - we only had one flashlight and it was pitch black inside .
In the corner room on each floor the bathroom was illuminated with a bright blue light .
The top floor was a big function area , maybe 2 large dining rooms with their own kitchen .
Now a bunch of junk was lying around - video cassettes , books , manga , TV’s .
We could n’t get onto the roof , the way was blocked by a solid metal door , but out the side of the top floor kitchen there was a mini balcony , and I could get this shot of one of the regal R’s :
And that was it , really .
Geoff and I walked the long way to the next station in the gathering dark , having a good final chat about real and heavy stuff .
There was another haikyo I wanted to see nearby - Sun Hills - but it was far too dark , and would have to wait for a second trip out .

Using PuTTY ( the best Windows SSH client going ) and Xming ( a free X Window server for Windows ) enables you to log in from a Windows box to your Unix box , and then run an X session remotely .
There are other ways of doing this as well ( e.g. , Cygwin / X ) , but this one is both neat and straightforward .
Combine the Win SSH client PuTTY with the Win server Xming and you have an easy way to log in from a Windows box to a Unix box to run an X session remotely .
Install Xming from the website above  it's a quick download and easy install .
You 'll need PuTTY as well , if for some reason you do n't already have it .
Once Xming is installed , the quickest way to get going is to use the XLaunch wizard .
Choose the " start a program " option , after which you can give the program you want to run ( xterm is the most flexible option , as from an xterm you can launch other graphical programs ) .
Click " Run Remote " to connect to a remote machine and run the xterm on that :
You must select the " Using PuTTY " option , and then fill in the hostname and your login details .
You should n't need to pass any other parameters in ( as per the next screen ) with a standard connection .
Hit Finish , and your connection should start .
You now have graphical access to your remote Linux box .
Be warned  things may run very sluggishly , depending on the speed of your connection .
You can choose to use compression during the XLaunch wizard , which may speed things up a little .
This is just the easy start option 
Xming is capable of many more complicated things as well .

Marriage Equality U.S.A has a report out that says , in the wee voice of a child , “ Prop. 8 Hurt My Family , Ask Me How ” that will probably get your blood boiling .
We get mad about having our rights away , but we forget how hard this must be for gay parents and their kids .
But with stories about how “ My six - year old , the day after we lost Prop 8 , asked me , with tears running down his face , if we were still a family ” , the report brings home [ literally ] , the sort of real - life damage Prop. 8 is doing , covering the individual stories of over 1,200 people .
According to the report , ( which you can download here ) Prop.
8 ’s social effects are :
The Sexual Life of Savages
In the early 1900s , anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski did his field work in the Trobriand Islands of the Western Pacific .
After getting himself ashore , he dropped himself into their culture and begun having to learn their language and understand their customs .
The result were a series of groundbreaking books in the field of anthropology , much of which is still entertaining to read today .
In The Sexual Life of Savages ( savages , Malinowski assures us , is a technical term and not meant to cause offense ) he describes the customs of Trobriand ’s intimate life , which is fascinating both for how it is different and how it is the same .
To a certain degree , it seems like the culture of the islanders presages our own .
Back when Malinowski was doing his field work , he was amazed that islanders could freely have premarital sex and yet still found it desirable to get married .
The same question would prove no puzzle to any American today .
And , indeed , the islanders seem like a case study in the ultimate consequences of the sexual revolution : girls want sex just as much as guys , kids start having sex at a very young age — 6 - 8 for the girls and 10 - 12 for the guys — with no social stigma , there are few customs about dating to inhibit “ hooking up ” , and , of course , revealing clothing has been taken to its limit , with girls actually going topless .
Of course , much of the story of a Trobriand ’s intimate life is the same : initial attractions budding into lasting relationships , etc .
And then , out of nowhere , Malinowski drops in something totally bizarre .
The islanders do n’t kiss , he explains .
Instead , they scratch .
The girls scratch the guys so hard that they draw blood and , if the guys can withstand the pain , then they move forward to having sex .
The ethnographer ( as Malinowski calls himself ) verified this by noting that just about everyone on the island had noticeable scratches .
And while everybody is having sex whenever they want , premarital meal - sharing is a big no - no .
You ’re not supposed to go out for dinner together until after you get married .
But the most fascinating and strange part about the islanders are their beliefs on the subject of pregnancy , also described in Malinowski ’s classic article “ Baloma : The Spirits of the Dead in the Trobriand Islands ” .
When people die , you see , their spirit takes a canoe to the island of Tuma , which works very much like the normal island except everybody is a spirit of the dead .
When the spirit gets old and wrinkled it shrugs off its skin and turns back into an embryo , which a spirit then takes back to the island and inserts into a woman .
This , you see , is how women get pregnant .
That ’s right .
The islanders do not believe that sex causes pregnancy .
They do n’t believe in physiological fatherhood .
Malinowski was incredibly skeptical about this , so he tried all sorts of ways to see if this was simply a story they told , while they actually the real deal .
But no , they assured him that it was really true , that all the white people who insisted otherwise were being silly , that the spirits caused pregnancy , not sex .
They argued the case quite logically .
After all , they noted , one fellow went on an expedition for a year or two and when he came back , he had a new son .
He obviously was n’t having sex with her while he was away , so where did the kid come from ?
( Cough . )
And , they note , there are some really hideous people on the island who nobody would dare have sex with , yet they manage to become pregnant .
( Malinowski spies some kids looking sheepish when this subject is raised . )
They also argue the other way : people on the island are having sex all the time from a very early age and yet they very rarely get pregnant .
( Naturally , the islanders do n’t practice any form of contraception ; the very idea does n’t make sense when sex does n’t cause pregnancy . )
The white man ’s argument just does n’t make sense .
Indeed , recent visitors report , the islanders still believe that sex does n’t cause pregnancy , despite the best efforts of health workers .
It is speculated that the yams that form the basis of the island diet have a contraceptive agent in them ( The Pill was originally made by looking at chemicals in wild yams ) , which conveniently explains quite a bit , including the low birthrate despite the high level of sexual activity .
Indeed , the whole idea lends quite a bit of support to the idea that material factors shape culture — after all , our own sexual revolution did n’t happen until we got the yam ’s chemicals in pill form in 1960 .
The notion has some other interesting consequences .
For example , the society is necessarily matrilineal , since fathers have no technical lineage .
Yet sociological fathers ( the mother ’s husband ) , Malinowski notes , show more love and care for their children than most he ’s seen in Europe .
Furthermore , they believe the same rules apply to the rest of the animal kingdom .
This is what clinches it for Malinowski — despite all the effort they go to to raise pigs , they insist that pigs also reproduce asexually .
They never attempt to breed pigs ; indeed , they castrate all the male pigs they have .
( To them this is further proof — we castrated all the pigs and yet they keep having children !
Malinowski notes that the domestic pigs often sneak off to canoodle with those in the wild . )
When I told a friend of mine about this odd state of affairs , he wondered if the islanders were just stupid .
After all , he noted , sex and childbirth are n’t exactly two physically unconnected human activities .
But as he reflected on it further , he considered that this belief was n’t that much different from what passes for religion in our country .
Smart people believe strange things .

Montanans are notorious ticket - splitters and this year was no exception .
Starting from the top ….. my prediction for Obama taking the state was a bit ambitious .
President - elect Obama won 47.1 % of the state ’s vote , however , making him the recipient of the most statewide Democratic votes in a Presidential contest since LBJ .
Given the nearly 20 - point victory of George W. Bush over both John Kerry and Al Gore in the last two Presidential races , I ’d say Obama ’s hard work in the state left a strong impression on voters .
Thank you Barack !!
Many Montanans who did n’t vote for Obama still voted for statewide Democrats , signaling a readiness for a more progressive agenda in the state .
For starters , Governor Brian Schweitzer and Senator Max Baucus were both decisively re-elected .
Narrow Democratic victories awarded Democrats Linda McCulloch the position of Secretary of State and Steve Bullock that of Attorney General .
The new Superintendent of Schools , Denise Juneau , made history as the first American Indian woman to win an executive statewide office .
True to her Democratic priorities , Monica Lindeen won State Auditor on a platform of state health care expansion .
Additionally , Democrats gained 2 additional seats on the Public Service Commission and now control all 5 seats on the state Land Board .
Hooray !!
So where ’s the split , you ask ?
Even with the seeming progressive mandate implied by these strong Democratic victories , Montana Democrats lost major seats in the state Legislature .
Republicans won a 27 - 23 majority in the state Senate , unraveling the Democratic majority held for the last four years .
Losses in the state house have ended the Democrats ' majority there , as well ; the split is now 50 - 50 .
Republicans have been vocal about what their victory means for the state :
“ The Senate gets the last bite at the apple when it comes to the state budget , and that gives Republicans a fair amount of power at the Legislature this time around , ” said Erik Iverson , chairman of the state Republican Party .
“ Being able to have control of the Senate and keep our fifty seats in the House is pretty gratifying for Republicans . ”
Echoing the nonpartisan message Obama emphasized in his victory speech last Tuesday , Governer Brian Schweitzer remains hopeful that a desire for progress and improvement will ensure Leglislative progress in the state .
“ I ’ll be looking for legislative leaders that are looking for solutions , ” Schweitzer said .
Split - ticket or not , this year ’s election in Montana was huge for Democrats .
With the election of Schweitzer and Tester a few years ago , and the popularity of Obama , it appears this historically Red state is no longer decidedly Red .
In fact , at present , it ’s purple .
The ability to manage our time efficiently is of great importance for happiness in our lives .
Success in this critical area will allow us to enjoy the pleasures that life offers , will help us to manage stress and is a big step for our mental relaxation and calm .
Conversely , if we do not learn the basic principles of time management , the setting of objectives and priorities , we risk being caught up by the waves and storms of life that affect us too often .
Good time management is not easy .
Not all people have the gift of proper organization .
Many people have a wealth of activities and obligations .
They feel they are oppressed by the many jobs that have to do with respect to the family , home or their profession .
Easily , without the skills and education one can be caught in a vicious cycle of time disruption and priorities with extremely negative consequences .
Despite the importance to manage time efficiently , educational systems at all levels give very little education to young people .
This is a paradox if someone considers that the management of time is an essential component of success in all business sectors .
Importance and benefits of good time management
The time is our life .
The more we are able to plan our time efficiently , the more we will be able to enjoy our lives .
We need to be careful from the pressures arising from the ceaseless flow of things we need to do during working hours which are increasing and are intolerable by the additional requirements that currently exist in personal and family life .
All this creates excessive stress and removes the psychological calm that we all need so much today .
Does this mean that we are doomed to be overcome by the mass of commitments and work to be done , and having psychological suffering and physical impact on our health ?
The answer is no .
If we do not have the inherent gift of good organization of time in order to manage the countless obligations flooding continuously , it is possible with a methodical effort to learn to apply some basic principles that will help us to manage our time better .
The benefits of such a successful effort are not limited to the psychological calm and personal satisfaction but also lead to a better physical health .
So let us look at how best to approach the issue of proper and efficient use of our time .
Planning activities and the need to say NO
Initially we must never forget that the planning and design of our activities for each day , gives us a large degree of control of our time .
We must recognize what is important for us to come first in our list .
It is necessary to have the strength to say NO for new commitments or proposals that will take us time and are not within our objectives .
We must also teach our selves to politely say no to various social , or family - friendly events , activities , dinners that are likely to charge more our already overloaded schedule .
Let us not forget also that such activities are certainly good but we must not allow them to deprive our sleep , rest and relaxation , which are priority in our lives today .
The setting of priorities
The placement of priorities is an essential prerequisite to the successful management of our time .
It is very important to recognize what activities are not so essential to us and to remove them from our list .
Here we must be very strict in our choices .
Removal from our schedule obligations that are not crucial for us , frees our time for rest and relaxation or for other things more important .
Delegation of work
It is good to continually look if we can , given that this is possible , to give others to do the work we have .
The art of delegation can offer more to people with managerial positions who are usually overburdened by obligations .
We need to be careful when doing work that we consider important to do it right from the beginning because experience shows that we may need more time to do the corrections afterwards .
Partial implementation
Another technique that can help us is the partial implementation of work that is long , difficult or we do not like , but we need to do .
We can , for example , every day , systematically to devote ten minutes on a difficult work .
Gradually we will be able to finish the job with out understanding it .
Self - monitoring and self - control
We should constantly monitor where and how we spend our time .
We ourselves are good to look at how we allocate our time every day .
If necessary , for a few days we can write on a paper all our activities and next to each activity how much time we spend on it .
Then we can examine our activities and the use of our time .
We must look for what we can remove or how we can change some of our activities to protect our time .
Sleep , rest , holidays , nutrition
Remember the great significance of the abundant and good sleep , healthy eating , rest and vacation for your effectiveness .
The sleep will help you relax and be more concentrated , to finish the work in less time and produce a better quality job .
If you feel stressed , then take one - day leave .
Do something you like , relax .
This will help you organize and manage your time better when you come back .
The release of Carl Levin 's report on the Bush Administration 's alleged " torture " policies was a formality :
The Senator 's conclusions were politically predetermined long ago .
Still , the credulity and acclaim that has greeted this agitprop is embarrassing , even by Washington standards .
According to the familiar " torture narrative " that Mr. Levin sanctifies , President Bush and senior officials sanctioned detainee abuse , first by refusing to accord al Qaeda members Geneva Convention rights , and second by conspiring to rewrite the legal definition of torture .
The new practices were then imposed on military leaders and spread through the chain of command .
Therefore , Mr. Bush , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and their deputies are morally -- and legally -- responsible for all prisoner abuse since 9/11 , not least Abu Ghraib .
Nearly every element of this narrative is dishonest .
As officials testified during Mr. Levin 's hearings and according to documents in his possession , senior officials were responding to requests from the CIA and other commanders in the field .
The flow was bottom up , not top down .
Those commanders were seeking guidance on what kind of interrogation was permissible as they tried to elicit information from enemies who want to murder civilians .
At the time , no less than Barack Obama 's Attorney General nominee , Eric Holder , was saying that terrorists did n't qualify for Geneva protections .
This was the context in which the Justice Department wrote the so - called " torture memos " of 2002 and 2003 .
You 'd never know from the Levin jeremiad that these are legal -- not policy -- documents .
They are attempts not to dictate interrogation guidelines but to explore the legal limits of what the CIA might be able to do .
It would have been irresponsible for those charged with antiterror policy to do anything less .
In a 2007 interview former CIA director George Tenet described the urgency of that post - 9/11 period : " I 've got reports of nuclear weapons in New York City , apartment buildings that are going to be blown up , planes that are going to fly into airports all over again . . .
Plot lines that I do n't know -- I do n't know what 's going on inside the United States . "
Actionable intelligence is the most effective weapon in the war on terror , which can potentially save thousands of lives .
WASHINGTON  Timothy F. Geithner , who moved closer to confirmation as Treasury secretary on Thursday , told senators that President Obama believed China was “ manipulating ” its currency , suggesting a more confrontational stance toward that country than under the Bush administration .
Mr. Geithner ’s comment was made in writing to the Senate Finance Committee hours before it voted 18 to 5 to recommend that the full Senate confirm him .
The statement , which is certain to anger the Chinese government , comes at a particularly sensitive time , with economies in both the United States and China weakening and tensions already rising around the globe over trade .
The United States , moreover , is increasingly dependent on China to finance its ballooning deficit .
An administration official said that Mr. Geithner was only repeating what Mr. Obama had said during the campaign , and pointed out that his statement also emphasized that the president intended to use “ all the diplomatic avenues available to him ” to address the currency question .
It remained unclear whether Mr. Geithner was signaling that Mr. Obama would officially declare later this spring that China was engaging in currency manipulation , when the administration is required by a 20 - year - old trade law to report to Congress on exchange rate issues .
Such a finding would begin a legal process that starts with diplomacy and could end with the imposition of trade barriers like tariffs .
The objective would be to persuade China to let the value of its currency , the yuan , freely float  a move that would let its value rise and would increase the cost of its exports .
The summary of the debate that follows , in chart form , is not an attempt to determine who won or lost the debate — or , much less , to settle the question of God — but , rather , an attempt to lay out the kinds of argument used by the debaters , and their consequent use of reason and evidence .
I 've classified the arguments by the kind of rhetoric involved .
Remember that in this context " scientific rhetoric " merely means that the argument is aimed at the listener 's understanding of the question , and that " political rhetoric " merely means that the argument is aimed at the motivations of the listener for choosing one side or the other , rather than the question itself .
The arguments are condensed and paraphrased .
In some cases , I 've made explicit an argument which the speaker only implied .
( For example , when Dennett shows the picture of a church turned museum , followed closely by a picture of the Vatican turned theme - park . )
The arguments here are also abbreviated .
If you want an expanded version , you can go to the commentaries ( the numbers at the left tell you which one ) , and from there you can find the which part of the video to go to , if you want to see the argument as presented by the debater .
I 've classified each point in two other ways :
I 've marked each as " sound " or " unsound " .
I 'm using these terms in a relatively informal sense .
I call an point " unsound " if it is based on an obvious falsehood ( as when D'Souza says that Dennett has n't cited any sources ) , or simply fails to make sense ( as when Dennett leaps from one church that has become a museum to an implied argument about all religion ) , or is based on a well - understood fallacy ( as when D'Souza missapplies probability calculations when arguing about fine - tuning ) , or contains a definite flaw which the opponent later points out .
I call an argument " sound " when it makes general sense , is relevant to the point it 's supposed to be relevant to , and the evidence provided for it is not clearly false .
So , for example , I assume that Dennett is right when he cites well known sources about the growth or decline of certain religious denominations , and I assume D'Souza is right when he talks about Christianity spreading in certain parts of the world .
( That argument , by the way , is marked " unsound " , but not because I question his facts . )
I 've also marked some points as " adversarial " .
By " adversarial " I mean that the purpose of the point is to divide the world into two camps , and make one camp seem desirable and the other seem undesirable in some respect .
The division can be as small as the division between the two speakers — accusing the other speaker of being sneaky or dishonest — or it can be as large as western civilization vs. eastern , or religious vs. nonreligious .
The points marked " adversarial " are all examples of political rhetoric , since the attempt to paint one 's own group as desirable , and the other as not , is a way of addressing motives , rather than the issue .
But it is possible to make political arguments without dividing the world into desirable and undesirable camps , and so not all political arguments are adversarial .
Look the charts over .
I 'll discuss some of the patterns , and some implications , next time .
Dennett :
# Scientific Rhetoric Political Rhetoric Sound Unsound Adversarial 1 Religion is not growing in numbers .
X 1 Religion does not necessarily produce " family values " .
X 3 There have been many different Gods throughout human history .
The God D'Souza is talking about is only one of these .
X 4 It 's not true , therefore , that atheists are disagreeing with most of humanity , while Christians like D'Souza are agreeing with most of humanity .
X 5 The Hagia Sophia is now a museum , so this is the potential fate of all churches .
X X 6 Humans , and thus all their ideas , including religion , are a product of evolution .
X 12 The fine - tuning argument does n't prove anything , since , for all we know , there could be millions of universes that do n't support life .
X 12 The atheist regimes that committed atrocities had structures similar to religions .
X 14 Natural Laws are generalizations about nature .
Nature does n't " obey " them .
X 14 There are many possible explanations for the fine - tuning .
God is not the only possibility .
X 14 It is n't true that the lack of God implies that there are no moral standards .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
( Dagbladet.no ) : Bildet du ser over er tatt på høylys dag i Bergen .
Mopedisten er 48 år gammel , og frakter en stige gjennom rushtrafikken .
Trædd over hodet - låst fast av hjelmen .
Bokstavlig talt halsbrekkende galskap som kunne gått fryktelig galt .
- Måtte ta bilde
Hendelsen skjedde midt i rushtrafikken i 15.30 - tida onsdag .
Bak mopedisten kommer 47 - åringen Ragni kjørende .
- Bildet er tatt i Michael Krohns gate på vei inn mot Bergenstrafikkens heteste område , Danmarksplass , sier hun til Dagbladet.no .
Trafikken hadde stoppet opp , og Ragni så sitt snitt til å knipse et mobilbilde av det elleville synet .
Hun trodde knapt det hun så .
- Mopedisten hadde ikke merket lasten , men bundet stigen fast til mopeden med tynt tau for at den ikke skulle svinge ut .
Han var svært utålmodig , for han tråklet seg videre med flott parallellkjøring mellom bilene frem mot lyskrysset , forteller hun .
- Null tanke på konsekvenser
- Jeg trodde ikke mine egne øyne , så for meg en ung gutt med null tanker for konsekvensene en liten bråstopp eller en dult fra en annen bil kunne få .
- For ikke å snakke om en kraftig påkjørsel bakfra !
At fyren er en mann på 48 gjør ikke saken bedre !
- Det var litt med livet som innsats , innrømmer føreren av mopeden når han blir oppringt av bt.no , som var først ute med saken .
Ketil ( 48 ) forteller at han skulle bruke stigen som rømningsvei hjemme .
— Jeg syntes det var helt på grensen .
Jeg måtte tre hodet opp gjennom stigen på tvers , for så å vri det ut .
Sikten var litt dårlig , og dessuten var det glatt .
Det hele var hasardiøst , sier Ketil .
Politiet hoderystet
— Jeg tror knapt det jeg ser .
Man ser av og til bilder fra andre land med de mest merkverdige laster .
Men dette er det verste jeg har sett av last , jeg har aldri sett maken .
Det er helt forferdelig , sier politioverbetjent Jan Gunnar Bøe til bt.no .
Utenom å ha brutt minst fem paragrafer i veitrafikkloven , har mopedisten vært en hårsbredd fra å få sitt eget hode revet tvers av , mener den erfarne politimannen .
Og han er interessert i å komme i kontakt med Ketil ( 48 ) .
I thought that I might put pen to paper in regards to my interpretation of Soke ’s mindset in the year of the mini horse .
The reality is that it is not something new or groundbreaking and the message is similar to other past messages , however a timeless message that is painted on a different canvas with contrasting colors , evolving as the ink dries and the paper ages .
We often jump to conclusions on what Soke might mean when he writes the proverbial scroll .
In my humble opinion , it has become quite a different message once the year comes to an end and the scroll is taken down .
Again , the quintessence is the moment , the moment Soke puts pen to paper the dance of the brush on the paper tells the real story .
Ironically , the characters can be meaningless unless they are re-written in the space with the blood , sweat and tears of our training .
A month has passed since the striking of the sake barrel and therefore the ever changing meaning as had some time to decant .
However , when asked by Soke to demonstrate taijutsu in this year ’s theme , I unfortunately found myself thinking ( because I was thinking ) of how this becomes an interesting challenge in application of this mindset to taijutsu .
Furthermore , how we can try and interpret Sokes words and teachings that resonate that of the said theme , regardless of the importance of any theme .
Soke often speaks about the detachment of technique and how we cannot make this of ourselves but of a higher and more mysterious power that is only cultivated through just and rigorous consistent training for the simple purpose of peace .
This heart and mind will somehow connect with the divine and allow for the passing of divine intervention or guidance .
Only when this is for the greater good and that of peace will the martial ways lead us to a path of reverberation of the heavens .
Soke explained in training recently that if you force the opponent or try to control them you will lead them to you .
In this they will discover you , therefore positioning yourself in a place of danger or counter control .
Ultimately , we must lead and they will follow you to submission and peace .
This aspect of leading is expressed in the final character of “ Michibiku ” 導 to guide or lead .
Mature warriors know well that one cannot force someone to do something and if we do it results in making us a target or subject of criticism .
Therefore , we can only lead and inspire in the way that Soke does for those to truly follow .
It is often said that naturally the weak will follow the strong , but in Budo you must not be weak nor strong you must forget attachment for the need of power and only then can you fully understand the aspects of strength or weakness .
You cannot lead weak students without becoming weak and by fully understanding weakness .
This is often stated by Soke to the Shihan .
Ultimately the true warrior seeks to lead self and others to peace and safety and to reach the level of mastery of the cat as in the legendary Neko no Myojitsu .
Bufu Ikkan-聖龍
Now that services have ended at the First National Church of Crawford , Texas , it ’s clear America needs a new religion .
Not to nitpick , but it could be argued that rule by the most loudly born - again or , as scholars call it , Screechocracy , was not a success .
That ’s not to say we can hope for an improvement by veering leftward , into one or another version of softcore Buddhism , as recovering Christians tend to do .
Let ’s face it : Buddhism has some nice statues and incense , but it ’s no fun at all .
Indeed , adopting that most dismally mature of religions means giving up forever on the idea of getting any fun out of existence .
That ’s the whole message of Buddhism .
And a fun pantheon is what America wants right now , to get everyone ’s mind off that Visa envelope sitting like an anthrax package on the hall table .
That ’s why it ’s time to drop the whole grim monotheism narrative and go back to polytheism — because if you want fun , you need a bigger , wackier cast of characters .
When Bill Murray said , in Groundhog Day , “ I ’m A God ; I ’m not THE God , ” he was on the right track .
We need to stop fooling with the singular , upper - case God and shop for a nice set of lower - case gods .
And goddesses , because the first benefit of polytheism is , as they say , diversity .
Luckily , the one thing the monstrous corpse - dump of human history has generated in profusion is weird , interesting gods .
We may as well recycle the bastards , because they ’re already paid for in blood , ignorance and misery .
We ’ll never know how many goats , birthmark - free children , twins , clubfeet , cattle , slaves , prisoners and other surplus beings have been killed in their names , but you can be sure it ’s a number big enough to ensure some good old Lord of the Flies creepiness to any god - gang you choose .
They ’ll do the job .
It ’s just a matter of picking the right crew .
So here is a quick survey of some enticing , unemployed , desirable pantheons , with quick summaries of their strong points and defects as future objects of urban worship :
The Egyptian Zoo
All we really have in a cold universe are our fellow critters .
The Egyptians understood this better than anyone — before they , along with many another promising civilization , were bulldozed by monotheist hicks , first Christian and then Muslim .
Just compare Greek and Egyptian art .
The Greeks were good with people , in fact they were so good with male musculature you can tell they spent their lives studying up — but they could n’t do animals .
Nobody can do animals like the Egyptians .
Egyptian cat statues look like they just finished grooming themselves and are about to jump off the pedestal .
Egyptian dog statues are so smart they seem to criticize your wardrobe as you stare at them .
They even did good baboons — beady - eyed hunched muggers waiting for the moment to spring .
The Egyptians took that delight in all life into their religion and made a pantheon that ’s warmer , bigger , and more versatile than any other .
Not only did they make every beast from croc to cat into a god , but they did it with remarkable range , even deifying a beetle that pushes little balls of dung across the fields , and the jackal , a beautiful beast unjustly despised by lesser critics for the sin of making a tough living by its wits .
Better still , they foresaw the possibilities of recombination , mixing jackal and man , falcon and woman .
You want inclusive ?
The Egyptian pantheon makes Oprah look like a Boston Brahmin .
Their war god , Sekhmet , is a nubile maiden in a linen dress who has the head of a lion — and the body to make it work for her .
That ’s another plus here : the Egyptian goddesses are by far the hottest .
This is the top of the line in pantheons : seductive , biosphere - friendly , morally ambivalent .
They play hard to get , but they ’re willing to listen to mortal petitioners .
Polytheism we can believe in .
Disadvantages : homeland swamped by filthy monotheists .
Many magnificent deified species of the pantheon , such as crocodiles and hippos , now wiped out in Egypt .
Third Mummy film said to be godawful .
The Greek Landlords
Zeus , Hera , Athena , Apollo , and the rest have built - in appeal for tweedsters who like to think they support “ classical civilization , ” , though the fogies would would all file stress lawsuits if they had to spend even a minute in a crowded elevator this tribe of randy , moody , vengeful and obsessive gamblers .
This is a pantheon that bores easy , and when they ’re bored — uh - oh !
One advantage for the contemporary market is that they ’re totally gender - balanced .
Athena , the brilliant , beautiful goddess of wisdom , may well be the single coolest god ever invented .
She ’s got a pet owl and carries a big spear , for Gods ’ sake — what more do you want ?
For the GBLT consumer , the possibilities are endless , starting with Artemis — you did n’t know about Artemis ?
Jeez , she was n’t exactly hiding it .
And Zeus is a man of flexible tastes .
No stickler he .
No speciesist even .
If it moves , he ’ll descend on it in some gaudy disguise .
Disadvantages :
It ’s going to be tough to keep “ sexual harassment ” on the books if we elevate a bunch of Greeks to Olympia .
That ’s all we ’re going to say .
Oh , also that whole justice thing , forget it — they ’d laugh if you mentioned .
But that reminds us of the great thing about these guys vs. most gods : they actually have a sense of humor .
Whether that ’s a good thing in a god or not depends on who ’s the punch line .
The Hindu Crowd
Many distinct advantages , starting with Ganesha , the god of wealth , who makes this pantheon a natural for urban capitalists , and a clear leader over god crews designed for warrior tribes alone .
There ’s no denying that these are the gods you want for your startup shrine or office .
Ganesha even has the right look : a fat many - armed multitasker with an elephant ’s head , complete with trunk for handling your Blackberry .
And there ’s something for the kiddies too : Shiva , the primal deity of pre-Aryan India , who is devoted to pure destruction .
The other great advantage of the Hindu pantheon is that there ’s no snooty members - only rule on this ride .
This is n’t so much a stable pantheon as an overcrowded train to Delhi that picks up new passengers , ticketed and otherwise , at every stop .
You can add or subtract a god or so , or 30 , at any stop without outraging your fellow believers .
Anything goes , and a bigger pantheon means more business for the idolmakers .
In fact , Hinduism is the only major world religion that had no record of slaughtering unbelievers or heretics .
Of course that proud record was broken when rural India was besieged by American evangelicals , but that has to be considered unbearable provocation .
Disadvantages : does n’t seem to travel very well .
Need to reconstruct an artificial Ganges wherever established ( though this can lead to wonderful dreamscapes , as at Angkor ) .
Certain modern , squeamish “ reform ” Hindus maintain that the various gods are not actually gods , the sort of dangerous talk that leads straight back to the monotheist ghetto .
This leads to the greatest disadvantage of all : unlike our other contenders , the Hindu pantheon is currently worshipped by several hundred million actual people , taking most of the romance out of it and cutting way down on our room for reinventing these gods .
Nothing ruins a pantheon like contemporary adherents .
A few years ago I tried darcs and wondered why all version control systems did n't work like this .
The only thing that stopped me using it full time were reports of poor performance , and the absolute lack of tool support .
Today , both of those problems are history .
darcs has been joined by git , Bazaar and Mercurial , and while no system has such an obvious technical edge over its competitors to be declared a deserving winner , it looks like git has the upper hand in mindshare thanks largely to github
Meanwhile , at work , our system administrator lost weeks of productivity and large chunks of his hair trying to solve our cross-Pacific Subversion performance problems
Storing Arbitrary Messages in Remote DNS Caches
A few months ago , I read Dan Kaminsky 's presentation slides , Attacking Distributed Systems : The DNS Case Study .
In the presentation , Kaminsky documents a method of implementing single bit data transfer with nothing more than :
A recursive , caching name server
A wildcard zone
After a particularly stressful week , I decided I needed to work on something fun -- an implementation of a DNS - based dead drop messaging system , utilizing Kaminsky 's ideas .
Recursion Desired : Signaling 0s and 1s
In each DNS query , 7 bits are reserved for a number of flags , one of which is the Recursion Desired ( RD ) flag .
If set to 0 , the queried DNS server will not attempt to recurse -- it will only provide answers from its cache .
Combine this with a wildcard zone and it's possible to signal bits ( RD on ) , and read them ( RD off ) .
To set a bit to 1 the sender issues a query with the RD bit on .
The wildcard zone resolves all requests , including this query .
The receiver then issues a query for the same hostname , with the RD bit off .
If the bit is 1 , the query will return a valid record .
If the bit is 0 , no record will be returned .
So , it 's easy to signal a single bit , but what if you want to share more than 1 bit of data ?
This requires both sides to compute a list of records -- one record for every bit of data we wish to send .
In my implementation , I chose to do this with a pre-shared word list and initialization vector ( IV ) .
Given the same word list and IV , both sender and receiver can independently compute an identical mapping of words to bit positions .
The sender can then signal the ' 1 ' bits , and the receiver can query all bits .
To communicate , the sender and receiver need to pre-share a word list , an initialization vector ( IV ) , the IP of a recursive nameserver , a wildcard domain , and a communications window ( time of day ) .
For the sake of simplicity , I borrowed a page from Pascal : Every message is prepended with an 8 - bit unsigned value specifying the full message length .
Here 's how the protocol works :
Sender :
Step 1 : Split the message into individual bits .
Step 2 : Permute the word list in a reproducible fashion using the shared IV .
Step 3 : Encode the length of your message as an 8 bit unsigned value , and prepend the length to your message data .
Step 4 : Each word in the ordered word list corresponds to a single bit of your message .
Generate a valid hostname for each bit by combining each word with the wildcard DNS zone
Step 5 : For each bit that is 1 , do a recursive lookup against the shared nameserver for the corresponding wildcarded hostname .
Receiver :
Step 1 : Permute the word list in a reproducible fashion using the shared IV .
Step 2 : Each word in the ordered word list corresponds to a single bit of the message .
Generate a valid hostname for each bit by combining each word with the wildcard DNS zone .
Step 3 : Acquire the message length by doing a non-recursive lookup against the shared nameserver for the first 8 bits of the message .
Names that return answers are 1 , those that do not are 0 .
Step 4 : For each word in the word list , do a non-recursive lookup against the shared nameserver for the remainder of the message .
Step 5 : Reconstruct the message from the individual bits .

You can download a copy of NSDK here .
It 's written in Python , and depends on Twisted Core and Twisted Names .
Usage
nsdk.py [ dns IP ] [ wildcard domain ] [ word list ] [ iv ]
Each bit of your message requires at least one DNS query .
I strongly suggest testing this implementation against name servers and zones that you control .

During the Great Depression of the 1930s , Hollywood thrived because it offered people a way to escape from austere times .
Today , the video - game industry is providing exactly the same service .
Meltdown might only be a heartbeat away for many industries , but business is booming for a number of games corporations .
As 2008 drew to a close , global sales of console hardware and games software hit a record $ 49.9bn , according to UK consulting firm Screen Digest .
With so much at stake , it will come as no surprise that there 's a bloody war for market dominance being waged between the " big three " console manufacturers .
Microsoft , Nintendo and Sony are pitted against each other in a battle over who can win the hearts – and cash – of the world 's gamers .
In terms of sales , Sony Corporation 's PlayStation 3 , which was launched in November 2006 in the US and in March 2007 in Europe , is increasingly being seen as the runt of the litter .
It has long lagged behind Microsoft 's Xbox 360 , which went on sale in late 2005 , and Nintendo 's Wii , released a year later .
The PlayStation 3 made some inroads on the Xbox in Europe , even jumping ahead of it in May 2008 .
But optimism quickly turned to gloom when CNN declared the console a " sinking ship " after figures from market researcher the NDP Group revealed that the PS3's November 2008 sales in the US had dropped by 19 per cent compared with November the previous year .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Break it down into units sold and the picture looks even bleaker .
At the end of September , 17 million PS3s had been sold worldwide , compared with 28 million ( its current total ) Xbox 360 machines and 35 million Wiis .
Yet go back a generation and the PlayStation 2 was shattering sales records and generally coming out victor in the war with Microsoft and Nintendo .
So what went wrong ?
Many believe
Sony shot itself in the foot by making the PS3 too pricey .
You can pick up a Wii for around £ 180 , and an Xbox 360 ( Premium ) for around £ 170 , but a PlayStation 3 ( 80 GB ) will set you back about £ 280 /£ 300 – a stark price difference in the deepening recession .
Another issue with the PS3 is you can't play PS2 games on current PS3 models ( although you can on first - generation PS3s ) .
Then there 's the Blu-ray drive , which plays high - definition ( HD ) films .
Critics often dismiss this as a white elephant , saying people are put off by the fact that they need to invest in an HD television to benefit from the Blu-ray player .
And as cheaper , stand - alone Blu-ray players have hit the market , what could have been seen as a unique selling point has become less attractive – further increasing Sony 's woes .
Ed Barton , games analyst at Screen Digest , however , thinks Sony 's gamble on Blu-ray is a winning move .
While he accepts that many people will opt to buy cheaper , entry - level Blu-ray players , he believes that " video consumers are likely to purchase the PS3 as the most cost - effective , future - proof Blu-ray player . "
Another thing that could help the PS3 is the possibility that it will go 3D later this year .
But what is most likely to get units flying off the shelves is a price cut .
And this looks like a distinct possibility , as Sony has reduced PS3 production costs by 35 per cent .
Nevertheless , there is no escaping the fact that the PlayStation division of Sony has lost a frightening $ 3.4 bn in the past two fiscal years .
The Wii – with its motion - sensitive remote control or " Wiimote " , which can be used as a sword , boxing glove , tennis racket or fishing rod depending on the game – has not only become a huge hit around the world , but has also helped bring gaming to a wider audience .
The phenomenally successful Wii Fit game , which is primarily aimed at women and older people looking to lose weight and get fit , is a perfect example of this .
Activities range from yoga to slalom skiing , and according to the blurb , the game will help " improve posture and strengthen your body " .
Bundled with the game package is a wireless " balance board " on which you stand , sit or lie to perform the various exercises .
The board tracks your centre of gravity and can also calculate your body mass index and level of fitness for your age .
The Wii Fit is selling like wildfire , but to a new audience of casual gamers who respond well to its low price , easy - to - play games and non-threatening image .
The Xbox , on the other hand , continues to be perceived as the console for the hardcore gamer .
Arguably , one of the reasons the Xbox 360 has trailed behind the Wii – despite a year 's head start – is down to it being plagued with problems in its early days .
Hardware failures and the " Red Ring of Death " ( three red lights on the Xbox 's power button signalling " core digital " failure ) did n't do much for its reputation .
Then there was the HD DVD misjudgement .
When it first designed the 360 , Microsoft put its money on the HD DVD format ( whereas PlayStation put it on Blu-ray ) and offered an external disc player for watching films .
But the format went belly - up and Microsoft naturally stopped making the add-on .
Right now , the Wii has market dominance .
But future battle lines are likely to be drawn beyond the living room – in the realm of online services .
Microsoft , for example , has created a thriving online Xbox Live market - place , which connects gamers via broadband to other gamers around the globe .
It also lets you download games , free demos , movie trailers and HD movies .
The PS3 has its PlayStation Network , which offers online play for free ( unlike Microsoft , which charges its Xbox 360 gamers via Microsoft Live ) .
You can also download games , demos and videos – and watch streaming videos from sites such as Hulu.com in full - screen mode .
Sony has also recently launched its much - anticipated – and delayed – PlayStation Home virtual world , which is similar to Second Life .
It 's free to join and lets PS3 gamers chat , interact in the virtual environment and launch multi-player games .
Like the other two consoles , the Wii also connects users to the internet ( via built - in Wi - Fi ) , opening up a variety of Wii channels for news , weather , games , and more .
Plus you can download an Opera - based web browser , which costs 500 Wii points ( £ 3.75 ) and is also used to stream BBC iPlayer videos .
So who will win the console war in the long run ?
It remains to be seen .
But legendary Japanese video game designer Tomonobu Itagaki makes no bones about it .
He admits to admiring the Nintendo Wii 's dedication to innovation , but thinks that the " Xbox 360 is the best games console on the earth .
It 's better than PlayStation 3 . "
So until the next generation of consoles is born , this war looks set to run and run .
Let the games begin :

Over the last couple of days I have been trying to implement the Sharing Problem ( Ruby Quiz # 65 : Splitting the Loot ) in Scala .
So far I have implemented the greedy pick algorithim and still need to implement a recursive solution that will brute force the edge cases .
However on the way I think I have picked up some important lessons .
You can see the code for yourself in the GitHub project related to the problem and the solution ( it ’s in the Scala directory ) but I will be highlighting some of the code in this post .
This was the first set of Scala I ’ve done that was actually an attempt to use some of the functional aspects of Scala rather than just porting Java code in a more or less literal and imperative way .
After struggling a little bit with the implict return and list concatenation I implemented the greedy heuristic .
This is what it looked like ( link to the code file ) .
import gems .
_ package splitter { class LootSplitter object LootSplitter { def splitLoot ( gembag : GemBag , shares : Int ) : List [ GemBag ] = { if (( gembag.totalValue % shares ) !=
0 ) { return List [ GemBag ] ( ) } val individualShareValue = gembag.totalValue / shares var partShares : List[ GemBag ] = List.make ( shares , new GemBag( List ( ) ) ) gembag.gems.sort( _.value > _.value ).foreach(( gem : Gem ) => { partShares = partShares.sort(_.totalValue < _.totalValue ) partShares = List ( partShares ( 0 ) add gem ) ::: ( partShares drop 1 ) } ) partShares } } } } I was struck initially by how compact this code was , you are looking at about 28 lines of code .
However as I was looking at it I began to wonder whether it was concise or just terse .
How is someone meant to interpret something like _.value > _.value ?
I showed it to a collegue and his first reaction was “ I do n’t know functional languages so I would n’t know what this means ” .
This was exactly the kind of reaction I was afraid of because I have been converted heavily to the principal of readable code .
Someone should be able to scan code and understand , in principle , what is happening here .
If they do n’t then the cost of maintaining that code is going to be higher and we have actually lost something in the concise syntax .
I decided to try and implement a readable version of the same file which added about 6 lines ( only two according to GitHub ! ) .
You can read this version here but now I want to throw it open to the public .
Is this version actually easier to read ?
Are things like the underscore variable actually part of the price of comprehending Scala ?
In my rewritten version I use some of the nice features of Scala such as first order functions but you still have lines like this : List ( sortedBags ( 0 ) add gem ) ::: ( sortedBags drop 1 ) I hope you are reading this as “ add a gem to the first sorted Bag and make a List of it and then add all the other bags except the first one to the new list ” but I am worried that this is far from obvious .
Is that because I ’ve done something that is n’t idiomatic or is it because actually the operators and the library API are too obscure ?
Scala represents a significant evolution of Java in terms of absorbing all the lessons learned during the evolution of the language .
When porting Java code I feel far more comfortable with it than when I am trying to create new code that uses the core language libraries .
I do n’t want to evolve to a new set of problems and best practices that try to avoid them .
Witnessing the Decay of Western Hegemony
Witnessing the Decay of Western Hegemony and the Role of the Organic Intellectual
By Pablo Ouziel
Abstract :
While the military might of the world ’s leading nations continues to expand , it has become apparent that western colonialism is abruptly coming to an end , yet the consequences are still not clear to any of the pundits traditionally involved in the discourse which has helped to build it .
For many decades in the west , we have thrived on imperial expansion led by the United States of America and its allies , and legitimized by international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund , The World Bank and the United Nations .
Today , this oligopoly of world domination is rapidly deteriorating and what only a few months ago seemed like the only option for humanity is today being severely put to the test .
The organic intellectual must face these challenging times by offering viable alternatives to society so that a new world order can emerge out of the rubble left behind by liberal democratic capitalism .
Introduction
Antonio Gramsci differentiated organic intellectuals from traditional intellectuals , by emphasizing the role of the former in cultivating roots within their communities to help develop a self - inspired organic consciousness .
Accepting their position within the dominant ideology , according to Gramsci , organic intellectuals will ultimately support the working - class in developing an alternative hegemony within civil society .
For many decades , society has been indoctrinated with the belief that liberal democratic capitalism was the benevolent solution to all world problems .
Through this model of society , hunger was going to be eradicated , wars would come to an end , the environment would be saved , and justice would be distributed equally amongst all members of the human species .
Entering the new century , western society celebrated the new millennium with the euphoria of success , once and for all ; we had entered the final face of existence , the one , which would bring upon the earth the mythical wonders of the Kingdom of Heaven .
However , without having witnessed the passing of the first decade of the 21st century , this dogma has been broken and as many across the globe struggle for survival and society is marred by the continuous threat of revolving crisis , the time for the revolutionary transformation of the western ideal is upon us .
Yet , the fundamental questions remain to be answered , how can we act ?
What can we do ?
It is the role of the organic intellectual to answer these questions .
If there are any left who have not yet awaken from their slumber , the time has come for them to abandon the petit bourgeois existence of the petty professor attending wine tasting events , the government bureaucrat justifying the wonders of his mind while working on the golf swing at the local country club , or the 1960s hippie , that after a stint in the Berkeley student movements went on to become a prosperous businessman .
In today ’s holistic global crisis , one which threatens every single aspect of our existence – from the food we eat , to the air we breath , and to the way we interact between each other – those who in their youth considered themselves conscious individuals fighting towards change , can no longer hide behind the mask of the liberal democratic ideal of a capitalist society striving towards justice , peace and prosperity .
All of these having remained ideals , while a reality of extreme misery for the majority , coexists today with the growing prosperity of a shrinking minority capitalizing on the growing pains of humanity .
In today ’s crisis , we will all perish together or we will overcome it together , and as professor Chomsky often states , “ so much depends on will and choice ” .
Yet , the choice at this point is between prolonged misery , constant crisis , environmental deterioration and continual war , or the possibility of working together in unison to overcome the hurdles , which we are facing .
If we are to honestly look at what is happening in society , on any given day we can observe that the interests of the majority are not being respected and instead , the elites benefiting themselves , pitch to society the benefits of their choices by attributing everything to the trickledown effect – a warped inversion of reality which supports investing on those at the top in order to protect people at the bottom .
I often wonder when I hear such discourse bombarded by government officials and experts through the traditional channels of propaganda , whether the rest of society is awake and paying attention , or simply asleep and indifferent .
I can never be quite sure , because if indeed society is awake and paying attention , then we live in a world of fools , yet , if the indifference is attributable to being asleep , the task of waking up is a daunting one .
One , which can only be carried out by the organic intellectual committed to revolutionary social transformation .
Decay of Western Hegemony
As western society struggles with rising tensions , both within and outside of its borders , as those being colonized begin to throw their shoes in despair , and those who thought they belonged to the empire begin to realize that their dream is no longer sustainable , the organic intellectual is able to grasp the severity of the global crisis .
As bankers announce their losses , the banking cartel slowly collapses .
First , the major investment banks and hedge funds , then their traditional counterparts , all showing loses which only a year ago had been presented as ground breaking profits , as slowly the deck of cards unfolds and everything crumbles .
Soon the job cuts begin , across continents furious workers revel against their enslaving owners , demonstrations , walkouts , sit-ins , failed negotiations between trade unions and shareholders .
The sky is falling and the capitalist always strives to win .
For a while , dormant workers watch their colleagues being laid - off , at first it seems an unavoidable aspect of capitalism , the dirty side of a casino culture , which rewards some at the expense of others .
But then , neighbourhoods begin to witness empty houses , people evicted , squatters moving in , the law can do little to prevent it , the numbers are too big to contain .
The lobbyists in Washington are eagerly fighting for pieces of the bailout money prepared by a government , which faced with complete anarchy must regain a foothold in the corridors of power .
Confidence must never be lost .
Hence , a new face in the White House , a new man , a new dream , perpetuated by the chanting of hope .
But things will never be the same in America , as young bankers spend their holidays in despair not knowing if their job awaits them in the coming year , the dark thoughts of unemployment begin to creep in .
Obama proposes solutions , three million jobs to be created by rebuilding the fallen infrastructures of the great American empire .
An empire , which in its boom forgot to cement its foundations and now collapsing , will offer its unemployed bankers the opportunity to go and fix roads .
As America crumbles , its allies must wait and hope .
they too must hold tight to the idea of a rebirth , they too must put their expectations and dreams in the hands of Obama .
For the allies , there is not much more that can be done .
They accepted the American way of life , they indulged in the great American credit card culture and now , millions of people around the globe are tied to the demise of Wall Street , thus the saying , “ when America sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold . ”
So , as frantic politicians of the axis of good scramble for some sense of stability for their countries , industries collapse , unemployment raises , and currencies begin to witness the prospects of inflation , deflation , stagflation , stagdeflation , and ultimately , what few dare to mention – depression and eventual collapse .
At this point , relations which in the good times presented themselves as strong and unbreakable begin to shake , governments of the allied countries , the client states , are trapped between their commitments to the emperor and the demands of their people – their people need to eat and the emperor demands that his people eat first .
So , the economies of the allied countries begin to fall one by one .
As they do , chaos breaks within their borders and internal factions begin to fight for power , possibilities of revolution or civil war are no longer too far fetched as American influence retreats and the ruling parties are left in a vacuum , like sitting ducks , waiting for factions to fight for the reigns .
First , the riots break out in the weaker allied countries such as Greece , where corruption has been so blatant that the disillusioned youth go out to the streets .
At first , it looks like a minor incident , but soon it is apparent that youth everywhere are inspired by such actions .
As the months go by , riots spark up in numerous countries , those that no longer feel a part of the empire are now eager to burn it .
The majority of people no longer see the governments as representing their interests , rather they are understood to be puppets of the ruling elites , the capitalist class , and this makes them the enemy .
It did n’t have to be this way , but politicians have become so complacent that they flaunt the wealth accumulated through legalized corruption , something , which although accepted by the courts , is no longer accepted by the angry mobs .
So politicians begin to flee into exile – first , they fly to the ally countries , but soon they realise that they are not welcomed there .
Their presence can destabilize already fragile situations , so they hop from country to country , finding eventual refuge in some far away land , in the same way that Nazi war criminals ended up in the jungles of Latin America .
In the meantime , the military might of America and its allies keeps getting stretched , and the wars that were begun can no longer be effectively fought .
With the unpopularity at home and the increased resistance of those being attacked , it seems like a retreat is in sight , however , the military commanders and the corporations involved in the creation of weapons of mass destruction , refuse to let go of this opportunity to continue their expansion .
So the war continues , with every shell fired helping to discredit an act , which was presented as a necessary evil to liberate humanity from tyranny .
Now the war is seen for what it is , an unjust act of aggression designed to conquer whole populations and generate profit for the small ruling elites .
The United Nations , once believed to be a fair moderator of conflict , is now showing its face as the mechanism for justification of the mega - powers – it is no longer sustainable , it is now viewed as an aggressor .
The International Monetary Fund is running out of funds and must call on the rising empires to support its transactions .
As for The World Bank , it just passes from corruption scandal to corruption scandal , until soon it too will become obsolete .
So , as the international institutions crumble and the allied countries collapse , America is left in debt with an internal discomfort brewing and external wars being lost .
What was once a colonial project based on the strategy of sticks and carrots , has run out of carrots and all that is left , is the stick to continue the expansion .
It is at this point that the American empire must decide between an all out war against the rising empires , or the acknowledgment of defeat .
All empires rise and fall , what America can do , is to choose between a graceful fall and the third world war .
For those in power the choice is clear , it is now essential for the people to speak loud and promptly .
Will there be war , or will there be revolution ?
It is the role of the organic intellectual to promote revolution rather than war , but how ?
And what kind of revolution ?
The rise of the organic intellectual movement
Mahatma Gandhi knew that soldiers had weapons when he chose to promote the path of non-violence .
He also knew that only through this method India had a chance of transitioning from colonialism to a self - ruling nation , without descending into civil war .
He understood the sacrifice people would have to make when they stood in front of guns with only their faces of indignation to protect them from their oppressors .
The sacrifice proved worthwhile .
Similarly , as liberal democratic capitalism comes to an end , the only option for western society to liberate itself from the chains of its ruling elites is to confront them through organized non-violent actions .
It must be the role of the organic intellectual , to promote this path and educate the oppressed about its benefits , while proposing effective methods of direct communal action .
As the situation deteriorates in the west , there is no doubt that violence is going to increase .
As the population begins to react to what is happening , governments will increase their police forces and will redeploy their militaries to monitor civilian streets – events , which are already apparent in certain areas of the United States .
Yet , violence breeds violence , and we can no longer afford to take this route .
So , as governments take bold steps to increase the controls of the civilian population and the clampdown on dissent becomes apparent , those who are currently ruled , need to understand the tools they have at their disposal in order to invert the pyramid of power .
However , this reversal of the power structure in society requires sacrifices , and the sooner we all understand this , the faster we will be able to obtain true democracy based on peace , equality in front of the justice system , and sustainable prosperity for all .
Helping people understand this reality is the role of the organic intellectual .
Of course , this is not an easy task , and it requires many people working together , using the tools at their disposal to build effectively coordinated information networks designed to empower the population .
Many networks already exist at present , actively educating and organizing communities through grassroots efforts aimed at direct action , yet , the kinds of coalitions , which can reshape society in a revolutionary way are currently lacking friction .
In America , the last time anything like this was actually lived was in the 1960s .
Since then , groups have been fighting for their rights isolated from each other , which has allowed liberal democratic capitalism to contain them and appease them , without jeopardising the continual and coordinated expansion of the colonial project .
It is therefore the need to organize and unite outside of the elite power structures , which must be prioritized if there is going to be any kind of revolutionary transformation of western society .
Once this step is acknowledged by the organic intellectual , and dealt with in a coordinated manner , efforts can then be directed to the numerous direct action initiatives , which are urgently needed : Putting an end to home evictions and making sure that everyone has a home .
Organizing global trade unions , which can counteract capital strikes by paralyzing the capitalist economy and lobbying the demands of the workforce .
Initiating consistent global demonstrations , requesting the halt of military investments and the dismantling of the war industrial complex .
The start up of cooperatives focused on the development of new forms of sustainable technologies and alternative methods of production .
The creation of community based and owned banking institutions .
Coordinating the development of collectively owned community farming initiatives .
The structuring of worker managed goodwill delegations , travelling around the world encouraging substitute forms of collaboration between countries .
Of course , these are only a few options out of the many which can be proposed and acted upon by an organized population , so these can only serve as suggestions , as organic intellectuals strive to unite existing grassroots efforts in coalitions designed to radically transform society .
Sympathizing with the reality of the majority of workers – whose workday is committed without much choice to staying afloat within the strenuous capitalist economy – it is understandable that a critical mass is only achieved after many have been forced into poverty .
However , it is the role of the organic intellectual , to educate the population about the consequences of not acting boldly and committing to the revolutionary project while still in the workforce , rather than having to do so later , when exposed to the charitable mercy of the ruling elite after being laid - off .
As things continue to deteriorate in the western world , these words will make much more sense .
I do hope however , that a majority grasps this view before it is too late to avoid the third world war .
Although , judging by the reflexes of society in predicting the current financial crisis , it might take a declaration of war before people understand where we are heading .
The truth is , that unless the population is empowered and revolutionary , this event seems unavoidable at this point in time , when the ruling elites are amassing more power , the working class is clasping to its wages , and the industrial military complex is expanding at the fastest pace in the history of mankind .

( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama is poised to restore the United States ' image in the international community , but experts say the president - elect must show the world that his actions will live up to his rhetoric .
People in Kisumu , Kenya , celebrate the election of Barack Obama .
Receiving a warm welcome is not the same as maintaining one , and Obama has a lot of work to do to improve the U.S. brand .
America 's image has declined in nearly every region of the world in recent years , but Obama 's victory " enables the United States to start again with a clean slate , " according to John Quelch , the senior associate dean at Harvard Business School .
" Americans can actually go to dinner parties and cocktail receptions around the world today and not have to apologize for the United States the way they have had to do the last several years , " he said .
" The election has made life a little bit easier for Americans living and traveling abroad to hold their head up high again . "
The United States ' tarnished reputation has been fueled by a combination of factors , including opposition to U.S. policies like the war Iraq and alleged torture and abuse of prisoners , the perception of hypocrisy , unilateralism , and the perceived war on Islam , according to a congressional report released in June .
Obama represents a " clean break " from the past , and his election is the first big step toward change , said Dick Martin , author of " Rebuilding Brand America . "
" Changing America 's standing in the world was going to be the work of a generation , and it would have to start with some kind of grand gesture that demonstrated that things were changing .
His election in itself is that kind of grand gesture , " he said .
Throughout the election season , Obama was largely well received across the globe .
More than 200,000 people came to watch his speech in Berlin , Germany , in July , according to police estimates -- and it was n't because they 'd read his book or memorized his policies .
" It was because they all felt that he was the incarnation of change and they admired him .
They had an emotional connection , " Martin said .
When Americans voted for Obama on November 4 , citizens around the world celebrated his resounding win .
People in cities and villages danced and cheered in the streets , and Kenya declared the day after the election a national holiday .
In China -- where the media is state - run and domestic stories are almost always the top stories -- newspaper headlines read " First Black President of the United States . "
When President Bush was elected for his second term , the cover on the U.K.'s Daily Mirror read , " How can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? "
The day after Obama 's victory , the paper 's cover read , " GOBAMA ! "
While the reaction around the world was mostly positive , some areas have been more hesitant to embrace Obama .
The day after the election , IslamOnline published an article titled , " Pakistanis Skeptical About Obama . "
In the months before the election , a survey by the Pew Research Center suggested little enthusiasm for Obama or Sen. John McCain in the Middle East , especially in Muslim nations .
But in general , people across the world have reacted with joy to Obama 's election because they are looking forward to the end of the unpopular presidency of Bush , said Robin Oakley , CNN 's European political editor based in London .
" The arrival of Obama , as an African - American president , gives people a reason -- an excuse even -- to start loving America again , " Oakley said .
But with expectations so high , experts say Obama will have to work to capitalize on the opportunity before him .
" Obama needs to show that he is prepared to listen to America 's allies , to consult with them genuinely on issues like Afghanistan and climate change , to open up to new thinking about Iran and Cuba , to re-shape the world 's economic institutions , " Oakley said .
The biggest thing Obama could do to reshape U.S. foreign policy would be to capture Osama bin Laden , Quelch said .
" For eight years he dodged George Bush and I think President - elect [ Obama ] has been pretty strong in terms of indicating his determination to secure bin Laden , " he said .
If that were to occur , Quelch said , " the U.S. could then in a sense close that chapter in its history and perhaps reopen dialogue with many parts of the Arab world that the relentless pursuit of al Qaeda and the Iraq war have closed off in the last few years . "
Obama must also bring a greater level of professionalism to the selection of the ambassadors he appoints , Quelch said .
" I think previous administrations have not served U.S. overseas interests and image that well by in some cases appointing cronies who have n't even set foot in the country to which they were appointed before they were named as ambassadors , " he said .
Martin said that most importantly , Obama must listen to what the international community wants if he wants to restore America 's reputation .
" The number one thing the people hold against us is that we do n't appear to take their interests into account , " he said .
Closing Guantanamo , adhering to the Geneva Conventions and eliminating torture are key issues for people around the world because they are the symbols of American unilateralism , Martin said .
Martin also suggested that Obama take a page out of President Eisenhower 's playbook and give the rest of the world an opportunity to experience American culture through an agency like the now - defunct United States Information Agency .
In addition to exposing the rest of the world to U.S. culture , Obama should also make sure young Americans are citizens of the world .
Martin recommends education reform , with an emphasis on world history and language classes .
" They think we are clueless , they absolutely think we are clueless , and in many cases we are , " pointing to a 2002 National Geographic study indicating that nearly a third of young Americans could not locate the Pacific Ocean .
Alessio Vinci , CNN's
Rome bureau chief , said that if the president - elect wants to change the world 's view of the United States , " Obama has to be Obama . "
" Obama 's support in Europe is pretty much based on the fact that most people on this side of the Atlantic are fed up with the Bush administration , not with America as a nation , " he said .

In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress , or of any ruling , regulation , or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States , the word “ marriage ” means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife , and the word “ spouse ” refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife .
Even with all the good news lately regarding spam , with Thanksgiving days away and Christmas around the corner , we can all safely assume cyber - criminals will be hard at work .
For the rest of us , that means having up - to - date security software and malware protection .
But with the popularity of smartphones such as the BlackBerry and Apple iPhone 3G on the rise , it may be time for consumers to start thinking about securing these devices as much as their desktops and laptops .
According to the latest Mobile Market View , a consumer study of U.S. mobile phone users conducted by The Kelsey Group with research partner ConStat , almost 19 percent of mobile users now use a smartphone .
Among those surveyed , more than 49 percent plan to purchase an advanced mobile device in the next two years .
The survey was conducted in October and included responses from 512 mobile phone users aged 18 and older .

While security vendors have been sounding the alarm around mobile malware for some time , the idea of a massive mobile malware attack has lived largely in the realm of the theoretical .
Compared with the threats to PCs , the amount of malware in the wild targeting mobile devices remains relatively small .
With that in mind , Gartner analyst John Girard noted that what consumers should be more concerned about is smartphones being lost or stolen .
" Most of the carriers offer smartphone data security and backup / restore services , " Girard said .
" There is value in them . "
Security vendors are trying to tackle this problem in their own way .
Kaspersky Lab , for example , includes a number of anti-theft features in its Kaspersky Mobile Security offering .
In the event of loss or theft , a user can send a hidden SMS ( Short Message Service ) message to block access to the phone until a preset password is entered .
A similar feature can also wipe the phone 's memory .
While smartphone theft or loss may be the bigger threat , the presence of malware targeting mobile phones suggests the saber - rattling by security vendors may be for good reason .
Take , for example , the polymorphic worm WinCE .
Pmcryptic .A , which targets smartphones running Windows CE platform on ARM processors .
As described by Symantec , the worm does little in the way of actual damage , but forces the phone to dial premium rate numbers .
Other threats such as WinCE .
Infomeiti steal information .
That particular worm , which targets the Windows CE platform and Windows Mobile 5.0 , only works on devices with a default language of Simplified Chinese .
Though the threat landscape in North America does n't seem to have caught up to the hype just yet , security vendors are placing their bets that the tide will turn soon .
A number of security vendors besides Kaspersky make products for smartphones , from McAfee and Symantec to smaller companies like ESET .
So while the immediate threats faced by mobile users remain nowhere near those faced by PC users , you may end up buying security software for your smartphone a few months from now anyway .
13 Tips to Building Self Esteem
Photo by Kevin Russ
People with high self - esteem are the most desired , and desirable people in society .
~
Can you recall the last time you were in an emotional slump , such that your beliefs in yourself and your abilities were slipping away ?
How can we maintain the beliefs we have in ourselves , such that we can live with less anxiety and more joy ?
Just imagine the things we would accomplish if we had the belief that we could do absolutely anything , especially if we could maintain a level of self - esteem that no circumstance could shake .
What would you be doing ?
Self - esteem comes from positive self - imaging , and it is something that we proactively build for ourselves .
Self - esteem does n’t happen while we wait passively .
When we leave it up to external factors , we build our self - esteem on sandy ground .
What we want is a rock - solid foundation , and this only comes from building it within .
Throughout our daily routines , our minds are very good at picking up all the things we ’ve done wrong , and it makes sure we are aware of them .
With such a counter - productive force at work , we can benefit greatly by regularly working towards establishing and building our own self image .
I ’ve learned that the way we view ourselves directly affects everything we do .
People with high self - esteem get along easily with others , rarely get sick , and seem to have high energy reserves .
Also , their high level of self - esteem corresponds with their high level of productivity , capacity of happiness and state of well - being .
A Personal Story …
As a style coach , I ( Jae ) am my own boss – which is a blessing and a curse .
Without a manager to report to , deadlines , or set schedules , I am responsible for enforcing these on myself – intrinsically .
I must do these things if I want to achieve my professional goals , even though it can feel like a burden at times .
Last month , after several previous hectic months of intense work , I had fallen into a lull .
Maybe you can relate with me …
It started with a few missed to - do items , then failure to deliver on a few commitments .
I could feel the self disappointment building inside .
I felt stressed .
I woke up each morning with the thought of making up for the previous day ’s failures , only to find myself failing once again .
Iin this vicious cycle my work started to accumulate , and for days I needed to push back on obligations and commitments .
I felt the grip on my self - esteem slipping , and was now scrambling to hang on to the remaining scraps of what was left of it .
I kept making excuses and rationalizations for why I was n’t getting stuff done , and as my integrity waned , I started to lose faith in myself and procrastinate even more .
This was me a month ago .
It has been a beautiful learning experience being able to observe myself in this state of mind , and ultimately learning how I overcame it .
A Closer Look
Self - esteem = how much we like ourselves .
How much we like ourselves = level of self - dominion .
What is self - dominion ?
It is our ability to get ourselves to actually do , what we want ourselves to do ; in other words , self - discipline and self - trust .
A person who has dominion over themselves has self - integrity – staying true to their words and commitments .
Every time we fail to listen to our inner voice , and do not take action in something that we need to , we lose trust with ourselves and our abilities .
This lack of self faith continues to spiral downwardly as we flounder to fulfill more commitments .
Turning Point : How to Start Building Self - Esteem
Photo : Mike Bailey - Gates
Most of us are familiar with the concept of momentum .
When we do something well , regardless of how small the task , we build positive energy and momentum , which can fuel other tasks on our list .
For example , if you have just washed all the dishes , mowed the lawn , and made calls to all of your clients , it will be easier for you – psychologically – to quickly move on to and complete the next task .
You will have built the momentum necessary to getting things done , and you are simply riding on that energy and building on previous successes .
On the flip side , when we put off what we want to do or know we should do , we lose momentum , and more importantly , we lose trust in ourselves .
Another way to view this is to pretend we have a personal assistant .
The better they perform on the tasks assigned to them , the more confident we will feel towards their abilities to handle responsibility .
Gradually , we will assign more important tasks to them as trust is established .
We now have faith in their abilities to follow through .
We trust them .
Conversely , if our assistant procrastinates and misses deadlines regularly , we will lose faith in their abilities to follow through .
We stop trusting them .
We stop giving them tasks ( at least the important ones ) , and we start to look for a replacement assistant .
Now , think of ourselves as our own assistant .
The more we follow through with actions , the more confidence and trust we ’ll establish with ourselves .
We will then gain faith in our ability to take on more tasks .
The small wins with ourselves , directly affect how much we like ourselves .
Each time we successfully follow through , the experience becomes a building block towards a more positive self image .
13 Tips to Building Self - Esteem
In order to build your self - esteem , you must establish yourself as the master of your own life .
Every single minute of your life is a moment you can change for the better .
If you ’ve been delaying some action for half the day , do n’t dwell on it or beat yourself up for it , shift your focus to the present moment and what you can do right now .
Start with the smallest or the most important task .

The following are tips to help build continuous upward momentum towards higher self esteem .
1. Start Small
Start with something you can do immediately and easily .
When we start with small successes , we build momentum to gain more confidence in our abilities .
Each completed task , regardless of how small , is a building block towards a more confident you .
What are some small actions you can take immediately to demonstrate that you are capable of achieving goals you ’ve set for yourself ?
For example , clean your desk , organize your papers , or pay all your bills .
2. Create a Compelling Vision
Use the power of your imagination .
Create an image of yourself as the confident and self - assured person you aspire to become .
When you are this person , how will you feel ?
How will others perceive you ?
What does your body language look like ?
How will you talk ?
See these clearly in your mind ’s eye , with your eyes closed .
Feel the feelings , experience being and seeing things from that person ’s perspective .
Practice doing this for 10 minutes every morning .
Put on music in the background that either relaxes you , or excites you .
When you are done , write a description of this person and all the attributes you ’ve observed .
3. Socialize
Get out of the house or setup a lunch date with a friend .
Socializing with others will give us opportunities to connect with other people , and practice our communication and interpersonal skills .
As with all skills , we get better with practice and repetition .
The more often we proactively do things that scare us , the less scary these situations will seem , and eventually will be rid of that fear .
5. Do Something You Are Good At
What are you especially good at or enjoy doing ?
Regularly doing things that you are good at reinforces your belief in your abilities and strengths .
I ( Tina ) can be very efficient with completing errands or administrative work .
Whenever I have a few hours filled with ways in which I ’ve maximized my time , I feel highly productive and this boosts the confidence have in my abilities as an organized and efficient person .
6. Set Goals
According to a study done at Virginia Tech , 80 % of Americans say they do n’t have goals .
And the people who regularly write down their goals earn nine times as much over their lifetime as people who do n’t .
By setting goals that are clear and actionable , you have a clear target of where you want to be .
When you take action towards that goal , you ’ll build more confidence and self - esteem in your abilities to follow through .
7. Help Others Feel Good About Themselves
Help somebody or teach them something .
When you help other people feel better about themselves and like themselves more , it will make you feel good about yourself .
See what you can do to make others feel good or trigger them to smile .
Maybe giving them a genuine compliment , helping them with something or telling them what you admire about them .
8. Get Clarity on Life Areas
Get clarity on the life area that needs the most attention .
Your self - esteem is the average of your self - concept in all the major areas of your life .
Write down all the major categories of your life , e.g. , health , relationships , finance , etc .
Then rate yourself on a scale of 1 - 10 in each area .
Work on the lowest numbered category first , unless they are all even .
Each area affects the other areas .
The more you build up each area of your life , the higher your overall self - esteem .
9. Create a Plan
Having a goal alone wo n’t do much .
Get clarity on your action items .
One of the biggest reasons people get lazy is because they do n’t have a plan to achieve their goals .
They do n’t know what the next step is and start to wander off randomly .
When you ’re baking a cake , it ’s a lot easier to follow a set of clear instructions , than randomly throwing ingredients together .
10 . Get Motivated
Read something inspirational , listen to something empowering , talk to someone who can uplift our spirits , who can motivate us to become a better person , to live more consciously , and to take proactive steps towards creating a better life for ourselves and our families .
11 . Get External Compliments
As funny as this point suggests , go find a friend or family member and ask them “ What do you like about me ? ” “ What are my strengths ? ” or “ What do you love about me ? ”
We will often value other people ’s opinions more than our own .
We are the best at beating ourselves up for things not done well , and we are the worst at recognizing what we ’ve done well in .
Hearing from another person our strengths and positive qualities helps to build a more positive image of ourselves .
12 . Affirmations & Introspection
Use affirmations , but in the right way .
Some people think that when they ’re in a slump , using positive affirmations will help them get out of it .
I love affirmations , but I ’ve realized you have to use them in the right way .
Sitting on your couch and saying “ I am highly motivated and productive ” does nothing .
Say something like “ I am sitting here being very unproductive right now , is this the ideal me ?
What would be my best self ? ”
Your affirmations have to be the TRUTH .
Once you ’re honest , take the first step towards doing the thing , no matter how small .
13 . No More Comparisons
Stop comparing yourself to other people .
Low - self esteem stems from the feeling of being inferior .
For example , if you were the only person in the world , do you think you could have low - self esteem ?
Self - esteem only comes into the picture when there are other people around us and we perceive that we are inferior .
Do n’t worry about what your neighbor is doing .
Accept that it ’ll serve you more to just go down your own path at your own pace rather than to compare yourself .
Pretend you ’re starting over and begin immediately with the smallest step forward .
Self - esteem comes from self - dominion .
The more power you have in getting yourself to take the right actions , the more self - esteem you will have .
Your level of self - esteem affects your happiness and everything you do .
** What did you do the last time you fell into a slump ?
What has been affective for you in developing your self - esteem ?

As I promised in my previous posts about so called IE8's " Clickjacking protection " , some hours ago I released the NoScript 1.8.9.9 development build , featuring experimental but complete compatibility with the X - FRAME - OPTIONS header support introduced by IE8 and unveiled yesterday by Eric Lawrence on the IE Blog .
As I said previously ,
this is just a cross - browser compatibility effort : neither Firefox nor NoScript really need this feature .
Traditional JavaScript - based frame busting works fine in Firefox , giving it the same degree of ( modest ) " protection " as IE8 .
NoScript users , on the other hand , are already fully protected , because ClearClick is the one and only countermeasure which works against any type of Clickjacking ( frame or embed based ) , no matter if web sites cooperate or not .
However I also said this is nice to have .
I had already imagined a functionally similar declarative solution , the SUB pseudo - method of ABE rules , and HTTP - based restrictions can actually be easier to deploy in some scenarios ( e.g. using a Web Application Firewall ) .
More important , not every IT manager will have a chance of reading the reasons I exposed so far , explaining why IE8 has no more " Clickjacking protection " than its competitors .
Our typical decision maker will just read a bullet list including " Clickjacking protection " , will find that no other browser dares such a claim and will base his choice ( also ) on that misleading comparison .
So let 's add this bullet , even if it does nothing against Clickjacking that " alternative browsers " could n't already do with traditional frame busting .
The following screenshot shows the original IE8 implementation as can be tested on my demo page :
And this is X - IFRAME - OPTIONS in action on Firefox ( kindly provided by NoScript for now , but already in the works as a built - in ) :
But now that we 've got " bullet parity " , let 's put the marketspeak aside and keep enjoying the only Clickjacking protection that really works " out of the box " : your friendly neighborhood ClearClick :)

Failed US Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin has responded to rumors that she will run for President in 2012 by saying God will “ show her the way . ”
In an exclusive interview with Fox News this evening , Palin said of a run in 2012 : “ I ca n’t predict what ’s going to happen a day from now , much less four years from now ”
“ You know , I have — faith is a very big part of my life .
And putting my life in my creator ’s hands — this is what I always do , ” Palin said .
“ I ’m like , OK , God , if there is an open door for me somewhere , this is what I always pray , I ’m like , do n’t let me miss the open door .
Show me where the open door is , ” she added .
“ Even if it ’s cracked up a little bit , maybe I ’ll plow right on through that and maybe prematurely plow through it , but do n’t let me miss an open door . ”
“ And if there is an open door in ’ 12 or four years later , and if it is something that is going to be good for my family , for my state , for my nation , an opportunity for me , then I ’ll plow through that door . ”

The White House , stung by its loss in the Senate and the prospect of falling markets , opened the door to possibly using Treasury financial market rescue funds .

W.H. revives hopes on auto rescue
The White House , stung by its loss in the Senate and the prospect of falling markets , opened the door Friday to possibly using Treasury financial market rescue funds to prop up the auto industry until a new Congress convenes in January .
“ Under normal economic conditions we would prefer that markets determine the ultimate fate of private firms , ” the administration said in a statement .
“ However , given the current weakened state of the U.S. economy , we will consider other options if necessary – including use of the TARP program — to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers .

“ A precipitous collapse of this industry would have a severe impact on our economy , and it would be irresponsible to further weaken and destabilize our economy at this time . ”
TARP is the acronym for the Treasury ’s “ troubled assets relief program ” for which Congress approved up to $ 700 billion earlier this fall .
About $ 15 billion remains available from the first $ 350 billion installment , and that would be sufficient to keep General Motors Corp. from slipping into bankruptcy .
Until its new statement , the administration has insisted that the TARP funds be kept in reserve for only the financial markets , and the White House instead pursued a $ 14 billion emergency loan package for automakers to be financed from prior appropriations within the Energy Department .
That effort collapsed Thursday night in the Senate when Republicans withheld their support and the bill was blocked on a 52 - 35 roll call — eight votes short of the 60 needed to move forward .
The Federal Reserve could yet help , but Chairman Ben Bernanke has warned Congress that he would be extremely reluctant to step into the auto crisis — especially if lawmakers could not agree on action among themselves .
That puts the burden back on Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , and it appears the administration is now moving in that direction rather than risk major bankruptcies in these last weeks in power .
GM estimates it needs $ 4 billion by the end of this month to stay afloat and another cash installment in January , when Chrysler LLC is also in peril .
“ While the federal government may need to step in to prevent an immediate failure , the auto companies , their labor unions , and all other stakeholders must be prepared to make the meaningful concessions necessary to become viable , ” the administration said Friday .
Going forward , one question is whether the Treasury or Commerce Department , which has been active in the auto debate , will take the role of “ auto czar ” — an executive position authorized in the failed bill but an idea Bush could begin to implement even as he cedes power to the incoming Obama administration .
Sen . Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat and strong industry ally , said he was “ encouraged ” by the White House ’s statement .
“ Use of TARP funds is the fastest , most feasible , most immediate and most certain approach to provide the emergency bridge loans needed by the auto companies , ” Levin said .
“ It was always the intent of the TARP program to assist industries whose collapse would have a major impact on the economy , including the financial sector . “
“ I am hopeful that the president will act promptly to prevent this collapse and the resulting calamity for our economy . ”
After watching Blade Runner recently on late - night television , I wondered : whatever happened to all those scientists ' predictions that humans would be having sex with robots by now – or at least in the very near future ?
After all , Ridley Scott 's film is only set in 2019 .
I still can't imagine having a hot replicant boyfriend any time soon – a battery - operated vibrator is about as high - tech as it gets for me .
Others , however , are fast becoming accustomed to using technology to take things a step further : men already go online to purchase custom - made " real dolls " , which are like silicon Stepford Wives minus the vocal cords , and cost several thousand pounds .
Fans claim they are a viable alternative for the lonely and socially awkward .
But can it really be healthy to seek out intimacy with an inanimate object ?
At the same time that technology is causing some people to withdraw from the dating game – preferring online porn and virtual sex to the real thing – the sheer volume of specialised websites means that huge numbers of people are now connecting in ways that they never have before .
Though most deviant sexual behaviours have been around for ages ( the Romans were having orgies , after all ) the Noughties have ushered in the normalisation of fetishes – and made it vastly more easy to find others with similar tastes .
These days , BDSM ( Bondage , Domination and Sado - Masochism ) has gone from underground fringe clubs to housewives browsing spanking paddles online and in high - street sex shops .

Sex parties , too , have shed their image of dumpy , middle - aged couples circling a bowl of car keys , and now upmarket swinging events such as Fever and Killing Kittens cater to young and more conventionally attractive couples by using their website to vet applicants .
These days , more and more single women are taking the plunge .
Technology has also made casual hook - ups – and infidelity – simpler than ever : a well - placed digital photo and a reasonably witty online profile can bring dozens of responses within a few hours .
And there are niche markets for everything ( among the more obscure I 've come across : love connections for the freakishly tall and even for devotees of the American writer Ayn Rand ) .
But what a friend of mine calls " the crack cocaine of online dating " does have its risks .
Ultimately , it 's much easier to hide one 's true intentions behind the anonymity of a keyboard , and to lie .
I 've met men who happily crop out years of their life ( and children ! ) as easily as the woman standing next to them in their profile picture .
Of course , not everyone online is a cheater .
Some people are completely open about their alter egos , and use their " avatars " to have cybersex on sites such as Second Life .
And many see it purely as a form of escapism , and have no intention of actually meeting in person .
The internet does , of course , provide people with fetishes with an easy way of finding each other .
I personally would not want to change an adult baby 's nappy , but it seems there are people out there who want to breast - feed and role - play a nanny scenario .
And it 's much easier to send an e-mail through a website than to mention the subject casually on a first date .
In a world bombarded by hyper - sexualised images , even those who identify themselves as asexual or celibate are able to surf over the sea of pornography and connect with people who understand them .
Modern sex , to me , is about easy connectivity , and open - mindedness – whether your sexual soulmate wants to be spanked over a desk or likes to dress up as a giant squirrel .
Today , there really is something for everyone .
The doll fetishist
James , 52 , civil servant
I suppose you could say that I am a recluse .
I 've always lived on my own and find it hard to make friends or have happy relationships – I 've got a history of unsuccessful relationships with women .
I did hope that eventually I would find happiness settling down with a partner and I have tried internet chatrooms and online dating but nothing worked .
A few years ago I watched a TV documentary about men who live with " real dolls " ( see introduction ) and thought it might be the perfect solution as I was extremely lonely at the time .
I contacted an online company that makes dolls to order and although I was very nervous about the whole thing they put me at my ease and helped me decide what sort of doll I wanted .
Alice cost me about £ 6,000 and via the company 's website I was able to customise every area of her looks and physical attributes – I admit it seems childish but I got a real kick out of creating my fantasy woman .
She 's aged about 25 and has dark hair and the perfect body .
I also enjoyed being able to choose all her clothes at the click of a mouse ; perhaps it 's the power thing that appeals – being in control of every aspect of her .
Whe she first arrived , it was a very surreal feeling having this gorgeous and life - like silicone creature sitting opposite me in the lounge .
Very gradually , however , I have got used to having her around and now I have grown to love her as I would a real woman .
I know it must seem pretty sad , but for me , she 's everything .
I think of her primarily as a companion , although obviously she fulfils my sexual needs too – in my experience it's a lot easier and more pleasurable than the real thing !
I like the fact that she 's always there for me ; she eats with me , sits and watches TV with me and sleeps with me .
I have n't told anyone about Alice ; my work colleagues would laugh at me and if my neighbours saw her they would probably freak out too .
To me , however , it 's the perfect partnership – and what harm am I doing to anyone else ?
The internet sex addict
Simon , 38 , regional sales director
I got into internet sex by accident ; I was n't even looking for sex .
I was at work about four years ago and a friend was registered to one of those dating sites , and he was having a whale of a time .
He was single at the time and went out on lots of dates with different women and met them once or twice and then slept with them and after that he did n't really see them again .
I joined my first internet website for a laugh when I was bored , and I could n't believe how easy it was to meet up with women .
I said I was single on my profile but I was married , of course .
I hooked up with one or two girls in the first couple of months but they were all looking for relationships and I was n't .
I felt a bit guilty , to be honest .
I was already lying to my wife and I did n't want to have to start lying to another woman as well .
After that I discovered some other specialist websites where married people can contact each other for a bit of flirting and then hooking up .
I usually meet the women in a bar first and then maybe we 'll go to a hotel .
I spend a fair amount of time surfing the sites , maybe an hour or two a day when I 'm at work and then maybe an hour or two at home .
I do n't think it 's excessive , though – people spend hours and hours on Facebook , do n't they ?
It 's not that I do n't love my wife or that we do n't have sex – we do !
But we 've been married for 12 years now and we 've got small kids and it's not really the same as it used to be .
I suppose you might call me highly - sexed .
It 's just sex , pure and simple .
I do n't sneak around with the same woman , and I 'm not having a big romance behind my wife 's back .
And I never really have to worry about her finding out because , first , the women I sleep with are married , too – so it 's not in their interests to tell my wife – and second , I 'm incredibly careful .
My wife could go through my computer with a toothcomb and she would n't find a thing .
What surprised me about it all was how many women there are out there who were really up for casual sex with someone who 's not their husband .
I know so many men who say things like , " Oh my wife would n't cheat on me , " and I laugh and think , OK , whatever , mate – she probably already has , with someone just like me .
The modern Mrs Robinson
Marian , 54 , interiors consultant
I was with my husband for 25 years and then he ran off with one of our neighbours and we got divorced .
It was quite funny really , looking back on it .
I do n't miss him at all ; it was the best thing that happened to me .
But at the time I was really angry and sad .
I kept the house after the divorce and my children were grown - up and I had plenty of money and I sat down one day and thought , " What the hell am I going to do with the rest of my life ? "
Eventually I hit on the idea of starting my own interiors company , and I was contacted by this woman who was having her whole house re-done after getting a divorce , just like me .
We started chatting and she told me about a website where she met young men online for sex .
She said it was brilliant and I should give it a go .
So I went online , and within a fortnight I was dating this amazing boy .
He was only about 30 .
He was amazing - looking and wanted to do all the things that men my age just are n't interested in .
We went out to the theatre and to the movies and out for dinner and he was just so fun and alive .
We saw each other for about three months and then he sort of disappeared , and I did n't mind at all .
When I was younger I would maybe have been a bit upset but I did n't give a damn .
When men get into their forties and fifties they do n't want to do anything .
They just talk about their new cars and sit on the sofa flicking through the channels with the remote .
And now I 've got so much energy .
Ten years ago I felt totally dead , like a zombie , but now I jump out of bed in the mornings .
Life is so exciting .
No one believes me when I say it , but going out with much younger men is not just about the actual sex – even though the sex is great and young men these days know much more about it than men my age .
The fundamental thing for me is that men in their twenties are a better match for women in their fifties and sixties than men of the same age are .
I went on some dates with men my own age after Keith left and all they wanted was a replacement wife to wash their pants .
I was n't having any of that .
I 'm seeing a couple of boys at the moment , but nothing serious .
And I do n't care really .
This time in my life is just for me – for as long as I can remember it 's been about other people , my husband and my children .
Now it 's just for me and I love it .
The party animal

People think that sex parties are really seedy but actually , they 're not .
They 're much less seedy than most nightclubs , in a way .
Firstly , there are so many sex - party swinging sites on the internet , so you can do lots of research in the comfort of your own home .
Once you decide to actually go to a sex party , there 's no pressure on anyone to do anything ; it 's usually just a fun atmosphere with people standing about chatting – quite often just drinking tea or something .
I got into swinging , at first , with my then boyfriend Tim , when I took him to a swingers ' party in Brighton for his birthday present .
He actually did n't enjoy it that much , but I thought it was really fun .
The people were nice and there was hardly any drinking or taking drugs or anything like that .
There were living - room areas , where you could n't get up to anything particularly racy , and then bedrooms upstairs , some with the lights on and some with the lights off , where you could go for more explicit action .
I broke up with Tim about a year later .
We had n't been back to any swingers ' parties but I had had sex with someone else at that first party with my boyfriend looking on in the same room and I do n't think he enjoyed it ; we both realised that we had such different levels of inhibition .
I 'm not at all shy !
After I broke up with Tim , I went online and signed up for what I suppose you 'd call an orgy .
It 's just the same as a swingers ' party , really , except that not everyone is in a couple .
It was just really fun .
I met so many like - minded people ; it was n't just about sex , it was about being yourself and letting go a bit .
There 's no pussyfooting around – so if you meet someone and think , " I really like you " and if they like you back , you can just have sex without anyone judging you or thinking you 're weird .
I 'd never tell my family or some of my more straight friends about this .
I do n't think they'd get it and there 's no point in trying to explain to someone who is n't open - minded what you get out of it .
They 'd just think I was being a bit of a slag , and I 'm not at all .
I do n't feel ready to have a steady relationship now .
Even if a prospective partner was really amazingly cool , I would n't introduce him to the idea of a swinging party because nine times out of 10 he'd be scared off by it .
The asexual
Mark , 44 , scientific glassblower
I 've always known that I was different from other people , especially when I hit puberty and found that I just was n't interested in sex in the same way that my friends were .
I also found my own gender more interesting and nicer - looking than the opposite sex , so I thought I might be gay .
Back in the Seventies , there was still a lot of homophobia .
I started hanging out on the gay scene , which led me to being in bed with people , sometimes men , sometimes women – and I realised that I 'm not capable of sex .
I just do n't get aroused .
I did have relationships , but they tended to be very short - lived .
I greatly enjoy physical contact , such as hugging , as well as companionship , but unfortunately once people realise that there 's not going to be any sex , the relationship usually comes to an end .
My longest relationship was in 1997 with a man .
We were together for 10 months and it was a sort of mutually beneficial arrangement whereby he tolerated my affections and I was his ticket to friends and parties .
When that ended I thought : this is a pointless pursuit .
My brother , to whom I 'm really close , went through a divorce a couple of years ago and I was driving in a car with him and talking about relationships .
And I told him .
I said , " I 'm asexual . "
And he said , " You lucky bastard ! "
We laughed so much !
I think some people still assume that I 'm gay but if they do then it 's not an issue .
My brother later told me that my parents had asked him more than once if I was gay .
I suppose they thought it was strange that I never brought anyone home .
My life really changed when I saw a piece in the paper in 2004 about the differences between asexuality and celibacy – in the former there is no sexual attraction and in the latter a conscious decision is made not to have sex .
I saw it and it was a total epiphany .
I was so thrilled to find there were other people like me .
There 's a range of different kind of asexuals – some are born that way ( like me ) and some become that way over time .
At the end of the article there was a reference to AVEN ( asexuality.org ) , the website for the asexual community , and I joined up straight away .
When I went to the first meet - up it was a revelation to meet other people who felt the same way as I did .
There 's always a lot of stuff going on and I 've got a busy social life – although I do worry a bit about what things will be like when I get older and I 'm on my own .
The adult baby
John , 45 , computer programmer
My mother walked out on my family when I was four , so I think I always craved being nurtured by a female figure .
My two older sisters and I were looked after by a very strict nanny at our house in Nottingham , who showed us no affection .
My father would come home late from work and was of the " children should be seen and not heard " school of thought .
My sisters and I spent a lot of time on our own and would invent games where they would play at being nurses and would give me baths , get me dressed and so on .
I have always been quite sexually dysfunctional and my sisters have n't managed to form lasting relationships either .
When I was in my early twenties I started a string of relationships with older women and realised that I was fantasising about a mother figure .
Things started to spiral out of control when I had strong fantasies about dressing up as a baby – it 's called infantilism .
At the beginning , being honest about my desires was very hard .
I felt like a pervert and did n't know who to turn to .
Then I confessed to one of my older girlfriends and she encouraged me to seek professional counselling .
My counsellor helped me to understand the root causes for my predilections – a lack of love in childhood – but although she encouraged me to stop dressing as a baby I was n't able to achieve this .
I then discovered an online adult - babies ' club in south - east England where I found like - minded people who wanted , as I do , to dress up in adult - sized baby clothes and behave as a baby might do .
This might include being bathed by " nannies " , wearing nappies and being " breast - fed " .
I realise that it sounds weird , but it gives me some sort of comfort at the same time as addressing my sexual needs .
The fact that it 's all done anonymously through the web provides me with extra privacy , too .
For some time now , during the months of June and July of 2007 , Eden and I had noticed that Bow was showing signs of literacy .
We would put up a number of new lexigrams -- words
Bow had never seen before -- and he would choose the right one to ask for what he wanted , without trial and error .
We kept asking ourselves how he did this .
For instance , we put out a tent for Bow to play with .
Two other unfamiliar words were posted along with the word for tent , which he also had never seen as a lexigram .
( However , the word was in his vocabulary for spoken English . )
He went directly for the lexigram tent without hesitating .
The same thing happened when we presented the Hebrew word for tent as a lexigram for the first time with two other unfamiliar words .
Other things that made us suspect that Bow was relying on spelling were the fact that he often confused words that were spelled similarly , even if they meant completely different things .
The Hebrew word for " chicken " , and the Hebrew word for " chase " both end and begin with a taff .
Bow sometimes confused them , but he did not confuse words for different foods or different games .
Clearly , it was the spelling -- the sequence of letters that composed the lexigram -- that caught his attention .
One day , ( August 17 , 2007 , to be exact ) , Eden decided to try an experiment to test Bow 's ability to spell .
I gave her a little hand - held computer like device that had a tiny keyboard .
She took Bow into the outer pens and asked him how to spell his name .
Without hesitation , Bow pressed the B , and the B came on the screen .
He then pressed the O , but much more lightly , and the O did not appear on the screen .
Then he stopped .
He would not press the W , no matter what .
Encouraged by this incident , Eden took down all the lexigrams from the glass and replaced them with English letters .
She posted the letters on the glass in no particular order .
Some of the letters were posted in duplicate , in more than one spot .
Then she brought Bow in , placing a selection of foods in his view .
What follows is a transcript of what happened .

Earlier this year , I published an article in City Journal called “ Child - Man in the Promised Land . ”
The piece elicited a roaring flood of mailed and blogged responses , mostly from young men who did n’t much care for its title ( a reference to Claude Brown ’s 1965 novel Manchild in the Promised Land ) or its thesis : that too many single young males ( SYMs ) were lingering in a hormonal limbo between adolescence and adulthood , shunning marriage and children , and whiling away their leisure hours with South Park reruns , marathon sessions of World of Warcraft , and Maxim lists of the ten best movie fart scenes .
It would be easy enough to hold up some of the callow ranting that the piece inspired as proof positive of the child - man ’s existence .
But the truth is that my correspondents ’ objections gave me pause .
Their argument , in effect , was that the SYM is putting off traditional markers of adulthood — one wife , two kids , three bathrooms — not because he ’s immature but because he ’s angry .
He ’s angry because he thinks that young women are dishonest , self - involved , slutty , manipulative , shallow , controlling , and gold - digging .
He ’s angry because he thinks that the culture disses all things male .
He ’s angry because he thinks that marriage these days is a raw deal for men .
Here ’s Jeff from Middleburg , Florida : “ I am not going to hitch my wagon to a woman . . . who is more into her abs , thighs , triceps , and plastic surgery .
A woman who seems to have forgotten that she did graduate high school and that it ’s time to act accordingly . ”
Jeff , meet another of my respondents , Alex : “ Maybe we turn to video games not because we are trying to run away from the responsibilities of a ‘ grown - up life ’ but because they are a better companion than some disease - ridden bar tramp who is only after money and a free ride . ”
Care for one more ?
This is from Dean in California : “ Men are finally waking up to the ever - present fact that traditional marriage , or a committed relationship , with its accompanying socially imposed requirements of being wallets with legs for women , is an empty and meaningless drudgery . ”
You can find the same themes posted throughout websites like AmericanWomenSuck , NoMarriage , MGTOW ( Men Going Their Own Way ) , and Eternal Bachelor ( “ Give modern women the husband they deserve .
None ” ) .
The reason for all this anger , I submit , is that the dating and mating scene is in chaos .
SYMs of the postfeminist era are moving around in a Babel of miscues , cross-purposes , and half - conscious , contradictory female expectations that are alternately proudly egalitarian and coyly traditional .
And because middle - class men and women are putting off marriage well into their twenties and thirties as they pursue Ph.D.s , J.D.s , or their first $ 50,000 salaries , the opportunities for heartbreak and humiliation are legion .
Under these harsh conditions , young men are looking for a new framework for understanding what ( or , as they might put it , WTF ) women want .
So far , their answer is unlikely to satisfy anyone — either women or , in the long run , themselves .
Now , men and women have probably been a mystery to one another since the time human beings were in trees ; one reason people developed so many rules around courtship was that they needed some way to bridge the Great Sexual Divide .
By the early twentieth century , things had evolved so that in the United States , at any rate , a man knew the following : he was supposed to call for a date ; he was supposed to pick up his date ; he was supposed to take his date out , say , to a dance , a movie , or an ice - cream joint ; if the date went well , he was supposed to call for another one ; and at some point , if the relationship seemed charged enough — or if the woman got pregnant — he was supposed to ask her to marry him .
Sure , these rules could end in a midlife crisis and an unhealthy fondness for gin , but their advantage was that anyone with an emotional IQ over 70 could follow them .
Today , though , there is no standard scenario for meeting and mating , or even relating .
For one thing , men face a situation — and I ’m not exaggerating here — new to human history .
Never before have men wooed women who are , at least theoretically , their equals — socially , professionally , and sexually .
By the time men reach their twenties , they have years of experience with women as equal competitors in school , on soccer fields , and even in bed .
Small wonder if they initially assume that the women they meet are after the same things they are : financial independence , career success , toned triceps , and sex .
But then , when an SYM walks into a bar and sees an attractive woman , it turns out to be nothing like that .
The woman may be hoping for a hookup , but she may also be looking for a husband , a co-parent , a sperm donor , a relationship , a threesome , or a temporary place to live .
She may want one thing in November and another by Christmas .
“ I ’ve gone through phases in my life where I bounce between serial monogamy , Very Serious Relationships and extremely casual sex , ” writes Megan Carpentier on Jezebel , a popular website for young women .
“ I ’ve slept next to guys on the first date , had sex on the first date , allowed no more than a cheek kiss , dispensed with the date - concept altogether after kissing the guy on the way to his car , fucked a couple of close friends and , more rarely , slept with a guy I did n’t care if I ever saw again . ”
Okay , wonders the ordinary guy with only middling psychic powers , which is it tonight ?
In fact , young men face a bewildering multiplicity of female expectations and desire .
Some women are comfortable asking , “ What ’s your name again ? ” when they look across the pillow in the morning .
But plenty of others are looking for Mr. Darcy .
In her interviews with 100 unmarried , college - educated young men and women , Jillian Straus , author of Unhooked Generation , discovered that a lot of women had “ personal scripts ” — explicit ideas about how a guy should act , such as walking his date home or helping her on with her coat .
Straus describes a 26 - year - old journalist named Lisa fixed up for a date with a 29 - year - old social worker .
When he arrives at her door , she ’s delighted to see that he ’s as good - looking as advertised .
But when they walk to his car , he makes his first mistake : he fails to open the car door for her .
Mistake Number
Two comes a moment later : “ So , what would you like to do ? ” he asks .
“ Her idea of a date is that the man plans the evening and takes the woman out , ” Straus explains .
But how was the hapless social worker supposed to know that ?
In fact , Doesn ’t - Open - the - Car - Door Guy might well have been chewed out by a female colleague for reaching for the office door the previous week .
The cultural muddle is at its greatest when the dinner check arrives .
The question of who grabs it is a subject of endless discussion on the hundreds of Internet dating sites .
The general consensus among women is that a guy should pay on a first date : they see it as a way for him to demonstrate interest .
Many men agree , but others find the presumption confusing .
Are n’t the sexes equal ?
In fact , at this stage in their lives , women may well be in a better position to pick up the tab : according to a 2005 study by Queens College demographer Andrew Beveridge , college - educated women working full - time are earning more than their male counterparts in a number of cities , including New York , Chicago , Boston , and Minneapolis .
Sure , girls can — and do — ask guys out for dinner and pick up the check without missing a beat .
But that does n’t clarify matters , men complain .
Women can take a Chinese - menu approach to gender roles .
They can be all “ Let me pay for the movie tickets ” on Friday night and “ A single rose ?
That ’s it ? ” on Valentine ’s Day .
This is n’t equality , say the male - contents ; it ’s a ratification of female privilege and , worse , caprice .
“ Women seemingly have decided that they want it all ( and deserve it , too ) , ” Kevin from Ann Arbor writes .
“ They want to compete equally , and have the privileges of their mother ’s generation .
They want the executive position , AND the ability to stay home with children and come back into the workplace at or beyond the position at which they left .
They want the bad boy and the metrosexual . ”
This attraction to bad boys is by far guys ’ biggest complaint about contemporary women .
Young men grew up hearing from their mothers , their teachers , and Oprah that women wanted sensitive , kind , thoughtful , intelligent men who were in touch with their feminine sides , who shared their feelings , who enjoyed watching Ally McBeal rather than Beavis and Butt - Head .
Yeah , right , sneer a lot of veterans of the scene .
Women do n’t want Ashley Wilkes ; they ’re hot for Rhett Butler , for macho men with tight abs and an emotional range to match .
One popular dating guru , David DeAngelo , ranks “ Being Too Much of a Nice Guy ” as Number One on his list of the “ Ten Most Dangerous Mistakes Men Make with Women . ”
At a website with the evocative name RelationShit.com ( “ Brutally honest dating advice for the cynical , bitter , and jaded ” and sociological cousin of DatingIsHell.net ) , the most highly trafficked pages are those dedicated to the question of why women do n’t like good guys .
A website ( and book ) called Hot Chicks with Douchebags rubs it in by offering pictures of jerks — we know by their ripped jeans , five o’clock shadow , gelled hair , and bling — standing next to adoring , bikini - clad blondes .
According to a “ Recovering Nice Guy ” writing on Craigslist , the female preference for jerks and “ assholes , ” as they ’re also widely known , lies behind women ’s age - old lament , “ What happened to all the nice guys ? ”
His answer : “ You did .
You ignored the nice guy .
You used him for emotional intimacy without reciprocating , in kind , with physical intimacy . ”
Women , he says , are actually not attracted to men who hold doors for them , give them hinted - for Christmas gifts , or listen to their sorrows .
Such a man , our Recovering Nice Guy continues , probably “ came to realize that , if he wanted a woman like you , he ’d have to act more like the boyfriend that you had .
He probably cleaned up his look , started making some money , and generally acted like more of an asshole than he ever wanted to be . ”
Adding to the bitterness of many SYMs is the feeling that the entire culture is a you - go - girl cheering section .
When our guy was a boy , the media prattled on about “ girl power , ” parents took their daughters to work , and a mysterious plague seemed to have killed off boys , at least white ones , from school textbooks .
To this day , male - bashing is the lingua franca of situation comedies and advertising : take the dimwitted television dads from Homer Simpson to Ray Romano to Tim Allen , or the guy who starts a cooking fire to be put out by his multitasking wife , who is already ordering takeout .
Further , it ’s hard to overstate the distrust of young men who witnessed divorce up close and personal as they were growing up .
Not only have they become understandably wary of till - death - do - us - part promises ; they frequently suspect that women are highway robbers out to relieve men of their earnings , children , and deepest affections .
As the disenchanted SYM sees it , then , resistance to settling down is a rational response to a dating environment designed and ruled by women with only their own interests in mind .
“ Men see all of this , and wonder if it ’s really worth risking all in the name of ‘ romance ’ and ‘ growing up , ’ ” a correspondent who calls himself Wytchfinde explains .
“ After all , if women can be hedonistic and change the rules in midstream when it suits them , why should n’t men ?
Why should men be responsible when women refuse to look into the mirror at their own lack of accountability ? ”
So , men like Wytchfinde conclude : No more Mister Nice Guy !
They will dump all those lessons from their over - feminized childhood and adolescence .
They will join what the Boston Globe has called the “ Menaissance . ”
And they will buy titles like The Alphabet of Manliness ( K is for Knockers , Q is for Quickies ) , The Retrosexual Manual , Being the Strong Man a Woman Wants , and actor Jim Belushi ’s recent Real Men Do n’t Apologize .
By far the most important philosopher of the Menaissance is Charles Darwin .
The theory that human sexual preferences evolved from the time that hominids successfully reproduced in the primeval African grasslands can explain the mystery of women ’s preference for macho — or alpha —males .
At the same time , evolutionary theory gives the former wuss permission to pursue massive amounts of sex with an endless assortment of women .
Finally , the emphasis that Darwinism places on natural selection encourages him to adapt to the brutal current sexual ecosystem .
Culture , in both its feminist and Emily Post forms , has n’t won him any favor with women , so he will embrace Nature in all its rude harshness .
For one illustration of dating à la Darwin , consider what ’s known as the Seduction Community .
The Community is a loose network of dating coaches , gurus , and their followers whose philosophical origins lie variously in Darwin , Norman Vincent Peale , and hyperlogical geekdom .
Women want alpha males , the Seduction Community agrees ; with some effort at self - improvement , any man can learn the game — Game , as it is reverently known — that will turn him into a Pick Up Artist ( PUA ) .
A highly skilled PUA can get any woman , even an HB10 ( Hot Babe who is a perfect 10 ; Game has more acronyms and rankings than the Department of Defense does ) .
It ’s impossible to know just how many wannabe PUAs there are out there , but judging from the multitude of websites like AlphaSeduction , Fast Seduction 101 , Grow Your Game , SeductionTutor , and The Seduction Chronicles , as well as chat rooms , conferences , ads for seduction gurus , boot camps not just in the United States but all over Europe and parts of Asia , and books , including Neil Strauss ’s 2005 best - selling The Game , their numbers are considerable .
Game is best understood as an SYM attempt to bring order to contemporary dating confusion .
“ Things do n’t make sense anymore , that ’s why we need pickup , ” one commenter on Fast Seduction 101 explains .
It teaches the ordinary nice guy — in Gamespeak , the Average Frustrated Chump ( AFC ) — how to reinvent himself to survive in a ruthless dating environment .
That means desensitizing the AFC to rejection and , alas , building up his jerk quotient .
Teachers encourage clients to project confidence and sexual energy , what is called , depending on the guru , “ cocky funny ” or “ amused mastery . ”
In The Aquarian , a New York–based music magazine , Kevin Purcell describes his experience at a Game workshop : “ One of our first tasks was to walk around the hotel silent , repeating in our heads ‘ I do n’t give a fuck what anyone thinks about me . ’
This mentality , it was assumed , would help lower the wall of anxiety and make us less prone to the pain of rejection .
Like soldiers responding to a drill sergeant , when asked ‘ What are you ? ’ we were instructed to loudly proclaim , ‘ A fucking ten ! ’ ”
Sealing the deal for Darwinists is their quarry ’s biological clock .
The main reason that young educated adults are increasingly marrying in their late twenties and thirties is that women are pursuing education and careers , but ironically , the delay works to men ’s advantage .
Once they get past their awkward late teens and early twenties , men begin to lose their metaphorical baby fat .
They ’re making more money , the pool of available women has grown , and they have more confidence .
“ I could get a woman now , but when I ’m 30 or 35 I could do better , ” Bryson , an otherwise nice - guy 24 - year - old from D.C. , tells me .
Darwinist dating may explain the litany of stories you hear from women about the troglodytes in their midst .
“ We can be slovenly from the start , ” one interview subject told Amy Cohen in her dating column for the New York Observer , “ because we can get laid anytime we want . ”
Remember those women who want a guy who will open the car door for them ?
They may be lucky if they find one willing to add “ please ” to “ Pass the ketchup . ”
Women complain that instead of calling to ask them out , or even make plans for a date , men simply text , “ Heading downtown .
Where r u ? ” as they walk to the subway .
That may be deliberate .
“ There is no longer any reason to answer the phone when a woman calls you or return her call when she leaves you a message , ” insists one dating pro at World of Seduction .
“ What should you do ?
Text message , of course . ”
Text messages , he argues , deflect unnecessary personal involvement and keep women on edge .
Game goes even further , actually encouraging men to “ neg ” their “ target ” women — that is , to undermine their confidence subtly by ignoring or mildly insulting them .
The hotter the woman , the more essential it is to neg her .
Indeed , the Darwinists wonder , why pretend we ’re interested in anything other than sex ?
Jillian Straus recalls meeting a man at a Hamptons pool party who , early on in their conversation , asked : “ So , are you getting any ? ”
One of Cohen ’s lessons in contemporary politesse came on a first date with a man who asked her how many guys she had slept with and whether she owned a vibrator .
Darwinian mores , or anti-mores , also explain the brutal status jockeying that pervades the contemporary dating scene and that makes the high school cafeteria look like a feminist utopia .
Check out DarwinDating.com , a matchmaking website “ created exclusively for beautiful , desirable people . ”
Members rank your picture on a scale of one to five and vote on whether to let you join their honored ranks or throw you into the slush pile of “ saggy , ” “ hairy , ” “ sweaty , ” “ nerdy ” rejects .
My 28 - year - old daughter tells me of a friend , a Yale alum and Stanford business school graduate , who asked her , apropos of nothing , “ If you ranked women from one to ten , one being Ugly Betty and ten being Elizabeth Hurley , what number could I get ? ” Jillian Straus describes a 34 - year - old sales manager from Dallas who says that his current girlfriend meets just six out of his ten requirements for the perfect girlfriend .
When they go out together , he ’s constantly looking for an “ upgrade . ”
Men are convinced that they are no worse — and probably a good deal better — than women in making these calculations .
With good Darwinian logic , though , they believe that women tend to do their reckoning on the basis of wallet size rather than pulchritude .
“ Girls are really good at that kind of math , ” one jaded twentysomething man writes to me about his entry - level salary .
In a review of the movie Sex and the City , the English author Toby Young remembers the five years he had lived in New York : “ Attractive single girls not only dropped their ‘ dates ’ at the slightest whiff of a bigger , better deal , they routinely betrayed their girlfriends , too . ”
( As his only half - facetious name suggests , Carrie ’s Mr. Big is pure alpha—rich and , as if proving the conclusions of recovering nice guys everywhere , a bit of a jerk . )
It would be easy enough to write off the dating Darwinists as simple renegades against female empowerment .
Easy , but misleading .
Menaissance men think that women ’s equality has brought real benefits , though they might not agree with women about what those benefits are .
“ We can have sex with as many women as we want and not have to worry about making any of them pregnant , ” one of my more upbeat respondents , an SYM named Curtis , writes .
“ Men are having more freedom and fun than ever before in all of history as a result of this , because if there ’s one thing every single man can agree upon , it ’s that having sex with as many women as possible is a great thing . ”
Seduction artists even say they prefer savvy women who understand Game as a male version of cleavage - revealing tops .
Attracting the opposite sex is , well , a game — an intricate and thrilling game .
Moreover , the Darwinists have not just hard - luck stories on their side , but hard data as well .
Forty years after they threw off the feminine mystique , women continue to prefer bigger , stronger , richer men , at least as husbands .
They almost always marry men who are taller than they are , men who are several years older than they are ( though the age difference has declined in recent decades ) , and men who earn more than they do ( though that number , too , has declined a bit ) .
Most of the women interviewed by Jillian Straus say that they ’re looking for a man who can be the primary breadwinner .
A June 2008 New Scientist article reports on two studies that even suggest that women are biologically attracted to “ jerks ” ; researchers speculate that narcissistic , risk - taking men had an evolutionary advantage .
Can anyone doubt the reason the gyms swarm with so many guys bench - pressing 250 pounds ?
Sculpted pecs are to today ’s SYM what plumage is to the peacock .
No , the problem with the Darwinian tenor of the Menaissance is neither antipathy to women ’s equality nor a misguided reading of female nature .
It is an uncompromising biological determinism that makes no room for human cultivation .
We are animals , the new Darwinians seem to say ; get used to it .
They define manhood as alpha - style toughness and unsentimental promiscuity .
And in that spirit , they cultivate manipulation , calculation , and naked ( in both the literal and metaphorical sense ) self - interest .
“ Nature does n’t care about hurting people ’s feelings , ” explains dating coach Mike Pilinski .
“ It cares ONLY about reproductive success . ”
From one vantage point , they are right .
Manipulation and self - interest suffused relations between the sexes even when gentlemen strode the earth ; a few pages of Edith Wharton should disabuse any doubters on that score .
But human beings rely on culture to tame natural selfishness .
After all , we have prohibitions against grabbing a neighbor ’s steak off the grill or kidnapping his daughter , to give just two examples of behavior about which Nature also does n’t care .
For this reason , successful human cultures expect far more of their men than muscle and promiscuity .
If Darwinian daters fail to understand this , you ca n’t entirely blame them .
They see that when the old dating and courting regime fell , it left a cultural vacuum with no rules for taming or shaming the boors , jerks , and assholes .
What do they have to lose ?
Nevertheless , you might ask , are there really so many dating Darwinists on the prowl ?
Is dating really hell , as the website would have it , for the majority of contemporary SYMs and Fs? Probably not .
It ’s a safe bet that for all the confusions and humiliations of dating , most men will still try to be nice guys who say “ please ” and avoid asking a woman about her sexual history until , say , the third date .
And if the past is any guide , most of them , even the most masterly PUAs , will eventually find themselves coaching Little League on weekends .
In a national survey of young , heterosexual men , the National Marriage Project , a research organization at Rutgers University , found that the majority of single subjects hoped to marry and have kids someday .
However , it ’s also a good guess that a significant minority of SYMs are the sort you would n’t wish on your friends and relatives .
Twenty - two percent of the men in the National Marriage Project ’s survey were “ relatively hardcore marriage avoiders , ” mistrustful of women , and highly skeptical of lifelong commitment .
The years they ’ve spent prowling the dating savanna only reinforce their cynicism .
Neil Strauss , the author of The Game , says that during his PUA years , he saw enough lies and infidelity to make Darwin look like an optimist .
“ Losing all hope is freedom , ” snarls the blogger at Eternal Bachelor .
In fact , some people would wager that the Darwinian answer to dating chaos is our future normal .
“ I have lived in many places , countries , and cultures , ” Douglas Gurney from Montgomery , Alabama , writes .
“ This is a worldwide phenomenon .
The behavior of men is simply a response ( which is actually a quite logical one ) to the changing behavior of women .
Simply put , men are a breeding experiment run by women .
You reap what you sow — and when a man can sow all he wants and leave the reaping to others , well , why not ? ”
A NSW Supreme Court judge has ruled an internet cartoon in which lookalike child characters from The Simpsons engage in sexual acts is child pornography .
In a landmark finding , Justice Michael Adams today upheld a decision convicting a man of possessing child pornography after the cartoons , depicting characters modelled on Bart , Lisa and Maggie engaging in sex acts , were found on his computer .
The main issue of the case was whether a fictional cartoon character could " depict " a " person " under law .
" If the persons were real , such depictions could never be permitted , " Justice Adams said in his judgement .
" Their creation would constitute crimes at the very highest end of the criminal calendar . "
Alan John McEwan had been convicted in the Parramatta Local Court of possessing child pornography and of using a carriage service to access child pornography material , the latter of which has a maximum penalty of 10 years ' jail .
NEW YORK , Dec 3 ( Reuters ) -
The family of a man killed in a stampede of frenzied holiday shoppers filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Wal - Mart Stores Inc WMT.N on Wednesday seeking unspecified damages .
Shoppers on New York ’s Long Island broke down doors and surged into the Valley Stream Wal - Mart at 5 a.m. on Nov. 28 , the day after Thanksgiving , known as “ Black Friday , ” traditionally the busiest retail shopping day of the year .
Jdimytai Damour , 34 , was knocked to the ground and trampled to death .
He had been assigned to cover security as an independent contractor .
Damour ’s death was caused by “ the carelessness , reckless negligence , wanton disregard for public safety and gross negligence ” in the “ staging , conducting and advertising for sales events , ” said the lawsuit , filed in Bronx Supreme Court .
The lawsuit also names the shopping mall where the incident occurred and the security company employed by Wal - Mart .
A Wal - Mart spokeswoman had no immediate comment .
On Friday , the retailer said it was saddened by the incident .
New York ’s largest grocery workers union has urged authorities to investigate what it called “ Wal - Mart ’s failure to provide a safe workplace . ”
Wal - Mart said it provided additional internal security and employees and third party security and worked closely with police to prepare for “ Black Friday . ” ( Reporting by Edith Honan , editing by Daniel Trotta )

The WSJ ’s Real Time Economics blog has a post linking to Raguram Raghuram (!)
Rajan ’s prophetic 2005 paper on the risks posed by securitization — basically , Rajan said that what did happen , could happen — and to the discussion at the Jackson Hole conference by Fed vice - chairman Kohn and others .
The economics profession does not come off very well .
Two things are really striking here .
First is the obsequiousness toward Alan Greenspan .
To be fair , the 2005 Jackson Hole event was a sort of Greenspan celebration ; still , it does come across as excessive — dangerously close to saying that if the Great Greenspan says something , it must be so .
Second is the extreme condescension toward Rajan — a pretty serious guy — for having the temerity to suggest that maybe markets do n’t always work to our advantage .
Larry Summers , I ’m sorry to say , comes off particularly badly .
Only my colleague Alan Blinder , defending Rajan “ against the unremitting attack he is getting here for not being a sufficiently good Chicago economist ” , emerges with honor .

A former head of Britain 's military and two senior generals have called for Britain to abandon its nuclear deterrent .
In a letter to the Times newspaper Field Marshal Lord Bramall , alongside General Lord Ramsbotham and General Sir Hugh Beach , argued it will be difficult for the UK to " exert any leadership and influence " on nuclear non-proliferation given its continued commitment to a deterrent .
They dismissed the independent deterrent argument as a " fallacy " because of Britain 's reliance on the US for the provision and servicing of the ballistic missiles used for delivery .
And they argued a " nuclear blackmail " situation would not be resolved with the threat of a retaliatory strike .
" Nuclear weapons have shown themselves to be completely useless as a deterrent to the threats and scale of violence we currently , or are likely to face - particularly international terrorism ; and the more you analyse them the more unusable they appear . "
MPs voted to back the Trident decision in March 2007 after lengthy debate in the Commons .
The government would have been defeated without Conservative support and the issue remains a divisive one .
In their letter the senior military figures added that " economic clout " now matters more than the seat at the top table .
" Our independent deterrent has become virtually irrelevant except in the context of domestic politics , " they added .
" Rather than perpetuating Trident , the case is much stronger for funding our Armed Forces with what they need to meet the commitments actually laid before them .
" In the present economic climate it may well prove impossible to afford both . "
The government seeks to encourage a ' virtuous cycle ' where nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament lead to one another .
It says there is a risk without full disarmament the nuclear weapons states are failing to meet their disarmament obligations .
But it points out the UK has cut its nuclear weapons capability by three - quarters since the end of the cold war and now only has 160 operationally available nuclear warheads .
Last March Gordon Brown said Britain was " ready to play our part in further disarmament " .
A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said : " The UK would only consider using nuclear weapons in self - defence , including the defence of our Nato allies , and even then only in extreme circumstances .
" We remain fully committed to its goal of a safer world in which there is no place for any nuclear weapons , and continues to work hard internationally to achieve that goal . "
" However , the government believes it should take the decisions necessary to ensure our national security , and in the current security environment that includes retention of a minimum nuclear deterrent . "

The government has said it accepts a report 's recommendation that the Royal Mail should be part - privatised .
The study by Richard Hooper says new minority owners can offer the " confidence , experience and capital " needed to carry out vital changes .
Describing the current Royal Mail as " untenable " , the report adds that the universal service is under threat without modernisation .
Dutch firm TNT said it would be interested in a stake in Royal Mail .
Potential partners ROYAL MAIL GROUP Employs 193,000 people in the UK Every working day , delivers 84 m items to 27 m addresses Each week , serves 28 million customers through 14,300 Post Office branches Source : Royal Mail Group TNT said in a statement that further steps depended on the full implementation of the government 's proposals , including changes to regulation and the government paying off much of Royal Mail 's company pension liabilities .
" Assuming the UK government implements these recommendations , I think that exploring a strategic partnership with Royal Mail makes a lot of sense for both our companies , " said Peter Bakker , TNT chief executive .
Some analysts also said German postal operator Deutsche Post could become a potential partner for the Royal Mail .
Meanwhile , ministers insist the Royal Mail will remain " publicly owned " .
The report 's findings were presented by Business Secretary Lord Mandelson , who confirmed that the government agreed with its recommendation that the service be part - privatised .
Lord Mandelson added that the government also agreed with its second recommendation that the government take over responsibility for reducing the mail service 's pensions deficit .
' Volatile ' pension deficit Mr Hooper , a former deputy chairman of media watchdog Ofcom , found that as a result of new communication technologies such as e-mail , the Royal Mail had missed out on a potential £ 500 m of profits over the past year .
I believe that Royal Mail and the postal market can thrive in the future - provided that decisive action is taken now

The study said that Royal Mail needed to modernise urgently , and introduce more automation .
Regarding its pension deficit , the report said Royal Mail was having to top up the fund by £ 280 m a year , describing the deficit as " large , growing and volatile " .
The Royal Mail 's pension deficit was £ 3.4bn in 2006 , but is widely thought to have doubled since then .
The report recommended that the government should take over responsibility for this , but that this should only come as part of a wider reform of the service .
The report added that labour relations needed to improve , that levels of trust and cooperation between managers and workers was low , and that industrial action took place too often .
The study by Mr Hooper was commissioned by the Department of Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ( BERR ) .
Lord Mandelson said it was vital the suggested changes took place .
Peter Mandelson is , once again , being condemned by many in his own party
Nick Robinson
BBC political editor
Read Nick 's blog in full " I believe that Royal Mail and the postal market can thrive in the future - provided that decisive action is taken now , " he told the Lords .
" Without far - reaching change , the opportunities brought by technology will become overwhelming threats . "
However , Lord Mandelson later told the BBC 's political editor Nick Robinson the privatisation of Royal Mail would not go beyond the part - privatisation proposed .
He said : " It is my view that what we want to see is a Royal Mail sustained in the public sector able to do a job not only here in Britain , but also to become a international player in postal services as well . "
Meanwhile , up to 2,000 postal workers are to stage a 24 - hour strike later this week in a row over office closures .
The Communication Workers Union said its members in Liverpool , Coventry , Stockport , Oxford , Crewe and Bolton would walk out on 19 December - the day before the last Christmas posting day for first - class letters .
' More commercial manner '
Tories welcomed the recommended part - privatisation of the Royal Mail , calling it a " step in the right direction " .
However , shadow business secretary Alan Duncan accused ministers in " raiding [ Royal Mail 's ] pension fund to bail - out government borrowing . "

" We broadly welcome ministers ' intention to introduce a new commercial partner ... but the details remain unclear , " he added .
Private UK mail operator DX Group said in a statement : " We would support moves to secure an injection of private capital into the Royal Mail only if this will encourage it to behave in a more commercial manner and adopt commercially - sustainable pricing models in each of its business areas . "
Meanwhile , the Communication Workers Union , which represents most of Royal Mail 's workers , said that private capital was not the solution to Royal Mail .
At the same time , the union welcomed proposals for the taxpayer to reduce Royal Mail 's pension fund deficit .

Here ’s an interesting experiment .
You ’ve seen American newspaper vending machines :
You put the money in , the glass door opens , you get your paper .
Now , let ’s go to a province in Austria :
Here , you put the money in at the top .
And you just grab your paper from the moisture - sealed bag below .
There ’s nothing forcing you to pay , though .
You could theoretically not pay anything and still grab a paper .
It ’s all based on the honor system .
And therein lies the experiment .
Essentially , researches would clean out the coinbox and put one paper in the bag .
After someone took the paper ( and some time had passed ) , one researcher would check to see how much money that person paid .
Another researcher would follow that person and , after enough distance had passed , stop the person “ randomly ” to interview him / her about a seemingly unrelated matter .
By doing this , the researchers learned about the person ’s “ social behaviors . ”
( Not everyone was willing to be interviewed , and this was factored into the results . )
The people who had bought the paper had no idea there was a connection between the purchase and the questions they were being asked .
So what were the results like ?
Not surprisingly , most people did not pay the 60 cents asking price for the paper .
In fact , the average payment was only 26 cents .
What ’s fascinating is the descriptions of people in relation to how much they paid .
Here is a list of characteristics compared to how much people paid more or less than the 26 - cent average .
So males paid 7.76 cents less than the 26 - cent average .
Those who regularly volunteers paid 8.05 cents more than the 26 - cent average .
And … wait a minute … what ’s that one …?
The people paying the least amount ?
Church goers .
They paid 22.13 cents less than the 26 - cent average .
In other words , virtually nothing .
The researchers tried to explain this :
People who regularly attend service at church pay 22.1 cents less for the Sunday tabloid …
This is a large effect , and we can only speculate with regard to its reasons .
One reason might be that the church attendees lacked the coin money to make a proper payment .
Active religious participation is high in the region , and on a typical Sunday morning it is plausible that many people might have donated some of their coin money to the church .
Of course , this explanation does not change the fact that church attendees are particularly dishonest when paying for the newspaper .
Another possible explanation is that the church attendees share relevant social traits .
Gneezy ( 2005 ) found that honesty interacts with social preferences towards the person who benefits from one ’s honesty .
According to this explanation , a typical church attendee might believe that it would do little harm to the wealth of the publisher if he does not pay for the paper .
You can download the full study for free and gauge for yourself how valid this study is .
In the meantime , I wonder what other explanations there might be for these results .
And where would atheists stand in relation to the other characteristics included on the list ?

KALAMAZOO --
A group that advocates for the decriminalization of marijuana sees the city of Kalamazoo as fertile ground in its push to liberalize marijuana laws in Michigan .
MINORML , the Michigan chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , is beginning to organize a petition drive to push for a local ordinance that would make the possession of small amounts of marijuana the " lowest possible priority " for law enforcement .
The ballot language has not yet been drafted , but organizers are hoping to have the issue voted on as early as November .
If adopted , Kalamazoo would be the only city in Michigan to have such a law .
Ann Arbor has an ordinance that makes it a civil infraction to use or possess small amounts of marijuana .
" The government has no right to tell us what we can put in our bodies , " said Steven Thompson , executive director of MINORML .

New marijuana law leaves many Michigan residents confused
Organizers will have to submit a total of at least 1,273 signatures of registered city voters to the Kalamazoo city clerk by Aug. 14 .
The issue would then go before the Kalamazoo City Commission , which would have 14 days either to adopt the ordinance or to put the question to voters .
Louis Stocking , 21 , of Kalamazoo , is leading the petition drive .
" I 'm sure we 'll get enough signatures , " Stocking said .
Capt .
Joseph Taylor , commander of the Kalamazoo Valley Enforcement Team , which targets illegal drug use in Kalamazoo County , called the proposal " ludicrous . "
" This is a silly idea , " he said .
" It 's a roundabout way of circumventing the more difficult process of getting marijuana legalized . "
" We should n't be prioritizing which laws we enforce and which ones we don't , " Taylor added .
" The law is the law . "
Proposal 1 , the new state law that shields people with certain debilitating diseases from criminal prosecution if they use marijuana to treat their conditions , passed in every precinct in the city in November .
Marijuana use and possession is still illegal according to state and federal law , however .
Taylor said marijuana is a gateway drug .
He said the violence associated with marijuana dealing has increased over the past 10 years as drug dealers moved away from crack cocaine and toward marijuana because of the lower criminal penalties .
More than half of the drug arrests made in the city are related to marijuana , he said .
Greg Francisco , director of MINORML's Southwest Michigan chapter , said Kalamazoo was chosen for the petition drive because it is " a progressive city with motivated activists on the ground . "
" Anyone who wants to use marijuana can already find it , " Francisco said .
EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. -- Super Bowl hero Plaxico Burress is done for the year .
The New York Giants fined and suspended Burress on Tuesday for four games -- the rest of the regular season -- after he accidentally shot himself in the right thigh over the weekend at a Manhattan nightclub .
The team also placed him on the reserve non - football injury list , which means the wide receiver could n't come back for the playoffs , either .
The team punished Burress a day after he was charged with illegal weapons possession , which carries a penalty of 3 ½ to 15 years in prison if he 's convicted .
Burress is due back in court again on March 31 , unless he reaches a plea agreement .
Burress arrived Tuesday morning at Giants Stadium , and met individually with Giants president John Mara , general manager Jerry Reese and coach Tom Coughlin .
He left for a medical test and returned in the afternoon for another brief session with team officials .
Even as they suspended him for conduct detrimental to the team , Giants officials expressed concern for Burress , who caught a touchdown pass from Eli Manning that gave the Giants a 17 - 14 Super Bowl win over New England in February .
" As we have said since Saturday morning , our concern is for Plaxico 's health and well - being , " Mara said .
" This is an important time for him to take care of his body and heal up and also deal with the very serious legal consequences and other issues in his life .
When I spoke with Plaxico he expressed great remorse for letting down his teammates . "
Police and prosecutors still want to talk to a pair of Burress ' teammates , Antonio Pierce and Ahmad Bradshaw , who were at the club when the shooting occurred but insist they did nothing wrong .
Pierce smiled but declined to speak to The Associated Press on Wednesday morning when he reported to Giants Stadium about 8 a.m .
The New York Post reported in Wednesday 's edition that police impounded Pierce 's SUV on Tuesday to look for any blood or gunpowder residue that might be inside .
Following the shooting , police say Pierce drove Burress to the hospital and returned to New Jersey with Burress ' gun in the glove compartment of his black Cadillac Escalade .
Neither Burress nor his agent , Drew Rosenhaus , was immediately available for comment .
Teammates seemed at a loss what to say Wednesday as they reported to Giants Stadium .
" The only thing I hope that we gain from that is that people will stop asking us about Plaxico , that 's probably the best thing about it , that it bring some closure at least as far as this season as far as football , " defensive tackle Barry Cofield said .
Receiver Amani Toomer , whose 13 years with the team make his the current longest serving player , called the situation unfortunate .
" There is nothing good that will come out of it and there is n't much to say , " he said .
" It 's just tough , it 's just tough for everyone to deal with .
I 'm just glad he is OK .
It could have been worse . "
Dr. Scott Rodeo , a team physician , examined Burress and told the Giants that the gunshot wound would have sidelined the 31 - year - old player for 4 - to - 6 weeks anyway .
" I had two conversations with Plaxico today , and it was obvious that he understood the magnitude of this situation , " Reese said .
I am in my mid-20's .
Non-violent , but covered in tattoos .
A few have told me this could cause me problems from both guards as well as other prisoners .
Do they keep you busy with work / books / cards / social - interaction , or are you expected to stare at the wall the whole time you 're there ?
Will a first - offender such as myself be placed with other inmates with minor crimes and short sentences or will I be placed in a general population with the hardcore guys ?
Please fellow short - term cons , help this new - fish survive these 3 days !
What can I expect from a 3 - day stay in county jail ?
In the near future I will be an honored guest in the county jail of San Luis Obispo , CA .
Up until now I have never been arrested and have absolutely no idea on what to expect out of this .
I 'd really appreciate any heads - up advice as well as just general expectations of this experience from any who have gone through it before .
A little more detail inside , Thanks in advance .

Solving Rubik 's Cube for speed .
By Lars Petrus
Introduction
This is a tutorial for my method of solving Rubik 's Cube .
It is intended both for beginners and experienced cubers .
There is no group theory or written notation involved , I just show you how to move .
You need a modern canvas tag capable browser , ideally with WebGL enabled .
Using this method , I won the 1981 Swedish championships , and finished 4th in the first world championships in Budapest 1982 .
I also won a minor world championship in 2005 .
As my official results show , I am a has - been these days .
Please take a look at my terminology , so you know the difference between a turn and a twist , for example .
If you are a total beginner , look at this description of the basic Rubik 's Cube concepts .
The Basic Idea
Most people solve the cube layer by layer .
This is a simple way for the human mind to approach the problem , but it is useless for speed cubing .
No matter how good you are , you will use more than 100 moves .
Going for speed , I use 55 - 60 moves on average .
Going for few moves , I average 40 - 45 .
The basic problem with the layer method is big , and obvious once you realize it .
When you have completed the first layer , you can do nothing without breaking it up .
So you break it , do something useful , then restore it .
Break it , do something , restore it .
Again and again .
In a good solution you do something useful all the time .
The first layer is in the way of the solution , not a part of it !

The agreement will provide American technical assistance , as well as monitors , to crack down on the network of tunnels through which Hamas moves components for rockets and missiles through the Sinai Peninsula into Gaza .
The composition of the monitoring force was not yet clear , as Israeli and American diplomats were still working out final details , a senior American official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Ms. Rice said ending the smuggling of weapons from countries like Iran was one of the conditions for a cease - fire and that European allies including Britain , Germany and France were likely to join in the monitoring effort .
But she said the agreement was only supportive of broader negotiations being carried out by Egypt , and she refused to say when a cease - fire could actually take place and the fighting in Gaza would stop .
“ We are doing everything we can to bring it to an end , ” she said .
She raised the possibility of donor conferences  possibly led by the Czech Republic and Norway  to deal with the humanitarian conditions in Gaza after a cease - fire and to help rebuild the territory .
“ There is much that can be done to bring Gaza out of the dark of Hamas ’s reign and into the light of the very good governance the Palestinian Authority can bring , ” she said .
You did n’t really think China would stop censorship , did you ?
The only fools that believed that were the IOC and the foreign “ democratic ” leaders who attended the Olympics and suggested the games would help open up China .
Pure CYA and attempted money grab , by all of them .
Let ’s see how much more censorship is rolled out as their economy slows to a trickle .
China said it has the right to block Web sites its says break its laws after being accused of restarting the practice it halted during the August Olympic Games as part of a promise to widen media freedom .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said Tuesday that certain Web sites had breached Chinese law by recognizing “ two Chinas ” — a reference to the self - ruled island Taiwan .
Liu , however , would n’t say whether any Web sites had been censored .
“ Undeniably , on some Web sites , there are some issues that go against Chinese law .
For example , some Web sites are actually creating two countries — that is one China , one Taiwan .
They treat Taiwan as an independent country , which is against our law of anti-secessionism , ” he said during a regularly scheduled press conference , without naming the organizations .
Beijing still claims sovereignty over the self - ruled island and has repeatedly warned any attempt at a permanent split could trigger a devastating conflict .
The British Broadcasting Corp. reported Tuesday that China appears to have banned a number of foreign Web sites recently , including its Chinese language news site and Voice of America in Chinese .
The sites had been unblocked after journalists attending the Beijing Olympics complained that the government was censoring sites deemed sensitive , the BBC said on its Web site .

Space tourist Charles Simonyi trains inside a Soyuz spacecraft simulator before his first flight of April 2007 .
Simonyi launched on a second orbital mission in 2009 , becoming the only two - time private space explorer .
Russia ? sspace agency chief has said that thrill - seeking millionaires won ?t be able tobuy tourist flights to the International Space Station after 2009 , according toRussian news reports Wednesday .
AnatolyPerminov , director of Russia ?s Federal Space Agency , reportedly told the dailynewspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta that 2009 is the last year in which spacetourists will be able flyto space station due the lack of available seats on Soyuz spacecraft as the orbiting laboratoryshifts to a larger , six - person crew later this year , according to the Russiannews service Ria Novosti .
The International Space Station is slated to double its currentthree - person crew size in late May .
Since 2001 , six space tourists havevisited the station by paying between $ 20 million and $ 30 million under dealsbrokered with Russia ?s Federal Space Agency by the U.S. firm Space Adventuresin Vienna , Va .
The nextspace tourist , Americanbillionaire Charles Simonyi , is due to launch to the space station in Marchalong with the orbiting laboratory ?s new Expedition 19 crew .
Simonyi ispaying a reported $ 35 million for what will be his second trip to the spacestation .
He last visited the orbiting laboratory in April 2007 on a 13 - dayspaceflight that he paid more than $ 20 million for .
Since then , ticket pricesrose to about $ 30 million due to inflation , Space Adventures officials havesaid .
Simonyi ? ssecond trip costing an extra $ 5 million beyond that due to his membership inSpace Adventure ?s Orbital Missions Explorers
Circle program , an elite club ofsix people who have put the $ 5 million down in order to jump to the head of theline for available flights .
High - ranking Russian space officials and cosmonauts met with the RossiiskayaGazeta ( or Russian Gazette ) for a round table meeting on Jan. 15 todiscuss the future of the nation ? s manned spaceflight program , according to the Russian aerospace firm RSC Energia , which posted photos of the meeting to itsWeb site .
Accordingto Ria Novosti , Perminov said that Simonyi and a Kazakh nationalwill fly to the International Space Station this year , with the Kazakhspaceflyer to launch in October , aboard Russian - built Soyuz spacecraft .
But theplan to double space station crews up to six astronauts will prevent futurespace tourists from finding room on regular Soyuz flights .
Last year , Space Adventures announced its plans to launch the first privateSoyuz spaceflight to the space station .
That mission , slated to launch in2011 , called for a crew of two paying passengers and a professional cosmonautcommander to fly to the International Space Station .
Space Adventures officialswere not immediately available for comment late Wednesday .
RiaNovosti alsoreported that Russia does not plan to cancel any of its planned launches to thespace station this year .
The Federal Space Agency is expected to launchadditional crewed Soyuz capsules and unmanned Progress cargo ships to ferryastronauts and supplies to the orbiting laboratory .
" Ihope that we 'll cope , ? the Russian news service quoted Perminov as saying .
?
Sofar we are preparing to make four manned launches , not two , as previouslyplanned , and send five , not four , freight modules into space .?

It ’s rather ironic that the U.S. wants to classify Hamid Gul and three other ex-ISI as terrorists .
The U.S. says Gul is suspected of providing political and moral support to the Taliban - led resistance in Afghanistan .
“ Gul said he had recently been informed by a senior official in Pakistan ’s Foreign Ministry that he had been placed on a U.S. watch list of global terrorists , along with several others .
He said that he was shown a U.S. document that detailed several charges against him , including allegations that he had ties to al - Qaeda and the Taliban , ” reports the Washington Post .
It looks like the U.S. through its United Nations proxy will also attempt to link him to Lashkar - i- Taiba , the fall group said to be behind the false flag operation in India .
Gul worked closely with the CIA during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan when he was the ISI chief .
As usual , U.S. intelligence is turning on its old allies in the cooked up GWOT for self - serving political reasons .
Gul worked closely with the CIA during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan when he was the ISI chief .
He has the inside scoop on the operation the CIA proudly considers its most successful — the creation of wild - eyed and religiously fanatical Islamic brigades organized to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan .
It is widely acknowledged that elements of these brigades , or Mujahideen , eventually became al - Qaeda , the manufactured threat against the United States .
According to the official story , Gul turned against the United States after it abandoned Afghanistan following the 1989 Soviet withdrawal and following the U.S. effort to punish Pakistan economic and military sanctions for its secret nuclear program .
Gul said that “ the Muslim world must stand united to confront the U.S. in its so - called War on Terrorism , which is in reality a war against Muslims .
Let ’s destroy America wherever its troops are trapped . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
But what likely really irks the U.S. is the fact Gul told journalist Arnaud de Borchgrave United Press International editor at large and others that the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , were an inside job .
Gul told de Borchgrave the attacks were the work of renegade U.S. Air Force elements working with the Israelis .
“ The U.S. spends $ 40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies , ” Gul explained .
“ That ’s $ 400 billion in 10 years .
Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise .
I do n’t believe it .

Emotions Run High At First Stop Of TSA 's Road Show
The first of five public meetings to be held by the Transportation Security Administration to listen to feedback on the proposed Large Aircraft Security Program was held last week in Atlanta .
A conference room at the Renaissance Concourse Hotel was packed to standing room only with pilots , executives , and others from the aviation community , unanimous in their strong feelings against the extension of commercial airline security procedures and regulations to general aviation .
Notable attendees included Craig Dotlo , the Northeast Regional Representative of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association ( AOPA ) , and Ed Bolen , President of the National Business Aviation Association ( NBAA ) .
TSA spokesman Jon Allen said such hearings will play an important role in making a decision regarding the proposed rules .
" It 's feedback that we value , and it will be considered as the rule - making process continues , " Allen told the Atlanta Journal Constitution .
And feedback he got - plenty of it .
" AOPA is concerned with the weight threshold that is used for the basis of the regulations and provisions in the rule that outsource security oversight to a third - party auditor , " Dotlo said .
" AOPA does not support the NPRM as currently drafted and requests that TSA reconsider the proposed rules , focusing particularly on whether there are less costly and less intrusive ways of enhancing general aviation security . "
In addition to echoing Dotlo 's misgivings , Bolen suggested the creation of a rulemaking committee would provide mutual benefits .
" We believe that by working together , we can harden business aviation against attack without destroying it in the process .
We deserve a dialog about how best to do this , " Bolen said .
Ray Boyd , who owns a jet - leasing company in Athens , said , " Does ( the Transportation Security Administration ) have their head in the sand ?
The whole program needs to be scrapped .
It 's obvious TSA does not understand general aviation . "
His sentiments were obviously shared by many in attendance and earned him a standing ovation .
" The imposition of this proposed regulation will , in fact , result in the terrorists ' objective of crippling our free society and profoundly altering our democratic way of life , " pilot Clif Port said , adding that the new regulations would cost his company $ 100,000 a year .
Pat Epps , president of Epps Aviation at DeKalb - Peachtree Airport , pointed out that having to check passenger names against a list of terrorists was unnecessary , and said , " We know who our passengers are .
We 're not letting strangers on our airplanes . "
Epps also called TSA 's 260 - page proposal " a huge waste of time and effort .
Your time could be better spent somewhere else . "

The US House of Representatives has passed a $ 700 bn ( £ 394bn ) government plan to rescue the US financial sector .
The 263-171 vote was the second in a week , following its shock rejection of an earlier version on Monday .
The package is aimed at buying up the bad debts of failing financial institutions on Wall Street .
US President George W Bush praised lawmakers for their " spirit of co-operation " before signing the bill into law later on Friday .
The House adopted the new version after the Senate added about $ 100bn in new tax breaks to win Republican votes .
Intervention The Dow Jones Industrial Average had been buoyant ahead of the vote , surging up 250 points , but those gains were pared back amid profit taking and continued uncertainty , and it closed down 1.5 % .
The passing of the bail - out plan is just the first stage and it will be several months before anyone can tell whether it is working
Greg Wood ,
BBC business correspondent
How will the rescue work ?
Stocks trim gains after vote Q&A : US $ 700 bn bail - out plan
In a televised response after the House vote , President Bush said : " In coming together we have acted boldly to prevent a crisis on Wall Street becoming a crisis in communities across the country . "
Mr Bush acknowledged there were concerns about the government 's role and the cost of the plan .
He said he believed in intervention only when it was necessary - but " in this situation , action is clearly necessary " .
However , he warned the package would take time to have an effect on the economy .
Despite traders ' celebrations , the Dow Jones finished down His Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson vowed speedy action to get the rescue package up and operating .
And Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke applauded Congress , saying the bill was a critical step toward stabilising financial markets .
BBC North America business correspondent Greg
Wood says the passing of the bail - out plan is just the first stage and it will be several months before anyone can tell whether it is working .
Avoiding ' catastrophe ' Legislators were hugely divided on the bill during the House debate .
Some who had voted " No " on Monday said they were switching because of the improvements to the bill but many of them still expressed serious reservations .

Others maintained their opposition , saying the bill was still a bail - out benefiting mainly Wall Street .
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was one of many to refer to those suffering on America 's Main Street and said that urgent action was needed " to avoid economic catastrophe " .
" The bright light of accountability will protect the taxpayer , " she vowed .
Democrat majority whip James Clyburn said : " We came together in a very strong , bipartisan way to deliver this decisive victory for the American people . "
Georgia Democrat John Lewis reflected the views of many when he said : " I have decided that the cost of doing nothing is greater than the cost of doing something . "
NEW MEASURES IN BAIL - OUT BILL Increased protection for saving deposits Increased child tax credits More aid for hurricane victims
Tax breaks for renewable energy Higher starting limits to alternative minimum tax
Congress vote reveals divisions
In quotes : Bail - out vote reaction Send us your comments South Carolina Republican J Gresham Barrett added : " No matter what we do or what we pass , there are still tough times out there .
People are mad - I 'm mad .
We have to act .
We have to act now . "
But Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling asked : " How can we have capitalism on the way up and socialism on the way down ? "
Friday 's vote showed 172 Democrats in favour and 63 against .
A majority of Republicans still opposed the bill - 91 voted for it and 108 against .
The House rejected the earlier version by 228 votes to 205 on Monday .
The Senate passed an amended bill on Wednesday that raised the government 's guarantee on savings from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
It also included tax breaks to help small businesses and to boost alternative energy , expanded the child tax credit and extended help to victims of recent hurricanes .
The US had experienced more evidence of the financial volatility ahead of the vote on Friday .
The Wells Fargo bank announced it would buy troubled rival Wachovia in a $ 15.1 bn ( £ 8.5 bn ) deal , while the US also reported its biggest monthly job loss in more than five years .

What are these ?
No , the government of Kentucky cannot seize the domain names of offshore Internet gambling operations just because the governor disapproves of wagering and believes himself ruler of the free world .
In a decision what can only be described as the grownups regaining control , the Kentucky Court of Appeals yesterday overruled a lower court decision that allowed Gov. Steve Beshear 's Keystone Cops to confiscate 141 domain names last fall .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation reports :
The Kentucky Court of Appeals today granted petitions by the Interactive Gaming Council ( IGC ) Interactive Media Entertainment and Gaming Association , Inc. ( iMEGA ) to overturn an earlier trial court ruling authorizing the seizure of domain names owned by operators of overseas gambling websites .
While challenged on several additional fronts -- including on a wide range of Constitutional grounds by EFF and its fellow amici the ACLU of Kentucky and the Center for Democracy and Technology ( CDT ) -- the Court overturned the prior ruling based on an interpretation of Kentucky 's " gambling device " forfeiture statute : [ I ]t stretches credulity to conclude that a series of numbers , or Internet address , can be said to constitute a " machine or any mechanical or other device ... designed and manufactured primarily for use in connection with gambling . "
Kentucky 's entire approach to this matter stretches credulity , especially given the state 's storied association with gambling of the racetrack variety .
You can read the ruling here ( .pdf ) .
So , that 's the end of that , right ?
Well , not necessarily .
A spokesman for the governor tells the Lexington Herald - Leader : " We want to take some time to review ( the ruling ) .
No decision has yet been made on whether to appeal it to the state Supreme Court . "
It 's no secret that I believe online gambling should be legal , regulated and taxed .
That others may disagree I can understand .
Not so that Kentuckians would abide such legal folly -- and such an affront to Internet freedom -- on the part of their elected officials .
Throw the bums out , people .
Will today ’s 6 - to 9 - year - olds love it as much as today ’s grownups did ?

US in the Middle East Arab League Wants New Course from Obama
Barack Obama still has more than two months before he moves into the White House , but the world 's expectations of the president - elect continue to be ratcheted upwards .
Now , Arab League General Secretary Amr Moussa says it 's time for the US to change directions in the Middle East .
He said : “ We are looking at means by which we can help pensioners and others with their savings and that is one of the things that we 'll look at in the run up to the Budget and I 'm very conscious that people have saved money all their lives , need the best deal that is possible . ”
Memo Instructed CIA To Document Both Torture Techniques And Agents Participating In Interrogations
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – The American Civil Liberties Union today obtained three redacted documents related to the Bush administration 's brutal interrogation policies , including a previously withheld Justice Department memo authorizing the CIA 's use of torture .
The government was ordered to turn over the documents in response to an ongoing Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit brought in 2004 by the ACLU and other organizations seeking records on the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody overseas .
" These documents supply further evidence , if any were needed , that the Justice Department authorized the CIA to torture prisoners in its custody , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" The Justice Department twisted the law , and in some cases ignored it altogether , in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the U.S. once prosecuted as war crimes . "
One of the documents obtained by the ACLU today is a redacted version of a previously undisclosed Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) opinion from August 2002 that authorizes the CIA to use specific interrogation methods , including waterboarding .
The memo states that interrogation methods that cause severe mental pain do not amount to torture under U.S. law unless they cause " harm lasting months or even years after the acts were inflicted upon the prisoners . "
Initially , the CIA took the position that it could not confirm or deny the existence of this memo ; it dropped that position after President Bush disclosed in September 2006 that the CIA had been operating detention centers overseas .
The other two documents , from 2003 and 2004 , are memos from the CIA related to requests for legal advice from the Justice Department .
The 2003 memo shows that CIA interrogators were authorized by OLC to use torture practices known as " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
The memo also indicates that , for each session in which these techniques were used , the CIA documented , among other things , " the nature and duration of each such technique employed " and " the identities of those present . "
The documentation relating to the CIA 's torture sessions , including the names of agents who participated , is still being withheld .
The 2004 memo shows that CIA interrogators were told that the Justice Department had concluded that certain interrogation techniques , including " the waterboard , " did not constitute torture .
The document also indicates that , after the Supreme Court ruled in June 2004 that courts can decide whether foreign nationals held in Guantánamo Bay were rightfully imprisoned , CIA interrogators were told to take into account the possibility their actions would ultimately be subject to judicial review .
" While the documents released today do provide more information about the development and implementation of the Bush administration 's torture policies , even a cursory glance at the documents shows that the administration continues to use ' national security ' as a shield to protect government officials from embarrassment , criticism and possible criminal prosecution , " said Jaffer .
" Far too much information is still being withheld . "
In May , Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York overruled some of the CIA 's claims that the documents released today were exempt from disclosure under the ACLU 's FOIA lawsuit .
The judge is still considering the ACLU 's motion to hold the CIA in contempt of court for destroying hundreds of hours of videotape depicting the abusive interrogations of two detainees in its custody .
The documents released today are available online at : www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/36104res20080724.html
To date , more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to the ACLU 's FOIA lawsuit .
They are available online at : www.aclu.org/torturefoia
Many of these documents are also compiled and analyzed in " Administration of Torture , " a recently published book by Jaffer and ACLU attorney Amrit Singh .
More information is available online at : www.aclu.org/administrationoftorture
In addition to Jaffer and Singh , attorneys on the case are Alexa Kolbi-Molinas and Judy Rabinovitz of the national ACLU ; Arthur Eisenberg and Beth Haroules of the New York Civil Liberties Union ; Lawrence S. Lustberg and Melanca D. Clark of the New Jersey - based law firm Gibbons P.C. ; and Shayana Kadidal and Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
So , you want to know how bad this crash will get .
Fine .
Spend 30 seconds to see the magnitude of what it is today .
It ’s going to get much worse .
The Manchester Guardian published 13 photos from around the world that show the extent of the disaster .
Spend just 3 seconds per photo .
( You wo n’t see these on Tout TV . )
I have never seen anything like these scenes .
Yet we are in only the early stage of the crash .
The British banking system is close to collapse .
There is serious talk at the highest levels of the nationalization of all British banks .
The currency markets are acting as though this is likely .
Nouriel Roubini , the man who predicted this recession in 2007 ( a little late , but better than most academic economists ) , recently gave a speech in Dubai .
He said that he has estimated U.S. capital losses of $ 3.6 trillion , half at banks and broker - dealers .
The total capitalization of U.S. banks is $ 1.4 trillion .
In short , he said , the American banking system is bordering on insolvency .
The story is here .
Think about this .
Today , we are facing a situation in which all U.S. banks could go legally bankrupt .
In the Great Depression , over 6,000 banks went bankrupt .
These were mostly small rural banks and small - town banks .
The Federal Reserve System saw to it that no major bank went under .
There are several ways to paper this over .
One would be to do more of the same — more purchases by the Federal Reserve of toxic assets held by banks and brokerage firms .
Another would be the creation of a government entity that will tap into Federal Reserve fiat money .
It could serve as a gigantic holding company for the busted banks ’ depreciated assets .
It is called an “ aggregator bank . ”
This would save the banks . . . for a while .
The fiat money used to buy the assets would allow the banks to keep their doors open .
The public could get access to their deposits .
But the reality will be this : a government - run banking system .
This approach is on the discussion list proposed by William Geithner , Obama ’s choice for Secretary of the Treasury .
Only the “ oops ” of his $ 34,000 missed tax payments will keep Geithner from being confirmed .
Congress does not really care , but constituents may .
Probably not .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dismissed this as “ a few hiccups . ”
He failed to pay self - employment taxes for money he earned 2001 to 2004 while working for the IMF , according to materials released by the Senate committee .
In 2006 , the IRS notified him that he owed $ 14,847 in self - employment taxes and $ 1,885 in interest from 2003 and 2004 , which he paid after an audit .
The IRS waived penalties for those tax years .
Transition officials discovered last fall that Geithner also had not paid the taxes in 2001 or 2002 .
He paid $ 19,176 in back taxes and $ 6,794 in interest for 2001 and 2002 several days before Obama announced his choice , the committee documents showed .
All told , Geithner had failed to pay $ 34,023 in self - employment taxes for the years 2001 to 2004 .
No penalties , of course .
For you or me , penalties .
But not for him .
Initially , he told the committee that he had messed up because he used TurboTax .
You can view the video of his testimony here .
He can do a song and dance while sitting down .
Under questioning , he was unable to show how TurboTax caused this error .
This is reminiscent of Hillary Clinton ’s inability to produce evidence of exactly how she made $ 100,000 by trading cattle futures .
Nobody pressed the issue with her , then or now .
The Senate , caught in an embarrassing situation in full public view , has not yet confirmed him .
It wants another hearing session .
This is a man who was paid $ 398,000 a year at the New York Federal Reserve , the man who will officially be in charge of the Internal Revenue Service .
“ Nice work if you can get it , and if you get it , tell me how . ”
Of course , I know how .
As soon as he was out of grad school , he went to work for Kissinger and Associates .
FRACTIONAL RESERVESAt present , banks hold excess reserves at the Federal Reserve because the FED began paying interest on reserves last fall .
But with the federal funds rate now close to zero , banks are moving money back into the loan market .
This will jump - start the fractional reserve system ’s creation of money .
The banking system already has sufficient legal reserves to allow a huge expansion of the money supply .
Every time the FED buys an asset and does not offset the purchase by the sale of another asset of equal face value , the legal reserves rise for the nation ’s banks .
The adjusted monetary base has increased from about $ 850 billion to $ 1.8 trillion since September of 2008 .
You can see the chart here .
I provide a link to the latest chart on my site .
Monitor this chart : “ Adjusted Monetary Base : Short Term . ”
The monetary base provides the foundation for banks to lend money .
They do lend money .
All reports on the banks ’ refusal to lend money fail to mention what should be obvious , namely , that the banks cannot pay interest on deposits if they do not lend the money deposited .
This is why they lend every dime .
They have been lending to the FED , which does not re-lend the money .
This is why the fractional reserve process has not done its work .
This is why the money multiplier has been falling .
But now that the FED is no longer paying more than a fraction of a percent interest , banks are moving the excess reserve money into the general economy .
You have been told that borrowers are afraid to borrow , and bankers are afraid to lend .
Is this true ?
Is the United States Treasury Department afraid to borrow ?
When an outfit runs a $ 1.2 trillion annual deficit , I guarantee you that it is not afraid to borrow .
Are bankers afraid to lend to the Treasury ?
No .
People ask : “ If banks are afraid , to whom will they loan money ? ” Repeat after me : “ The United States Treasury . ”
Do you think the people receiving monthly checks from the Treasury will go to their banks , withdraw currency , and hide it at home ?
Or do you think they are just barely making ends meet , and will spend the money ?
I think they will deposit the money in their bank accounts .
What will their banks do with this money ?
I think I know .
The monetary base has doubled the banks ’ legal reserves since September 2008 .
The increase monetary base came when the FED bought assets .
That money was deposited in banks .
Banks will lend this money , now that they cannot afford to keep the money at the FED as excess reserves .
They will lend to the Treasury .
The Treasury is ready to spend .
If your local bank is still taking deposits , then it is still lending .
The borrowers are spending this money .
Whatever is not immediately spent by borrowers is kept in the borrowers ’ bank accounts , money which is lent short - term by the bank .
Conclusion ( with apologies to Kevin Costner ) : “ If Ben prints it , banks will lend . ”
Are you worried about price deflation ?
Really ?
Can you tell me why ?
UNEMPLOYMENT
The news from the job markets around the world is grim .
No matter how the various governments ’ statisticians have cooked the books , the unemployment rate is rising .
The “ recipe ” does not often change , so the trend is what matters .
The trend is ominous .
Demand for discretionary products is falling .
Food is not very discretionary , given the fact that people find it difficult to change their diets .
Food costs have been rising .
The CPI was up by a minuscule 0.1 % in 2008 .
But the CPI minus food and energy was up by 1.8 % .
Energy costs rose in the first half of 2008 , then fell .
So , the bulk of this increase came from food .
We should expect to see this pattern continue .
Those industries that are based on discretionary spending , most notably the auto industry , will continue to experience depressionary conditions .
Anyone whose livelihood depends on the sale of new cars is in a difficult position .
Nobody needs to buy a new car .
He can buy a used car .
I know .
My wife bought one last Saturday .
So did I .
We paid less for two minivans , a 2006 Toyota Sienna and a 2006 Chrysler Town & Country , than what a new stripped - down Dodge minivan costs .
Americans are finally beginning to save .
This began in the second quarter of 2008 .
The rate of household saving as a percentage of disposable ( after - tax ) income rose a little above 2 % .
It ’s about time !
This is likely to continue .
Economic recovery depends on capital formation .
When people save , they turn money over to a bank or to an investment fund that deposits the money in a bank .
The money saved does not go under the mattress .
It gets spent .
Again , when analysts say that saving is deflationary , they do n’t know what they are talking about .
There is only one form of saving that is deflationary .
You go to your bank , withdraw currency , and hide it under a mattress , or else send it to your wife in El Salvador , where she spends it .
There , it circulates as a black market currency .
This reverses the fractional reserve process .
Nothing else does .
So , unless some analyst shows you evidence that this is what savers are doing with their money , do n’t believe him when he says that the increased rate of saving is dangerously deflationary .
The only way that increased saving lowers prices is by increased production : “ more goods chasing a fixed supply of money . ”
There is nothing dangerous about increased production .
If there were , the West ’s high - tech economy would have collapsed in the 1990 ’s because of the fall in the price of computers and software .
It is true that unemployed people spend less money .
But never let things stop there .
Do n’t fall for the fallacy of the thing not seen .
What does the unemployed laborer do ?
He collects unemployment insurance , which he spends .
His employer cuts prices .
Consumers save money .
What do they do with their saved money ?
( 1 ) They spend it on something else .
( 2 ) They invest it .
What does the bank do with the saved money ?
It lends it .
The analysis that we hear about unemployment ’s causing deflation is silly .
Other than the contraction of the money supply , the only thing that causes mild price declines is increased production .
Once produced by the central bank , the money remains in someone ’s bank account .
If it gets lent , it gets spent .
What about the Great Depression ?
Did n’t unemployment cause falling prices ?
No .
What caused falling prices was the contraction of the money supply .
How did this happen ?
All those banks that went under .
There was no FDIC until 1934 .
A busted bank not only stopped the fractional reserve process , it reversed it .
The money supply shrank .
If you are employed by a company that sells discretionary products or services , you are in trouble .
You will soon be in much bigger trouble .
The contraction of this zone of the economy will continue .
If you work for a restaurant , you are in trouble .
If you work for a supermarket that sells low - cost food , you will do just fine .
You will survive .
What matters is demand for your product , not aggregate demand for the entire economy .
Aggregate demand depends on individual production .
If you are productive , and if you produce something for the non-discretionary zone of the economy , you will do well .
Keynesian central planners want voters to hand more tax money over to them , so that the planners can keep aggregate demand high .
The best way to keep aggregate demand high is to reduce corporate taxes , reduce graduated income taxes , reduce Social Security taxes , reduce government spending , and stop trying to regulate what people do with their money and their skills .
CONCLUSION
This economy is going to get worse .
The inflationary policies of central banks from 1995 — 2006 set the trap .
Their disinflationary policies from 2007 - mid-2008 sprang the trap .
Now their inflationary policies will set a new trap : price inflation .
They do not know what they are doing .
Neither do commercial bankers and Congress .
The public pays for this shared confusion .

Northrop Grumman recently announced its stealth UAV has been successfully completed and will be ready for initial test flights in the fall of 2009 .
Designed under a joint program with the United States Navy , the X - 47B drone will closely resemble a strike fighter .
It will take off from and land on an aircraft carrier and support mid-air refueling .
Unlike the current crop of military UAVs , the X - 47B will operate mostly autonomously once airborne .
Northrop Grumman was awarded a Navy contract in 2007 to develop two unmanned combat air system ( UCAS ) vehicles over the course of six years .
Called the X - 47B , the first drone was built in just over a year .
The initial requirement for this new aircraft design was just integration with the aircraft carrier system , but mid-air refueling was later added to the mix .
The X - 47B is designed to fly at altitudes of up to 40,000 feet at high subsonic speeds .
It is also designed for long range , high endurance missions , performing several tasks including intelligence gathering , surveillance , reconnaissance , targeting , close air support , communications relay , ballistic missile detection , and precision strikes .
The X - 47B drones are being built in California and incorporate parts and services from several partners including Lockheed Martin , Pratt & Whitney , GE Aviation , Honeywell , Goodrich , Dell , GKE Aerospace , Eaton Aerospace , Moog Inc. , Wind River , Parker Aerospace , Hamilton Sunstrand , and Rockwell Collins .
Only one X - 47B has been constructed at this time .
A second drone should be completed in 2009 .
No further vehicles are planned until after the design passes its tests .
Subsystem and structural tests are currently underway .
The initial aerial tests scheduled for fall 2009 will only ensure the vehicle can fly ; more robust testing including flights from an aircraft carrier are set to start in 2011 with an eye toward deployment only around 2020 .
Why are some people generous and others selfish ?
There 's no doubt that both strategies pay off under certain circumstances , but research ( as well as everyday experience ) shows that we are not mere opportunists — some people simply are nicer than others .
This raises a question which intrigues evolutionary psychologists : is there a selective force that works in favour of a wide range of personalities , preventing us from all evolving the same optimal character trait ?
A possible answer has recently been published by mathematicians from the universities of Bristol and Exeter .
Their game theoretical model of human interaction shows that diversity , once it has taken root in a population , can be self - perpetuating and ensure its own existence for generations to come .
Who do you trust ?
" What we found is that watching each other 's behaviour produced individuals who were more socially aware , " explains John McNamara , who led the research , " which in turn exaggerated the personality traits of both players .
Some became more cooperative — because they became aware of the impact their decisions were making on their reputations — while others became less cooperative and exploited trusting individuals for personal gain . "
McNamara 's team , which also includes Philip Stephens and Sasha Dall , work in evolutionary game theory , an area that over the last few decades has gained popularity with people who study evolving systems , including economists , biologists , sociologists and psychologists .
As the name suggests , the theory likens inherited traits to strategies in the great game of evolution .
An advantageous trait has a positive payoff in terms of fitness to survive and have offspring , and this is reflected in a larger proportion of the next generation having that particular trait .
Using simple mathematical rules to describe the payoff and replication of traits in the next generation , researchers can sit back and let a computer work out whether a particular trait survives , becomes dominant , or eventually dies out .
McNamara , Stephens and Dall based their model on a simple game of trust and cooperation .
Imagine that two individuals , call them Alice and Bob , have been thrown together and have to decide whether or not to cooperate on a certain task .
Alice is the one who has to make the first move .
She has to signal whether or not she is willing to trust Bob .
If she does , and Bob reciprocates , then both receive a certain payoff , which is higher than the payoff they would both get if Alice had decided not to trust Bob .
If , however , Bob decides to defect once Alice has decided to trust him , he will receive a higher payoff still , while Alice will get nothing .
As it stands , only a very naive Alice would decide to trust Bob , since he does n't have much incentive to cooperate .
In terms of evolution , you would expect naive Alices to eventually die out , which would in turn make altruistic , cooperating Bobs redundant .
But now imagine that social awareness enters the game .
If Bob is aware that he is being watched by future Alices , he may well decide to cooperate if trusted , for if he does n't , he may never be trusted again and therefore always lose out on the higher reward .
If Alice has some way of finding out how Bob has behaved on previous occasions , she may be more willing to trust .
Being a trusting Alice and a cooperating Bob may become viable evolutionary strategies .
The question is whether Alices with varying degrees of trust and Bobs with varying degrees of trustworthiness can exist stably alongside each other .
To find out , the researchers imagined a population of individuals who are randomly paired off in Alice - Bob situations .
Each individual plays the role of Alice in some interactions and the role of Bob in others .
When cast in the role of Alice , an individual always behaves in the same way , according to an inherited trait : some always trust Bob , some never trust Bob , some trust Bob if he has been seen to cooperate in at least one of n previous occasions , some trust him if he has been seen to cooperate in at least two of n previous occasions , and so on .
The latter classes represent Alices with social awareness and varying degrees of trust .
When cast in the role of Bob , each individual may or may not cooperate if trusted , and the individual 's chance of cooperating is measured by a number p between zero and one .
The continuously varying values of p represent Bobs of varying degrees of trustworthiness .
The researchers assumed that an individual 's degree of trust , when being Alice , and trustworthiness , when being Bob , are independent .
This is n't entirely realistic , but it frees the researchers from having to keep track of the association between genes that control the traits .
Each interaction comes with a certain payoff for the two individuals involved .
The exact value of this payoff depends on the individuals , but using statistics it 's possible to calculate a mean payoff , a sort of average , for the traits in each role .
For example , when acting as Alice an individual who uses some social awareness to assess Bob may have a higher mean payoff than one who trusts Bob unquestioningly .
Similarly , an individual who in the role of Bob has a 50 % chance of cooperating may have a higher mean payoff than one whose chance of cooperation is zero .
These mean values are used to calculate the proportion of the next generation that display a certain trait : the researchers devised a formula which ensures that the higher the expected payoff for a trait ( such as the degree of trust in an Alice , or the degree of trustworthiness in a Bob ) , the higher the proportion of the next generation with that same trait .
With these rules in place , it would be possible to calculate how the various degrees of trust and trustworthiness perform over many generations , but there is another important issue to take into account : in real - life evolution individuals do n't just acquire traits through inheritance , but also through mutation .
This is important because a society of nice altruists could be turned on its head within a few generations by the influence of a selfish mutant .
The researchers built mutation into their model by introducing mutation rates which slightly adjust the replicating formulae for the next generation .
The next step was to set the computers chomping .
Starting with some initial distribution of traits and values for the various parameters that define the game — the payoffs that result from trusting and cooperating , and the rates of mutation — the researchers waited to see how the traits fared generation after generation .
For certain initial values , the proportions of individuals with the various traits eventually settled down — they hardly changed at all from generation to generation .
Such an unchanging configuration of traits was deemed to be evolutionary stable .
Social awareness makes for nice people .
Unsurprisingly , when the researchers initialised their model without social awareness — with only universally trusting or untrusting Alices — the number of trusting Alices became negligible , while the most popular chance p of cooperation was zero .
Without social awareness , it is impossible to maintain trustworthiness and trust .
However , in stable situations that involved social awareness , two types of Bob could be seen to exist alongside each other : a non-cooperating type , and a type with quite a high degree of trustworthiness .
Universally trusting Alices were also seen to exist alongside universally untrusting ones , and those who display social awareness and varying degrees of trust — a whole range of character traits existing in an evolutionary stable situation .
The researchers put the phenomenon down to a positive feedback loop : " Variation encourages social awareness , " explains Dall , " which favours greater personality divergence , maintaining the need for social awareness .
In other words , because people operate in such different ways , we need information to decide whether or not trust to them .
This encourages a really diverse range of responses which , in turn , makes social awareness all the more important . "
Real - life people and their interactions are of course a whole lot more complicated than the virtual individuals in the model .
But what the research shows is that diversity is no mystery : it can arise from the very rules of the game and maintain itself .
The research also shows that models of human behaviour , used widely in economics , can no longer ignore complex and changing interpersonal relationships , as they have tended to do so far .

JILL , 19 , from Michigan , wants to go to university to read political science .
There is just one problem : she keeps failing the mathematics requirement .
“ I am an exceptional student in all other subjects , so my consistent failure at math made me feel very stupid , ” she says .
In fact , she stopped going to her college mathematics class after a while because , she says , “ I could n’t take the daily reminder of what an idiot I was . ”
Last November , Jill got herself screened for learning disabilities .
She found that while her IQ is above average , her numerical ability is equivalent to that of an 11 - year - old because she has something called dyscalculia .
The diagnosis came partly as a relief , because it explained a lot of difficulties she had in her day - to - day life .
She ca n’t easily read a traditional , analogue clock , for example , and always arrives 20 minutes early for fear of being late .
When it comes to paying in shops or restaurants , she hands her wallet to a friend and asks them to do the calculation , knowing that she is likely to get it wrong .
Welcome to the stressful world of dyscalculia , where numbers rule because inhabitants are continually trying to avoid situations in which they have to perform even basic calculations .
Despite affecting about 5 per cent of people – roughly the same proportion as are dyslexic – dyscalculia has long been neglected by science , and people with it incorrectly labelled as stupid .
Now , though , researchers are starting to get to the root of the problem , bringing hope that dyscalculic children will start to get specialist help just …
GAZA CITY —
The 27 - year - old in a sweatsuit limped to the table , heaved himself into a chair and began to talk about how he had been shot .
Men from Hamas have begun to assault people they suspect of supporting its chief political rival , Fatah , he said , and on Sunday , he became one of the victims .
It was impossible to verify the man ’s account , which he provided on the condition that he remain anonymous , out of concern for his safety .
But it came during a week in which leaders of Fatah accused Hamas of harassing and harming its members in the Gaza Strip .
Yasser Abd Rabbo , an ally of the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , said at a news conference in Ramallah on Thursday that Hamas had “ turned its rifles in the direction of Fatah members ” after Israel stopped its military offensive on Sunday .
Mr. Rabbo accused Hamas of placing Fatah supporters under house arrest and shooting some of them in the legs , an intimidation tactic that it used in the past .
A Hamas spokesman , Fawzi Barhoum , strongly denied the accusation , saying that Fatah was raising the issue to distract attention from the fact that it remained on the sidelines and did not challenge Israel during the three weeks of fighting in Gaza .
I know a man , a man of a conservative bent , who gets downright irate anytime you use some variation or another of “ tax cuts for the rich ” in conversation .
He ca n’t be taking it personally , I do n’t suppose , since he is n’t rich and , as far as I can tell , he has no prospects for getting that way unless he happens to trip over a winning PowerBall ticket .
So I guess you ’d say he ’s like Joe the Plumber and many millions more Americans who have very little , but want to make damned sure that they look after the interests of those who have everything .
People like this man are the reason I always giggle when I encounter political and economic theories that hinge on things like “ rationality ” and “ informed self - interest . ”
I was reminded of this man today , when the following story found its way to my desktop :
Richest Americans ’ Income Doubled as Tax Rate SlashedJan. 30 ( Bloomberg ) —
The average tax rate paid by the richest 400 Americans fell by a third to 17.2 percent through the first six years of the Bush administration and their average income doubled to $ 263.3 million , new IRS data show .
This man , best I can tell , regards “ tax cuts for the rich ” as some sort of evil liberal meme , no doubt crafted in a Satanic sex ceremony involving Jane Fonda in George Soros ’ basement .
So just to be clear , let ’s snip some key facts – yes Virginia , there is such a thing as a fact – from the story :
“ The average tax rate paid by the richest 400 Americans fell by a third to 17.2 percent through the first six years of the Bush administration ”
“ their average income doubled to $ 263.3 million ”
Source : IRS data
“ The 17.2 percent tax rate in 2006 was the lowest since the IRS began tracking the 400 largest taxpayers in 1992 ”
“ The drop from 2001 ’s tax rate of 22.9 percent was due largely to ex-President George W. Bush ’s push to cut tax rates on most capital gains to 15 percent in 2003 ”
“ Capital gains made up 63 percent of the richest 400 Americans ’ adjusted gross income in 2006 , or a combined $ 66.1 billion ”
If this man I know is reading , I ’m sure he ’s angry .
And why not .
As noted conservative TV pundit Stephen Colbert has noted , facts , reality , and even information itself have a well - known liberal bias .
Indian troops make up a quarter of peacekeepers in DR Congo The Democratic Republic of Congo has asked the United Nations not to send any more Indian peacekeeping troops to the troubled east of the country .
A government spokesman told the BBC there were already enough in the force but gave no further reason .
Over the last few years , Indian peacekeepers have been accused of gold trafficking and sexual abuse .
India says it takes firm action against perpetrators if allegations are proved and has disciplined troops in the past .
Last week , the Security Council agreed to send 3,000 more troops to DR Congo where more fighting has been reported between rebels and a rival militia .
Recent weeks have seen heavy fighting involving rebels , government troops and pro-government militia which has displaced more than 250,000 people .
See detailed map of the area " There are already enough Indian troops in Congo , and the UN reinforcements should come from other countries , " government spokesman Lambert Mende told the BBC .
He said there was a need to " redress the balance " of the make - up of the 17,000 - strong UN force in DR Congo , known as Monuc .
Indian soldiers make up a quarter of Monuc 's numbers .
Last week , 44 community groups in DR Congo wrote a letter to the UN Security Council asking for European troops to be sent to the region to halt atrocities there .
In the latest fighting , rebels led by dissident general Laurent Nkunda attacked the pro-government Mai-Mai militia on the road to Uganda , north - east of the rebel - held town of Rutshuru .
The UN condemned the clashes as a violation to last week 's ceasefire , but Gen Nkunda 's men say they were conducting operations to secure the population from Rwandan rebels known as FDLR .
Gen Nkunda has said he is fighting to protect his Tutsi community from attack by Rwandan Hutu rebels , some of whom are accused of taking part in the 1994 genocide .
Reports say clashes also erupted on Tuesday north of Nyanzale , an area Gen Nkunda 's men had withdrawn from to make way for a buffer zone .
Meanwhile , Monuc has reported more lootings perpetrated by Congolese soldiers in a village further north of the ceasefire zone , around Lubero .
UN special envoy Olusegun Obasanjo , who negotiated the ceasefire , is expected for a second visit to DR Congo at the weekend .

After years of using Linux I 've built up a collection of customised config scripts for things like bash , vim , and screen .
Having everything setup just how I want it is great , until I need to start working on a new computer .
A simple solution is to copy all my config files over to the new computer , but it means I need to re-copy all the config files if I make any changes to them .
This is n't too much of a problem if I 'm only working on two computers , but it becomes a real pain with more .
The solution I 've come up with ( and I 'm sure others have too ) is to put all my config files into into a Git repository on GitHub .
Any changes to the config files can be committed to the repository , and than a quick update operation other machines keeps all the config files in sync .
In this post I 'll describe how to set it all up .
Adding your config files to GitHub
You 'll obviously need to install Git .
On any debian based system this is as simple as :
sudo aptitude install git-core
You 'll also nee to Signup for a free GitHub account , and create a new repository .
GitHub uses public - key cryptography and SSH for authentication , so you 'll need to create a SSH public key on each machine you 'll be accessing GitHub from .
Details of how to do this are given in their guide .
After adding your public key details to your GitHub account page you 're ready to add your config files :
git init git add . bashrc git add .vimrc git add < any other config files you want to add > git commit -m ' Initial commit ' git remote add origin git@github.com :coderholic/config.git #
Your URL will differ git push origin master
Now all your config files are on GitHub !
Setting up a new machine
You 'll need to create a SSH public key on the new machine , just as you did on the previous one .
Once you 've done that :
Once you 've done that :
git init git pull git@github.com :coderholic/config.git git remote add origin git@github.com :coderholic/config.git
And your setup will match your other machine !
Making changes
The real benefit of storing your config files on GitHub is that it makes it really easy to synchronise changes between all your computers .
After making a change on one computer :
git commit - a -m " Useful commit message goes here " git push origin master
Then all you need to do on your other machines is issue the following command :
git pull origin master
And you 're synced !
If you 're interested in seeing my config files you can see them on the GitHub page : http://github.com/coderholic/config/tree/master
For linux hosting needs on the other hand , try reading reviews from a reliable provider first .
Banking rules dictate that Lebanese banks keep 30 % of their capital in cash
By Natalia Antelava
BBC News , Beirut
The world maybe in meltdown but Beirut is booming .
The country best known for wars , turmoil and instability has not just survived the global financial crisis , it seems to be thriving because of it .
Deep down in the basement of Lebanon 's Central bank treasury vaults are full .
Cash has been flowing in like never before , Lebanese banks are posting record deposits and bankers say this is the best year in Lebanon 's financial history .
According to the country 's chief banker all of this is because while the world was shocked when in September the banking giants began to wobble , Lebanon was prepared .
" I saw the crisis coming and I told the commercial banks in 2007 to get out of all international investments related to the international markets " , says Riad Salameh , the governor of Lebanon 's Central Bank .
You could have thought they had a crystal ball
Edward Gardner
International Monetary Fund
There is a tradition of conservative regulation at the Central Bank in Lebanon , which kept the banks safe .
Banks were n't allowed to take on too much debt and they had to have at least 30 % of their assets in cash .
They were not allowed to speculate in risky packages of bundled up debts .
And weak banks were forced to merge with bigger ones before they got into trouble .
" You could have thought they had a crystal ball .
It was very wise of the Lebanese regulators not to get involved in all these risky international investments that turned out to be the doom of many banking systems , " says Edward Gardner of the International Monetary Fund .
Well tested system But Lebanon 's conservative policies are not just thanks to the wisdom of its chief banker .
Mr Salameh says that in Lebanon 's high risk political environment he did not have much choice .
I think I 've proved my point ...
I believe that this wild extension of credit , these high leverages in order to get more profits into financial institutions were against the very nature of banking
Riad Salameh
Governor of Lebanon 's Central Bank " The system we created has been tested against wars , against instability , against political assassinations .
And our sector would be much more developed if Lebanon did not have political and security risks , but it has also induced us to have a conservative reflex because we were always getting ready for the worst case scenario , " says Mr Salameh .
This conservative reflex has also spared Lebanon the housing crash that the rest of the world is going through .
Commercial property developer Karim Basil showed me around one of his latest projects - a spectacular ultra-modern and brightly lit apartment in the heart of Beirut 's historic district .
Mr Basil says that getting loans here is never easy .
The banks will only lend him 60 % of what he needs and they want cast iron guarantees that he can repay .
" Its not always good for business , " says Mr Basil , " but it does eliminate speculation and it also keeps prices stable . "
Government debt
But the tight reign on borrowing does not apply to the government .
Over the years , Lebanon has taken on loan after loan for post war reconstruction .
Today , per capita , Lebanon owes more than any other country in the world .
On paper this makes it vulnerable , but the political realities of the Middle East mean that danger is unlikely ever to materialise .
When I went to get my first mortgage in London , I never met my bank manager .
Banking should once again become a personal relationship between the customer and the bank manager
Faddy Abboud
Lebanon 's Industrialist Association " This level of public debt has created serious problems for other countries , but the difference is that there is a perception that Lebanon has friends with very deep pockets who will not let it go down financially , " says Edward Gardner of the IMF .
" This was demonstrated in 2006 war with Israel , when both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were very quick to deposit large sums of money into the Central Bank to help it to remain stable , " Mr Gardner added .
But Lebanon could still feel the aftershocks of the credit crunch .
Every year , thousands of highly educated young people from Lebanon go to work abroad .
With some 12 million Lebanese overseas and only 3.5 million in the country , remittances make up a vital third of the economy .
Remittances hit
There are concerns that as recession bites elsewhere , Lebanese abroad will start sending less money home .
But unlike elsewhere , the savings they have already deposited should be safe .
" We know that our savings are safe , and this strength of the banking sector is a great push for the industry here , " says Faddy Abboud , the head of Lebanon 's Industrialist Association .
Mr Abboud has many complaints about the government handling of the economy , which he describes as a web of monopolies riddled by corruption .
But when it comes to banking , Mr Abboud says Lebanon got it right .
" When I went to get my first mortgage in London , I never met my bank manager .
Banking should once again become a personal relationship between the customer and the bank manager and I think there are many lessons for the world to learn from Lebanese banks , " Mr Abboud says .
Riad Salameh of the Central Bank , who in the past was often criticised for his conservative approach , feels vindicated .
" I think I 've proved my point , " he says .
" I have personally been stubborn about keeping a very conservative approach to banking , as I believe that this wild extension of credit , these high leverages in order to get more profits into financial institutions were against the very nature of banking . "
As the night falls , the dance floor of the Casino , one of Beirut 's many glitzy nightclubs , is full .
The rest of the world is now being forced to sober up after the wild excesses of the global markets , but here the party 's on .
The Lebanese are a nation of survivors , who have paid a heavy price for the fortunes they are reaping now .
Through their troubles they have learned how to party as if tomorrow will never come , but also , against the odds , how to bank for their future .

Iraq in midst of �agricultural disaster �
Nizar Latif

KUT , IRAQ // Just before harvest time the fields around the city of Kut used to be thick with barley , sunflowers and maize .
This year large areas were left bare as farmers fell victim to a water shortage that has pushed agriculture in Iraq to the brink .
" We are suffering , all of us , " said Falah Mohammed al Dirian , a local farmer .
" It has been one crisis followed by another .
There is no rain , there is no water in the rivers , the land is ruined by salt , we cannot afford fuel for our generators and there is no help from the government . "
Mr al Dirian�s family has been working the land for generations but the 38 - year - old said he now sees no future in it .
" All of the farmers I know are encouraging their children to get different types of work , mainly in the Iraqi police and security forces , " he said .
" There is not much money in farming now .
In fact we are losing money these days . "
There are 22,000 people living in the 14 villages of the Al Mzak district along on the Tigris River near Kut , the capital of Wasit province .
Most of them are dependent on farming for a living and are now threatened by rising poverty .
Average rainfall in 2007 was just 40 per cent of its typical level , according to the Iraqi government , hitting farmers , already suffering from a myriad of problems , particularly hard .
Ministry of agriculture officials said Iraq is losing upwards of five per cent of its agricultural land each year and estimates the country will need to import three million tonnes of wheat in 2008 - 2009 to offset a 27 per cent drop in domestic production .
Barley production is also likely to fall by 60 per cent , according to government figures and US $ 132 million ( Dh485 m ) has been set aside to purchase supplies .
" Farmers are abandoning their land , much of which has become unproductive from water shortages or salinity [ salt in the soil ] , " said Latif Hamid Turfa , the governor of Wasit .
" Farmers are looking for alternative work and that �s going to do a great harm to Iraq�s food production . "
At a local level , Mr Turfa said , there was little that could be done .
The provincial council has set up a committee that is in the process of evaluating the land with the aim of reclaiming areas that have effectively been poisoned by increasing levels of salt .
" The drought is beyond our power to control , " he said .
" And the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers are both reduced in their flow because Turkey and Syria are taking more water than before .
It means less gets down as far as Wasit . "
A report on Iraq�s farming sector by the US Department of Agriculture this year noted an " agricultural disaster " had cut wheat production in some parts of the country by up to 80 per cent of normal levels .
It is a far cry from the 1970s , when Iraq�s lush farming zones between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers grew food for export across the Middle East .
Government officials blame years of agricultural neglect under Saddam Hussein , although most farmers now look back on those times as years of comparative plenty .
" I used to grow dates and sell them to Saudi Arabia , " said Barik Mahdawi , who owns an orchard in the Zafaraniya district of south - central Iraq .
" I used to have traders coming from different countries to buy from me .
Now in the local market the dates being sold are Saudi dates .
" If I buy any fruits or vegetables they are from Syria , Iran , Saudi Arabia .
I can�t get an Iraqi cucumber or a tomato anymore .
I�m not sure such things even exist . "
The 63 - year - old used to employ 20 workers on his land ; today he has four .
" Salt is killing the trees , " he said .
" There will be nothing but desert left in Iraq soon .
The ministry of agriculture has got to help us .
We need more fertilisers and they must do something about the water levels of the rivers . "
After a lifetime growing Iraq�s famous dates , Mr Mahdawi , a father of eight , said he was close to giving up .
" Something needs to change otherwise it will be impossible to carry on , " he said .
" I am seriously thinking of selling the land while I can and getting away , getting out of Iraq if possible . "
At the ministry of agriculture in Baghdad , Saad Alwash , the deputy director , said action was being taken , but that problems were complex and would be difficult to overcome .
" We are providing seeds and support loans and improved fertilisers , " he said .
" And there are new fuel allocations for farmers to help ease their burden from rising prices .
In truth the bad security situation over the past years has made it difficult for farmers , there was too much chaos to get organised .
" But there has been a surge in the number of farmers applying for support loans and aid and we expect that will have a positive effect on agricultural production . "
Mr Alwash also said efforts were underway to reverse the growing trend of land becoming unproductive .
But international officials working in the farming sector have been highly critical of the ministry of agriculture , accusing it of gross inefficiency and corruption .
" All they offer are small loans with absurd conditions attached to them , " a farming consultant working for the US government in south - central Iraq said this year , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media .
" No ordinary farmer can really qualify for a loan and they end up having to pay a cut to government officials if they want one , " he said .
" If you �re an Iraqi farmer , the government is useless . "

U.S. & China Celebrate 30 Years
The United States and China celebrate 30 years of diplomatic relations , with Dr. Henry Kissinger former Secretary of State / Kissinger and Associates
Every few weeks for nearly four years , the Secret Service screened the IDs of employees of a Maryland cleaning company before they entered the house of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , the nation ’s top immigration official .
The company ’s owner says the workers sailed through the checks -- although some of them were actually illegal immigrants .
Now , owner James Reid finds himself in a predicament that he considers especially confounding .
In October , he was fined $ 22,880 after Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators said he failed to check identification and work documents and to fill out required I - 9 verification forms for employees , five of whom he said were part of crews sent to Chertoff ’s home and whom ICE told him to fire because they were undocumented .
“ Our people need to know , ” Reid said .
“ Our Homeland Security ca n’t police their own home .
How can they police our borders ? ”

Reid admits he made mistakes but called the fine so excessive that it might put him out of business .
Several of his workers moved after ICE agents showed up at their homes , he said .
Raising a common objection among employers as ICE cracks down on illegal hirings across the nation , Reid said it is unreasonable to expect businesspeople to distinguish between fake and real driver ’s licenses and Social Security cards .
Immigration laws are unevenly enforced , he added , allowing big companies to stay in business while crushing small - business owners and workers .
He said the rules punish “ scapegoats ” like him while inviting people at every level -- customers , subcontractors and contractors -- to look the other way while benefiting economically from cheaper labor .
“ No one wants to put the blame on the head ; they ’d rather put the blame on the business owner , ” said Reid , who owns Consistent Cleaning Services .
“ Damned if I should be fined for employees that I took over to their house . ”
Advertisement
Chertoff declined to comment .
“ We ’re very constrained in what we can say about anybody who has any kind of issue with the department , ” he said .
The Secret Service uses workers ’
ID information to conduct security checks , not immigration checks , much as most police departments do when they pull over people for traffic stops .
Eric Zahren , a spokesman for the service , which is part of Chertoff ’s department , declined to discuss specific screening practices .
But he said agents protecting the secretary “ would have run the appropriate checks , screened and escorted people as appropriate in order to maintain the security of the residence and our protectee ’s security . ”

Department of Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke said that in this type of investigation , ICE focuses on the employers , not where employees are dispatched .
He said that contractors have the responsibility of ensuring that their workers are legal , and that the Chertoffs were assured by Reid that workers sent to their home were legal .
Upon learning that Reid might have hired illegal immigrants , the Chertoffs stopped using his firm , and the secretary recused himself from the department ’s subsequent enforcement actions , Knocke said .
“ This matter illustrates the need for comprehensive immigration reform and the importance of effective tools for companies to determine the lawful status of their workforce , ” he said .
The Bush administration has pushed to expand employers ’ use of E - Verify , for instance , an electronic system that can confirm new hires ’ work documents against federal databases .
In addition to the Chertoffs ’ house , Reid said , his service once cleaned the Washington home of former President Clinton and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , now secretary of State - designee , as well as the homes of another Bush Cabinet member and of former Clinton Secretary of State Madeline Albright .
In those cases , he said , his company worked as a subcontractor and billing was done by a larger contractor firm .

Reid said he was referred to the Chertoffs in 2005 and worked mainly with the secretary ’s wife , Meryl Chertoff , an adjunct professor and director of the Sandra Day O’Connor Project on the State of the Judiciary at Georgetown Law School .
Reid ’s calendar shows that the Chertoffs paid $ 185 per visit for his company to clean their suburban Maryland home .

Conservative author Ann Coulter initially seemed pleased Tuesday to appear on CBS ’ “ The Early Show , ” especially after an interview that she was set to do on NBC ’s “ Today ” the same morning was canceled .
“ You are the most brilliant person in the mainstream media , the most manly , ” she told CBS anchor Harry Smith .
But by the end of the segment , she was no longer lavishing compliments on Smith , who aggressively confronted the controversial writer about the allegations in her latest book , “ Guilty : Liberal ‘ Victims ’ and Their Assault on America . ”
At one point , he suggested that she was crying victim herself and “ should have a cross . ”
“ Here ’s my problem , ” Smith told Coulter at the outset .
“ Because you try to be funny , because you have this kind of sophomoric , sort of simplistic kind of view of so many things … who ’s going to take you seriously ? ”
“ I think any comedy writer will tell you that sophomoric is New York Times code for funny , so I thank you for that , ” Coulter retorted .
Smith said afterward that he had n’t planned for the interview to get contentious , noting that Coulter devotes much of her book to challenging the mainstream media .
“ I was just going to challenge her back , ” he said in an interview .
“ The thing is , there are things she says that have a real place in our ongoing political conversation in terms of issues of importance to everybody .
The point I was trying to make to her was that if she was more serious , she would be taken more seriously . ”
In an e-mail , Coulter said she was flattered by Smith 's questioning .
" He treated me like a Republican vice presidential candidate ! " she wrote .
Their seven - minute exchange was the latest dust - up involving Coulter , a polarizing personality who is adept at generating attention for her bestselling books .
On Monday , she cried foul when an appearance she was set to make on “ Today ” was canceled , telling Fox News ’ Sean Hannity and Alan Colmes that NBC had only booked her as a “ charade ” to keep her from going on other shows .
NBC disputed that , saying that Coulter was bumped so the program could devote more time to covering the developments in the Gaza Strip , for which host Matt Lauer interviewed former British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
“ We ’ve had Ann Coulter on ‘ Today ’ many times , but because of the news in Washington and the Middle East , we decided to cancel her appearance on Tuesday morning , ” said NBC spokeswoman Megan Kopf .
“ Understanding the media as well as she does , we are sure she knows this happens from time to time . ”
After Coulter ’s complaints — and coverage on the Drudge Report , which reported that NBC had banned her for life , which the network denied — she was invited to appear on two segments of “ Today ” on Wednesday .
That adds up to a media bonanza for Coulter , who also appeared Tuesday on the Fox News morning program “ Fox & Friends . ”
But it was her interview on “ The Early Show ” that has so far generated the most attention .
Smith , who is known for his even - keeled , affable demeanor , noted in his tease for the segment that Coulter called him “ certifiably insane ” in her book .
“ Perhaps I am , for having her on the program this morning , ” he added .
In their interview , he objected to her criticizing him in her book for asking Sen. Edward M. Kennedy last year about whether Barack Obama was a target for assassination , saying , “ That was a legitimate question to ask . ”
When Coulter responded that all would - be or successful presidential assassins were “ anarchists , communists , liberals , they were some form of basically Obama ’s base , ” Smith urged her five times to “ take a breath . ”
“ I ’m breathing fine , ” she responded .
Smith said that as he read her book , “ the more I kept thinking , well , you ’re the whiner .
You ’re the one who ’s claiming victimhood here . ”
“ You should put yourself up on a cross , ” he added , extending his arms wide .
Later , Smith said he did n’t have any regrets about how he conducted the interview , but “ I ’m still not satisfied that we served any public good . ”
“ People sort of verbally wrestling with each other — you get a lot of heat and a lot of sweat , but I 'm not sure there ’s any particular satisfaction for either side , ” he added .

End of an era - the shutters came down in Glasgow 's Argyle Street store for good
Woolworths ' last 200 UK stores have closed their doors for good , leaving more than 27,000 people unemployed .
The firm 's 807 British outlets have been closing in stages since the end of December following clearance sales .
Tuesday was the final day for the remaining 200 stores , following a one - day reprieve by the High Street chain 's administrator , Deloitte .
Woolworths went into administration in November with debts of £ 385 m and Deloitte was unable to find a buyer .
Deloitte is now continuing negotiations to sell off individual sites , with stores in prime High Street locations expected to be reopened by other businesses .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
It has held talks with other retailers about taking on the leases of around 300 Woolworths stores and hopes to sell off the Ladybird children 's clothes and Chad Valley toys brands .
Shopworkers ' union Usdaw said it was contacting companies who may be buying empty Woolworths stores , recommending they prioritise applications from the chain 's redundant staff .
The union said it was also working with other organisations to ensure the staff had the best chance of re-employment .
General Secretary John Hannett said : " The union will also be in contact with local colleges , which will be offering free Skills for Life training .
" We will be providing as much support as necessary and would recommend all Woolworths staff to use JobCentre Plus and Next Steps to find alternative employment . "
We are all happy while we are getting the bargains but we wo n't be so pleased when all the other shops are wiped out too

Shopper
The store closures follow a clearance sale which saw stock and fixtures and fittings being sold at discount prices .
Customers were able to buy items such as staff lockers and the metal baskets they were filling up with bargains .
As Glasgow 's Argyll Street store closed one shopper said she had picked up bottles of water for 4 p , with another saying that despite buying some DVDs and CDs for " pennies " it was a " sad day " .
Professor Alan Wilson , from the city 's Strathclyde Business School , said one reason Woolworths did not survive was because it did n't offer the quality of some other stores .
" And it could n't offer the prices that the discount stores such as Primark , Lidl and others could actually offer , " he added .
In the Lichfield store Patricia Douglas , 58 , said shoppers had squabbled over the final bargains .
Mrs Douglas , from Hopwas , Staffordshire , said : " It is so sad to see the shop like this .
Many devastated staff had worked for Woolworths for years " Woolworths used to be the heart of Lichfield .
It was the heart of every high street .
" We are all happy while we are getting the bargains but we wo n't be so pleased when all the other shops are wiped out too , " she added .
The administrator would not confirm how much money had been raised by the sale but many stores have been cleared out by shoppers .
The chain 's first British store was opened by American Frank W Woolworth in Liverpool in 1909 .
The city 's branch shut at midday on Tuesday , as the manager said there was nothing left to sell .
Empty shelves Edna Sherman , 62 , from Everton , Liverpool , was one of the last customers allowed inside .
She said : " People in there are fighting to get at empty shelves , there is nothing left .
" I 've been shopping at Woolies all my life .
I remember going to the pick and mix when I was a girl and lately I would buy clothes for my grandchildren .
" There was always a bargain to be had at Woolies , I just do n't understand where it all went wrong . "
Woolworths is the most high - profile UK High Street casualty of the economic downturn and ran into trouble this year after struggling under the weight of its debt .
Its problems were compounded when it was forced to pay cash while buying goods from suppliers because trade credit insurers were no longer prepared to cover its suppliers .

Bishop Gene Robinson delivered the invocation for the Obama inaugural concert called We are One. Bishop Robinson 's speech was delivered minutes before HBO began its live broadcast of the concert with featured Beyonce , Bruce Springsteen , Garth Brooks , Stevie Wonder , Denzel Washington , Samuel L. Jackson , Jack Black , Tom Hanks , Gay Men 's Chorus of Washington and many others .
Update : I have added video of Bishop Robinsons 's speech .
We do n't see him in the clip , but the sound is clear .
A PIC source reports that some clips from the Lincoln Memorial event , including Bishop Robinson 's prayer , will be played on the Mall prior to the swearing in ceremony .
In addition , HBO 's Cusson has also confirmed that the cable outlet will include Bishop Robinson 's appearance and prayer in its re-broadcast of the event .
A Prayer for the Nation and Our Next President , Barack Obama
By The Rt. Rev. V. Gene Robinson , Episcopal Bishop of New Hampshire
Opening Inaugural Event
Lincoln Memorial , Washington , DC
January 18 , 2009
Welcome to Washington !
The fun is about to begin , but first , please join me
in pausing for a moment , to ask God¹s blessing upon our nation and our next
president .
O God of our many understandings , we pray that you will Š
Bless us with tears ­ for a world in which over a billion people exist on
less than a dollar a day , where young women from many lands are beaten and
raped for wanting an education , and thousands die daily from malnutrition ,
malaria , and AIDS .
Bless us with anger ­ at discrimination , at home and abroad , against
refugees and immigrants , women , people of color , gay , lesbian , bisexual and
transgender people .
Bless us with discomfort ­ at the easy , simplistic ³answers² we¹ve preferred
to hear from our politicians , instead of the truth , about ourselves and the
world , which we need to face if we are going to rise to the challenges of
the future .
Bless us with patience ­ and the knowledge that none of what ails us will be
³fixed ² anytime soon , and the understanding that our new president is a
human being , not a messiah .
Bless us with humility ­ open to understanding that our own needs must
always be balanced with those of the world .
Bless us with freedom from mere tolerance ­ replacing it with a genuine
respect and warm embrace of our differences , and an understanding that in
our diversity , we are stronger .
Bless us with compassion and generosity ­ remembering that every religion¹s
God judges us by the way we care for the most vulnerable in the human
community , whether across town or across the world .
And God , we give you thanks for your child Barack , as he assumes the office
of President of the United States .
Give him wisdom beyond his years , and inspire him with Lincoln¹s reconciling
leadership style , President Kennedy¹s ability to enlist our best efforts ,
and Dr. King¹s dream of a nation for ALL the people .
Give him a quiet heart , for our Ship of State needs a steady , calm captain
in these times .
Give him stirring words , for we will need to be inspired and motivated to
make the personal and common sacrifices necessary to facing the challenges
ahead .
Make him color - blind , reminding him of his own words that under his
leadership , there will be neither red nor blue states , but the United
States .
Help him remember his own oppression as a minority , drawing on that
experience of discrimination , that he might seek to change the lives of
those who are still its victims .
Give him the strength to find family time and privacy , and help him remember
that even though he is president , a father only gets one shot at his
daughters ¹ childhoods .
And please , God , keep him safe .
We know we ask too much of our presidents ,
and we¹re asking FAR too much of this one .
We know the risk he and his wife
are taking for all of us , and we implore you , O good and great God , to keep
him safe .
Hold him in the palm of your hand ­ that he might do the work we
have called him to do , that he might find joy in this impossible calling ,
and that in the end , he might lead us as a nation to a place of integrity ,
prosperity and peace .
AMEN .
Seventy - five years ago Friday , voters ratified the 21st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and officially ended Prohibition -- a 13 - year experiment as a " dry " country .
What does that mean today -- other than the legal distribution , manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages ?
The introduction of Prohibition and its eventual repeal show that the Constitution is , as it was intended to be , a malleable document that can be modified when the public demands it .
" The ...
Is global warming caused by humans ?
Is Barack Obama a Christian ?
Is evolution a well - supported theory ?
You might think these questions have been incontrovertibly answered in the affirmative , proven by settled facts .
But for a lot of Americans , they have n't .
Among Republicans , belief in anthropogenic global warming declined from 52 percent to 42 percent between 2003 and 2008 .
Just days before the election , nearly a quarter of respondents in one Texas poll were convinced that Obama is a Muslim .
And the proportion of Americans who believe God did not guide evolution ?
It 's 14 percent today , a two - point decline since the '90s , according to Gallup .
What 's going on ?
Normally , we expect society to progress , amassing deeper scientific understanding and basic facts every year .
Knowledge only increases , right ?
Robert Proctor does n't think so .
A historian of science at Stanford , Proctor points out that when it comes to many contentious subjects , our usual relationship to information is reversed : Ignorance increases .
He has developed a word inspired by this trend : agnotology .
Derived from the Greek root agnosis , it is " the study of culturally constructed ignorance . "
As Proctor argues , when society does n't know something , it 's often because special interests work hard to create confusion .
Anti-Obama groups likely spent millions insisting he 's a Muslim ; church groups have shelled out even more pushing creationism .
The oil and auto industries carefully seed doubt about the causes of global warming .
And when the dust settles , society knows less than it did before .
" People always assume that if someone does n't know something , it 's because they have n't paid attention or have n't yet figured it out , " Proctor says .
" But ignorance also comes from people literally suppressing truth — or drowning it out — or trying to make it so confusing that people stop caring about what 's true and what 's not . "
After years of celebrating the information revolution , we need to focus on the countervailing force :
The disinformation revolution .
The ur - example of what Proctor calls an agnotological campaign is the funding of bogus studies by cigarette companies trying to link lung cancer to baldness , viruses — anything but their product .
Think of the world of software today :
Tech firms regularly sue geeks who reverse - engineer their code to look for flaws .
They want their customers to be ignorant of how their apps work .
Even the financial meltdown was driven by ignorance .
Credit - default swaps were designed not merely to dilute risk but to dilute knowledge ; after they 'd changed hands and been serially securitized , no one knew what they were worth .
Maybe the Internet itself has inherently agnotological side effects .
People graze all day on information tailored to their existing worldview .
And when bloggers or talking heads actually engage in debate , it often consists of pelting one another with mutually contradictory studies they 've Googled : " Greenland 's ice shield is melting 10 years ahead of schedule ! " vs. " The sun is cooling down and Earth is getting colder ! "
As Farhad Manjoo notes in True Enough : Learning to Live in a Post - Fact Society , if we argue about what a fact means , we 're having a debate .
If we argue about what the facts are , it 's agnotological Armageddon , where reality dies screaming .
Can we fight off these attempts to foster ignorance ?
Despite his fears about the Internet 's combative culture , Proctor is optimistic .
During last year 's election , campaign - trail lies were quickly exposed via YouTube and transcripts .
The Web makes secrets harder to keep .
We need to fashion information tools that are designed to combat agnotological rot .
Like Wikipedia :
It encourages users to build real knowledge through consensus , and the result manages to ( mostly ) satisfy even people who hate each other 's guts .
Because the most important thing these days might just be knowing what we know .

Sabretooth " tigers " hunted in packs , sharing the spoils among themselves
Forget their ferocious fangs - sabretooth " tigers " were social animals who lived in family prides , like lions today , according to UK and US experts .
The abundance of S.fatalis fossils in Californian tar seeps suggests they were packs of scavengers , lured in by the distress calls of trapped prey .
Research in Africa found that audio playbacks of prey sounds attract social carnivores , but not solitary hunters .
This suggests S.fatalis was social too , claims the Royal Society journal study .
Jaw dropping
The so - called sabretooth tiger - Smilodon fatalis - is famous for its extremely long canine teeth , which reached up to seven inches and extended below the lower jaw .
This extinct cat was more likely to roam in formidable gangs , than as a secretive solitary animal .
Dr Chris Carbone , Zoological Society of London
But although commonly called " tigers " , due to their size , the species is actually part of a different subfamily , and they lived very differently .
While sabretoothed " tigers " were powerful predators , they were social beasts , rather than skulking loners , according to Dr Chris Carbone , a research fellow of the Zoological Society of London .
He said : " The extinct sabretoothed cat , Smilodon fatalis , has been something of an enigma , with almost nothing known of its behaviour .
" This research allowed us ... to conclude that this cat was more likely to roam in formidable gangs , than as a secretive solitary animal . "
S.fatalis - one of many sabretooth cat species - lived between 1.6 million and 10,000 years ago , in North and South America .
Many Smilodon fossils have been found in the Late Pleistocene era tar seeps at Rancho La Brea , California - apparently lured to their fate by the calls of trapped , dying herbivores .
In fact , the fossils are so numerous , many palaeontologists now believe the cats were pack hunters , who came to scavenge prey and share the spoils .
The cats lived in prides similar to modern day lions , research suggests Cat calls
In search of further evidence , Dr Carbone and colleagues looked at the behaviour of modern day carnivores , in the Serengeti region of Tanzania and the Kruger National Park , South Africa .
Big cats were lured to sites using audio " playbacks " of prey in distress , or the sounds of lions and hyenas .
The playbacks attracted large numbers of social carnivore species .
Lions and spotted hyenas made up 84 % of the individuals attending .
But solitary carnivores , of all sizes , were rare .
Overall , social carnivores attended the playbacks approximately 60 times more often than would be expected , based on their abundance relative to other carnivore species in the regions .
The researchers compared these to the carnivore species drawn into the tar seeps , apparently by the sounds of prey .
Again , they found that two species appear to dominate .
The presumably social dire wolf ( 51 % ) and Smilodon fatalis ( 33 % ) made up 84 % of the carnivores in the tar seeps .
" The striking similarities between the playbacks and the fossil record support the conclusion that Smilodon was social , " said Dr Carbone .
Social animals " [ Sabretooths ] were dependent on scavenging as a food source and are likely to have evolved more complicated social organisation in order to optimise their caloric intake . "
Professor Alan Turner , an expert in carnivore evolution , from Liverpool John Moores University , said : " These findings make sense when you look at the full picture .
" In the tar seeps , you find so many sabretooth fossils .
There is almost one predator for every prey .
" The implication is that several carnivores were attracted to each prey animal .
Logically , these predators were not all coming from different territories .
" We now have a whole battery of evidence - from the fossil record to modern ecological studies - all suggesting sabretooths were social .
" We can't say the case is closed , but we have some pretty strong indications . "
The research , published in The Royal Society 's journal Biology Letters , involved scientists from the University of California , Tshwane University of Technology and University of Pretoria .

Robert E. Lucas , Jr.
Lately the Mises Daily may have given the impression that we just bash Paul Krugman .
In the interest of balance , today I will cast aspersions on another Nobel laureate , the Chicago School economist Robert Lucas .
As is typical among many " promarket " economists , the undeniably sharp Lucas inexplicably sees no problem with government price fixing when it comes to interest rates .
In his recent Wall Street Journal op - ed , Lucas writes ,
The Federal Reserve 's lowering of interest rates last Tuesday was welcome , but it was also received with skepticism .
Once the federal - funds rate is reduced to zero , or near zero , does n't this mean that monetary policy has gone as far as it can go ?
This widely held view was appealed to in the 1930s to rationalize the Fed 's passive role as the U.S. economy slid into deep depression .
The present article is hardly the place to go into the debate over the Great Depression , but suffice it to say , Herbert Hoover 's ( and then FDR's ) very conscious efforts to " maintain purchasing power " by preventing wage cuts was one major factor in turning the stock - market crash into a decade - long slump .
( The fact that Hoover slapped on major tariff and income tax hikes did n't help , either . )
Lucas 's view — namely , that the 1929 downturn would have been a run-of - the - mill depression , but the Fed 's timidity turned it into the Great one — was popularized by Milton Friedman .
It resonates well with free - market types , because after all , it blames the Depression not on laissez - faire capitalism , but instead on regulatory blunders .
However , as Matt Machaj argued in a previous Mises Daily , such rhetoric is difficult for a proponent of truly market - based money and banking to accept .
Is it really government " intervention " if the Fed refrains from flooding the economy with more paper money ?
Let me put it this way : if Lucas is right , and the Fed 's " passive role " helps explain the genesis of the Great Depression , then what about all the little -d depressions that occurred in US history before the Fed was founded in 1913 ?
Was the Fed even more passive in the 1930s than during its nonexistence the previous century ?
But let us return to Lucas 's article :
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke 's statement last Tuesday made it clear that he does not share this view and intends to continue to take actions to stimulate spending .
There should be no mystery about what he has in mind .
Over the past four months the Fed has put more than $ 600 billion of new reserves into the private sector , using them to discount — lend against — a wide variety of securities held by a variety of financial institutions … .
This action has been the boldest exercise of the Fed 's lender - of - last - resort function in the history of the Federal Reserve System .
Mr. Bernanke said that he is prepared to continue or expand this discounting activity as long as the situation dictates .
Before analyzing this statement , let 's make sure we see just how bold this Fed exercise has been .
Below is a chart of total bank borrowings from the Fed , from 1919 to the present .
( If you squint your eyes , you can see the slight uptick to which Lucas refers . )
Now people have rightly focused on the dangers such a massive infusion poses to the strength of the dollar .
These fears are entirely justified .
But I want to focus on the political aspects of the recent Fed behavior .
Let us parse Lucas 's description : the infusion of some $ 600 billion in just a few months has come from Fed loans to banks , based upon collateral that no one in the market would accept at face value ( literally ) .
Lucas himself says ,
Could the $ 600 billion in new reserves be called a bailout ?
In a sense , yes : The Fed is lending on terms that private banks are not willing to offer .
They are not searching for underpriced " bargains " on behalf of the public , nor is it their mission to do so .
Their mission is to provide liquidity to the system by acting as lender - of - last - resort .
We do n't care about the quality of the assets the Fed acquires in doing this .
We care about the quantity of its liabilities .
What 's this " we , " Ke-mo Sah - bee ?
It is amazing how flippant Lucas is concerning these new developments .
He can barely bring himself to admit that a $ 600 billion infusion of new money — which no private investor would be foolish enough to make — constitutes a bailout .
Moreover , Bernanke 's pledge to continue this pattern as " long as the situation dictates " sounds an awful lot like a blank check .
Lucas 's touching innocence is illustrated even more so with his endorsement of Bernanke 's policy :
It entails no new government enterprises , no government equity positions in private enterprises , no price fixing or other controls on the operation of individual businesses , and no government role in the allocation of capital across different activities .
That last phrase in particular amused me .
I confess I did n't actually try this , but I 'm betting that if I emailed Mr. Bernanke and explained that my business was desperate for liquidity , he would inform me that I was n't eligible for any of his generous loans .
I am not accusing Ben Bernanke of being anything more than a misguided academic .
I believe his policies have been terrible during this crisis , but I am willing to attribute them to intellectual error .
Be that as it may , he has opened Pandora 's box .
The precedent is now set for the Federal Reserve to make injections of hundreds of billions of dollars as it sees fit .
In October , Barney Frank suddenly realized the awesome power that the Fed has held all of these years , according to this account :
" He [ Bernanke ] can make any loan he wants under any terms to any entity or individual in America that he thinks is economically justified .
I asked the chairman if he had $ 85 billion to bestow in this way .
He said , ' I have $ 800 billion . ' "
Clearly unnerved after his exchange with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , concluded that no one should have that kind of money to dispense as he sees fit .
Unfortunately , this realization will not lead to a return of the gold standard or ( better yet ) a complete return of money and banking to the market .
Rather , what will surely happen is that Congress will move to bring the Fed more closely under its control :
" He can't debase the currency at will !
That 's our job ! "
The next few years are going to be very interesting .
It is clichéd to say such things , but our country truly is moving through a revolutionary period .
But I liked the Beatles song a lot better than Paulson and Bernanke 's rendition .

From Eccentric Lives & Peculiar Notions by John Michell .
The People With Holes In Their Heads
Amanda Feilding lives in a charming flat looking over London 's river with her companion , Joey Mellen , and their infant son , Rock .
She is a successful painter , and she and Joey have an art gallery in a fashionable street of the King 's Road .
Another of her talents is for politics .
At the last two General Elections she stood for Parliament in Chelsea , more than doubling her vote on the second occasion from 49 to 139 .
It does not sound much , but the cause for which she stands is unfamiliar and lacks obvious appeal .
Feilding and her voters demand that trepanning operations be made freely available on the National Health .
Trepanation means cutting a hole in your skull .
The founder of the trepanation movement is a Dutch savant , Dr Bart Hughes .
In 1962 he made a discovery which his followers proclaim as the most significant in modern times .
One 's state and degree of consciousness , he realized , are related to the volume of blood in the brain .
According to his theory of evolution , the adoption of an upright stance brought certain benefits to the human race , but it caused the flow of blood through the head to be limited by gravity , thus reducing the range of human consciousness .
Certain parts of the brain ceased or reduced their functions while others , particularly those parts relating to speech and reasoning , became emphasized in compensation .
One can redress the balance by a number of methods , such as standing on one 's head , jumping from a hot bath into a cold one , or the use of drugs ; but the wider consciousness thus obtained is only temporary .
Bart Hughes shared the common goal of mystics and poets in all ages : he wanted to achieve permanently the higher level of vision , which he associated with an increased volume of blood in the capillaries of the brain .
The higher state of mind he sought was that of childhood .
Babies are born with skulls unsealed , and it is not until one is an adult that the bony carapace is formed which completely encloses the membranes surrounding the brain and inhibits their pulsations in repsonse to heart - beats .
In consequence , the adult loses touch with the dreams , imagination and intense perceptions of the child .
His mental balance becomes upset by egoism and neuroses .
To cure these problems , first in himself and then for the whole world , Dr Huges returned his cranium to something like the condition of infancy by cutting out a small disc of bone with an electric drill .
Experiencing immediate beneficial effects from this operation , he began preaching to anyone who would listen to the doctrine of trepanation .
By liberating his brain from its total imprisonment in his skull , he claimed to have restored its pulsations , increased the volume of blood in it and acquired a more complete
Joseph Mellen met Bart Huges in 1965 in Ibiza and quickly became his leading , or rather one and only , disciple .
Years later he wrote a book called Bore Hole , the contents of which are summarized in its opening sentence : ' This is the story of how I came to drill a hole in my skullto get permanently high . '
[ A few paragraphs that detail Joseph Mellen 's early experiments with LSD , and how he finds out about Bart Huges have been removed for brevity . ]
The time came when Joey felt he had preached enough and that he now had to act .
He did not agree with Holingshead that the third eye was merely a figure of speech , believing in its physical attainment through self - trepanation .
Support for this can be found in archaeology .
Skulls of ancient people all over the world give evidence that their owners were skillfully trepanned during their lifetimes , and many of these appear to have been of noble or priestly castes .
The medical practice of trepanation was continued up to the present century in treatment of madness , the hole in the skull being seen as a way of relieving pressure on the brain or letting out the devils that possessed it .
By his scientific explanation of the reasons for the operation , Bart Huges had removed it from the area of superstition , and Joey Mellen proposed to be the second person to perform it on himself in the interest of enlightenment .
Bart had become a close friend of Amanda Feilding , and they went off to Amsterdam together while Joey took care of Amanda 's flat .
This was the opportunity he had been waiting for to bore a hole in his head .
The most gripping passages in Bore Hole describe his various attempts to complete the operation .
They are also extremely gruesome , and those who lack medical curiosity would do well to read no further .
Yet to those who might contemplate trepanation for and by themselves , Joey 's experiences are a salutary warning .
It should be empahasized that neither he , Bart nor Amanda has ever recommended people to follow their example by performing their own operations .
For years they have been looking for doctors who would understand their theories and would agree to trepan volunteer patients as a form of therapy Strangely enough , not one member of the medical profession has been converted .
In a surgical store Joey found a trepan instrument , a kind of auger or cork - screw designed to be worked by hand .
It was much cheaper and , Joey felt , more sensitive than an electric drill .
Its main feature was a metal spike , surrounded by a ring of saw - teeth .
The spike was meant to be driven into the skull , holding the trepan steady until the revolving saw made a groove , after which it could be retracted .
If all went well , the saw - band should remove a disc of bone and expose the brain .
Joey 's first attempt at self - trepanation was a fiasco .
He had no previous medical experience , and the needles he had bought for administering a local anaesthetic to the crown of his head proved to be too thin and crumpled up or broke .
Next day he obtained some stouted needles , took a tab of LSD to steady his nerves and set to in earnest .
First he made an incision to the bone , and then applied the trepan to his bared skull .
But the first part of the operation , driving the spike into the bone , was impossible to accomplish .
Joey described it as like trying to uncork a bottle from the inside .
He realized he needed help and telephoned Bart in Amsterdam , who promised he would come over and assist at the next operation .
This plan was frustrated by the Home Office , which listed Dr Huges as an undesirable visitor to Britain and barred his entry .
Amanda agreed to take his place .
Soon after her return to London she helped Joey re-open the wound in his head and , by pressing the trepan with all her might against his skull , managed to get the spike to take hold and the saw- teeth to bite .
Joey then took over at cranking the saw .
Once again he had swallowed some LSD .
After a long period of sawing , just as he was about to break through , he suddenly fainted .
Amanda called an ambulance and he was taken to hospital , where horrified doctors told him that he was lucky to be alive and that if he had drilled a fraction of an inch further he would have killed himself .
The psychiatrists took a particular interest in his case , and a group of them arranged to examine him .
Before this could be done , he had to appear in court on a charge of possessing a small amount of cannabis .
The magistrate demanded another psychiatrist 's report and demanded him for a week in prison .
There followed a period of embarrassment as the rumour went round London that Joey Mellen had trepanned himself , whereas in fact he had failed to do so .
As soon as possible , therefore , he prepared for a third attempt .
Proceeding as before , but now with the benefit of experience , he soon found the groove from the previous operation and began to saw through the sliver of bone separating him from enlightenment or , as the doctors had predicted , instant death .
What followed is best quoted from Bore Hole .
' After some time there was an ominous sounding schlurp and the sound of bubbling .
I drew the trepan out and the gurgling continued .
It sounded like air bubbles running under the skull as they were pressed out .
I looked at the trepan and there was a bit of bone in it .
At last !
On closer inspection I saw that the disc of bone was much deeper on one side than on the other .
Obviously the trepan had not been straight and had gone through at one point only , then the piece of bone had snapped off and come out .
I was reluctant to start drilling again for fear of damaging the brain membranes with the deeper part while I was cutting through the rest or of breaking off a splinter .
If only I had an electric drill it would have been so much simpler .
Amanda was sure I was through .
There seemed no other explanation for the schlurping noises I decided to call it a day .
At the time I thought that any hole would do , no matter what size .
I bandaged up my head and cleared away the mess . '
There was still doubt in his mind as to whether he had really broken through and , if so , whether the hole was big enough to restore pulsation to his brain .
The operation had left him with a feeling of wellbeing , but he realized that it could simply be from relief at having ended it
The result was all he had hoped for .
During the next four hours he felt his spirits rising higher until he reached a state of freedom and serenity which he claims , has been with him ever since .
For some time now he had been sharing a flat with Amanda , and when she came back from America she immediately noticed the change in him .
This encouraged her to join him on the mental plane by doing her own trepanation .
The operation was carefully recorded .
She had obtained a cine - camera , and Joey stood by , filming , as she attacked her head with an electric drill .
The film shows her carefully at work , dressed in a blood - spattered white robe .
She shaves her head , makes an incision in her head with a scalpel and calmly starts drilling .
Blood spurts as she penetrates the skull .
She lays aside the drill and with a triumphant smile advances towards Joey and the camera .
So that 's it then .
The end of light as we know it .
Shops have stopped replenishing their stocks of traditional tungsten light bulbs , and expect to have run out by the end of the week .
But to judge from the hoo - ha surrounding this announcement , you could be forgiven for thinking that Britain is about to be full of very cross people sitting in the dark .
The withdrawal of conventional bulbs is the second part of a government campaign to force people into buying low - energy fluorescent bulbs , which started with the scrapping of the 150 - watt equivalent last year .
The powers that be say the switch to low - energy will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by around five million tonnes a year .
Stocks of 100W and 75W bulbs will be run down now while 60 W bulbs , commonly used for table and reading lamps , will be phased out this time next year .
All incandescent bulbs will be banned by 2012 .

So from now on , whether we like it or not , we will all have to use eco-lights .
First , the good news .
An energy - saving bulb uses one sixth of the electricity and lasts 12 times as long as a conventional one , which means an annual saving of around £ 90 over the life of the bulb , which is not to be sniffed at in the current climate .
But eco-lighting is not without its critics .
Have you tried energy - efficient bulbs ?
Did your heart sink as you stood in a dim , dreary glow while the bulbs warm up ?
You 're not alone .
In addition , they contain mercury , which means you can no longer chuck them in the bin but have to dispose of them responsibly .
And you have time for that ?
That 's not all .
Some medical charities say the subtle flicker of these bulbs can trigger migraines and epilepsy attacks , so they 're lobbying the Government for an opt - out for people with health problems , to allow them to continue using the old - style bulbs .
But for every surly critic there 's a passionate fan .
Oliver Heath , the designer and enthusiastic promoter of all things eco , whose book Urban Eco Chic ( Quadrille , £ 19.99 ) promotes green design of the kind that does n't make the heart sink .
" I 've just changed all my bulbs to CFLs [ compact fluorescent lamps ] and saved around four - fifths on my electricity bill .
It really is quite staggering that so many people are still using Edison 's light bulb which was invented in 1879 .
It 's 130 years later and people are still using the same technology – that just does n't happen in other areas of our home and lives . "
But even Heath acknowledges that – while the new - style bulbs ( or CFLs as he calls them ) have come a long since they first arrived – many of them still do n't give the quality of light we 're used to .
Still , he has some suggestions for those who complain about greyish glows .
" First you really need to maximise the amount of natural light coming into your home .
Use reflective surfaces to bounce the light around and choose the right colour schemes to throw the light back into your space . "
If the walls around the windows are painted in pale colours , the light will be drawn into the room .
" CFLs do take time to reach their optimum brightness so are not ideal for use in a hallway , for example , where you may well be out of the room by the time they are fully functioning , " he admits .
" but they can now be dimmed and come in different shades .
And the elements are often encased in rubber - coated frosted glass so they look more like the conventional tungsten bulbs .
If you really do n't like the look of them , then put a large shade over – perhaps made of felt or paper as the bulbs give out so little heat . "
Patrick Hudgell , managing director of Lightbulbs Direct , says : " I think the unilateral ban is ridiculous .
There are cases where the incandescent bulb is right for the job .
What happens to the person with a beautiful 1930s Art Deco lamp ?
There is no energy - saving bulb for them – and that renders the lamp useless . "
But they are getting better , and the usual CFLs are not the only option .

Lighting : Need to know
LED spotlights
LEDs , or light - emitting diodes , are very energy efficient , but expensive .
( The cheap ones in garden lights give off a nasty blue glow – no good for living rooms . )
Lucy Martin of lighting design firm John Cullen says that one in seven will have a grey light , and that you can't tell which ones do so until you 've turned them on .
And each bulb costs up to £ 25 .
Yet bulbs can last for up to 100,000 hours , so in effect never need replacing .
But as ambient lighting for the home , LEDs are n't there yet .
Price : From £ 7 to £ 25
Halogen energy savers
These are probably the way forward for most of us .
Use them to replace all those halogen spotlights in the kitchen or hall for instant light .
Or put them into reading lamps .
They last two - thirds of the time of compact fluorescent lamps , so are less of a bargain , but the quality of light is warmer and brighter .
If you are replacing a 50W bulb , choose a 35 W halogen energy saver .
They are fully dimmable .
Price : Around £ 4 each
Fluorescent tubes
There 's nothing new about strip lights – but they are incredibly energy efficient , if ugly .
Lucy Martin suggests fitting them along the top of kitchen cupboards , with a small facing to hide them .
They will push a bright light up to the ceiling which will softly light the rest of the room .
Price : From £ 1.50 to £ 6
Compact fluorescent lamps
These are the most common eco bulbs .
They give out five times more light than traditional bulbs , so if you want to replace your 100W bulb , you need to buy a 20W CFL .
For a 60W , buy a 12W CFL , and so on .
In terms of your bank balance , they make sense – but they 're detested by many .
That said , quality brands ( Osram , Philips and Megaman ) make CFLs that reach full brightness in two to three minutes , and some can now be dimmed , too .
The best advice is not to rush out and buy a houseful of CFLs , but look instead for halogen energy - savers described below .
Price : Around £ 9 each for good - quality bulbs
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The collapse of electronics retailer Circuit City CCTYQ.PK could drive down shopping and strip mall rents , and deal another blow to commercial mortgage - backed securities ' ( CMBS ) investors who have already seen their bond prices slide .

After a dismal holiday shopping season and several failed attempts to sell itself , Circuit City -- having filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November -- last week said it would close all its 567 U.S. stores and liquidate its assets .
The move left 30,000 employees of the Woodland Hills , California - based company without work , and creditors -- including landlords -- lining up to get whatever they can after the company sells its inventory .
“ Now those landlords are in line like the rest of their creditors -- and probably in the back of the line to get paid , ” said Suzanne Mulvee , Property & Portfolio Research real estate strategist .
The loss of the large tenant , whose stores typically run from 35,000 to 40,000 square feet , is likely to be felt by some publicly traded shopping center owners , such as Developers Diversified Realty Corp DDR.N , where Circuit City accounted for 1.7 percent of its annual base rent revenue , and Kimco Realty Corp KIM.N , where the chain accounted for 1.5 percent of its annual base revenue , according to Green Street Advisors analyst Nick Vetter .
Other landlords include Inland Western Real Estate Retail Trust , Simon Property Group Inc SPG.N , Vornado Realty Trust VNO.N , Weingarten Realty Investors WRI.N , First Capital Realty Inc FCR.TO , Kite Realty Group Trust KRG.N and Arcadia Resources Inc KAD.A , according to financial data firm SNL Financial .
Yet the pain will be felt throughout the retail real estate market , several real estate experts said .
“ A company like Circuit City is the poster child for what ’s going on , ” Mulvee said .
“ There ’s a bigger disease at work here . ”
DREARY DAYS
Retailers are seeing their revenue drop as financially strapped U.S. consumers retrench and spend less .
The holiday shopping season , which often accounts for 30 to 40 percent of a retailer ’s annual revenue , failed to save companies this year as U.S. sales fell 2.8 percent , the first decline since 1995 .
Retailers are now forced to renegotiate their leases to cut costs .
And with landlords facing more empty space and lower demand , they will likely play ball .
“ What this does to the rest of the retail market is you ’ve got an increase in vacancy rates , and you ’ve got more vacant space , chasing fewer retailers that need that space , ” said Steve Jellinek , vice president of credit rating agency Realpoint LLC .
“ Ultimately , we ’ve already begun to see it , rents are going to fall . ”
Rents at strip malls have fallen at an increasing rate over the past three quarters with the greatest drop , 0.9 percent , in the fourth quarter of 2008 , according to real estate research company Reis Inc .
About half the shopping centers where Circuit City is a major tenant have mortgages that have been pooled and manufactured into CMBS , with more than $ 4 billion left on the balance of the mortgages , according to Realpoint .
The numbers do n’t look good .
Circuit City accounts for more than 20 percent of the revenue rent on 176 of the properties .
Those properties contribute 38 percent of the total loan exposure .
Without Circuit City , occupancy at 187 centers would fall to less than 80 percent , meaning it would hurt mortgage payments to bondholders , Realpoint said .
About 52 loans are delinquent -- more than 30 days late on payments .
Without the Circuit City rents , some bondholders , especially those of riskier CMBS , will receive less of a return .
“ It ’s one of many possible and future examples of retailers who ca n’t find financing in this environment to continue business if they ’re struggling and are going to have to close their doors as a result , ” Vetter said .
“ We ’re just starting to see the wave that probably will be coming up in the next two months , as more retailers realize that Christmas season was n’t as great as they had hoped it would be . ”

ISLAMABAD —
Two missile attacks launched from unmanned American aircraft killed at least 15 people in western Pakistan on Friday , suggesting that the strategy of using drones to kill militants inside Pakistan ’s own borders would continue under President Obama .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Remotely piloted Predator drones operated by the Central Intelligence Agency have carried out more than 30 missile attacks since last summer against Al Qaeda members and other suspected terrorists deep in their redoubts on the Pakistani side of the border with Afghanistan .
But the attacks have also killed civilians , enraging Pakistanis and making it more difficult for the country ’s shaky government to win support for its own military operations against Taliban guerrillas in the country ’s lawless border region .
American officials in Washington , who said there were no immediate signs that the Friday strikes had killed any senior Al Qaeda leaders , said they dispelled for the moment any notion that Mr. Obama would rein in the Predator attacks .
Even as the C.I.A. continues its strikes just inside Pakistan ’s border with Afghanistan , Mr. Obama and his top national security aides are likely to review in the coming days other counterterrorism measures put in place by the Bush administration , American officials said .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama will start reversing former President George W. Bush ’s climate change policies on Monday with steps to raise fuel efficiency standards and grant states authority to limit greenhouse gas emissions from cars .
President Barack Obama at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House complex , January 21 , 2009 .

An administration official said late on Sunday that Obama , who took office last week , would direct the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a request by California to impose its own strict limits on automobile carbon dioxide emissions .
The request was denied under the Bush administration , prompting California and several other states to sue .
The official said a final decision by the EPA would likely take several months .
Another official familiar with the policy shift said Obama would instruct the EPA to approve the waiver allowing California to impose the rules .
The state asked the new administration last week to reconsider its request .
If the EPA reverses the previous ruling , more than 12 U.S. states could proceed with plans to impose strict carbon dioxide limits .
California wants to reduce the emissions by 30 percent by 2016 -- the most ambitious federal or state effort to address global warming .
Ailing carmakers , which have accelerated efforts to build more environmentally friendly vehicles , have fought the California statute , but braced for a policy reversal once Obama won the November 4 election .
Obama promised on the campaign trail to take aggressive action to fight global warming and reduce emissions blamed for heating the earth .
He is scheduled to deliver remarks on jobs , energy independence and climate change in the East Room of the White House on Monday .
FUEL EFFICIENCY
The White House official said Obama would also direct the Department of Transportation to move forward with setting 2011 vehicle fuel efficiency standards by March .
The president ’s memorandum would instruct the agency to reconsider how such standards are set for later years in a separate process , he said .
The Bush administration sought to finish the fuel efficiency regulation by December , but took no action due to the uncertain financial prospects of U.S. automakers .
Automakers , including big foreign manufacturers , have opposed the California waiver on grounds that approving it would create a confusing patchwork of state rules based on tailpipe emissions .
The California statute was intended to take effect for 2009 model year vehicles already in showrooms , while the federal government , according to Obama ’s order , will have its own new efficiency rules in place by March for cars made between 2011 - 2015 .
The federal standards are considered weaker .
Activists welcomed the moves .
“ These actions are a clear demonstration that President Obama recognizes the urgency of moving America to clean energy and tackling the climate crisis in 2009 , ” said Frances Beinecke , president of the Natural Resources Defense Council .
California Sen. Barbara Boxer , who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , promised to work with the EPA to ensure the California waiver moved forward quickly .
Obama has spent his first few days in office overturning his predecessor ’s policies .
On Thursday , he signed an order to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , within a year and he lifted restrictions on Friday on U.S. government funding for groups that provide abortion services abroad .
Shortly after his victory in the November 4 election , Obama reiterated his commitment to bringing the United States firmly back into the fold of nations trying to reach a global agreement to limit emissions once the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol runs out at the end of 2012 .
' Maar de economische crisis heeft toch een rol gespeeld ' , zegt Jan Van Biesen , het nethoofd van Studio Brussel .
' Er waren dit jaar beduidend meer acties in groep dan individuele giften .
Door de crisis ...
President George Bush wants to speed up the withdrawal of American combat troops from Iraq , a move that could help to quell the anti-war anxieties of voters before November 's presidential election .
Drawing down large numbers of troops would enable the Republican candidate , John McCain , to say that his forceful military strategy for Iraq was correct .
Alone among Republican and Democratic politicians , he consistently urged Mr Bush to take on the insurgents with extra forces .
He is now attacking his Democratic opponent , Barack Obama , for preaching policies of defeat by calling for a withdrawal in 16 months .
American commanders want to reduce their deployment in Iraq to ease the strain on the military and free up troops for Afghanistan where they are taking a beating from the Taliban and other militants .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Nine American soldiers were killed and 15 wounded yesterday in the bloodiest day in three years for US forces in Afghanistan .
In a multi- pronged attack , revealing sophistication and daring , militants overran a remote US base near the Pakistan border on the front lines of the hunt for Osama bin Laden .
It was the deadliest on US forces in the country since 16 combat troops were killed when their helicopter was shot down by a rocket - propelled grenade in the same area in 2005 .
Concerns are also growing that Mr Bush wants to release fighting forces before he leaves office in January , in the event of conflict with Iran .
By the times of Mr Bush 's departure , three of the 15 combat brigades now in Iraq could have left the country , say government and military officials .
That would still leave up to 130,000 frontline troops in the field – a reduction from the 170,000 deployed in the " surge " last year .
A rapid US withdrawal would mark a sharp turnaround in the fortunes of the Bush administration from only two years ago , amid the bloody slaughter of growing numbers of Iraqis and American soldiers .
Anti-war feeling is at fever pitch in the US and the military is said to be near breaking point from its extended combat deployments .
This was the climate in which Mr Obama , a fierce opponent of the war , shot to prominence to seek and eventually win the Democratic presidential nomination .
The Illinois Senator will head to Baghdad in a few weeks to take soundings from Iraqi leaders and US military commanders about a withdrawal .
He is taking with him the Republican Senator Chuck Hagel , a fierce critic of Mr Bush 's policies in Iraq with him as he seeks to arrange the orderly removal of all US combat troops if he is elected president in November .
Mr Obama 's plan is to remove one or two brigades every month , but he says that he will be guided by military commanders on the ground .
Mr Hagel has sometimes been suggested as a possible vice - presidential running mate for Mr Obama , who needs to reach out to Republican voters if he is to expand the Democratic vote and win the White House .
As the conditions in Iraq improve , the government and armed forces have shown an ability to combat insurgents that would have been unthinkable a short time ago .
The number of attacks on American and other forces has dropped sharply and is now down to the levels of 2004 when the insurgency was gathering steam .
The faster pullout being considered by President Bush would free US troops for duties in Afghanistan where the Taliban and other insurgents are growing in confidence and strength .
In the past three months more American soldiers died in Afghanistan than in Iraq as violence has declined .
" As the Iraqi security forces get stronger and get better , then we will be able to continue drawing down our troops in the future , " the US Defence Secretary , Robert Gates , said last week .
General David Petraeus , the US commander in Iraq , is reviewing troop levels and officials say that he is expected to take a more cautions approach and recommend smaller reductions in forces .
Video : Ancient computer recreated
MARCELLUS and his men blockaded Syracuse , in Sicily , for two years .
The Roman general expected to conquer the Greek city state easily , but the ingenious siege towers and catapults designed by Archimedes helped to keep his troops at bay .
Then , in 212 BC , the Syracusans neglected their defences during a festival to the goddess Artemis , and the Romans finally breached the city walls .
Marcellus wanted Archimedes alive , but it was n’t to be .
According to ancient historians , Archimedes was killed in the chaos ; by one account a soldier ran him through with a sword as he was in the middle of a mathematical proof .
One of Archimedes ’s creations was saved , though .
The general took back to Rome a mechanical bronze sphere that showed the motions of the sun , moon and planets as seen from Earth .
Special admiration
The sphere stayed in Marcellus ’s family for generations , until the Roman author Cicero saw it in the first century BC .
“ The invention of Archimedes deserves special admiration because he had thought out a way to represent accurately by a single device for turning the globe those various and divergent movements with their different rates of speed , ” he wrote .
“ The moon was always as many revolutions behind the sun on the bronze contrivance as would agree with the number of days it was behind it in the sky . ”
Until recently , historians paid scant attention to this story : the description suggests a sophisticated mechanical device , beyond anything the ancient Greeks were thought to have been capable of .
Furthermore , Cicero had no technical training , and did not explain how the device worked .

The choice of Mrs. Clinton pleased many in the Democratic establishment who admire her strength and skills , and they praised Mr. Obama for putting the rancor of the campaign behind him .
“ Senator Clinton is a naturally gifted diplomat and would be an inspired choice if she is chosen by President - elect Obama as secretary of state , ” said Warren Christopher , who held that job under her husband .
But it could also disappoint many of Mr. Obama ’s supporters , who worked hard to have him elected instead of Mrs. Clinton and saw him as a vehicle for changing Washington .
Mr. Obama argued during the primaries that it was time to move beyond the Clinton era and in particular belittled her claims to foreign policy experience as a first lady who circled the globe .
Advisers said Mr. Obama concluded after the election that the problems confronting the nation were so serious that he needed Mrs. Clinton ’s stature and capabilities as part of his team , notwithstanding their past differences .
The bitterness that inhabited the Obama team for much of the year has faded with time , advisers said .
And many of the aides working on the transition with Mr. Obama are not campaign veterans with scars from the primaries , but rather former Clinton administration officials like Rahm Emanuel , the incoming White House chief of staff , and John D. Podesta , the transition co-chairman , who admire Mrs. Clinton .
For Mrs. Clinton , becoming secretary of state would require her to sacrifice the independence that has come with a Senate seat and the 18 million votes she collected in the primary season .
She has found it liberating the last eight years to speak for herself , not as someone ’s spouse .
But friends said she could still have her voice while subordinating her ambitions to Mr. Obama ’s agenda .
“ Hillary Clinton will always be seen as her own person , ” said Mickey Kantor , a longtime friend who served as commerce secretary in her husband ’s administration .
“ But you know , Hillary Clinton ’s a terrific lawyer .
She knows how to represent a client , and she ’s good at it .
And I do n’t have any doubt in my mind that she ’ll be a team player . ”
Mrs. Clinton had to accept that she might never become president , a former aide said .
“ There ’s a very small chance that she could run again , ” he said .
“ You ’re not going to be the president , so you want to make sure your next few years , which may be your last in public life , really make a mark . ”
Beginning Factor – Shufflers & Combinators
In the previous installment of Beginning Factor , we discussed some of the attributes of stack - based languages and the syntax for defining words in Factor .
This time around , I ’d like to introduce stack shufflers , quotations & combinators , and touch on some more basic data types and their properties .
Up until now , we ’ve essentially been using Factor as an overqualified RPN calculator .
I just wanted to make sure that you do n’t underestimate Factor because of these particular examples ;
Factor is an extremely capable and modern language that can be used for everything from web applications , to game development , to complex text parsing , and so on .
I ’m purposefully using over - simplified examples as a means to demonstrate specific points about the language .
Stick with me , and I assure you the examples will gradually get more expressive .
Stack Shufflers
Because of Factor ’s stack - based nature , you sometimes need the ability to rearrange or copy items in the stack to ensure that they are in the correct position for future use .
The way to go about this is a group of words called “ stack shufflers ” .
Much like the name implies , stack shufflers are merely words that change the order ( or number ) of the items on the top of the stack .
It is said that shuffle words “ control the flow of data between words that perform actions . ”
In fact , you already know one stack shuffler … drop
There are three basic varieties of stack shufflers .
Here they are along with the most commonly used word for each type :
Removing Shufflers drop ( x -- ) removes the top item from the stack and discards it Duplicating Shufflers dup ( x -- x x ) duplicates the top item on the stack Permuting Shufflers swap ( x y -- y x ) exchanges the positions of the first and second items on the top of the stack
… and here are a couple of word definitions that use these shufflers appropriately :
: sq ( x -- y ) dup * ; : neg ( x -- -x ) 0 swap - ;
( scratchpad ) 5 sq . 25 ( scratchpad ) 1 neg . - 1
Caveats
There are many more shuffle words that support intricate rearrangements and the duplication / removal of multiple items from differing locations within the stack .
The problem is , code that is full of stack shufflers can easily become confusing .
In general , you should try to minimize the use of stack shufflers to keep things understandable .
Of course there are exceptions to that rule , times when shufflers make the most sense , but the preferred alternative to complicated stack shufflers is the use of a “ combinator ” that fits your use case .
That said , combinators will take a bit of explaining …
Quotations
Before we can get to the idea of combinators , we first have to discuss quotations :
( scratchpad ) 5 [ " hello " print ] times hello hello hello hello hello
In this example , [ " hello " print ] is a quotation .
In layman ’s terms , a quotation is a way to encapsulate a snippet of code so it does n’t get called right away , but can be passed around on the stack and called later .
The computer science term for this is an “ anonymous function ” .
It ’s referred to as “ anonymous ” because it is fundamentally a word that has no name .
If we did n’t have quotations , that same example would get ugly real fast :
( scratchpad ) " hello " dup dup dup dup print print print print print hello hello hello hello hello
Imagine if you wanted to print “ hello ” 1000 times !
To create a quotation , you just surround your code snippet with square brackets , and it will be pushed onto the stack : [ ... ] .
In order to do anything useful with that quotation once it ’s on the stack , what you need is a combinator .
What is a Combinator ?
A combinator is just a fancy name for a word that takes a quotation as one of its inputs .
In the example above , times is a combinator which takes an integer ( n ) and a quotation from the stack , and it calls that quotation n times .
Factor uses quotations & combinators extensively for conditionals , sequence traversal , namespaces , closures , and more … but that ’s jumping the gun a bit .
Before we dive into all of that , I ’d like to get back to the idea of minimizing the use of stack shufflers by replacing them with appropriate combinators instead .
Combinators That Express Intent
While our code examples thus far have been easy to follow , when you start tackling more realistic problems , stack shufflers will begin to obfuscate your code .
If we can represent our intentions consistently with a combinator instead , then code becomes cleaner and you can consequently focus more on your problem domain and less on mentally organizing your stack .
To illustrate this point , I ’d like to introduce a couple of simple combinators :
dip ( x quot -- x ) calls a quotation while temporarily hiding the top item on the stack
keep ( x quot -- x ) calls a quotation with an item on the stack , restoring that item after the quotation returns
While both of these combinators have the same stack effect declaration , their usage is a bit different :
( scratchpad ) 1 2 4 [ + ] dip --- Data stack : 3 4 ( scratchpad ) clear ( scratchpad ) 1 2 4 [ + ] keep --- Data stack : 1 6 4
These two combinators alone can greatly reduce the number of stack shufflers your code will need .
If you ’re curious about how these combinators work , they both secretly take advantage of an auxiliary stack ( called the “ retain stack ” ) to temporarily store items while the supplied quotation is being executed .
There are a few other preserving combinators that are worth exploring as well .
Cleave , Spread , and Apply
The cleave , spread , and apply combinators are your best weapons when trying to reduce the use of stack shufflers while simultaneously expressing intent .
The key point being that they should express intent … if you find yourself writing code where these combinators do n’t fit logically , then try another option .
Cleave Combinators
These are used when you want to apply multiple quotations to the same set of items on the top of the stack .
Let ’s say that you want to find the average of a bunch of numbers in an array .
The steps are straightforward , you take the sum of all the numbers and divide that sum by how many numbers you have ( the length of the array ) : ( scratchpad ) { 1 2 3 } dup sum swap length / .
2
We can eliminate the need for those stack shufflers and better express our intent by using a cleave combinator to achieve the same thing : bi ( x p q -- ) applies quotation p to x , then applies quotation q to x ( scratchpad ) { 1 2 3 } [ sum ] [ length ] bi / .
2
The different cleave combinators change either the number of quotations applied to your items ( bi vs. tri ) , or the number of items used as input for your quotations ( bi vs. 2bi ) .
Spread Combinators
These are used when you want to apply a different quotation to different items on the top of the stack .
The spread combinators are closely related to dip , but provide a bit more flexibility while also expressing intent .
Let ’s say that you have two coordinate positions in the form of { x y } , and you ’d like to extract the x-coordinate from the first position , and the y - coordinate from the second position to form a new position with those values : ( scratchpad ) { 1 2 } { 3 4 } swap first swap second 2array .
{ 1 4 } We can eliminate the need for those stack shufflers and better express our intent by using a spread combinator to achieve the same thing : bi* ( x y p q -- ) applies quotation p to x , then applies quotation q to y ( scratchpad ) { 1 2 } { 3 4 } [ first ] [ second ] bi* 2array .
{ 1 4 } When you want to do the same thing with more than two quotations / items , then using spread combinators eliminates the need for nested dips or shufflers and the added clarity becomes much more evident .
The different spread combinators change the number of quotations applied to the corresponding number of items on the stack ( bi* vs. tri* ) .
Apply Combinators
These are used when you want to apply a single quotation to multiple items on the top of the stack .
Let ’s say that you have two strings , each containing a name , and you want to see if those names are the same .
In order to ignore case when doing the comparison , you decide to convert both strings to upper case before checking for equality : ( scratchpad ) " john " " John " swap > upper swap > upper = . t
We can eliminate the need for those stack shufflers and better express our intent by using an apply combinator to achieve the same thing : bi@ ( x y quot -- ) applies the quotation to x , then to y ( scratchpad ) " john " " John " [ > upper ] bi@ = .
t
The different apply combinators change the number of items on the stack your quotation is applied to ( bi@ vs. tri@ ) .
The cleave , spread , and apply combinators are all closely related ; if you ’re having trouble keeping them apart , try to memorize the naming convention :
If there is no suffix , it is a “ cleave ”
If the suffix is * , it is a “ spread ”
If the suffix is @ , it is an “ apply ”
Once you learn these combinators , you should be able to express almost any pattern of complicated stack shufflers .
Note that there are also generic forms for all of these combinators that can take additional inputs from the stack .
If you find that you resort to using the generic forms more often then not , that ’s usually a good indication that you should rethink your approach or put your data into a more appropriate structure .
Data Type Details
Before I turn you loose , I wanted to offer a few extra details about some of Factor ’s basic data types …
Sequences
In the cleave and spread examples above , I was sneaky and used sequences without explaining them formally .
A sequence is a finite , ordered , collection of elements .
Any data type that implements the sequence mixin class ( meaning a data type that knows its length and will let you set / get an element at a specific index ) gains the ability to use the powerful built - in sequence operators .
Read through that documentation to get an idea on how to manipulate sequences and their elements .
Factor has many sequence types that you may already be familiar with , such as arrays ( fixed - size mutable sequences ) and vectors ( resizable mutable sequences ) , but there are also other data types that you might not expect to be sequences , such as strings .
In Factor , a string is merely an array of Unicode 5.0 code points .
Using the sequence operators and combinators together , you can create all sorts of powerful abstractions that I ’ll talk more about next time .
Here are a couple of examples to whet your appetite :
( scratchpad ) { 1 2 3 4 5 } [ even ? ] filter . { 2 4 } ( scratchpad ) { 1 2 3 } [ . ] each 1 2 3 ( scratchpad ) " Hello " [ alpha ? ] all ? . t ( scratchpad ) " Hello ! ! ! " [ alpha ? ] all ? . f
Keep in mind that in Factor , sequences are zero - based .
Numbers
So far , we have only used integers , but Factor also supports rational numbers ( fractions ) , floats ( decimal approximations of a number ) , and complex numbers ( imaginary numbers ) .
( scratchpad ) 100 330 / . 10/33 ( scratchpad ) 5/4 1/2 + . 1 +3/4 ( scratchpad ) 5/4 0 .5 + . 1 .75 ( scratchpad ) 2 5 rect > .
C{ 2 5 }
Iota
One last thing that is going to come in handy , is a word for creating sequences from integers :
iota ( n -- iota ) creates a sequence of length n , whose elements are its non-negative predecessors ( i.e. 0 to n- 1 inclusive )
This word can be very helpful when performing counted loops or other control flow statements .
For example , the following two lines are equivalent :
{ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 } [ . ] each
10 iota [ . ] each
Next Time
Next time we ’ll stick with a theme of “ flow ” and discuss control flow for your words and after that , the typical work flow when developing code with Factor .
Hope you enjoyed this installment !
Budget airline tells disabled man he must pay extra - for his false legs
Mick
Skee is furious after being told his prosthetic legs will count as excess baggage
A disabled man has condemned a budget airline that told him he must pay to take his spare prosthetic legs on holiday .
Double amputee Mick Skee is angry that airline Jet2 will not waive the excess baggage charge when he travels to Majorca next May .
He lost both his legs after contracting meningococcal septicaemia in 2006 .
The 47 - year - old said today : ' In my opinion , the prosthetic legs are a disability aid .
A wheelchair is classed as that and can be transported free of charge .
' It is ridiculous .
The legs weigh less than a wheelchair , but I have been told that Jet2 are not prepared to budge .
' If I wanted to take a spare pair of prosthetics , I will have to pay an extra £ 10 for each way . '
Mr Skee , a father - of - four from Wardley , Gateshead , plans to write to Jet2 to protest and to highlight the problem with his local MP .
The catering manager for Tyne - and - Wear Fire Services and his wife Sandra , 40 , booked their trip through a holiday website called On The Beach .
Mr Skee said : ' After getting confirmation details , I contacted them to say I needed special assistance for transportation of prosthetic limbs .
' They emailed me for my medication condition and contacted Jet2 , who in turn told them they were not prepared to transport the legs for free .
' On The Beach have said they will pay the extra baggage charge , but that is not the point .
' It 's the principle .
This is something that could affect other people in the same situation and it is an issue that needs to be dealt with . '
Jet2 told Mr Skee it would charge him £ 10 each to transport his spare legs
He had a pair of limbs specially made and fitted with training shoes .
He is having another pair made at Newcastle 's Freeman Hospital so he can wear dress shoes .
He said : ' I wanted to take a spare pair on holiday because if one pair gets damaged I could use the other pair .
But also if I want to take my wife out for dinner and get dressed up , I can put the other pair on . '
A spokesman for Jet2 said the airline would not comment on individual cases .
But the company advised Mr Skee to make a formal complaint to its customer services department and said it would endeavour to provide a response within 21 days .
Wow :
The frightening , but fascinatingly cool hovering robot – MKV ( Multiple Kill Vehicle ) , is designed to shoot down enemy ballistic missiles .
A video released by the Missile Defense Agency ( MDA ) shows the MKV being tested at the National Hover Test Facility at Edwards Air Force Base , in California .
Inside a large steel cage , Lockheed ’s MKV lifts off the ground , moves left and right , rapidly firing as flames shoot out of its bottom and sides .
This description does n’t do it any justice really , you have to see the video yourself .
During the test , the MKV is shown to lift off under its own propulsion , and remains stationary , using it ’s on board retro-rockets .
The potential of this drone is nothing short of science - fiction .
When watching the video , you ca n’t help but be reminded of post - apocalyptic killing machines , seen in such films as The Terminator and The Matrix .

Steve Jobs Heart Attack Rumors
Apple Inc. Chairman and CEOwas rumored to have had a major heart attack , causing Apple stock to fall in early Nasdaq trading .
A spokesman for Apple , was quick to report that the rumor is untrue - prompting a stock rebound .
The initial report was posted on the internet by a " citizen journalist website " , according to Bloomberg , and the report was that the computer maker had been rushed to a hospital after suffering a major heart attack .
The Cupertino , California computer maker was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer four years ago and has repeatedly told investors he is now cancer free .
He has appeared frail in recent months , which has led to speculation that he is ill .
He has responded to those concerns by saying that he is dealing with nutritional issues related to the cancer surgery .
The 53 year old has gained a reputation for his quirky personality .
Fortune magazine noted that he " is considered one of Silicon Valley 's leading egomaniacs . "
On August 28 , 2008 , Bloomberg erroneously published a 2,500 word obituary for Steve Jobs with his age and cause of death left blank .
At Apple 's 2008 Let 's Rock event in September , Jobs started out his keynote speech by quoting Mark Twain , " The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated . "
Check out thin Steve Jobs at Let 's Rock 2008 below .

An Indonesian bill that includes a bylaw requiring " sexually aggressive " people living with HIV / AIDS to be implanted with microchips is causing debate between some lawmakers , who argue that the bill is necessary to curb the spread of the virus , and advocates , who say the bylaw is discriminatory and a violation of human rights , the AP / Minneapolis Star Tribune reports .
According to John Manangsang , a lawmaker who supports the bill , authorities would be able to identify , track and punish people living with HIV / AIDS in the country 's province of Papua who intentionally spread the virus with a $ 5,000 fine or up to six months in jail .
In Papua , the HIV prevalence is 15 times the national average at 61 cases per 100,000 people ( Karmini , AP / Minneapolis Star Tribune , 11/24 ) .
According to Reuters , Manangsang said the microchip is " a simple technology .
A signal from the microchip will track their movements and this will be received by monitoring authorities " ( Anjani , Reuters , 11/22 ) .
According to the Jakarta Post , the microchips would only be implanted in people living with HIV / AIDS who are labeled as " aggressive . "
Manangsang said , " Aggressive means actively seeking sexual intercourse " ( Flassy , Jakarta Post , 11/22 ) .
According to the AP / Star Tribune , a committee would be created to establish which HIV - positive people should be implanted with microchips and to monitor their behavior .
The technical and practical details of the bill are still being decided by lawmakers .
The provincial parliament of Papua has given its full support to the measure , which will be enacted next month if it receives the expected majority vote ( AP / Minneapolis Star Tribune , 11/24 ) .
Manangsang said the program is " one way to protect healthy people " and that " real action " must be taken " because 47 % of ( the country 's ) HIV / AIDS ( cases ) are in Papua . "

Critics of the bill say it is discriminatory toward people living with HIV / AIDS and a violation of human rights , the Post reports .
Constan Karma , executive director of the Papua AIDS Commission , said the law " will violate the rights of people living with HIV / AIDS because they will be implanted with microchips . "
Gunawan -- a liaison officer of the West Papua chapter of Save Papua -- said that people living with the virus " do not always have sex , especially those with AIDS . "
He also questioned how officials would measure aggressiveness .
Although reported incidents of discrimination against HIV - positive people in Papua have declined , Enita Rouw -- coordinator of the Papua branch of the Indonesian Network of People Infected with HIV -- said that " stigmatization is still there .
So please do n't use microchips .
We are humans , not animals " ( Jakarta Post , 11/22 ) .
Tahi Ganyang Butarbutar , an advocate in Papua , said that increased funding for sex education and condom promotion would be more effective for addressing the HIV / AIDS epidemic in the region .
He also said the people living with the virus " are n't animals ; we have to respect their rights " ( AP / Minneapolis Star Tribune , 11/24 ) .
Weynand Watari , a lawmaker who supports the bill , said the region 's " health situation is extraordinary , so we have to take extraordinary action . "
According to the AP / Star Tribune , the HIV epidemic in Indonesia is one of the fastest - growing in Asia , with as many as 290,000 cases in the country 's population of 235 million .
HIV / AIDS in Indonesia primarily is spread through commercial sex work and injection drug use ( AP / Minneapolis Star Tribune , 11/24 ) .
According to Reuters , the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS in the Papua region primarily is because of inadequate education programs , lack of condoms and partner swapping rituals that take place in the region ( Reuters , 11/22 ) .
According to the Post , Manangsang said that people should not concentrate solely on the bylaw but should focus on the entirety of the bill , which requires universal HIV testing " so that preventative measures can be taken early on . "
He also said that " if we respect the rights of the people living with HIV / AIDS , then we must also respect the rights of healthy people " ( Jakarta Post , 11/22 ) .

MMA Fighter Justin Levens and Wife Shot to Death
Mixed martial arts fighterand his wife , were found dead in their home in Laguna Niguel , California .
They had both suffered fatal gun shot wounds .
TMZ is reporting that the police are investigating this tragedy as a possible murder / suicide .
Their bodies were discovered in a bedroom and a gun was also found nearby .
The couple were discovered by Sarah 's mother on Wednesday afternoon , according to Orange County sheriff 's officials .
She made the 911 call that alerted officers of the tragedy .
Levens , 28 , fought in the MMA league , which included bouts in the UFC , IFL and the WEC .
His standings were 9 - 8 .
His nickname was The Executioner .
Back in September another UFC fighter Evan Tanner was found dead in the desert .

Quicker to compose the slang may be , but it takes longer to read A study of new slang terms entering English finds that technology is driving and perpetuating them .
For instance , " 404 " - the error message given when a browser cannot find a webpage - has come to mean " clueless " .
Slang lexicographer Jonathon Green says that some such terms and abbreviations come about because of the limited speed and space afforded by text messaging .
However , an Australian study found that reading " textese " takes more time and results in more mistakes .
A study conducted by the telecommunications arm of the Post Office has searched out the terms that are not yet in wide use but may be soon .
" What we 're seeing is the influence of technology coupled with current events and , inevitably of the young , who in many cases drive language , " says Mr Green .
" It 's focused on this world of mobile phones - these abbreviations are perfectly suited to those little screens . "
And the very act of text messaging can throw up new terms : predictive text tends to choose " book " when users type the letters for " cool " .
Solution ?
Book now means cool .
Oyster pearls
Of the more unlikely slang sources identified in the Post Office research is the Oyster system , a card - based payment scheme on the London Underground .
The card readers show the number 35 if the card has run out of credit .
As a result , " Code 35 " has come to mean penniless .
Similarly , if you 're behind the times , you might be " Code 11 " - Oyster 's way of signifying an out - of - date card .
While these might seem London - centric , Mr Green says that slang is inherently an urban phenomenon , and London has ruled the invention and propagation of slang since as far back as the 16th Century .
Other terms from the study are of a more topical bent ; the economic downturn has given rise to " GOOD job " - an acronym for Get Out Of Debt , the kind of job that many of the cash - strapped formerly employed may be on the lookout for .
Other examples are simple abbreviations , the technologically driven equivalents of FYI or TBC .
Such consonant - heavy shortcuts are well - documented , but new examples are creeping in .
" I love you " can take the shortened form of 143 - for the number of letters in each word .
It 's just another form of the Queen 's English - not better , not worse
Jonathon Green , slang lexicographer Such labour - saving is nothing new ; as another fairly fiddly mode of communication , the telegraph had its own rich collection of abbreviations .
But the sheer number of mobile users compared to the number of telegraphers in their heyday means that these abbreviations and terms will spread further and last longer .
Hrd 2 rd According to a study by psychologist Nenagh Kemp at the University of Tasmania , however , such shortcuts benefit only the sender , not the recipient .
A group of 55 students was asked to send and read out text messages either in standard English or its vowel - impoverished cousin " textese " .
While writing in textese was significantly faster across the board , nearly half the students took twice as long to read messages aloud as compared to standard English versions .
Contrary to the idea that shortenings and deliberate misspellings are dulling our language skills , Dr Kemp argues that expertise with phonetics and grammar is directly tied to the ability to decipher messages in textese .
The development of this technologically savvy ( or lazy ) branch of language is a natural part of our language 's evolution , argues Mr Green .
" It 's just another form of the Queen 's English - not better , not worse , " he says .

Questions Answered
In a comment to a below post , Seth asks these questions :
Ok Jon , so what 's the explanation ?
Why is the UN Sec - Gen soft on Israel ?
Does the Israel lobby of the US dominate the UN too ?
Is he too scared of the US reaction ?
Seriously , he has nothing to lose by condemning Israeli aggression in the strongest terms he desires .
So why is he holding back ?
Here are some answers :
This is from a New York Times story from November 26 , 1996 .
( Note that , according to Nexis , the Times did n't even bother to run a story on November 19 , when the actual veto was cast . )
The Clinton Administration , which vows to prevent [ Boutros ] Boutros - Ghali from winning a second term [ as Secretary - General ] , vetoed his candidacy in the Security Council last Tuesday and asked Africans to come up with other names , which they were expected to do by this week .
If they do not , American diplomats say , Africa may lose the Secretary General 's position to another continent .
The United States has refused to name its own candidate , knowing that in the current mood here , that person would be rejected .
American diplomats believe that Africans are less united behind their candidate than divided among themselves over an alternate .
A number of Africans are known to be waiting in the wings for a call .
Until Africa or another region makes a move , the 14 other Security Council members , all of whom voted against the United States and for Mr. Boutros - Ghali last week , are not in a position to change their preferences , diplomats say .
Here 's more detail in a quote from Richard Clarke 's book Against All Enemies :
Albright and I and a handful of others ( Michael Sheehan , Jamie Rubin ) had entered into a pact together in 1996 to oust Boutros - Ghali as Secretary - General of the United Nations , a secret plan we had called Operation Oriental Express , reflecting our hope that many nations would join us in doing in the UN head .
In the end , the US had to do it alone ( with its UN veto ) and Sheehan and I had to prevent the president from giving in to pressure from world leaders and extending Boutros - Ghali 's tenure , often by our racing to the Oval Office when we were alerted that a head of state was telephoning the president .
In the end Clinton was impressed that we had managed not only to oust Boutros - Ghali but to have Kofi Annan selected to replace him .
And here 's a great deal of detail , in an extremely informative column by Phyllis Bennis :
By the middle of 1996 , as President Clinton 's second election campaign was in full partisan swing , the administration known for its domestic priorities suddenly turned on the United Nations .
Its target , on the 38th floor , was UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros - Ghali , the pro-Western Egyptian whom even the staunchly reactionary Washington Times admitted " has done nearly all the US wanted - even if he squawked about it " .
Madeleine Albright , then ambassador to the UN , announced that she intended to veto Boutros - Ghali 's expected second term in office .
And Israel would play a key role .
The campaign was n't really about Boutros - Ghali , of course .
Washington did not suddenly begin condemning the UN and halting UN dues payments in 1996 because they did n't like Boutros - Ghali .
( It was during the Reagan administration , back in 1985 , that Washington first refused to pay up . )
Boutros - Ghali was merely a convenient scapegoat for an anti-UN crusade ...
The main parameters of the administration ’s campaign were set quietly by State Department officials in early 1996 ... The State Department team quietly offered Boutros - Ghali a " deal " , a one - year extension of a single term ; he turned it down , but counter - offered that he would accept a two - and - a - half year " half term " .
Washington refused , and the battle was joined .
Washington 's support for Israel further shored up US determination to get rid of the secretary - general .
Israel 's August 1996 air assault in south Lebanon had targeted , among other things , a UN peacekeeping center at Qana , a small Lebanese village .
Hundreds of refugees had taken shelter there from the bombardment .
The Israeli attack killed more than 100 Lebanese civilians , and wounded several Fijian peacekeepers serving with the UN peacekeeping contingent in south Lebanon .
The UN 's report , issued some months later , documented the presence of an Israeli drone surveillance plane in the immediate area during the air strikes , rebutting Israel 's claim that the Qana attack was an unfortunate accident because they never knew about the civilians sheltering in Qana .
US diplomats worked hard to prevent the information from being released , but eventually Boutros - Ghali allowed the report to be made public .
It was carefully edited , but unmistakably damning to Israeli claims .
US officials were furious , and their anger at the secretary - general consolidated Albright 's already intense anti-Boutros - Ghali campaign .
Albright had also correctly recognized that no one ever lost points inside the Washington beltway by being too antagonistic towards the UN As ambassador to the institution Washington loved to hate she was best positioned to blame Boutros - Ghali for everything in the UN that Washington hated .
She could orchestrate his downfall , claim credit for it , and reap her just reward –- appointment by a victorious Bill Clinton as secretary of state in his second administration .
Her campaign was successful : Boutros - Ghali was forced out , Albright moved up the State Department ladder , and Kofi Annan was anointed UN secretary - general with Washington 's blessing .
P.S. : This is not just a blug post .
It is also a sophisticated psychological experiment .

“ We both knew if we were to work together again we could n’t tread on the kind of similar territory as Titanic , ” says DiCaprio , via e-mail .
“ The characters [ in Revolutionary Road ] were a departure from what we did together before , and we knew we could push each other as actors to get some interesting performances out of each other . ”
Asked how Winslet approaches a role , he observes : “ Her working script is riddled with notes , with different colored bookmarks , every page has detailed reference points for her to infuse into her role .
She takes on her characters like a detective might survey a crime scene . ”
He adds — no ifs , ands , or buts — “ Kate is the most talented actress of her generation . ”
For his part , Mendes had to navigate a kind of de facto triangle offscreen .
“ Leo and Kate ’s instinctive , almost wordless understanding of each other saved us weeks of work , ” the director says .
“ I encouraged them and wanted them to go off into a corner together .
I wanted them to be the unit of the movie — not me and Kate .
For me it was a lot about Leo : I wanted him to feel that she and he were on each other ’s side and looking out for each other , rather than me and Kate .
Because the person who was in the most complicated position in many ways was Leo , because he was there having to be married to , you know , the director ’s wife .
And also I made a decision very early on , in rehearsals , that I just had to treat Kate as I would treat any other leading actress of her stature .
And I had to do it 24 hours a day because otherwise it would be confusing .
Because if I came back and started talking as her husband , rather than her director , then it would have been very , very confusing for her , and for me too . ”
Marital status notwithstanding , Mendes is passionate on the subject of his lead actress : “ I did n’t realize the extent of her absolute dedication — and I know it ’s such a corny word to use , but I really did n ’t — until I worked with her .
I had seen every aspect of her in many ways except the professional side of her and how incredibly focused she is .
I mean , she makes me look like a sort of tired slug . ”
He adds , “ I think there ’s quite a lot of talented people and there ’s very few gifted people , and I think that she genuinely has a gift .
I ca n’t tell you where it comes from , and I ’m not sure she can either — and I think that ’s probably a good thing — but when she goes into that place , those strange secret rooms that she unlocks to explore these people that she ’s playing , it ’s sobering for those of us who do n’t possess that kind of pure gift . ”
After taking the role in The Reader , Winslet had only two months to prepare — an unusually short period for her , and even more so in this case .
“ It ’s a part that is incredibly complicated , ” says Stephen Daldry , the director .
“ Not just in terms of the age span that the character makes , which is huge , and not just because it ’s an extraordinary character , but also because she ’s performing in the film where the majority of the actors are Germans speaking in English , and she ’s English speaking in a German accent , and so the issues of matching accents are crucial to make sure everybody ’s in the same world .
What she had to do in two months is climb a mountain . ”
Of course , even in the best of circumstances , preparation can take an actor only so far .
There ’s always a leap of faith to be made in front of the camera .
Says Winslet ( who threw up before shooting one of * Revolutionary Road ’*s most emotionally painful scenes ) , “ I know that in order to do my job as truthfully as I can — because to me that ’s everything — you really have to not give a fuck [ about what people think ] .
You have to be prepared to look stupid and you have to be prepared to walk around naked in front of a crew of people you ’ve never met before and may never see again .
And it is scary . ”
The two are currently working on an adaptation of James and Buzz Bissinger ’s novel Shooting Stars
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gave an enthusiastic , if unconventional , welcome on Thursday to the election of Barack Obama , citing among his attributes youth , good looks and a suntan .
Speaking at a joint news conference with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow , the 72 - year - old media tycoon also said Obama ’s election to the White House had been “ hailed by world public opinion as the arrival of a messiah . ”
“ I will try to help relations between Russia and the United States where a new generation has come to power , and I do n’t see problems for Medvedev to establish good relations with Obama who is handsome , young and also suntanned , ” he said .
Berlusconi , who prides himself on being a friend of outgoing U.S. President George W. Bush , shrugged off a barrage of criticism in Italy as his remark quickly appeared in print and audio on major media websites around the world .
Italy ’s left - wing opposition parties accused him of bringing discredit on the country with comments which they said were at worst racist and at best a diplomatic blunder .
Berlusconi called his critics “ imbeciles ” without any sense of humor , adding , “ God save us from the imbeciles . ”
Berlusconi , who himself sports a year - round tan , is famed in diplomatic circles for making sometimes inappropriate quips .
On his first meeting with Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2002 , Berlusconi complimented him with the words : “ Rasmussen is not only a great colleague , he ’s also the best - looking prime minister in Europe . ”
He added : “ He ’s so good looking , I ’m even thinking of introducing him to my wife . ”
He sparked a minor diplomatic incident in 2005 by suggesting he had wooed Finnish President Tarja Halonen to ensure her backing for Italy to host the European Food Safety Authority .
“ I had to use all my playboy tactics , even if they have not been used for some time , ” he said , prompting Helsinki to call in the Italian ambassador to explain the comments .
More than a quarter of all U.S. teenagers think violent behavior is at least sometimes acceptable , and one in five say they behaved violently toward another person in the past year , according to a new poll .
Most said self - defense ( 87 percent ) or helping a friend ( 73 percent ) were acceptable justifications for violence .
But 34 percent said revenge was a sufficient motivation .
The poll was conducted by Opinion Research for the school - support organization Junior Achievement and the tax and consulting firm Deloitte , LLC .
More than three - fourths of the respondents who said violence is acceptable also consider themselves ethically prepared to enter the work force .
That sticks in the craw of David W. Miller , director of the Princeton University Faith & Work Initiative and a professor of business ethics at Princeton University .
In an analysis released with the poll , Miller suggests the survey results bode ill for the future workforce .
It 's not clear that 's the case , however .
In fact , teens are known to think differently than adults because their brains have not matured .
Scans reveal that teens ' ethics change dramatically as they grow into adulthood .
Or do they ?
' Highly troubling '
The survey of 750 young people ( half boys , half girls ) age 12 to 17 was conducted between Oct. 9 and Oct. 12 .
The results were released this week .
" It is highly troubling that so many teenagers have a self - image of ethical readiness and the confidence in their ability to make good decisions later in life , yet at the same time freely admit to current behavior that is highly unethical , " Miller said in a statement accompanying the poll results .
" Employers will have their hands full if a quarter of teens grow up still willing to resort to violence and other unethical behavior when it comes to making decisions about how to settle differences , protect their interests or get ahead , " said Miller , who is also author of " God at Work : The History and Promise of the Faith at Work Movement ( Oxford University Press , 2006 ) .
There are potential problems with Miller 's take on the poll , however .
Teens lie
First , polls can be greatly skewed based on how questions are framed and by how honestly people respond .
Adults are known to lie through their teeth in sex surveys , for example .
In one Web - based survey , women claimed on average 8.6 lifetime sexual partners .
The men claimed 31.9 .
Some researchers doubt those disparate figures are accurate .
A follow - up survey found about 5 percent of each sex said they lied and more than 10 percent said they knew their answer was n't accurate .
It 's reasonable to assume that teenagers , who are prone to prevaricate and whose brains are known to be not fully formed , might fib , knowingly or unknowingly , about heavy questions on topics like violence .
In a telephone interview today , Miller agreed to this possibility , but he cites another question in the poll aimed at getting around this issue :
Some 41 percent of the respondents reported a friend had behaved violently toward someone else in the past year .
That response , Miller said , is less likely to involve lies .
Words vs. actions
Second , it 's also quite possible few of the teens would actually act on the hypothetical responses they gave .
LiveScience 's Bad Science Columnist Ben Radford points out that a study of teen virginity pledges , as an example , found that nearly 90 percent of them broke their vow .
Another study at Harvard University found that more than half of adolescents who make signed , public pledges on things like virginity and violence give up on their pledges within one year .
And in what will not sound ironic to any parent , three - fourths of the teens who pledged not to have sex but did , later denied having made the pledge .
Miller questions whether lying about sexual activity , which may be driven more by hormones than reason , translates to the poll on violence .
" We lie about some things , and at the same time , we tell the truth about other things , " he said .
" Lying in one category does not mean logically we 'll lie in others . "
Miller also said , regarding words vs. deeds , that today 's teens are exposed to exponentially more violence on TV , in video games , in movies , on the Internet , and even in popular extreme sports like kick boxing , " making violent acts seem normative .
That 's something prior generations did n't have . "
Teens grow up
Third , without a similar version of this teen violence poll having been done decades ago , it is impossible to know whether Miller 's basic concern — that the state of a teenage mind on such things as intentions and ethics actually predicts adult behavior — holds any water .
In fact , science has plenty of evidence to suggest the opposite .
A 2006 study involving questions about how participants ( teens and adults ) would react to certain situations was , importantly , coupled with brain scans while they answered .
Scientists found that teens , frankly , do n't care about people 's feelings as much as adults do .
The part of the brain associated with higher - level thinking is n't fully operational .
Specifically , teens were found to barely use the part of the brain known to be involved in thinking about other people 's emotions when considering a course of action .
" Thinking strategies change with age , " said neuroscientist Sarah - Jayne Blakemore of the University College London .
" The fact that teenagers underuse the medial pre-frontal cortex when making decisions about what to do , implies that they are less likely to think about how they themselves and how other people will feel as a result of their intended action . "
The idea of violence in a teen 's mind , then , is not likely viewed the same as in an adult mind .
Miller , too , allows that teens change .
" Let 's hope so ! " he said .
" All teenagers in all generations go through a stage of boundary testing … and figuring out where the right ethical boundaries are , " he told me .
" At some level there 's nothing new in that .
On the other hand , the data is pretty compelling . "
Coupled with other data that suggest today 's teenagers , and the millennials before them , " tend to embrace ethical relativism , that even as they mature into adults , they will have cultivated habits and brains that are capable of rationalizing behavior that serves their interests , irrespective of traditional societal expectations or understandings of right and wrong , " he said .
" I would n't overreact " to the survey , " Miller said , " but I think to under - react and interpret it as natural youth boundary testing is naive too . "
Unethical adults
Lastly , Miller worries not just about violence but that teens will carry their ethical relativism into adulthood .
On that point he might be right : A lot of adults have lousy ethics .
One need look no farther than the Wall Street Ponzi scheme of Bernard Madoff or the New England Patriots head football coach Bill Belichick 's cheating last year for proof .
Bad ethics is not just the purview of the powerful , either .
Nearly 20 percent of U.S. adults think cheating on taxes is morally acceptable or is not a moral issue , according to a Pew Research Center survey in 2006 .
About 10 percent think it 's okay to cheat on a spouse .
Cheating is not the same as violence , of course , but if the issue is modern teen ethics , then adults who supposedly grew up in a better era are not necessarily a model to which today 's teens ought to aspire .

“ The war on drugs has been an utter failure .
… ( W )e need to rethink and decriminalize our ( nation ’s ) marijuana laws . ”
- Barack Obama , January 2004
( Watch the video here . )
“ I inhaled frequently , that was the point . ”
- Barack Obama , November 2006 ( Watch the video here . )
Q : “ Will you consider legalizing marijuana so that the government can regulate it , tax it , put age limits on it , and create millions of new jobs and create a billion dollar industry right here in the U.S. ? ”
A : “ President - elect Obama is not in favor of the legalization of marijuana . ”
- Statement from Change.gov , the official website of President - Elect Obama , December 15 , 2008
Okay , count me among those disappointed , but hardly surprised to see that Change.gov — the official website of the incoming Obama administration — answered the above question , which finished first out of over 7,000 public policy questions submitted to the website , in the most curt and dismissive way possible .
That said , as StoptheDrugWar.org ’s Scott Morgan writes , Obama ’s brevity is , in fact , quite telling .
As frustrating and insulting as it is to witness an important matter brushed casually to the side without explanation , Obama ’s answer actually says a lot .
It says that he could n’t think of even one sentence to explain his position .
Within the vast framework of totally paranoid anti-pot propaganda , Obama could n’t find a single argument he wanted to associate himself with .
That ’s why he simply said “ No. Next question . ”
All of this highlights the well - known fact that Obama agrees that our marijuana laws are deeply flawed .
He ‘s said so , and has back - pedaled recently for purely political reasons .
If Obama ’s transition team tried to give an accurate description of his position on marijuana reform it would look like this :
Q : “ Will you consider legalizing marijuana so that the government can regulate it , tax it , put age limits on it , and create millions of new jobs and create a billion dollar industry right here in the U.S. ? ” S. Man , Denton
A : President - elect Obama will not use his political capital to advance the legalization of marijuana .
While he agrees that arresting adults for marijuana possession is a poor use of law enforcement resources , he believes that the issue remains too controversial to do anything about it .
In fact , Obama essentially said as much earlier this year when asked about the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes .
Obama : “ When it comes to medical marijuana , … my attitude is if it is an issue of doctors prescribing marijuana , … I think that should be appropriate . …
Whether I want to use a whole lot of political capital on ( this ) issue ; the likelihood of that being real high on my priority list is not likely . ”
( Watch the video here . )
So then , disappointed as we are , how should we proceed ?
Answer : Just as we have been .
To be fair to President - Elect Obama , he never pledged to legalize marijuana .
Quite the contrary , during his Presidential campaign he backtracked from his previous comments supporting pot decriminalization , and he even went so far as to pick one of the chief architects of the modern drug war to be his Vice President .
In short , to believe that the Obama team would have responded to the legalization question any other way was idealistic at best , and foolish at worst .
But that hardly means that we activists should write off the next four years .
In November , editors at the website Alternet.org asked me to draft “ a progressive agenda for Obama ” regarding marijuana policy .
At that time , I listed several realistic , practical actions Obama could take to substantially reform America ’s antiquated and punitive pot laws .
( Note , legalizing marijuana by Executive Order was not on my wish list . )
These actions include :
1 . As President , Obama must uphold his campaign promise to “ not … use Justice Department resources to try and circumvent state laws ” that legalize the medical use of cannabis .
( Watch the video here . )
2. Obama can appoint leaders to the US Department of Justice , DEA , and the Office of National Drug Control Policy who possess professional backgrounds in public health , addiction and treatment rather than in law enforcement .
3. Obama can support the autonomy and health of Washington D.C. voters by encouraging Congress to lift the so - called “ Barr amendment ” ( passed by Congress in 1998 and reinstated every year since then ) , which prohibits the District of Columbia from implementing a 1998 voter - approved ballot initiative legalizing the use of marijuana by authorized patients .
4. Obama can call for the creation of a bipartisan Presidential commission to review the budgetary , social and health costs associated with federal marijuana prohibition , and to make progressive recommendations for future policy changes .
Ultimately , of course , it ’s Congress , not the president , who is responsible for crafting America ’s oppressive federal anti-drug strategies .
Moreover , it is clear that in the coming years this battle will continue to primarily be fought — and won — on the state level , not in Washington D.C .
That ’s not to say that we should not continue to keep the pressure on Obama by continuing to post questions to websites like Change.gov .
( My suggestion for the next round of voting …
How about : “ On Election Day , over 3 million voters decided to legalize the medical use of cannabis in Michigan , making it the 13th state to enact laws allowing the legal medical use of marijuana .
While campaigning , you pledged : ‘ What I ’m not going to be doing is spend Justice Department resources to try and circumvent state laws on this issue . ’
As President , will you and your Attorney General uphold this promise not to target and prosecute patients and providers who are in compliance with state medical marijuana laws ? “ )
However , we must always remember that it will be the actions of tens of thousands — not the actions of just one man — that will ultimately bring an end to America ’s vindictive and senseless war on cannabis consumers .
Now let ’s get back to work !

A concentration camp
for 1 million people
Advertisement
Administered by Israel , paid for by the US and tolerated by Arab rulers , Gaza is an open air concentration camp where snipers take pot shots at children , aircraft shoot missiles into crowds , and bulldozers randomly destroy homes with impunity .
The recent mass assault is only the latest in a long string of atrocities .
Dishonest news outlets like the Associated Press talk about the bombing of the Gaza tunnels without pointing out that for over a year they are the only source of food , medicine , and other necessities for one million people walled in and surrounded by homicidal psychopaths .
Approximately half of the population of Gaza is under 18 years old .
As the Israelis continue to pound Gaza , killing Hamas cadre , traffic cops , and civilians alike , Americans shake their heads and wonder : why ca n’t they all just get along ?
Why must we be involved ?
The answer to both questions lies in understanding the peculiar nature of the Israeli state and its " special relationship " to the West , specifically the U.S .
Defenders of the Israeli government and its policies often complain that Israel just wants to be treated as a " normal country , " like any other .
They cavil that the Jewish state is treated like an outsider , a pariah , and held up to standards that do n’t apply anywhere else .
The big problem for these complainants , however , is that Israel is not a normal country , and never has been .
From the day of its birth , Israel has been a Western project , a unique creation of European ideologues whose vision of a Jewish state was rooted in myth , custom , and remembrance , rather than blood and soil .
Israel owes its existence to theology rather than geography , and in this it occupies a singular place in the history of nations .
The only other comparable state is , or was , the old Soviet Union , which was founded as the receptacle for Leninist ideology , but even here the analogy is n’t quite exact , for the simple reason that Russia preexisted the USSR by several centuries , and Russian nationalism soon came to dominate and overwhelm the ostensibly " internationalist " Kremlin leadership .
As a settler colony rather than a rooted nation , Israel ’s always precarious existence is made possible by an extensive international support system that exists entirely outside the Middle East .
In the beginning , it was the Zionist movement itself that provided the outside material aid that nurtured and grew this nascent nation .
That , however , was not enough to provide the sustenance Israel needed to come into existence and survive in a very rough neighborhood , so it was the British empire that presided over its birth .
The Balfour Declaration provided the semi-legal basis for the existence of an independent Jewish state in the area known as Palestine .
The British , however , had neither the resources nor the inclination to act as Israel ’s permanent sponsor and protector , and this role eventually fell to the United States .
Without U.S. aid , including unconditional military and political support , Israel could not exist for long .
Over the years , it has evolved its own characteristic means of survival , which is analogous to that of an epiphyte  a plant that , rather than rooting in its own soil , grows on other plants .
Because Israel is almost entirely dependent on international support  and especially American support  for its very survival , without U.S. public opinion behind it the Jewish state would soon wither on the vine .
What this means , in practice , is that a constant stream of pro-Israel propaganda must be directed at the American people in order to justify the high levels of financial and military aid that keep Israel afloat .
What ’s more , the Israelis must constantly generate the urgency and immediacy of the need to support their country .
They have succeeded in doing this by projecting a sense of continuing crisis .
The idea that Israel is in danger , that unless we ship billions more in taxpayer dollars the Israeli state will sink beneath the waves of an unrelenting Arab assault , is constantly being pushed  and we wonder why the " peace process " is perpetually stalled .
Given the need for a constant crisis , all efforts to mediate a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question are doomed to utter failure .
The Israelis simply have no interest in peace , when war suits their purposes so well .
Indeed , when things get too peaceful , they have every interest in stirring things up .
Once more , Israel is supposedly fighting for its life  so please keep those aid packages coming , to the tune of over $ 3 billion per year !
Another aspect of this epiphytic survival strategy involves the large - scale theft of military and other classified secrets , mainly from the U.S. , as illustrated by the arrest of Jonathan Pollard , and , more recently , his fellow spy Ben Ami Kadish .
U.S. intelligence agencies have long characterized Israel as the most aggressive procurer of illicit technology transfers , and the case of Kadish  who stole nuclear secrets , missile defense technology , and other high - tech weapon designs  underscores this sensitive yet largely ignored aspect of the " special relationship . "
Yet it is n’t just technological secrets that the Israelis are interested in pilfering from their American big brothers : due to their dependence on the decisions and actions of our policymakers , they also require an extensive knowledge of the inner workings of the U.S. government .
That ’s what the case of the AIPAC defendants is all about .
While Kadish recently pled guilty to charges of espionage , the AIPAC defendants 
Steve Rosen , former AIPAC lobbying director , and Keith Weissman , who used to be AIPAC ’s Iran expert  are fighting the charges .
They are accused of pilfering not only military - related intelligence , but also U.S. government documents revealing the internal policy debates within the administration , especially U.S. policy toward Iran .
Their defense
team argues that the Justice Department , in prosecuting their clients , is criminalizing what ought to be considered legitimate lobbying and advocacy .
One has to wonder , however , what kind of " advocacy " requires the theft [ .pdf ] of highly sensitive and classified materials and their transmission to officials of a foreign government .
Yet , from the Israeli perspective , this is entirely legitimate , given their peculiar national survival strategy .
An epiphyte , after all , depends on its host .
The host , however , may have other ideas  and that ’s where the extensive Israeli penetration of U.S. governmental and opinion - making institutions comes in .
John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have done us all a service is providing a comprehensive survey of this effort and its astounding success , and we are seeing this play out in the political responses to the Gaza massacre , with both major political parties , as well as the incoming president and the bulk of the media , playing right along with the Israeli propaganda machine .
Until and unless the peculiarities of the " special relationship " are untangled and the cord cut , Israel will continue to rampage throughout the Middle East .
The most recent Gaza massacre is only the beginning .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
As the new year approaches , I want to take the opportunity to thank all of our readers and supporters who gave so generously to our winter fundraising campaign .
Without you , we could not continue providing the kind of independent voice that is so desperately needed in the realm of foreign policy .
Bereft of the contributions that make our work possible , Antiwar.com could not even consider presenting the kind of material presented above .
We do n’t depend on big foundations , liberal or conservative , to keep us going .
We just count on you , year after year , to keep us afloat .
And year after year , you ’ve come through .
For that , a gigantic thank you  and a happy New Year to one and all .

RSS is one of those technologies that are extremely simple yet extremely powerful .
Currently , RSS is the de facto standard for blog syndication , and it is used widely in both personal and corporate settings ; for example , in blogs .
And because a large percentage of these blogs run on WordPress , we ’ll cover in this post some ( hopefully ) relatively unknown but useful RSS - related tricks and hacks that will help you use RSS in a more effective way — and without unnecessary and chunky WordPress plug-ins .

And because a large percentage of these blogs run on WordPress , we ’ll cover in this post some ( hopefully ) relatively unknown but useful RSS - related tricks and hacks that will help you use RSS in a more effective way — and without unnecessary and chunky WordPress plug-ins .
This article has been reviewed and updated on Nov. 24th , 2016
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
Let ’s take a look at 10 useful , yet rather unknown RSS - tricks for WordPress .
Each section of the article presents a problem , suggests a solution and provides you with an explanation of the solution , so that you can not just solve some of your RSS - related problems but also understand what you are actually doing .
Thus , you can make sure your WordPress theme remains under your control and is not bloated with some obscure source code .
1. Control When Your Posts are Available via RSS
The problem .
Have you ever published an article and then immediately noticed an error ?
Sure , you can edit it , but there ’s another problem : the article has already been published in your RSS feed .
To avoid this kind of problem , use this recipe to create a delay between the publication of a post and its availability in your RSS feed .
The solution .
To apply this hack , simply paste the following code into your theme ’s function .
php file .
If your theme does n’t have this file , just create it .
function publish_later_on_feed ( $ where ) { global $ wpdb ; if ( is_feed ( ) ) { // timestamp in WP - format $ now = gmdate ( ' Y - m - d H:i :s ' ) ; // value for wait ; + device $ wait = ' 5 ' ; // integer // http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_timestampdiff
$ device = ' MINUTE ' ; //MINUTE , HOUR , DAY , WEEK , MONTH , YEAR // add SQL - sytax to default $ where $ where .= " AND TIMESTAMPDIFF ( $ device , $ wpdb->posts.post_date_gmt , '$ now ' ) > $ wait " ; } return $ where ; } add_filter ( ' posts_where ' , ' publish_later_on_feed ' ) ;
Code explanation .
The above code will add a 5 - minute delay to the time between when your post is published on your blog and when it appears in your RSS feed .
To change the length of the delay , change the value of the $ wait variable on line 9 .

2. Redirecting WordPress Feeds to FeedBurner Feeds
The problem .
Beginner bloggers usually start to use FeedBurner only after they have seen it used on many other blogs and realize how useful and cool this tool is .
They sign up and start to use it , but their early readers are already subscribed to their default WordPress feed .
Another problem : do you often change your theme ?
If so , you must be bored having to edit each call to bloginf o ( ’rss2_url ’ ) and replace it with your FeedBurner feed ’s URL .
The solution .
The solution to both problems described above is simple : use server redirections .
Create a backup of your .htaccess file , located in the root of your Web server .
Edit the .htaccess file and add the following code .
Do n’t forget to modify the feed ’s URL with your own feed ’s URL .
# temp redirect wordpress content feeds to feedburner < IfModule mod_rewrite .c >
RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ! FeedBurner [ NC ] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ! FeedValidator [ NC ] RewriteRule ^feed /?( [ _0 -9a -z - ] + ) ?/? $
http://feeds.feedburner.com/wprecipes
[ R=302 , NC, L ] </ IfModule >
Save the file .
You ’re done !
Code explanation .
Each time someone clicks on a link to http://www.yourblog.com/feed, he or she will be redirected to http://feeds.feedburner.com/yourblog.
This way , you will have never lost an RSS subscriber , and even if you change your theme twice a day , you ’ll never have to manually edit your RSS feed links again .
Sources
3. Insert Ads ( or Anything Else ) in Your RSS Feed
The problem .
Monetizing RSS feeds is currently becoming a common practice , and many blog owners do it to maximize their income .
FeedBurner can insert AdSense ads into your feed items , but you need at least 500 subscribers to qualify , and you ca n’t use any ads other than the AdSense ads provided by FeedBurner .
The solution .
It is possible , though , to insert other kinds of ads into your RSS feed .
You can , for example , use a link to a free WordPress theme only for your RSS subscribers .
Follow these simple steps to perform this hack :
Edit the functions .
php file of your theme .
If your theme does n’t have a functions .
php file , simply create one .
Paste the following code into your functions .
php file : <? php function insertAds ( $ content ) { $ content = $ content . '< hr />< a href = " http://www.wprecipes.com "
>
Have you visited WpRecipes today ?</a>< hr />' ; return $ content ; } add_filter (' the_excerpt_rss ' , ' insertAds ' ) ; add_filter (' the_content_rss ' , ' insertAds ' ) ; ?>
Save the file .
You ’re now displaying your ads in your RSS feed !
Code explanation .
I have seen many similar hacks on the Web , but all of them require you to edit WordPress core files to achieve the same result .
Of course , editing WordPress core files is a very bad idea because then you would have to re-edit the files each time you upgrade your blog .
Instead , this hack uses the add_filter ( ) WordPress function to insert content into your RSS feed without editing any core files .

4. Format Your Images for Feed Readers
The problem .
You took a lot of time to write and format your post and add beautiful screenshots .
It looks so good on your blog .
Sadly , when the post is displayed in Google Reader or any other RSS reader , it does n’t look so great .
The solution .
This is due to the fact that most feed readers display images inline with text :
To avoid this problem , add a CSS class to display the image as a block .
WordPress provides the built - in class “ center “ :
<img src= " https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/wordpress-rss-hacks/myimage.jpg " alt = " This is my image " class= " center " / >
Sources
5. Provide Your Readers with a Feed for Each Post
The problem .
When a post has lots and lots of comments , it can be hard for readers to follow the conversation .
Most WordPress users do n’t know this , but our favorite blogging engine has a built - in function for providing an RSS feed for the comments in each post .
The solution .
Well , this recipe is n’t really a hack or anything : to provide an RSS feed for the comments in a particular post , just call the comment_rss_link ( ) function :
<?php comments_rss_link ( '» Comments RSS Feed ' ) ; ?>
Update : the comment_rss_link ( ) function has been deprecated .
Use the post_comments_feed_link ( ) function instead .
<?php post_comments_feed_link ( '» Comments RSS Feed ' ) ; ?>
Sources
6. Exclude Categories from Your RSS Feed
The problem .
Do you use one of your blog categories to let readers know about your website ’s news , or does your blog feature a category that has nothing to do with the rest of your content ?
If so , it is generally not a good idea to include it in your RSS feed .
The solution .
Here ’s how to get rid of one of the categories in your RSS feed :
First , get the numeric ID of the category you want to exclude .
If you do n’t know how to get the ID of a particular category , you can learn how here .
Once you have the ID of the category you want to exclude from your RSS feed , edit the functions .
php file in your theme .
Create the file if it does n’t exist .
Paste the following code in it : function myFilter ( $ query ) { if ( $ query - > is_feed ) { $ query -> set ( ' cat ' , ' - 5 ' ) ; // Don't forget to change the category ID =^o^= } return $ query ; } add_filter ( ' pre_get_posts ' , 'my Filter ' ) ;
Save the file , and you ’re done !
Code explanation .
This hack works exactly the same way as the previous one : create a custom function to exclude the category that you do n’t want to appear in your RSS feed , and then use the super - useful add_filter ( ) function to apply it to the pre_get_posts ( )
WordPress core function .
The minus is important before the numeric ID .
Without the minus , only this category will be used .
7. Display Any RSS Feed on Your WordPress Blog
The problem .
Do you have more than one blog , or do you manage a forum ?
If so , you may want to be able to display any RSS feed on your WordPress blog .
The solution .
Many plug-ins can do the job , but they ’re not necessary at all .
WordPress has a built - in RSS reader that is used , for example , to display news on your dashboard .
All you have to do is use it in your theme .
Paste the following code anywhere in your theme ( personally , I ’d put it in the sidebar , the footer or , even better , the page template ) : <?php include_once ( ABSPATH .
WPINC.'/rss.php ' ) ; wp_rss ( ' http://feeds.feedburner.com/wprecipes', 3 ) ; ?>
Save it and you ’re done .
It ’s as easy as that !
Code explanation .
The first thing we have done is include the rss.php file from WordPress core .
This file allows us to use the wp_rss ( ) function , which takes two parameters : the first is the RSS feed ’s URL , and the second is the number of RSS entries to be displayed .
Sources
8. Use Category - Specific RSS Feeds
The problem .
Many blogs talk about a lot of different topics : design , programming , blogging tips , etc .
Have you ever come across a blog in which you have enjoyed only one category of posts ?
If so , you should definitely consider offering one feed per category to your own readers .
The solution .
Let ’s say you ’d like to be able to subscribe only to TheGridSystem ’s tools section .
The category URL is :
http://www.thegridsystem.org/categories/tools/
To get an RSS feed for this category , you simply have to add / feed to the end of the URL :
http://www.thegridsystem.org/categories/tools/feed
Pretty easy , is n’t it ?
But pretty useful , too , in my opinion .
9. List RSS Feeds by Category
The problem .
If you like the previous hack , you will probably also want to be able to display the names of all your category feeds in a list to your readers .
The solution .
Edit any of your theme files , where you want to list your categories and their accompanying feeds .
Paste the following code : <?php wp_list_categories ('feed_image=http://www.myblog.com/image.gif&feed=XML Feed&optioncount=1&children=0 ' ) ; ?>
Save the file .
You categories will now be displayed , along with their RSS feeds !
Code explanation .
This hack uses only the good old wp_list_categories ( ) function , with two parameters .
The first is feed_image , which allows us to specify the URL to be displayed as a feed image .
The second parameter is feed , which is used to specify the feed format .
10 . Get Rid of RSS Feeds the Clean Way
The problem .
Let ’s say you ’re using WordPress as a CMS to manage your online portfolio or your company ’s website .
In such cases , the RSS feed is n’t that useful , and some people would probably want to remove it .
The solution .
I have seen many “ hacks ” on the Web where people say you just have to remove the include on the wp- settings .
php core file .
I do n’t think you should ever edit a core file .
Instead , the following hack will do the job .
Simply paste this code in the functions .
php file of your theme :

Micro-blogging site Twitter had to temporarily suspend accounts belonging to Barack Obama , Britney Spears and other celebrities after they were hijacked by miscreants and used to spread scandalous and false information that appeared to come from their owners .
The attack on 33 celebrity accounts caused Fox News to apparently admit that news commentator Bill O'Reilly was gay and prompted a confession from pop celeb Spears that her vagina was four feet wide " with razor sharp teeth . "
Twitter said in a blog post that the compromises were the result of an individual who " hacked into some of the tools our support team uses to help people do things like edit the email address associated with their Twitter account when they can't remember or get stuck . "
The accounts were temporarily suspended until their rightful owners could regain control of them .
A separate high - profile phishing campaign caused thousands of the site 's users to receive phony messages designed to trick them into visiting sites that steal their login credentials .
Miscreants used the compromised identities to spam additional Twitter users who followed the account holder .
It 's the latest example of a social networking site being besieged by scammers .
Over the past year , Facebook and MySpace have become havens for phishers and other scammers out to exploit the near - blind trust users place in these online hangouts .
To its credit , and unlike many of its peers , Twitter gives users the option of surfing the vast majority of the site with the use of the secure sockets layer protocol , a measure that makes it harder for scammers to trick their prey .
So if you must peruse the site , be sure there 's an https in front of the address , especially when logging in .
According to Twitter , the phishing scampaigns were unconnected to the impersonation of celebrities .
While the goal of the former is to purloin login credentials , the aim of the latter appeared to be the embarrassment of the rich and famous .
CNN anchor Rick Sanchez , for instance , was caught staying home from work because he was too high on crack .
The exception was the hijacked account of President - elect Barack Obama , which directed followers to visit a website that attempted to steal personal information . ®
There 's really only one side you can take in all this : that of the plucky Gallic resisters against the invaders .
The story so far : it is 2009 AD .
Albert Uderzo , illustrator and , since 1977 , only begetter of the Asterix series of books , has retired and sold his rights to Hachette Livre .
Which means , en effet , that the company can continue to bring out new Asterix stories untouched by his hand .
But his daughter , Sylvie , has now railed against his decision in Le Monde , accusing him of selling out to " those who would negate all the values he taught me : independence , fraternity , conviviality and resistance " .
( Any clumsiness or inaccuracies in this translation are my fault .
" Fraternité " is a much more loaded word in French than " fraternity " is in English . )
She points out the decision taken in comparable circumstances by Hergé , creator of Tintin , that there be no additions to the canon after his death .
As I have said on numerous occasions , the quality of the Asterix stories plunged after the death of Uderzo 's partner , Rene Goscinny , who wrote them ; and this latest development we could have foreseen , for one of the recurring motifs of Goscinny 's narratives was an abiding distrust of rampant capitalism , expressed in the most penetrating satire available to the medium of the bande dessinée .
" These barbarians are n't interested in money , " says a frustrated Julius Caesar in Asterix and the Roman Agent , as he hears a plan to undermine the Gaulish resistance by buying them off .
" If they were , the magic potion would have been on the market long ago . "
But even by then Asterix was big business ; now it 's even bigger .
Six years later , in Obelix and Co , Goscinny is less sanguine about the villagers ' native common sense : the economics whizz - kid Caius Preposterus from the LSE ( Latin School of Economics ) hatches a plan to demoralise the villagers by introducing rampant consumerism .
He nearly succeeds , but in the end his plan backfires , and he starts what these days could only be called a catastrophic credit crunch , nearly emptying the Imperial coffers by stimulating a faddish demand for menhirs ( " It 's the right one , it 's not the light one ...
It 's a menhir ! " goes the jingle during an ad break at the Circus Maximus ) .
It should , obviously , be required reading for every student of economics , and had its lessons been taken on board , we might not be in the mess we 're in now .
There 's a hilarious sequence that shows Caesar , for the first time , completely baffled as he listens to Preposterus 's marketing bollocks :
" The following passage will be difficult for those of you unacquainted with the ancient business world to understand , especially as , these days , such a state of affairs could never exist since no one would dream of trying to sell something utterly useless ... "
Well , Hachette Livre , as people love to point out , is part of an enormous conglomerate which manufactures , among other things , missiles ; I once speculated that the Asterix series represented not only a wish - fulfilment fantasy about resistance during the second world war , but also subconsciously nodded to France 's desire for an independent force de frappe - that is , a menhir - shaped object flying through the air causing maximum devastation to her enemies .
Except in this case it is the French who are now the baddies , occupying themselves , as it were .
How Sylvie is going to allow her father 's creation to rest in peace I really do n't know .
For in real life there is , unfortunately , no such thing as a magic potion that can thwart the aims of big business .
Science runs your life .
Have no doubts about this at all .
It is in everything you do , everything you are .
How we deal with science , engineering , and innovation affects the air you breathe , the water you drink , the food you eat , the medicine you take , the lifespan you statistically enjoy , the computer you are sitting at , and the prosperity -- or lack thereof -- of the country you call home .
Right now , science in the US is under the heaviest attack it 's suffered since Galileo 's time , and for too long the citizens of this country have acquiesced .
In November , we can do something about it .
Both Senators Obama and McCain have made cursory statements about various aspects of science , but that 's not enough .
Science is critical , absolutely critical , to the health of the US , so we need better and more in - depth answers .
To get them , a group of six citizens created Science Debate 2008 to " ... restore science and innovation to America ’s political dialogue . "
They asked each candidate a series of science questions .
As of this moment , Obama is the only one who has answered , though McCain says he will .
Obama 's answers to these questions are , to me , very heartening .
He has been accused of giving no specifics when answering questions , but that is misleading at best ( the noise machine is very good at making noise ) .
In these answers he does indeed give many specifics , and to my eye is taking the right road to scientific progress and innovation in this country .
I wo n't detail all his answers , but I do want to point out some specific things he wrote .
On science innovation :
My administration will increase funding for basic research in physical and life sciences , mathematics , and engineering at a rate that would double basic research budgets over the next decade .
We will increase research grants for early - career researchers to keep young scientists entering these fields .
The number of young scientists in America is in decline , so this is a good idea .
I suspect McCain 's campaign would do the same thing .
On climate change :
There can no longer be any doubt that human activities are influencing the global climate and we must react quickly and effectively .
First , the U.S. must get off the sidelines and take long - overdue action here at home to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions .
We must also take a leadership role in designing technologies that allow us to enjoy a growing , prosperous economy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
I love that first statement .
Imagine , a leader who actually has a grasp of reality !
I very eagerly await John McCain 's statement on this topic .
It 's not hard to see that working on this issue will lead to engineering breakthroughs ( or even incremental steps ) that will generate tons of money for large and small businesses .
That 's a good thing , and something we should have been pursuing for decades .
On energy :
This research will cover ...
A new generation of nuclear electric technologies that address cost , safety , waste disposal , and proliferation risks .
Stereotypically , it 's been liberals opposed to nuclear power , and conservatives who are for it .
However , I find this statement by Obama to be very encouraging .
I am all for better nuclear tech , as we all but abandoned this energy production method decades ago , and we desperately need it .
The engineering exists to make it clean , safe , and efficient .
I 'd very much like to see us increasing our use of this technology .
On science education :
I recently introduced the " Enhancing Science , Technology , Engineering and Math Education Act of 2008 " that would establish a STEM Education Committee within the Office of Science and Technology Policy ( OSTP ) to coordinate the efforts of federal agencies engaged in STEM education , consolidate the STEM education initiatives that exist within the Department of Education under the direction of an Office of STEM Education , and create a State Consortium for STEM Education .
... I also recently sponsored an amendment , which became law , to the America Competes
Act that established a competitive state grant program to support summer learning opportunities with curricula that emphasize mathematics and problem solving .
I 'd love to see a multi- departmental multi-agency ( Dept. of Education , Dept. of Energy , NASA ) collaboration on STEM education .
Fermi ( what used to be GLAST ) is a collaborative effort of the Department of Energy and NASA , and while developing educational materials for it was difficult due to the bureaucracy , there is a lot of money for education in various governmental sectors .
We need to take advantage of that , so we do n't waste money developing the same things repeatedly while also being able to pool intellectual resources .
On stem cells :
I strongly support expanding research on stem cells .
I believe that the restrictions that President Bush has placed on funding of human embryonic stem cell research have handcuffed our scientists and hindered our ability to compete with other nations .
As president , I will lift the current administration ’s ban on federal funding of research on embryonic stem cell lines created after August 9 , 2001 through executive order , and I will ensure that all research on stem cells is conducted ethically and with rigorous oversight .
Awesome .
And this :
I am also aware that there have been suggestions that human stem cells of various types , derived from sources other than embryos , make the use of embryonic stem cells unnecessary .
I do n’t agree .
While adult stem cells , such as those harvested from blood or bone marrow , are already used for treatment of some diseases , they do not have the versatility of embryonic stem cells and cannot replace them .
Also awesome .
this is something the Bush Administration has been lying about since practically Day One .
Stem cells may lead a revolution in medicine , or they may just be a helpful line of inquiry , but either way we wo n't know until the draconian and illogical rules prohibiting their use are lifted .
On space : I 've reported on this before , but I do want to point this part out again :
Between 1958 and 1973 , the National Aeronautics and Space Council oversaw the entire space arena for four presidents ; the Council was briefly revived from 1989 to 1992 .
I will re-establish this Council reporting to the president .
It will oversee and coordinate civilian , military , commercial , and national security space activities .
It will solicit public participation , engage the international community , and work toward a 21st century vision of space that constantly pushes the envelope on new technologies as it pursues a balanced national portfolio that expands our reach into the heavens and improves life here on Earth .
The NASC would be another step in the process to make sure we are making the right moves about space exploration .
This is an advisory council , so it has no legal impact , but it sounds to me like Obama does tend to actually listen to expert advice ( perhaps he understands the definition of " elite " ) .
If that is indeed the case , then reinstating the NASC is an excellent idea .
And finally ,
On freedom of scientific research : I put this last , but perhaps I should put it first .
Squashing actual scientific freedom and burying , distorting , and outright lying about scientific results that go counter to ideology may very well be one of the major ways the Bush Administration will be remembered .
What does Obama say on this ?
Scientific and technological information is of growing importance to a range of issues .
I believe such information must be expert and uncolored by ideology .
I will restore the basic principle that government decisions should be based on the best - available , scientifically - valid evidence and not on the ideological predispositions of agency officials or political appointees .
Senator McCain ?

A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night to meet , and have dinner with her parents .
Since this is such a big event , the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner , she would like to go out and make love for the first time .
The boy is ecstatic , but he has never had sex before , so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms .
He tells the pharmacist it ’s his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour .
He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex .
At the register , the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he ’d like to buy , a 3 - pack , 10 - pack , or family pack .
The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy , it being his first time and all .
That night , the boy shows up at the girl ’s parents house and his girlfriend meets him at the door .
“ Oh , I ’m so excited for you to meet my parents , come on in ! ” she says .
The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl ’s parents are already seated .
The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head .
A minute passes , and the boy is still deep in prayer , with his head down .
10 minutes pass , and still no movement from the boy .
Finally , after 20 minutes with his head down , the girlfriend leans over and Whispers to the boyfriend , “ I had no idea you were this religious . ”
The boy turns , and whispers back , “ I had no idea your father was a Pharmacist . ”
When Jacqui Smith unveiled Home Office proposals to track the emails , telephone calls and text messages of every member of the public , she might have got more than she bargained for .
Thousands of civil liberties campaigners are planning to flood the Home Secretary 's inbox by copying her in on every email they send on June 15 .
Martin Allan Gray , an account manager from Dulwich , south - east London , is spearheading the campaign .
He said his intention is to send the message : " You want to see our emails ?
OK then , here they are then ! "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ms Smith announced proposals for a communications " superdatabase " , containing details of everyone 's telephone calls , emails and internet use , in December .
The Interception Modernisation Programme , which critics claim could cost up to £ 12 billion , would be managed by a private company .
A message from Mr Allan Gray , 29 , on the campaign 's Facebook page says : " This is an immense infringement of civil liberties , not to mention a major risk to our private data - but it wo n't make us any safer . "
The message calls on group members to copy every email they send and forward every one they receive to the Home Office on June 15 .
As well as the 6,790 campaign members poised to inundate the Home Office at the click of a button , Mr Allan Gray 's initiative has won the backing of Liberal Democrat MP Lynne Featherstone , Welsh Assembly member Peter Black and the Bishop of Buckinghamshire .
Ms Featherstone plugged the campaign in her blog , where she described the home secretary 's proposals as " bonkers " and said she was backing the email onslaught because " civil liberties is the Lib Dem middle name " .
Bishop Alan Smith also threw the full weight of his blog behind the cyber offensive , calling his readers to sign up and click send on June 15 .

" We can then measure how much Crime , War and International Terrorism fell that day , and , armed with that hard knowledge , we can all calculate whether this obvious erosion of our basic human rights is worth the candle , " he wrote .
The proposed database would not be intended to feature the content of communications , but only the details of internet sites visited and what emails and telephone calls have been made , to whom and at what times .
The facility is intended to assist police and security services with their investigations by giving them access to communications data which may not be available from telephone or internet providers .
Ms Smith faced a volley of criticism when she announced the plans last month .
Former director of public prosecutions Sir Ken Macdonald was the most vocal opponent , warning the database would become a " hellhouse " of personal private information .
A Home Office spokesman said : " The communications revolution has been rapid in this country and the way in which we collect communications data needs to change so that law enforcement agencies can maintain their ability to tackle serious crime and terrorism .
" To ensure that we keep up with technological advances we intend to consult widely on proposals in the New Year .
" We have been very clear that there are no plans for a database containing the content of emails , texts or conversations . "
Editor 's Note :
This is the extended version of the " Sustainable Developments " column from the January 2009 issue of Scientific American .
The global economic crisis is akin to a power blackout .
In both cases , a disturbance in one part of a complex “ tightly coupled ” system results in a cascade of failures through an entire network .
In the case of a power blackout , a single downed power line or transient overload causes power to be shunted to another part of the grid , which in turn leads to new overloads , more shunting and ultimately to a cascade of failures that pushes a region into darkness .
Similarly , in the current economic crisis , a U.S. banking emergency caused by worsening U.S. market forces has sent shock waves through the world ’s financial system , causing a global banking crisis that now threatens to lead to a global economic downturn .
Cascading failures are an emergent phenomenon of a network , rather than the independent and coincidental failures of its individual components .
Although it is true that many banks in the U.S. and Europe simultaneously overinvested in mortgage - backed securities ( MBSs ) to their peril , positive feedbacks in the global economic system amplified those errors .
Bank regulators and macroeconomic policymakers have focused too much attention on the individual nodes of the network ( that is , on each bank , and each national economy ) without proper regard for the system - wide amplification .
Four kinds of economic feedbacks are key .
The first is the “ debt - deflation spiral . ”
When default rates on mortgages started to rise last year , the banks suffered capital losses on their holdings of MBSs .
To repay their creditors ( such as the money - market funds that had lent them short - term money ) , the banks sold their MBSs en masse , driving the market prices of those securities even lower and amplifying the banking sector ’s losses .
Second , when banks suffer capital losses on bad assets such as MBSs , they cut back on lending by a multiple of their holdings of those MBSs .
That cutback further depresses housing and other prices , reducing the value of the banks ’ assets and amplifying the downturn .
Third , as one or more banks fail , panic ensues .
Banks borrow short term to invest in longer - term assets , which the banks can liquidate quickly only at large losses .
When a bank ’s short - term creditors , such as the money - market funds , suddenly believe that other short - term creditors are withdrawing their loans , each creditor rationally tries to withdraw its own loan ahead of the others .
The result is a self - fulfilling stampede to the exits , as was triggered worldwide in September 2008 by the failure of Lehman Brothers .
Such “ rational panics ” can finish off otherwise solvent banks .
Fourth , the collapse in bank lending is quickly turning into a “ main street ” calamity .
As banks cut back on their loans , consumer spending and business investment plummet , unemployment soars , and banks suffer further capital losses because more and more of their loans go sour .
The real economy goes into a tailspin .
Only aggressively expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in China , Japan , Germany and other countries with surpluses can avert that outcome in the current situation .
The U.S. recession can no longer be avoided , but it can still be moderated in the U.S. , and largely averted in East Asia , through expansionary macroeconomic policies .
The possibility of such amplifying feedbacks has been understood since the Great Depression , and some partial protections have been put in place .
The main ones include capital adequacy standards that cushion individual banks against capital losses , emergency ( lender - of - last - resort ) loans from the central bank , deposit insurance and counter - cyclical macroeconomic policies .
In practice these policies have been applied haphazardly , without regard for cross - border spillovers , and have generally been too little , too late .
Nor was there any attention to building “ firewalls ” between countries , so that shocks in one part of the system would not quickly percolate to other economies .
The global economy was being run at full throttle , without due attention to resiliency and vulnerability to shocks .
As policy makers now begin to revamp global financial and economic systems , they would be wise to consult the classic analysis of the Great Depression by economists Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in A Monetary History of the United States .
“ [ E] conomic collapse , ” they wrote , “ often has the character of a cumulative process .
Let it go beyond a certain point , and it will tend for a time to gain strength from its own development as its effects spread and return to intensify the process of collapse .
Because no great strength would be required to hold back the rock that starts a landslide , it does not follow that the landslide will not be of major proportions . ”
We will also have to remember that our risks go far beyond finance , and the fixes we need go far beyond financial policies .
The interactions of the economy and the physical environment are similarly tightly coupled .
The reckless gambles the world took on the recent financial bubble are dwarfed by the long - term gambles we have been taking by our failure to address the interconnected crises of water , energy , poverty , food , and climate change .
The financial crisis should quickly and urgently open our eyes to these much greater systemic threats and the global cooperation needed to redress them .

" i'm ready for the next chapter ' »
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President - elect Barack Obama has n't put a dollar figure yet on his promise to create an economic recovery package that he says will generate or save 2.5 million jobs over two years .
His reluctance may be with good reason : Obama is six weeks from taking office , and the potential cost of helping the economy could rise .
On Friday , the government reported that 533,000 jobs were lost in November , far more than economists had forecast .
On Thursday alone , companies across a variety of industries announced nearly 30,000 layoffs .
It 's not clear yet how bad things will be by the time Obama takes office in January .
" The picture is very fluid , and it 's changing very quickly , " said Gus Faucher , the director of macroeconomics at Moody 's Economy.com .
Congress is expected to have an economic rescue bill ready for Obama to sign on Jan. 20 .
The Bush administration so far has been unwilling to commit more money to economic stimulus , although it did recently agree to an increase in unemployment benefits .
The more conditions deteriorate , the more likely it is that economists will jack up their estimates for what 's required to put the economy back on track .
One leading economist , Economy.com founder Mark Zandi -- who was an unpaid adviser to the campaign of Republican presidential candidate John McCain -- boosted his estimate for needed stimulus to $ 600 billion from $ 400 billion in just nine days late last month .
Even with his increased estimate , " the $ 600 billion stimulus plan would not forestall a sizable decline in real GDP in 2009 , " Zandi wrote .
He believes such a plan , however , would limit job loss and help restore gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of the economy 's performance -- to its previous peak by the summer of 2010 .
A Democratic aide in the House told CNNMoney.com that at the moment it 's likely the proposed stimulus package for January will be between $ 400 billion and $ 500 billion and would include elements for infrastructure spending , green energy initiatives and tax cuts .
And if they can secure White House support , Democrats next week may try to pass an increase in food stamp benefits and in payments to states to help them fund Medicaid coverage , demand for which goes up when unemployment rises .
But as of Friday afternoon , that seemed highly unlikely .
In mid-November Larry Summers , whom Obama has named to head his National Economic Council , said estimates for needed stimulus range between $ 500 billion and $ 700 billion .
But now some are saying even that may not be enough .
Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University , for instance , said in an op-ed in the New York Times last week that the size of the stimulus package could run as high as $ 1 trillion .
Obama 's goal of creating or saving 2.5 million jobs is too modest and should be doubled , he added .
Economy.com 's
Faucher said the total cost of stimulus could come close to $ 1 trillion but not necessarily all at once .
Lawmakers might pass a $ 500 billion or $ 600 billion package in January , but in the months that follow " if something goes wrong that ups the ante , " Faucher said .
Congress might need to commit another $ 400 billion or so by June of next year if the credit markets do n't loosen up sufficiently , if the jobless rate continues to rise or if large companies like the automakers go belly up , he explained .
In the end , a serious guessing game
Not all economists are eager to put a price cap on a stimulus package .
" Be skeptical of all these numbers .
All of them are guesses .
...
They 're based on notions without foundation , that we can forecast the depth and duration of the downturn , " said Douglas Holtz - Eakin , a former Congressional Budget Office director who served as McCain 's top economic adviser during the campaign .
The risk of making the wrong assumptions about the scope of the downturn is that Congress commits too much or too little money to deal with it , or disburses the money at the wrong time in the economic cycle .
This week , the National Bureau of Economic Research formally concluded that the United States has been in recession since December 2007 .
Not long ago , many economists believed the recession would end by June 2009 .
Now most view that time frame as a best case scenario .
Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research , describes himself as the " most optimistic guy on Wall Street . "
Three weeks ago he told CNNMoney.com he saw gloom , but not doom , in the economy .
Now he 's not so sure .
Yamarone has changed his outlook in the past two weeks because of business data and sentiment surveys , as well as his conversations with C - suite executives across the country .
" We 've gone from a yellow flag warning to a gale 5 hurricane warning , " Yamarone said .
" We 're talking about a drowning economy . "
Without a sufficiently big stimulus package , he noted , " there 's no catalyst for this to change . "
That said , he 's still reasonably optimistic that the economy might start to turn around next summer if Congress passes a stimulus package in the neighborhood of $ 700 billion and if the infrastructure projects funded by that package and intended to create jobs are up and running within 30 to 90 days from the time the package is approved .
Any longer and he said he 'll have to rethink his forecast .
At this point , it 's all about jobs and fostering conditions to create them , Yamarone said .
" The government has to bail out its citizens .
This situation gets more grave by the day . "
Person Tracking with Stereo Range Sensors Principal Investigators : Neal Checka David Demirdjian
The Problem :
The goal of this project is to design and build a multi-person tracking system using a network of stereo cameras .
Our system , which stands in an ordinary conference room is able to track people , estimate their trajectories as well as different characteristics ( e.g. size , posture ) .
Motivation : Systems which can track and understand people have a wide variety of commercial applications .
It is predicted that computers of the future will interact more naturally with humans than they do now .
Instead of the desktop computer paradigm with humans communicating by typing , computers of the future will be able to understand human speech and movements .
Our system demonstrates the capabilities of a solely vision - based system for these ends .
Our Approach :
We have developed a system that can perform dense , fast range - based tracking with modest computational complexity .
We apply ordered disparity search techniques to prune most of the disparity search computation during foreground detection and disparity estimation , yielding a fast , illumination - insensitive 3D tracking system .
When tracking people , we have found that rendering an orthographic vertical projection of detected foreground pixels is a useful model .
A ” plan view ” image facilitates correspondence in time since only 2D search is required .
Previous systems would segment foreground data into regions prior to projecting into a plan- view , followed by region - level tracking and integration , potentially leading tosub - optimal segmentation and / or object fragmentation .
Instead , we develop a technique that altogether avoids any early segmentation of foreground data .
We merge the plan - view images from each view and estimate over time a set of trajectories that best represents the integrated foreground density .
The figure on the left shows three people are standing in a room , though not all are visible to each camera .
Foreground points are projected onto a ground plane .
Ground plane points from all cameras are then superimposed into a single data set before clustering the points to find person locations .

The new Secretary of Energy , Steven Chu , addressed the national labs in an all - hands video transmission today .
I was not there , but my colleague and friend Rob Roser at Fermilab was there , and sent me a very nice bulleted summary .
So , you are getting this second hand , and people who were there can add nuances in the comments , but here goes :
Energy is the defining issue of our time .
Addressing the environment is the major reason Chu took on this job .
These problems provide a tremendous opportunity for the DOE , but it comes with a burden : we can not fail .
The DOE is the principal supporter of physical sciences in the US , and the physical sciences are the conernstone of prosperity for the US future .
This was part of the message of the " Rising Above the Gathering Storm " report .
The DOE should endeavor to replace the great industrial labs that no longer exist as they once did .
The DOE will be the " go to " organization for a multitude of key problems -- will depend on all labs to help .
The DOE can quite literally " save the world " by developing a sound energy policy going forward , and invent new science that will provide new technologies .
Our current use of energy not sustainable -- have to move forward .
We are facing something society has never been asked to do before : to deal with ominous problems with climate change .
If half of the things climate science tells us are half true , we have a huge problem on our hands and the DOE has to work to provide those solutions .
The Obama administration is creating a new Energy and Climate Change Council which will serve as a coordinating body including all stake holders in this arena .
DOE is first and formost in this but Interior , Agriculture , Treasury and Defense etc. all play a role .
The DOE is the science and technology " arm of energy " .
There is a core of truly oustanding scientists at the national labs , and these labs have trained many successful scientists .
The national labs are " crown jewels that the US does n't want to lose " .
Restimulation of the economy is # 1 on the priority list .
DOE will get considerable funds in the stimulus package , not just to get the economy going but to provide a long term path for the US .
We can't be completely overwhelmed by the short term economic woes ; we need to still find a path to solve our long term problems .
The DOE has to invent transformative technologies that will allow us to get to the next level of energy independence .
Chu sees a lot of young and middle age scientists shifting careers to deal with energy , and the DOE is optimistic to capture the best and brightest to work on these issues .
I am truly awed by the vision presented by Chu here , and so hopeful that we can get our country back on a path to long term prosperity by supporting research in the physical sciences .
At least half of our present economy relies on the knowledge gained in the 20th century about our physical world ... one can only imagine the revolutions to come .
Expect the Worst Recession Since WWII
This week we look at a short but excellent summary of the state of the current economic crisis .
I always enjoy reading David Rosenberg , the North American economist of Merrill Lynch .
He has a no - nonsense style that is refreshing from most mainstream economists .
The reality is that things continue to deteriorate .
Today 's stock market action shows that we are not of the bear market woods just yet .
Rosenberg gives us a few reasons why .

The Six Lessons from Last Week's Action
By David Rosenberg , North American Economist , Merrill Lynch
1 ) Expect the worst recession in the post - WWII era
First , this is going to be the worst recession in the post - World War II era , in our view .
The ECRI leading indicator hit a record low for the fifth week in a row – down to - 29.2 as of the November 21st week versus - 28.2 the week before .
This index , which leads real GDP by two quarters with a 70 % historical correlation , is getting further and further away from the prior all - time low of - 19.8 that defined the worst recession of the post - WWII era and saw a six - quarter consumer recession coincide with a 45 % peak - to - trough decline in the stock market .
Perhaps the fact that this bear market is proving to be even more severe is symptomatic of an economic downturn that will also prove to be deeper and more prolonged .
After the flurry of data released just before Thanksgiving , we are now tracking close to a 4.5 % QoQ annualized fall in real GDP in 4Q .
This would be the largest pullback since the 1982 recession , and we see a similar contraction in the first quarter of 2009 .
2 ) Capex is in a steep decline
Second , capex is in a very steep decline right now .
Durable goods orders dropped 6.2 % in October , the third decline in a row .
Over that time frame , orders have plunged at a 39 % annual rate , which is unprecedented .
The retrenchment has spread to the tech sector , where order books were expanding at a 7 % annualized rate over the three months to June .
Currently , that same three - month trend has swung to a negative 13 % annualized rate .
3 ) Consumer spending down sharply ; savings rate is soaring
Third , consumer spending fell 1 % in October , which was a near - record decline .
This , in fact , was the fourth straight monthly decline , which is unprecedented .
The savings rate is soaring ; it leapt to 2.4 % from 1.0 % in September , in a sign of heightened risk aversion and cash preservation , and is a shift that we believe should be seen as secular , not merely cyclical .
This was a conclusion that came through loud and clear in the Conference Board 's Consumer Confidence Index , principally in the spending intention components of the survey .
Auto buying plans dropped for the third month in a row to a record low in October while home - buying plans fell to their lowest level since the 1982 recession .
Consumer plans to buy a major appliance fell to a 14 - year low as well – down for three months in a row .
During this four - month period of unprecedented consumer retrenchment from July to October , spending on discretionary items collapsed at an average annual rate of 18 % .
Even spending on groceries has declined 6 % , toiletries are off by 6 % and utilities are down 3 % .
So , even some of the classic staples are being curtailed .
The only areas that have posted increases in spending over this unprecedented four - month decline in spending have been pharmaceuticals ( +7 % ) , telecom services ( +3 % ) , medical care services ( +5 % ) and mass transit ( + 26 % ) – all other forms of transportation , from rail to bus to air fell at a 19 % annual rate .
4 ) Obama planning a $ 700 billion fiscal package
Fourth , we learned this week that President - elect Obama 's economics team is planning a fiscal package as big as $ 700 billion over the next two years .
We are going to wait for the details to see how this is going to impact our base case macro forecast .
Suffice it to say that the cornerstone of the stimulus this time around will likely be infrastructure , not tax rebates .
The key for investors is where these outlays will be concentrated , which , in turn , means identifying the areas of the capital stock that have been the most underinvested in recent years .
After sifting through the data , we believe that the prime candidates will be hospitals , waste management services and passenger transit .
5 ) Housing market is not close to bottoming out
Fifth , we learned that the housing market is nowhere close to bottoming out .
New home sales dropped 5.3 % in November to a 433 k annualized rate – the worst since the 1982 recession .
Even though sales are now down 69 % from the July 2005 bubble peak of 1.39 million units , we believe builders have not been aggressive enough in curbing production because the most critical variable of all , the unsold inventory backlog , rose to 11.1 months ' supply from 10.9 in September .
Need to see inventory backlog drop to 8 months ' supply
The reality is that even though single - family starts have dropped to 26 - year lows of 531,000 , they are still running 23 % above the prevailing level of new home sales .
The worst the inventory - sales ratio ever got in the early 1990s real estate meltdown was 9.4 months ' supply .
We are currently 18 % above that level and almost 40 % higher than the 8 months ' supply we would need to see before calling an end to the housing deflation phase .
Another 15 - 20 % decline in home prices likely from here
As we saw last week , the Case - Shiller index fell 1.85 % MoM or at a 20 % annual rate .
All 20 cities were down both sequentially and YoY .
Home prices are now down a remarkable 22 % from the 2007 peaks .
With the unsold inventory sitting at the third highest level of the past three decades and mortgage approvals for new home purchases falling to their lowest level in nine years , we believe the laws of supply and demand point to a further 15 - 20 % decline from here .
So , of all the things that happened last week in the market , retailing stocks up 17 % , the bank stocks up 26 % , tech up 9 % , the one development that probably has the greatest chance of being reversed is the 60 % surge we saw in the homebuilding group .
6 ) Fed has switched December meeting to a two - day affair
Sixth , we learned that the Fed is going to make the December FOMC meeting a two - day affair instead of one ( December 15 - 16 ) .
The market is already sniffing out a 50 basis point rate cut .
However , now that the Fed has de facto embarked on the process of quantitative easing , perhaps the need for a two day meeting is to iron out a more aggressive plan to revive the credit markets and the economy .
The only areas that have posted increases in spending over this unprecedented four - month decline in spending have been pharmaceuticals ( +7 % ) , telecom services ( +3 % ) , medical care services ( +5 % ) and mass transit ( + 26 % ) – all other forms of transportation , from rail to bus to air fell at a 19 % annual rate .
As Chairman Bernanke suggested in several speeches he gave back in 2002 and 2003 , one of the deflation - fighting strategies would likely involve Fed action to nurture lower rates at the longer end of the yield curve .
Perhaps this prospect is behind the rally in the 10 - year note yield and long bond to cycle lows .
This would fit in very well with our ongoing strategy of focusing on equity sectors that have income - generating characteristics like utilities , health care and telecom services ; these sectors also screen very well in a negative nominal GDP growth environment .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Three New York City police officers pleaded innocent on Tuesday to charges one of them sodomized a man with a police baton on a subway platform and two others helped cover up the crime .
Detective Richard Kern , 25 , was charged with aggravated sexual assault , which is punishable by up to 25 years in prison , and other charges .
Andrew Morales and Alex Cruz , both 26 , are charged with participating in the attempted cover up , which included writing a summons for the victim following the assault .
If convicted , each faces up to four years in prison .
“ I ’m pleased but it still has n’t changed what happened to me , ” the victim , Michael Mineo , 24 , told reporters after the arraignment .
“ I still have abdominal pain , rectal pain . ”
His lawyer , Kevin Mosley said , “ It was , for all intents and purposes , rape . ”
According to prosecutor Charles Guria , Kern and Morales observed Mineo , who works at a tattoo parlor , smoking a marijuana cigarette as they sat in an unmarked police car in the early afternoon on October 15 near Brooklyn ’s Prospect Park .
Cruz and another officer arrived to provide backup and Kern and Cruz followed Mineo into a nearby subway station , Guria said in court .
“ Several officers held Mineo down and rear handcuffed him , and Kern anally assaulted him with a retractable baton , ” the prosecutors office said in a statement .
Speaking to reporters after the arraignment , Kern ’s lawyer , John Patten , said he had not yet reviewed the prosecution ’s evidence but called Kern a “ decent young man ” who is married with two young children .
“ Money ’s driving this case and they ’re looking for a payday , ” Patten said of Mineo and his lawyers .
Kern was released on $ 15,000 in bail and a $ 15,000 bond .
Morales and Cruz were released on their own recognizance .
The incident has sparked charges of police brutality and recalls the case of Abner Louima , a Haitian immigrant who was attacked with a broomstick in a Brooklyn police station in 1997 .
In the Louima case , one New York City police officer was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in the attack , and a second officer was given a five - year prison sentence for perjury .
A heartbreaking story in The Times this month underlines the sheer , unprecedentedly ideological cruelty of the 20th century – and the lasting traumas it left behind , like so many time bombs :
Find General Francisco Franco ’s stolen children of the Spanish Civil War , says court
She was 54 when she first got to know her mother , but Antonia Radas was one of the luckier ones .
Taken away when her mother , Carmen , was imprisoned after the Spanish Civil War for her father ’s Republican links , Mrs Radas ’s adoptive parents lied to her , telling her that she had been abandoned , and changed her name to stop relatives tracing her .
Mother and child were finally reunited in 1993 , 18 months before Carmen died .
Now 71 , Mrs Radas is among an estimated 30,000 children who were separated from their parents on the orders of General Francisco Franco .
Many of them never knew who their real parents were .
Their cause was taken up by Judge Baltasar Garzón , the man who went after Pinochet and officers from the Argentinian junta :
Garzón [..] has claimed that Franco and 34 henchmen were guilty of the systematic killing or disappearance of at least 114,000 people during and after the civil war .
Among the victims were children of Republicans who were adopted by Franco sympathisers to prevent them coming under the influence of Marxism .
Others , whose families fled abroad , were lured back to Spain under false pretences .
“ Child refugees were also kidnapped in France by the repatriation service of the regime and put in state institutions , ” Judge Garzón wrote . [..]
Julián Casanova , a historian , claims that the aim was to “ reCatholicise ” the children of “ Reds ” .
He said : “ The Church was responsible for the theft of these children , from Red families .
It wanted to purify them . ”
The stories are all the more tragic because it ’s too late now , for all but a few victims .
The children who were robbed from ( and of ) their parents are in their old age .
Their parents will almost certainly be dead , so there is no prospect of a cathartic reunion .
Moreover , Garzón last November had to relinquish “ what had promised to be the first criminal investigation of wrongs committed by Franco and his allies ” .
He was forced by state prosecutors to concede jurisdiction to regional courts , “ who now have the authority to decide whether or not to take up these controversial cases ” .
He also had pass the responsibility “ for opening 19 mass graves believed to hold the remains of hundreds of victims ” to regional courts .
Xenu Ablana , 80 , holds little faith in the proceedings .
“ The courts are still run by Francoists .
These people have a lot of influence , ” he said .
His story is one of the heartbreaking ones :
[ Ablana ] was sent to a centre run by Franco ’s Social Aid charity for children of Republicans , where he was taught allegiance to the Falange , the party allied to Franco .
“ I know all the Falangist hymns , all the prayers of the Church .
They brain - washed me against my father [.. ] , ” Mr Ablana told The Times .
“ I never had any toys , never knew anything about girls until I escaped .
I was robbed of my childhood .
I am still looking for my childhood now . ” [..]
Or there ’s Emilia Girón , “ the wife of a leftwing guerrilla fighter [ who ] searched fruitlessly for her son , Jesús , who was taken from her in prison ” :
She died last year aged 96 .
In an interview with Spanish documentary - makers before her death , she said : “ I know I gave birth to him .
They took him to be baptised but they never brought him back .
I never saw him again . ”
This is the tragedy of dictatorships that were allowed to fester on for fourty years .
Even if they mellowed out over time , their enduring grip on power de facto buried any opportunity to uncover the crimes of their early days and come to terms with them .
It took long before anyone dared to dig into the records and stories of totalitarian crime , too long , as the generation who consciously lived through the Civil War died off .
Franco ’s rule eventually gave way to democracy in 1975 , but the first years of democracy were still fraught with danger , highlighted by the 1981 coup attempt .
Focused on integrating Spain into the EU and modernising its provincial economy , the socialists of Felipe Gonzalez mostly shied away from digging into the past for the next thirteen years .
You ca n’t really blame them ; as Georgina Blakely put it in a paper for Entelequia , their choice “ reflected what was possible given the “ political opportunity structure ” in place at the time ” .
But then the conservatives came into power and actively resisted an emerging groundswell of attempts to scrutinize Franco ’s rule .
It was n’t until 2002 that a parliamentary body officially condemned Francoism .
By that time , there was “ a veritable explosion within civil society of books , exhibitions , television documentaries and radio programmes ” to air “ what had until then been private memories of the Civil War period and the subsequent Francoist dictatorship ” , as Blakely put it .
But the conservative government party resisted moves to remove statues from the Franco era .
Only since the socialists returned to government in 2004 has the pace of ‘ Vergangenheitsbewältigung ’ picked up officially as well – not least because the socialists needed to secure the support of the far left and the Basque and Catalan parties to govern .
Even then , while an “ Interministerial Commission for the Study of the Situation of the Victims of the Civil War and Francoism ” was established in October that year , it took almost two years before the government first approved a “ Law of Historical Memory ” .
Political parties responded with 377 amendments , and it was a full three years after the Commission had been established , in October 2007 , that the parliament approved it – over strident objections from the conservative opposition .
The sheer apprehension with which the government had approached the issue is clear from the tentative language of the first draft , which was stocked with euphemisms like “ the conflict between Spaniards ” to describe the Civil War and “ the two factions ” to describe the Republican government and Franco ’s putschists .
It was only under pressure from the far left and autonomist parties that most phrases suggesting such an equivalence were scrubbed from the final text .
The law imposes a variety of tasks on the government , including , for example , producing a map of all of the mass graves from the civil war and the Franco dictatorship , and drawing up work plans to ensure that they are opened .
The final text also declares any sentence handed out by Francos courts for political , ideological or religious reasons “ illegitimate ” .
In theory this opens the way for individuals or groups to at long last have the prison or death sentences of their ( grand ) parents annulled .
But in practice Xenu Ablana ’s fears are justified .
Many in the court system still refuse to recognize the illegality of Franco ’s rule , and the Supreme Court rebuffed several attempts to annul Franco - era death sentences which evoked the parliament ’s 2002 condemnation of Franco ’s regime .
It is in this context we should see Garzon ’s fight to force the issue through , and the rap on the knuckles he received from within the judicial system .
Even just having the mass graves uncovered is a long struggle .
The post - war experience of Germany showed that it takes a generation before a society is ready to raise and investigate its own misdeeds – and then arguably only if it is enjoying a stable enough prosperity to allow people to do more than focus on surviving .
The famously critical German introspection only emerged in the sixties .
The Spanish example suggests a similar timeline .
In the immediate aftermath of the dictatorship ’s demise , society focuses on reconstruction and agrees on what Blakely calls “ public silence ” and “ apparent ” forgetting .
Only after the first two decades of democracy does the lid get lifted on the dirty past .
Blakely cites a 2006 poll in which 53 % of the Spanish agreed that “ the victims of the Civil War had been forgotten and that it was now time to put right this injustice ” .
But the Germans had the time .
Parents and contemporary authorities were still alive in the sixties , they could be questioned , confronted .
But a twenty - year - old combatant of the Spanish Civil War would be over 90 now ; anyone in a higher position is long gone .
In an odd kind of mirroring , with the ideological roles reversed , the same is true for the efforts that were kickstarted in the 1990s and continue even now in Eastern Europe to deal with the communist past .
While there was a torrent of research and debate , the actual secret service archives were often only opened partially , or merely leaked from strategically to discredit political opponents .
In some states of the former Soviet Union , the whole process of uncovering the regime ’s crimes was buried again before it even got properly started .
This was even as survivors of the Stalinist terror were dying off , and now , another ten to twenty years on , we are rapidly losing even veterans of the 1956 and 1968 uprisings .
When in 1972 , Hans Magnus Enzensberger compiled The Short Summer of Anarchy : Life and Death of Buenaventura Durruti , his fascinating puzzle of personal testimonies and contemporary sources , he could still interview those who had taken part , but he had no access to the wealth of archive material in Spain .
Now that it will be finally forced open in full , the documents can no longer be corroborated or explained by survivors .
The puzzle is broken , the continuity disrupted ; even if some agent or other could still be found , the kidnappers of those children basically got away with it – and to some extent at least achieved their goal .
You can only imagine the bitterness this must have left in families that consciously continue their grandparents ’ erstwhile Republican , anarchist or socialist traditions .
January has been an exciting month , what with all the many changes taking place around us .
As the month draws to a close , however , there ’s a certain feeling of winter doldrums setting in , particularly for those of us being pummeled by harsh weather again and again .
Never fear !
The economy may be a wreck and the temperatures polar , but there has been an extraordinary amount of good news of late for our favorite operating system .
We here at LinuxInsider are here to bring it to light — banish those below - zero blues and think freedom instead !
A Steven J. Vaughan - Nichols post on the Computerworld blogs , for example , concludes that “ Being Anti-Linux Is Bad for Your Business ’ Health . ”
‘ It ’s Going to Come Back to Bite You ’
Microsoft is stumbling , Vaughan - Nichols asserts , noting not only the biggest layoffs in the company ’s history but also that its stock price has dropped to about half of what it was last year at this time .
Red Hat and Novell , meanwhile , are thriving on their Linux businesses .
More than 1,000 Diggs and 200 comments greeted that tasty bit of news !
“ Well when you charge hundreds of dollars for your operating system , in times like this , it ’s going to come back to bite you , ” wrote 3242130193 , for example .
‘ That Is Really the Lesson ’
Then there was the LinuxDevices interview with Linux Foundation Director Jim Zemlin about Linux ’s role in Microsoft ’s misfortunes .
Companies “ have learned that they can participate in the higher - value , higher - margin choice Linux offers , both in embedded and on the enterprise side , ” Zemlin told LinuxDevices .
“ They can offer their own branded software platform based on Linux , gaining a more direct relationship to the consumer . …
If Microsoft is getting 75 percent margins , you would like some of that high - margin business .
That is really the lesson . ”
Slashdot bloggers made more than 500 comments on * that * cheerful lesson .
FUD in Redmond
There was also news that left a hint of egg on some Redmond faces .
Specifically , citing a confidential memo from Microsoft that was used as evidence in antitrust proceedings , an article on Boycott Novell charged that a Microsoft “ task force ” lobbied Wal - Mart to drop GNU / Linux from its shelves .
So * that ’s* what happened !
More than 1,400 Diggs and 300 comments greeted that one on Digg , even as bloggers also pondered a post from CNet ’s Matt Asay titled “ Facts Behind Microsoft ’s Anti-Linux Campaign . ”
Nothing like a chilling blast of fresh scrutiny to take the wind out of a software behemoth ’s sails !
Canonical ’s Millions
Perhaps most intriguing of all , however , was the recent New York Times article in which Canonical ‘s Mark Shuttleworth said his company ’s annual revenue is approaching US $ 30 million — the figure he says it needs to be self - sustaining .
That happy fact was picked up on Digg , OStatic and Slashdot , where more than 600 comments followed when bloggers pondered the question , “ should Microsoft worry ? ”
Indeed , good question !
LinuxInsider could n’t resist taking a small poll of our own .
‘ A Scary and Abusive Relationship ’
“ Canonical has a long way to go before it threatens MS Windows , but in order to delay people from switching , Microsoft will need to drop their prices for the full version , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack told LinuxInsider .
“ That , in turn , will limit Microsoft ’s ability to pump money into unprofitable projects .
So in a way , it ’s more of a threat to MSN , XBOX , etc . ”
A milestone based on a market cap is “ a totally erroneous concept , ” Slashdot blogger drinkypoo asserted .
“ The market functions not on the basis of reality , but on the perception of reality . ”
Microsoft has been “ completely overvalued for a long time because their main asset is customer relationships , but it ’s a scary and abusive relationship and everyone who knows there ’s something better out there would like desperately to leave , if only they knew how , ” drinkypoo told LinuxInsider .
“ It ’s a sort of battered customer syndrome …
‘ But of course Microsoft has my best interests in mind ! ' ”
‘ Microsoft Is Tripping Over Its Own Feet ’
The simple truth is that “ only Microsoft is a real threat to Microsoft , ” drinkypoo added .
“ They have tampered with all their areas of core competency , at least in business . ”
Office ’s interface , for example , “ has been changed so much that only the file format lock - in is a viable argument for that product any more , ” he said .
“ Windows has been bloated beyond all belief and Windows 7 seems to allay that issue mostly by coming out at a time when the machines can actually support it . ”
Gaming , “ an area in which Microsoft has traditionally been strong , has been hampered by the Vista - only nature of DX10 and the generally slow uptake of Vista , ” he said .
“ The Xbox 360 was rushed and has some of the worst reliability ratings of any game console ever . ”
In short , “ Microsoft is tripping over its own feet in basically every area , ” drinkypoo said .
“ Linux is harming Microsoft , but not really responsible for any fast decline . ”
‘ The Gathering Storm ’
Should Microsoft worry ?
“ Probably not , but the gathering storm for Microsoft is about more than Ubuntu , Linux and Open Source , ” Slashdot blogger yagu told LinuxInsider .
“ It ’s about a company that has sown so much bad will that the gathering storm may become Microsoft ’s Perfect Storm , where because people need to save money , budgets , jobs and their sanity , they continue to peel off and look at fresh alternatives . ”
Alternatives are many , yagu asserted , “ and Ubuntu demonstrates that well .
So does Apple .
So does a Blackberry Storm , which could replace lots of users ’ computer needs entirely ! ”
So the $ 30 million is “ chump change to Microsoft — they could n’t care less about that radar blip , ” yagu concluded .
“ But that blip becomes a couple of blips , and coalesces into the Perfect Storm .
That ’s what scares Microsoft , and thankfully , that ’s what Microsoft is n’t prepared to handle !
Hey , we can dream … . ”
The Genie ’s Out of the Bottle
Similarly : “ Canonical is still only a blip on the radar for M$ , ” blogger Robert Pogson told LinuxInsider .
“ What worries M$ is GNU / Linux in general , which is much larger than just Canonical . ”
Millions of GNU / Linux netbooks were sold last year “ without much help from Canonical , ” Pogson pointed out .
“ Many millions of desktops and notebooks are out there with GNU / Linux in production , being used and being seen by many .
M$ has no way to put that exposure back in the bottle . ”
There are about 100 million users of GNU / Linux on the desktop today , he added .
As the economy staggers , “ M$ is afraid that number will become several hundred million in a few years .
The monopoly is ended , but they desperately need to preserve the cash flow as long as possible . ”
‘ Another Lead Balloon ’
To maintain its own mind share , Microsoft is licensing XP cheaply for netbooks and giving product licenses away for educational and governmental projects , Pogson charged .
“ To do any more they would have to pay bribes , and still GNU / Linux advances . ”
Windows 7 , meanwhile , will be “ another lead balloon , offering nothing of value to hundreds of millions of XP users , so M$ ’s revenue stream from the client OS will dry up , ” he predicted .
“ A tiny quarter of 2008 caused them to announce layoffs , ” Pogson concluded .
“ What will 2009 bring ?
It will be interesting to watch a dinosaur try to adapt to change . ”
Trouble Ahead for Canonical ?
And what of Canonical , we could n’t help but ask ?
“ It ’s worth mentioning that the nerdcore is starting to leave Ubuntu , ” drinkypoo warned .
“ I noticed because I had done it , and then started commenting about it , and finding that many others were finding the overall quality to have gone downhill .
“ If Ubuntu does n’t start trimming the sails and stop breaking drivers in every release , ” he concluded , “ they ’re going to have real problems . ”
Following are excerpts from an address delivered by Egyptian cleric Hassan Abu Al - Ashbal , which aired on Al - Nas TV on November 27 , 2008 .
Hassan Abu Al - Ashbal :
Let me take this opportunity to address the leader of Europe , and the leader of America , who is the leader of the world , the recently - elected Obama , who is the leader of the Byzantines – he is like the Byzantine leaders in the days of Prophet Muhammad .
My message to him is three - fold .
First , I invite him to convert to Islam .
This is the call of the Prophet and of Allah .
Oh Obama – convert to Islam , and you will be saved .
I hope that Allah will reward you twice :
Once for converting to Islam , and another reward for all those who will convert in your footsteps .
If you want glory – you will find it in Islam .
If you want honor – you will find it in Islam .
In religions other than Islam there is utter humiliation , even if you are the president of the entire world .
[...]
You , Obama , are among those who have pledged before Allah – Allah who created you , sustained you , and brought you to this position – to be a Muslim who believes that Allah is the one God , especially since you have some kind of roots in Islam .
Convert to Islam , and you will be saved .
All glory and honor lie in following Allah and His messenger Muhammad .
Know that the true religion is the religion of Islam , and all other religions are fabricated religions , which are null and void – religions that were abrogated by the shari ’a of Muhammad .
If you refuse to return to your [ Islamic ] origins , to the way Allah created you , withdraw your huge armies and military bases from the lands of the Muslims .
Know that all your predecessors have ended up in the garbage bin of history , and that America ’s black and bleak history in the land of the Muslims and the Arabs constitutes an evil omen for you , your predecessors , and your successors .
Know , Obama , that America , with all its size and might , will know no peace , as long as a single Muslim child lacks food , drink , medicine , or housing .
If you refuse , Obama , and insist on remaining in Muslim lands , know that Allah still plants in [ Muslims ] obedience to Him , and they are willing to wait for Paradise , which is closer than their own shoelaces .
Know , Obama , that in the lands of Islam , there are people who seek death , and are eager for it , even more than you and your people are eager for life – any kind of life , even a life of humiliation .
When Arnold Schwarzenegger ran for governor in 2003 , his supporters touted his independence , outsider status , and inspiring life story as the quintessential American dream .
His detractors mocked his inexperience , but he indeed stood as a great example of what was possible in America .
This immigrant worked tirelessly and rose to the top in the private sector as a giant on the silver screen .
He entertained millions , created vast amounts of wealth , and even used his fame to educate the public about the importance of personal health and , in a twist for Hollywood , market economics and individual freedom .
Oh , how the mighty fall .
The governor is struggling , once again , to negotiate a budget .
He seemingly becomes embroiled every year in these protracted showdowns , resulting not in responsible budgets but burgeoning deficits and growing bureaucracies .
He tries to hold the line , threatening to veto the Democrats ’ plan , but it is stunning how far that line has shifted .
He began promising a dose of economic conservatism after the fiscally reckless and profligate years of Gray Davis .
Instead , he has overseen the state budget climb by 39 % since he took office .
Arnold always had a soft spot for spending programs , vowing five years ago to produce a massive bond package to finance the school system .
Since then he has saddled us with several large bonds and many billions in new spending projects .
So now he is fighting over relative trivialities , while accepting in principle California ’s leviathan government and new tax increases .
This marks a sad time for the state but also a personal tragedy .
Schwarzenegger had an amazing career as an entertainer .
The governorship has only diverted his invaluable time toward intractable political disputes and symbolic battles over nothing .
We are no better off than we were under Davis , and meanwhile the private sector has lost a talented and socially conscious actor .
The only solution to the state ’s ills is libertarian reform .
The government should shut down prisons and free nonviolent offenders such as drug convicts .
It should liquidate its many billions in unneeded assets .
It should close down entire agencies and leave their functions to the market .
This would truly stimulate the economy .
But these measures would be too much for a governor to do , even if he wanted , without strong public support .
With almost 40 million residents , America ’s most populous state is especially difficult to tame .
Perhaps there can never be a semi-functional political system as long as the state is so big , larger than most nations .
In any event , genuine , sustaining reform requires a revolution in public opinion first .
Republicans often say we need a successful businessman , small - town leader , or citizen whose accomplishments are outside politics to shake things up in Washington or the state capitals .
But those who work in the market labor under a totally different system , set of incentives , and institutional dynamic .
The government ’s defining character renders it immune to fundamental reform by outsiders .
Unlike the market , government finances itself through coerced taxation , not honestly earned profits .
It maintains dominance through the threat of violence — police and imprisonment — not through voluntary exchange .
Government power corrupts and cannot be purged of its intrinsically coercive and political nature .
Outsiders cannot stay outsiders long once inside the halls of power .
Like Ronald Reagan before him , Schwarzenegger was the Hollywood rogue conservative who would finally produce fiscal restraint and meaningful reform .
But also like Reagan , he has overseen a staggering growth in government while confusing the dialogue and giving free enterprise a bad name .
Markets are free insofar as they are left alone by the state .
An alleged free marketer wielding and exercising considerable government power ceases to be a true friend of the free market .
Some of his films have not been the highest of art , but even Schwarzenegger ’s flops were great achievements compared to what he has done as governor , or what we can expect anyone like him to do in his place .
If he wants to contribute to society , he should resign , leave the dismal world of politics to the corrupt and power - hungry , and return to the private sector where he can once again make a difference .
There might still be time for him to do a cameo in the fourth Terminator film .
These days US Treasuries can do no wrong .
No matter how much interest dips , they 're just the hottest thing in town .
The bird in the hand theory of finance , I suppose .
But is this bird really in hand , and for how long ?
One would think that the bond market has already factored in the upcoming big - spending stimuli planned by a number of G20 players ; but , even though the printing presses have already begun their magic in earnest , the amounts that have already been distributed have yet to have an impact on the economic outlook .
Recession and deflation seem to be what are on everyone 's mind .
But for how long ?
We know that markets are fickle .
And supple .
They can turn on a dime .
Thanks to Tfdclowns.com for this picture of Huffy turning on dime . ]
Once the presses get churning at billions a minute , and whether or not deflationary pricing stops , what will the markets do ?
Could they turn this bond boom into another burst bubble ?
The world has been awash in credit and in the chimera of purchasing power the sheer mass of it seemed to engender .
It flowed into the real estate bubble until 2006 , then to the stock market bubble in 2007 , then to commodities in 2008 .
Each one came rushing down like something at Magic Mountain , only to see the remaining cash hop on again for another loop with bonds .
Government bonds are the last safe haven before ... there 's only one thing left after government bonds : Gold .
But that would mean a flight from paper currencies altogether .
Are we that far gone ?
We 'll soon find out .
Foreign bonds will have a tremendous amount of competition soon , once the US and other debtor nations begin to borrow to the max .
Cash may still flow into these government bonds for a while , but as stated in this editorial in Friday 's Financial Times , " finance ministers must make plain how they intend to keep paying creditors without resorting to debasing their currencies .
Those who have not already credibly done so are living on borrowed time .
" And just which have done so in a credible fashion ?
I 'm hard - pressed to name one .
So I 'm betting that gold will be our next , and perhaps last , bubble , at least for this time around .
( Disclosure : Yes , I do own some gold - related assets .
I 'd be a hypocrite if I did n't . )
In case you have n't seen my mantra , I 'll repeat it for you :
" You can take the gold out of the standard , but you can't take the standard out of gold . "

The US government 's emergency rescue of Citigroup offers a new model for bank bail - outs : explicitly insuring against losses on toxic assets , with taxpayers footing the bill .
The Citigroup plan extends the federal commitment beyond the previous framework of capital injections from the Treasury and credit from the Federal Reserve .
Now , the US is a partner in the performance of $ US306 billion ( $ 500 billion ) in real - estate loans and securities , sharing losses beyond $ US29 billion on what are likely to be some of Citigroups worst holdings .
" Everybody and his brother has got to have their hand out now , '' said Eric Hovde , chief investment officer at Hovde Capital Advisors .
" The whole problem is so much bigger and deeper than the Fed and Treasury ever understood . ''
Taxpayers are likely to be at greater risk from the new template , which may be used to help more companies as debt writedowns continue to climb , analysts said .
I guess Bill O'Reilly decided he'd had enough of being just a demagogue last night and made the leap into his new persona as an unmistakably dangerous demagogue .
His Talking Points
Memo segment is almost always amusing for its incoherence , but this time it was just inchoate : an attack on the Barack Obama 's selection of Leon Panetta as CIA chief , ostensibly because of Panetta 's lack of experience .
The argument , as well as we could make it out , was that Obama is making the U.S. vulnerable to terror because he has chosen a CIA chief who wants us not to torture terror suspects .
Most of the early part of the rant is a regurgitation of O'Reilly 's recent warnings that the " far left " wants to hijack Obama 's presidency and that his approach to torture is reflective of that .
Then he pulls a clip from his radio show earlier in the day , in which he interviewed Michael Scheuer , who 's lately been absorbed by the Ron Paulians .
Scheuer says this :
Michael Scheuer : I think that the only way to change policy is , sadly , another attack on the United States , and I think that 's coming .
O'Reilly :
Are you going to predict that ?
Scheuer : Oh , I think so , sir .
I think that within the next year we 'll be attacked again .
The opportunity is just too good a one .
Um , taking down a lot of the rendition program and that kind of stuff makes things easier for the enemy --
And then O'Reilly launches into a classic naming - the - enemy rant -- the enemy , evidently , being embodied in l'il ole Baghdad By The Bay :
O'Reilly : But some Americans do n't care .
In fact , some Americans are even are supporting the enemy .
In San Francisco , Ground Zero for anti-American displays , supporters of Hamas openly demonstrate against Israel and the USA .
These people believe America is evil .
And so do many in the media .
Bottom line on this , Barack Obama is taking a major risk by handcuffing U.S. intelligence in its vital task of disrupting and defeating terror .
If we get hit , the U.S. will have huge problems .
So let 's see :
If Obama lets Panetta muck up the CIA 's ability , we 're going to get hit in the next year .
But wait -- are n't we going to be hit no matter what ?
And is n't all that reflective of the 2006 NIE which warned that the Iraq war and Bush administration 's handling of it ( including the Abu Ghraib revelations ) had made us actually more vulnerable to terrorist attack ?
Ah , but O'Reilly has long ago swept that particular fact under his mental rug .
That 's just for starters .
Next up on the program , he had on author / CIA expert Gary Berntsen , and " Fox Military Analyst " Col.
David Hunt .
Berntsen was largely baffled by the Panetta selection .
Hunt , on the other hand , was largely bats - -t crazy :
[ Transcript and more below . ]
O'Reilly : But Colonel -- and you and I have disagreed on this one before -- if you 're going to say that you have to do the Army Field Manual , which you know very well , which says , quote , you are not to make any captured person uncomfortable in any way , if that 's going to be the standard that Leon Panetta embraces , and he told the Monterey newspaper that 's exactly his vision , then I do n't think we 're going to get intel from any captured terror suspects at all , am I wrong ? *
Hunt : No , and the Army Intel Manual is meant for Private Johnson , in the field , and it's not been adopted by the intelligence community .
O'Reilly : But -- but -- it was clear by the interview that Panetta did with the Monterey newspaper that this was the standard that he believes the CIA has to adhere to !
Hunt :
He 's wrong , and so is the incoming president , on this issue .
Guys who know this business understand that it has to be in their toolkit , the ability to do this very tough thing called torture .
And by the way , it 's a small part of the effort on terrorism .
It 's a small part .
... [ O' Reilly goes off on another 24 scenario .
Hey , Bill , Jack Bauer is much more convincing than you .
And that ai n't saying much . ]
Hunt :
The problem is actually bigger .
The National Intelligence Director , this guy Blair that 's being put in there , Navy guy , what they 've done is , they 've increased that office from 500 to 1500 , and further diluted the agency 's capability .
What they have done in putting Panetta in there is put a stake in the heart of the agency , and try to kill it .
This is not a good situation at all .
Gary Berntsen then tries to sound somewhat reasonable amid all this madness , but it 's like a drowning man in a flood .
Well , I wonder what Col .
Hunt would say about those Japanese soldiers convicted of the war crimes of waterboarding American prisoners .
Hmmm .
Does n't exactly jibe with the notion that torture is just a routine thing American intelligence operatives need to have in their toolkits .
* As for BillO , may we meekly suggest he avail himself of the advice of the pseudonymous Matthew Alexander , who found that exactly what BillO describes as " Leon Panetta 's vision " was indeed the most effective means of obtaining intelligence .
Incidentally , the Panetta interview that O'Reilly references can be read here .
Judge for yourself Panetta 's vision for the intelligence community .

Meg Whitman , the former chief executive of EBay Inc. , has resigned from the board of directors of the online auction company and two other corporations , fueling speculation that she is preparing for a 2010 run for California governor .
The resignations , which were effective Wednesday , from EBay , Procter & Gamble Co. and DreamWorks SKG were made for personal reasons , Whitman spokesman Henry Gomez said Monday .
Gomez declined to comment “ on anything having to do with the governor ’s race . ”
Nevertheless , he noted that Whitman , a Republican , “ has said before and it ’s been widely reported that she is considering a run . ”
Whitman ’s actions send a “ pretty clear signal ” that she ’s going to be a candidate to succeed Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , said Dan Schnur , director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC .

Schwarzenegger , who was reelected in 2006 , is not eligible to run again .
Whitman , 52 , is likely to make a more formal statement of intent in four to six weeks , said a person familiar with her plans , who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the record .
If she jumps into the 2010 GOP primary , Whitman , who has a net worth of $ 1.3 billion , according to Forbes magazine , is expected to confront another extremely wealthy former Silicon Valley high - tech executive , California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner .
He founded SnapTrack Inc. , which developed global positioning systems for cellular telephones , and sold the company for $ 1 billion to Qualcomm Inc. in 2000 .

A third potential candidate is former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell ( R - San Jose ) , who has formed an exploratory committee .
Campbell is a UC Berkeley business professor .
Whitman and Poizner have a lot more in common than being moderate Republicans with business backgrounds , said Bill Whalen , a Republican strategist and former speechwriter for ex-Gov. Pete Wilson .
“ They have the ability to write a very large check to their own campaign , ” Whalen said .
What ’s more , they both have been working to burnish their Republican credentials :
Poizner by traveling around the state to meet with local GOP officials , and Whitman by campaigning last year for Republican presidential candidate John McCain , Whalen said .
The Democratic governor ’s field is even larger .
U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein is the presumptive favorite if she decides to seek the office .
Other possible contenders include Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , a former governor ; Lt. Gov. John Garamendi , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former state Controller Steve Westly , who also was a top executive at EBay .

The advertisers say taking a day off sick can be beneficial for employees
An advert for a cold and flu medicine has been criticised for encouraging workers to " throw a sickie " .
The TV and web " Take a Benylin Day " ad offers advice on what to tell the boss when calling in sick and reviews the best DVDs to watch while at home .
The Federation of Small Businesses said the adverts were " outrageous " .
The advertising company behind the campaign , JWT , said it had taken the advice of experts that taking a day off sick could help recovery from illness .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Benylin's website says the product is there to " take the guilt out of calling in sick when you need time off to rest and recover " .
" We urge employers and employees alike to take a stand against cold and flu by staying at home , rather than going into work , " it continues .
Stephen Alambritis of the Federation of Small Businesses criticised the message the advert sent out to employees .
" Actually urging them to stay at home and watch various videos or movies and telling them how to e-mail in sick , and how to e-mail their colleagues and bosses , really is outrageous , " he said .
However , James Whitehead of JWT said the firm had been told that taking a day off sick could help workers return to their jobs fit and healthy .
He said : " We 've been advised by health care experts that by taking one or two days off work , staying in bed , you can break that cycle and you can get to work healthy and productive . "
The advert has been referred to the Advertising Standards Authority .

“ You keep using that word .
I do not think it means what you think it means . ” – Inigo Montoya , The Princess Bride
It may be inconceivable for you to misuse a word , but a quick look around online reveals plenty of people doing it .
And it ’s all too easy when we hear or see others use words incorrectly and parrot them without knowing they ’re wrong .
We know by now that great copy and content often purposefully break the rules of grammar .
It ’s only when you break the rules by mistake that you look silly .
So , let ’s take a look at 27 commonly misused words .
Some are common mistakes that can cost you when trying to keep a reader ’s attention .
Others are more obscure and just interesting to know .
Adverse / Averse
Adverse means unfavorable .
Averse means reluctant .
Afterwards
Afterwards is wrong in American English .
It ’s afterward .
Complement / Compliment
I see this one all the time .
Complement is something that adds to or supplements something else .
Compliment is something nice someone says about you .
Criteria
Criteria is plural , and the singular form is criterion .
If someone tells you they have only one criteria , you can quickly interject and offer that it be that they get a clue .
Farther / Further
Farther is talking about a physical distance .
“ Move farther away from those people , Daddy ! ”
Further is talking about an extension of time or degree .
“ Take your business further by reading Copyblogger . ”
Fewer / Less
If you can count it , use fewer .
If you can ’t , use less .
“ James has less incentive to do what I say . ”
“ Tony has fewer subscribers since he stopped blogging . ”
Historic / Historical
Historic means an important event .
Historical means something that happened in the past .
Hopefully
This word is used incorrectly so much ( including by me ) , it may be too late .
But let ’s make you smarter anyway .
The old - school rule is you use hopefully only if you ’re describing the way someone spoke , appeared , or acted .
Smart : I hope she says yes .
: I hope she says yes .
Wrong :
Hopefully , she says yes .
: Hopefully , she says yes .
Wrong :
Hopefully , the weather will be good .
: Hopefully , the weather will be good .
Smart :
It is hoped that the weather cooperates .
: It is hoped that the weather cooperates .
Smart :
She eyed the engagement ring hopefully .
Imply / Infer
Imply means to suggest indirectly ( you ’re sending a subtle message ) .
To infer is to come to a conclusion based on information ( you ’re interpreting a message ) .
Insure / Ensure
Insure is correct only when you call up Geico or State Farm for coverage .
Ensure means to guarantee , and that ’s most often what you ’re trying to say , right ?
Irregardless
Irregardless may now be grudgingly considered a word , but it ’s a stupid word that makes you sound … well , not so smart .
Use regardless or irrespective instead .
Literally
“ I ’m literally starving to death . ”
No , odds are , you ’re not .
Literally means exactly what you say is accurate , no metaphors or analogies .
Everything else is figurative ( relative , a figure of speech ) .
Premier / Premiere
Premier is the first and best in status or importance , or a prime minister .
Premiere is the opening night of Star Wars 15 : Disney Wants More Money .
Principal / Principle
Principal when used as a noun means the top dog ; as an adjective , it means the most important of any set .
Principle is a noun meaning a fundamental truth , a law , a rule that always applies , or a code of conduct .
Then / Than
Use then when referring to points in time ( “ I did this , then I did that ” ) .
Use than when comparing ( “ I ’m better than that ” ) .
Unique
Unique means ( literally ) one of a kind .
Saying something is very unique is wack .
It ’s either a purple cow or it is n’t .
Who / Whom
This one is a lost cause , but let ’s go down swinging .
The way to deal with the who versus whom quandary is a simple substitution method .
First , a refresher on subjects and objects .
Subjects do the action :
“ He / she / we like (s ) to rock the house . ”
Objects receive the action :
“ The rock star sneered at him / her / us . ”
Use who for subjects and whom for objects .
Subjects :
Who wrote this blog post ?
Who is speaking at the conference ?
Who is going to clean up this mess ?
Objects :
Whom are you going to write about ?
Whom did he blame for his Google Slap ?
Whom did he bait for the clicks ?
Truth is , whom just does n’t sound right in many situations where it ’s correct , especially in the US .
You now know the rule … feel free to break it .
P.S. If you have n’t seen
The Princess Bride because you think it must suck based on the title , do n’t let that stop you .
It ’s laugh - out - loud funny and has more great lines than I can come up with angles to write about … so far .
The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the ECC 's ruling , which declared Franken the winner , late Tuesday morning .
The 32 page order , issued unanimously by the five presiding justices , marked the end of Minnesota 's 2008 Senatorial Election .
An excerpted summary of the order is presented below followed by Norm Coleman 's concession speech : Filed : June 30 , 2009 ...
SYLLABUS 1 . Appellants [ Coleman ] did not establish that , by requiring proof that statutory absentee voting standards were satisfied before counting a rejected absentee ballot , the trial court 's decision constituted a post-election change in standards that violates substantive due process .
2 . Appellants did not prove that either the trial court or local election officials violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection .
3 . The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded additional evidence .
4 . Inspection of ballots under Minn. Stat. § 209.06 ( 2008 ) is available only on a showing that the requesting party cannot properly be prepared for trial without an inspection .
Because appellants made no such showing here , the trial court did not err in denying inspection .
5 . The trial court did not err when it included in the final election tally the election day returns of a precinct in which some ballots were lost before the manual recount .
Affirmed .
OPINION PER CURIAM .
[ Unanimous 5 - 0 decision . ]
Appellants , incumbent Republican United States Senator Norm Coleman and Cullen Sheehan , filed a notice of election contest under Minn. Stat. § 209.021 ( 2008 ) , challenging the State Canvassing Board 's certification that Democratic - Farmer - Labor challenger Al Franken was entitled to receive a certificate of election as United States Senator following the November 4 , 2008 general election .
After a trial , the three - judge trial court we appointed to hear the election contest issued its findings of fact , conclusions of law , and order for judgment , concluding that Franken received 312 more legally cast votes than Coleman and that Franken was entitled to a certificate of election for the office of United States Senator .
The question presented on appeal is whether the trial court erred in concluding that Al Franken received the most legally cast votes in the election for United States Senator .
Because we conclude that appellants have not shown that the trial cour 's findings of fact are clearly erroneous or that the court committed an error of law or abused its discretion , we affirm .
... I
We turn first to the question of whether Coleman 's right to substantive due process under the United States Constitution has been violated .
Whether Coleman 's right to substantive due process was violated is a question of law , which we review de novo .
State v. Netland , 762 N.W.2d 202 , 207 ( Minn. 2009 ) . ...
We conclude that our existing case law requires strict compliance by voters with the requirements for absentee voting .
Thus , we reject Coleman 's argument that only substantial compliance by voters is required .
Having rejected this argument , we also conclude that the trial court 's February 13 order requiring strict compliance with the statutory requirements for absentee voting was not a deviation from our well - established precedent .
...
II
We next examine Coleman 's argument that the constitutional guarantee of equal protection was violated in this case .
12 Coleman 's equal protection argument is two - fold .
First , he argues that the differing application and implementation by election officials of the statutory requirements for absentee voting violated equal protection .
Essentially , Coleman contends that similarly situated absentee ballots were treated differently depending on the jurisdiction in which they were cast and that this disparate treatment violated equal protection .
Second , Coleman contends that equal protection was violated when the trial court adhered to the statutory requirements for acceptance of absentee ballots , in contrast to the practices of local jurisdictions during the election .
...
The trial court found that election judges applied the election laws in a consistent and uniform manner .
The court found that election jurisdictions adopted policies they deemed necessary to ensure that absentee voting procedures would be available to their residents , in accordance with statutory requirements , given the resources available to them .
The court also found that differences in available resources , personnel , procedures , and technology necessarily affected the procedures used by local election officials reviewing absentee ballots .
But the court found that Coleman did not prove that these differences were calculated to discriminate among absentee voters .
Our review of the record convinces us that the trial court 's findings are supported by the evidence and are not clearly erroneous .
As a result , we conclude that Coleman did not prove his equal protection claim .
...
The trial court concluded that Bush is distinguishable in several important respects and , as a result , does not support Coleman 's equal protection claim .
We agree .
In Bush , the Supreme Court specifically noted that it was not addressing the question of " whether local entities , in the exercise of their expertise , may develop different systems for implementing elections . "
531 U.S. at 109 .
Variations in local practices for implementing absentee voting procedures are , at least in part , the question at issue here .
As previously noted , the trial court here found that the disparities in application of the statutory standards on which Coleman relies are the product of local jurisdictions " use of different methods to ensure compliance with the same statutory standards ; that jurisdictions adopted policies they deemed necessary to ensure that absentee voting procedures would be available to their residents , in accordance with statutory requirements , given the resources available to them ; and that differences in available resources , personnel , procedures , and technology necessarily affected the procedures used by local election officials in reviewing absentee ballots .
As we noted previously , Coleman has not demonstrated that these findings are clearly erroneous .
... III Coleman next contends that the trial court improperly excluded ( 1 ) evidence of absentee ballots accepted on election day and in the manual recount that would not satisfy the standards established by the trial court , and ( 2 ) evidence of disparities among jurisdictions in their application of the statutory standards governing absentee ballots .
We review the trial court 's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion .
See Peterson v. BASF Corp. , 711 N.W.2d 470 , 482-83 ( Minn. 2006 ) . ...
In enacting section 204C.13 , subd .
6 , particularly in light of our interpretation of the same language in Bell , the legislature made a policy decision to limit challenges to an absentee ballot , once it is separated from its return envelope and deposited in the ballot box , to challenges based on the face of the ballot .
We conclude that the trial court ruled correctly that Minnesota law provides no remedy for wrongly accepted absentee ballot return envelopes once those envelopes have been opened and the ballots inside deposited in the ballot box .
Accordingly , we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence .
...
As we have explained , in order to prevail on his equal protection claim , Coleman was required to prove intentional or purposeful discrimination on the part of either local election officials or the trial court .
But Coleman does not contend that the additional evidence he sought to introduce would have proven intentional or purposeful discrimination on the part of any election officials or the trial court .
We therefore conclude that in excluding this evidence , the court did not abuse its discretion .
IV Coleman also claims that the trial court erred in denying his petition for inspection of ballots for certain precincts in which he alleges that double - counting of ballots occurred .
The trial court concluded that Coleman had not met his burden to show that an inspection was needed to prepare for trial , noting Coleman 's concession at the hearing on the petition that he would be able to prove his case without an inspection , by calling election judges as witnesses and by subpoenaing voter rolls and ballots .
The court also concluded that inspections under Minn. Stat. § 209.06 ( 2008 ) are limited to the ballots themselves and do not include voter rolls or other election materials sought by Coleman .
Finally , the court noted that the parties had already reviewed the ballots during the manual recount .
... Coleman conceded at the hearing on the petition for inspection , and does not dispute here , that he could prove his claim of double - counting by subpoenaing the ballots and election materials and by subpoenaing witnesses to testify .
This concession negates any claim that he made the required showing of necessity and any contention that he was prevented from proving his case by denial of the inspection .
Coleman called no witnesses with direct knowledge of the handling of duplicate ballots in the relevant precincts , but he did introduce at trial voter rosters , envelopes from accepted absentee ballots , copies of ballots challenged during the manual recount , and machine tapes from the identified precincts in which he alleges double - counting of absentee ballots occurred .
On appeal , Coleman has identified nothing additional that an inspection of ballots under section 209.06 would have produced .
21
We therefore hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for inspection .
V Finally , Coleman contends that the trial court erred when it ruled that missing ballots from Minneapolis Ward 3 , Precinct 1 , were properly included in the State Canvassing Board 's January 5 , 2009 certification of legally cast votes .
During the manual recount , election officials could locate only four of the five envelopes of ballots from Minneapolis Ward 3 , Precinct 1 .
Voting machine tapes showed a total of 2,028 ballots cast and counted in the precinct on election day , but only 1,896 ballots from the precinct were available for the recount , a difference of 132 ballots .
The State Canvassing Board determined that an envelope of ballots had been lost and , rather than certify only 1,896 votes in the recount , accepted the election day returns for that precinct .
...
Coleman articulates no compelling reason why that same principle should not apply here .
The ballots are missing , but Coleman introduced no evidence of foul play or misconduct , and the election day precinct returns are available to give effect to those votes .
We hold that the trial court did not err in ruling that the election day precinct returns for Minneapolis Ward 3 , Precinct 1 , were properly included in the tally of legally cast votes .
VI
For all of the foregoing reasons , we affirm the decision of the trial court that Al Franken received the highest number of votes legally cast and is entitled under Minn.
Stat. § 204C.40 ( 2008 ) to receive the certificate of election as United States Senator from the State of Minnesota .

There are several interesting statements by the MN Supreme Court Justices , most notably the second excerpted paragraph under section III , but any relevance was minimized following Norm Coleman 's fifteen minute address to the people of Minnesota : Within his concession speech , Norm Coleman congratulated " Senator Franken , " thanked his supporters and addressed his political future with the following statement : " soon , I presume sometime , we 'll get through July fourth , sometime next week .
We 'll talk a little about what my future is . "
Coleman also suggested that Governor Tim Pawlenty would sign the Election Certificate because " for all Minnesotans , this is a time to look forward . "
Al Franken is scheduled to address the media at 4:15 CT live on CSPAN .
Update [ 4:24 PM CT ] : " I 'm not going to Washington to be the 60th Democratic Senator , I 'm going to Washington to be the 2nd Senator from the State of Minnesota . "

The Minnesota Supreme Court is still deliberating on Norm Coleman 's latest appeal in the drawn out Senate Election of 2008 ; but at this point their ruling merely appears to be a legal formality .
Even Minnesota 's Republican Governor , Tim Pawlenty , has indicated his intent to adhere to the MNSC 's ruling by signing the Election Certificate should Al Franken be declared the victor .
With a ruling likely to come this week or next , Al Franken seems poised to become the legal victor , and there is n't anything anybody can do about it .
Michael Brodkorb of MinnesotaDemocratsExposed.com does however seem intent on altering the public 's perception .
On June 8th , just five days before his election as the new Deputy Chair of the Minnesota Republican Party , he filed public data practice requests with seven of Minnesota 's counties seeking photocopies of rejected absentee ballots .
Mr. Brodkorb filed his two page request with the counties of Anoka , Carver , Dakota , Hennepin , Olmsted , Sherburne and Washington , and the cities of Edina , Minnetonka , Orono and Plymouth .
The following excerpt contains the request sent to Anoka County : Michael Brobkorb
[ Poorly Redacted Address ] June 8 , 2008 Rachel Smith
Anoka County
325 E Main St W130
Anoka , MN 55303- 2465
Re : Data Practices Request
This correspondence is a request for access to public information and data relating to the 2008 general election for United States Senator in your county under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act ( " MGDPA " ) , Minnesota Statutes , Chapter 13 .
Minnesota Statutes § 15.17 requires all government entities to make and maintain all records relative to their official activities .
Minnesota Statutes § 13.03 , subdivision 1 requires all government entities to keep records that contain government data in a way ( or ways ) that makes the data easily accessible for convenient use .
The undersigned requests copies of that portion of the front side of all ballots relative to the 2008 United States Senate general election contained within rejected absentee ballot envelopes in your possession that were not submitted late and were not submitted by persons who otherwise voted in the 2008 general election ( either in person or by replacement absentee ballot ) .
This request does not seek to have the undersigned open or unseal any absentee ballot envelopes ; to the extent any such envelopes have not yet been opened , the undersigned requests that an election judge do so .
This request also does not seek access to any data regarding any individuals , including voter registration applications , voter registration lists or any other information related thereto and subject to restricted access under Minnesota Statutes § 201.091 .
Finally , this request does not seek copies of the absentee ballot envelopes themselves or any accompanying materials , such as absentee ballot applications .
In short , this request in no way seeks to ascertain which person (s ) voted for which candidate (s ) .
The request can be easily complied with while protecting the secrecy of the ballots .
This information / data is clearly public information under the MGDPA .
As you know , Minn .
Stat . § 13.03 , subdivision 1 provides that all government data collected , created , received or maintained is public information unless classified by statute , federal law or temporary classification as confidential , private , nonpublic or protected nonpublic data .
No such classification exists for the information requested .
No Minnesota statute provides that the ballots contained within uncounted rejected absentee ballot envelopes is nonpublic or private information if opened by an election judge ; although Minnesota law requires you to securely maintain all election materials , no Minnesota statute exists which denies the public the right to inspect and / or receive copies of the ballots contained within rejected absentee ballot envelopes .
As the agency with jurisdiction over all ballots and election materials within your county , it is your duty to comply with data practices requests under the MGDPA and the undersigned is not aware of any statutory or other authority which prohibits you from opening the rejected absentee ballot envelopes while maintaining the secrecy of each person 's intended vote for the purposes of complying with this request .
There is simply no risk whatsoever that the secrecy of any ballot ( s ) will be compromised .
Again , this request seeks only a photocopy of the section of ballots relative to the 2008 general election for United States Senator contained within certain rejected absentee ballot envelopes in your possession or under your control and in no way seeks to ascertain which person (s ) voted for which candidate (s ) .
...
Thank you .
Sincerely , Michael B. Brodkorb [ emphasis added ]

There are several catastrophic assumptions and falsehoods located within Brodkorb 's meager request .
I 've bolded the fallacious and contradictory portions from his request above and will now address each item below .
Let 's begin by addressing the issue raised within the first bolded portion ; the need for an election judge to open the requested ballots .
This triggers two questions , the first of which I will now address .
It is necessary for an election judge to open the currently sealed and rejected absentee ballots because of MN § 13.37 : 13.37 GENERAL NONPUBLIC DATA .
Subd .
2 . Classification .
The following government data is classified as nonpublic data with regard to data not on individuals , pursuant to section 13.02 , subdivision 9 , and as private data with regard to data on individuals , pursuant to section 13.02 , subdivision 12 : Security information ; trade secret information ; sealed absentee ballots prior to opening by an election judge ; sealed bids , including the number of bids received , prior to the opening of the bids ; parking space leasing data ; and labor relations information , provided that specific labor relations information which relates to a specific labor organization is classified as protected nonpublic data pursuant to section 13.02 , subdivision 13 .

Subd .
9 . Nonpublic data .
" Nonpublic data " means data not on individuals that is made by statute or federal law applicable to the data : ( a ) not accessible to the public ; and ( b ) accessible to the subject , if any , of the data .
... Subd. 12 . Private data on individuals .
" Private data on individuals " means data which is made by statute or federal law applicable to the data : ( a ) not public ; and ( b ) accessible to the individual subject of that data .
Source : 13.02 , 2008 Minnesota Statutes via Minnesota Office of the Revisor of Statutes Minnesota § 13.37 essentially states that unopened absentee ballots are private data and are therefore inaccessible to the general public .
The subject of this request , rejected absentee ballots , are currently unopened and therefore qualify for protection under § 13.37 .
Brodkorb may think he is circumventing § 13.37 by explicitly asking the election judges to open his requested ballots , but data practice requests do not fall within the duties of elections judges with regard to opening absentee ballots .
In fact the only mechanism by which absentee ballots can be opened by an election judge falls within the jurisdiction of § 203B.12 : 203B.12 ELECTION JUDGES TO RECEIVE AND COUNT BALLOTS .
Subd .
4 . Placement in container ; opening and counting of ballots .
The ballot envelopes from return envelopes marked " Accepted " shall be placed by the election judges in a separate absentee ballot container .
The container and each ballot envelope may be opened only after the last regular mail delivery by the United States postal service on election day .
The ballots shall then be initialed by the election judges in the same manner as ballots delivered by them to voters in person and shall be deposited in the appropriate ballot box .
[ emphasis added ]
Source : 203B.12 , 2008 Minnesota Statutes via Minnesota Office of the Revisor of Statutes
The rejected absentee ballots requested by Brodkorb are not marked with " Accepted " by definition because they were " Rejected " under § 203B .12 subd 2 .
As a result of their current " Rejected " status , the absentee ballots in question would never qualify for the " separate absentee ballot container " and could therefore never be opened by an election judge .
At this point , the first half of Brodkorb 's argument is clear ; he wants election officials to open his requested rejected ballots .
Brodkorb then justifies this request by stating , in the second bolded portion , that the ballots then become public data if they are opened by election officials .
It does n't make a whole lot of sense ; he is attempting to justify one action with another .
The rejected ballots are private data , so to make them public , an election judge needs to open them ; but an election judge cannot open them because they are rejected .
Brodkorb 's entire argument is circular and without merit .
After seventeen days , Brodkorb posted a follow - up to his data practice requests : I have received responses to all of my requests for public data and every county and city has denied my request .
I 'm reviewing my options and I 'll have updates on this subject in the next 24 hours on Minnesota Democrats Exposed .
Source : Update : MDE Exclusive : Data Practices Request Filed Today Requesting Copies of Certain Rejected Absentee Ballots via Minnesota Democrats Exposed Brodkorb 's request appears to have been flatly denied by each jurisdiction .
He does however have at least one other option .
Brodkorb could bring forth an action to compel discovery of these rejected ballots in accordance with MN § 13.03 subd .
6 . I do n't know how this would work , or if rejected absentee ballots even qualify for discoverability .
It will be interesting to see if Brodkorb continues to pursue these data practice requests when he becomes the new Deputy Chair of the Minnesota Republican Party this Wednesday .

While the MN Supreme Court deliberates on Norm Coleman 's latest appeal , the Election Contest Court addressed and resolved the issue of disbursements ; the monetary reimbursement of court associated fees .
The legal process began shortly after the ECC declared Franken the victor with the first disbursement filing arriving on April 28th from the Franken campaign ; just 15 days after the court 's final judgment .
The Franken document totaled 394 pages with 384 pages of exhibits .
The first ten pages contained the body of the filing while the remaining 384 pages , of exhibits , were found within a gray three ring binder .
The digitization of the exhibit portion was just completed this morning by the Ramsey County Court Administration Office .
Prior to purchasing the first ten pages , and then later receiving the exhibits from a Ramsey County Court Administrator , no portion of this document could be publicly accessed without making a physical trip to the Ramsey County Court House .
The entire document has been converted to PDF for public consumption below with the highlights excerpted : David L. Lillehaug , being duly sworn , on oath says that he is one of the attorneys for Contestee Al Franken ( " Contestee " ) in the above entitled action and certifies that he has investigated the costs and disbursements claimed herein , and that the following is a true statement of the taxable costs and disbursements incurred by Contestee ; and that each and every item thereof has actually and necessarily been paid or incurred in this action .
Documents supporting each of Contestees ' costs and disbursements are attached .
Statutory Costs $ 205.50 ( Minn. Stat . § 549.02 , subd .
1 ) Court Filing Fees $ 1,130.00 ( Minn. Stat. § 357.021 ) ( Tab A ) Deposition Transcripts of Testifying $ 7,315.30 Witnesses ( Minn. Stat. § 357.31 ) ( Tab B ) Written Deposition Transcripts $ 812.50 Entered Into Evidence ( Minn. Stat § 357.31 ) ( Tab C ) Deposition Transcripts Entered $ 3,200.70 Into Evidence ( Minn. Stat .

The list above contains the itemized cost for each subheading for which the Franken campaign is seeking reimbursements from the losing party ; in this case , the Coleman campaign .
It 's also pertinent to note that the Franken campaign did not provide a rational for why any item should be reimbursed ; they were simply presenting the ECC with a probable list of expenditures which they believe qualify for reimbursement .
On another note , the projector used during the ECC trial was actually provided by the Franken campaign .
The State of Minnesota does not provide a projector for use in their most prestigious court room ; this is absolutely astonishing to me .
I also found it humorous that the Franken campaign made a roughly $ 600 purchase of printing related goods from BestBuy ( on page 329 ) ; BestBuy was the 14th largest corporate supporter to Norm Coleman according to OpenSecrets.org for the period from 2007 - 2008 .
The Coleman campaign then responded to Franken 's list of applicable expenditures on May 8th by providing their rationale for why some of the listed items do not qualify for compensation .
The introduction and conclusion of their opposition is excerpted below with the accompanying PDF as published on the MNCourts website on May 21st : I. Introduction Contestants Cullen Sheehan and Norm Coleman ( collectively , " Contestants " ) , by and through the undersigned counsel , hereby object to Contestee Al Franken 's ( " Contestee " ) Bill of Costs and Disbursements , notice of which Contestee served May 6 , 2009 .
Contestee has not provided sufficient detail and / or documentation from which to determine the basis of many of the costs he identifies and the purpose for which they were incurred .
Nor has he provided a sufficient explanation as to whether the costs claimed were necessary or reasonable , and it is his burden to do so .
Accordingly , this Court should disallow the taxation of costs and disbursements to the Contestants to the extent Contestee has inadequately described his costs or it deems them unnecessary or unreasonable .
... III .
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons , Contestants respectfully request that this Court disallow Contestee 's costs and disbursements to the extent he has improperly classified them as " costs , " inadequately described them , or failed to justify them as necessary and reasonable .
Dated : May 8 , 2009 Source : Contestants Objections to Contestees Bill of Costs and Disbursements via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
Unsurprisingly , the Coleman campaign essentially argued that the Franken campaign did not adequately provide needed detail .
The brunt of their argument can be summarized with the following quote from the third page , " [t ] he burden is on the prevailing party [ Franken ] to show that its claimed costs are necessary and reasonable . "
The Coleman campaign also took issue with the expedited status of the many transcripts and witness filing fees that the Franken campaign incurred .
From a details point of view , the Coleman filing did not contain any attached exhibits or material evidence supporting any of their claims .
The Franken campaign responded on May 13th in 9 pages by addressing each of their claims and Coleman 's associated refutations .
The Coleman campaign did not refute each item as the Franken campaign noted $ 5,392 worth of requested disbursements lacking objections .
The introduction and conclusion of Franken 's response is excerpted below as posted on the MNCourts site on May 21st : Contestee Al Franken ( " Contestee " ) respectfully submits that his costs should be awarded and in the full amount requested pursuant to Minn .
R. Civ. P. 54.04 .
Contestee has submitted a sworn affidavit and numerous invoices documenting costs and disbursements necessarily incurred , as required .
Contestants have submitted no affidavit in response .
Nor have they suggested that the total amount requested is unreasonable for a complex , seven - week , exhibit - intensive trial .
Instead , they raise a series of ill - founded objections , all of which should be rejected .
Contestee 's costs were reasonably incurred , necessary to the defense of Contestants ' lawsuit , and are fully recoverable under Rule 54 .
...
For all of these reasons , Contestee submits that the full amount itemized in the Bill of Costs and Disbursements should be taxed to Contestants .
The costs were reasonably incurred , necessary for the presentation of relevant and admissible evidence at trial , and should be awarded to Contestee as the prevailing party in this action pursuant to Rule 54.04 .

The ECC issued their ruling today by awarding the Franken campaign roughly two - thirds of their requested disbursements .
The publicly available filing from the ECC is fairly terse and without details ; the entire document is quoted below :
You are hereby notified that a judgment has been entered in the above entitled matter Pursuant to The Findings of Fact , Conclusions of Law , and Order for Judgment , Judge Elizabeth A. Hayden , Judge Kurt J. Marben and Judge Denise D. Reilly dated April 13 , 2009 .

Please be advised that notices sent to attorneys are sent to the lead attorney only .
*** Pursuant to MSA 548.09 , Judgment shall be docketed upon the filing of an Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Debtor ***
Note : Costs and interest will accrue on any money judgment amounts from the date of entry until the judgment is satisfied in full .
Dated : June 10 , 2009 Source : Notice of Entry of Judgment Taxation of Costs via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
The ECC order appears to retroactively take effect on April 14th and requires the Coleman campaign to pay $ 94,783.15 in reimbursements to the Franken campaign .
I am unsure as to when the " date of entry " officially begins ; the interest rate on any delinquent payments is also not explicitly given .
The ECC may have also provided additional documentation that has not yet been made available .
A decision from the MN Supreme Court is still pending , but according to John Kostouros the Director of Communications for the Judicial Branch , their opinion " will be released during normal business hours ( 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. , Monday - Friday ) . "
Until this unknown date occurs , political posturing will continue as several outside groups have filed additional lawsuits relating to the MN Senate Election .
While the outcome rests solely in the hands of the MN Supreme Court , the battle for public opinion never ends .
I 'll try to detail these auxiliary lawsuits later next week , after completing the necessary research .

The Minnesota Supreme Court convened today at 9 AM CT for the oral arguments associated with Norm Coleman 's election appeal .
The proceedings lasted approximately 69 minutes ; upon their conclusion , each candidate 's representation addressed the media on the second floor of the Minnesota Judicial Building .

All files are .
WAV , Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 Coleman 's lead attorney , Joseph Friedberg began the hearing with what was supposed to be a ten minute introduction .
Ten minutes turned into thirty as the five judge panel peppered Coleman 's representation with questions and critiques .
Despite the barrage of questions , the most telling exchanged occurred in the opening moments of the hearing : Justice Page :
We have one case for argument this morning , in the matter of the contest of general election held on November 4 , 2008 for the purpose of electing a United States Senator from the State of Minnesota .
Mr. Friedberg I see you have reserved 10 minutes for rebuttal .
Joseph Friedberg [ Coleman ] :
With the court 's permission your honor .
Justice Page :
You may proceed when you are ready .
Mr. Friedberg : Morning and may it please this court ; my name is Joe Friedberg , I represent [ Norm Coleman ] .
Let me begin by saying that Minnesota is quite different from many states .
We have problems within our institutions and when we do , we deal with them candidly and openly , we do n't minimize them or sweep 'em under the rug to be discovered later by a federal court during 1983 litigation .
That 's why finding of fact 47 of the trial court is so surprising .
Announcing that we are proud of rejecting only 0.5 % of our total ballots cast in November is misleading at best .
The only ballots that get rejected are absentee ballots ; and our officials rejected 4 % of them ; 12,000 citizens who made good faith efforts to vote were disenfranchised for a variety --. Justice Page : Did these 12,000 citizens comply with the absentee ballot voter requirements .
Mr. Friedberg : Many of them did substantially your honor , many of them did .
Justice Page : Substantially ?
What does that mean ?
Source : Minnesota Judicial Branch [ Mirror : TPT.org ]
The remainder of Mr. Friedberg 's opening address revolved around Justice Page 's seemingly rhetorical , yet legally unanswered question quoted above .
The arguments meandered from justice to justice as Friedberg attempted to answer each question .
Justice Anderson , Dietzen , Gildea and Meyer each took issue with the Coleman campaign 's lack of evidentiary support with regard to their inconsistent application of the strict vs. substantial compliance argument .
Justice Meyer prominently entered the fray with this exchange toward the end of Mr. Friedberg 's initial rebuttal : Justice Meyer :
Where is evidence from the overwhelming majority of the counties and cities ?
Mr. Friedberg : Every auditor we called , as I recall , made exceptions [ to the admittance of absentee ballots ] .
Now I think we only called 26 or 27 --. Justice Meyer :
And we have 87 counties , we are reviewing the work of a panel of three trial court judges here and they took evidence .
Where is the evidence ?
Even as you called , as you said , you did n't even call witnesses from a majority of Minnesota 's counties .
You are asking us to presume , based on the testimony from a sampling of counties that that practice is applied to a majority of the counties .
Source : Minnesota Judicial Branch [ Mirror : TPT.org ]
Friedberg responded by hesitantly referencing the assumed equality of populations within Bush vs .
Gore to compare the " relaxed standard in Brower County with the unrelaxed standard in Palm Beach . "
Friedberg would then go on to state that " we have made our case " when " Plymouth kicks out 75 for signature mismatches and 31 counties in the state kick out none . "
I think Friedberg has a valid point from a mathematical standpoint if true ; the Plymouth scenario presents a significant outlier and the aforementioned sampling of " 26 or 27 " counties represent a statistically sound sampling of all 87 counties .
An inconsistent application of absentee ballot compliance in " 26 or 27 " counties would indicate to me , although devoid of legal rigor , that a problem existed , regardless of the remaining 50 or so counties .
Whether the Coleman campaign adequately provided evidence to support this claim is vague at best .
Mr. Friedberg 's time expired and Marc Elias , Franken 's lead attorney , stepped up to the podium whereupon stating his name received his first question from Justice Page : Justice Page : Council , before you get to that finding of fact , let me ask you a question .
Hopefully council for the other side will be able to respond to this on the rebuttal .
To the extent that the United States Senate will make the ultimate decision here , and the extent that they do n't have to follow what we do .
How do we issue an opinion , without it being an advisory opinion ?
In essence , do we have authority to do anything here ?
Marc Elias [ Franken ] : Your Honor , this question was raised with the district court as to whether the court had jurisdiction .
The court found , and we believe appropriately so , that the court had jurisdiction to determine who received the most lawful votes , even though the Senate has within its jurisdiction to decide who is seated .
Source : Minnesota Judicial Branch [ Mirror : TPT.org ]
Elias would then go onto quote a South Dakota case involving Tom Daschle from his days as a Congressman .
The referenced case was eventually linked to a Supreme Court decision stating that so long as the state process does not impede the US Senate , the state court is not " deprived of jurisdiction . "
The MNSC clearly has the power to declare a winner under Minnesota Statute , but the US Senate is under no obligation to act in accordance with any decision .
The issuance of an election certificate for the sole purpose of full representation is irrelevant to the Supreme Court 's present responsibility ; an election certificate will apparently only be issued upon the thorough completion of the appeals process .
The sole duty of the MN Supreme Court is to determine the candidate who received the largest number of legally cast votes , not to ensure federal representation or for any other purpose .
Elias would then go on to perform a small bit of math in the hopes of illustrating the futility of the Appellants ' case : Mr. Elias : From the March 31st order of the trial court , in which [ the Coleman campaign ] held that of all the rejected absentee ballots , the parties proved registration for approximately 650 ; 650 of all of the ballots presented to the court .
That 's voter registration , that 's not all of the other requirements that appellants now have complaints about .
But this is the most fundamental requirement , that the voter be registered .
Of those 650 , 351 were opened and counted .
So the universe of ballots , properly plead and about which this trial took place , stands at 299 .
Now , obviously the margin separating the two candidates is 312 .
As a result , even if everyone of the three - hundred or so ballots , for which voter registration was proven , does n't mean the witness was registered , does n't mean that the certificate was completed , it does n't mean that they only cast one ballot , but that they were at least registered .
Even if all three - hundred of those were for the appellant , and even if all three - hundred met all other requirements , it would still be impossible for the appellants to make up the difference .
Source : Minnesota Judicial Branch [ Mirror : TPT.org ]
The remainder of Elias ' time was spent discussing the finer points of due process and equal protection .
Elias contended that the discrepancies between each county served to " grease the joints " of election reporting .
He later defended any breach of due process or equal protection on the grounds that the inconsistencies were not intentional or systematic and could therefore not be classified as in bad faith or fraudulent as required within Bush vs. Gore .
Elias concluded his presentation by stating that election officials used " the different tools , available to them in the different jurisdictions " to " administer a fair election " within the confines of the law .
Mr. Friedberg then returned to the podium for the final fifteen minute stint and made three main assertions before the court adjourned .
He first presented the varying processes by which each county voided an invalid ballot , thus potentially creating cases where the voter was registered , but their vote was not counted due to a failure to comply with another statutory requirement .
Friedberg then reasoned that these registered voters should have their vote counted based upon the application of substantial compliance .
Justice
Page then questioned the lack of evidence presented by the Coleman campaign specifically relating to these uniquely registered and rejected voters .
Friedberg countered by stating that the ECC would not accept the evidence despite his effort , to the point of " test[ing ] the trial court 's patience . "
Justice Anderson then explicitly asked Friedberg if their were any instances of fraud .
Friedberg responded by simply stating " absolutely not " and added that there was no fraud of any kind ; election , voter or otherwise .
During Elias ' statement , Justice Deitzen began to muddle through the messy statute associated with the challenging of ballots ; Deitzen would later finished his line of questioning with Friedberg at the helm .
Although the statute is not definitive , the application , as implement by the Attorney General during the recount , precluded either campaign from challenging the inclusion of any absentee ballot .
This meant that once an absentee ballot was included by an election official for any reason , it would be opened and counted .
This practice differed from the in -person portion of the recount in which the campaigns were allowed to challenge the election officials ' ruling .
Upon conclusion of the hearing , Norm Coleman and Joseph Friedberg jointly addressed the media : Video : . WMV , 09:37 , 158MB
The general gist of Coleman 's address was that there are voters who have not had their vote counted , and are therefore disenfranchised ; until they are enfranchised the campaign will continue to represent the interests of these 4,400 voters .
This statement seems to align with Friedberg 's opening remarks .
Mr. Friedberg cited Minnesota 's Judicial history of addressing all problems before they reach the federal level .
Drawing from this prior statement it seems logical to conclude that if the MNSC does not address all of the problems , the Coleman campaign will seek federal relief .
Marc Elias then addressed the media after the Coleman procession exited the foyer : Video : . WMV , 04:19 , 71.1MB Marc Elias ' brief address was followed up by a few soft questions from the media .
Elias basically reiterated that he was confident of a Franken victory , but that he had no specific timeline in mind for a Supreme Court decision .
If I had to guess at a timeline I would say by July 4th , but I really have no idea ; the whole ordeal could drag out even further depending on what the MNSC concludes .
Coleman 's best case scenario is for the ECC to resume the trial with different rules and Franken 's best case scenario is an outright win .
Its also possible for this to end up in federal court as discussed above .
I doubt very much will happen within the next two weeks .
I also stopped by the Ramsey County Court House to obtain some other court documents that I 'll hopefully be able to post sooner rather than later .

The Coleman campaign filled their brief with the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 30th , the last possible day for submission .
An overview of the 62 page document is excerpted below : ISSUES PRESENTED ON APPEAL 1 )
Whether the trial court erred in excluding evidence regarding ( a ) the disparate application by election officials of the statutory standard governing absentee ballots and ( b ) the presence of illegal votes in the certified vote totals ?
Trial Court 's Ruling : Such evidence was irrelevant to whether the ballots before it were legally cast .
Apposite Authorities : Minn. Stat . § 209.12 ; U.S. Const. amend .
XIV .
2 ) Whether the trial court violated the constitutional protections of equal protection and due process when it declared Respondent received the highest number of " legally cast votes " where the record demonstrated the number of " illegally cast " ballots , under the court 's own definition , that were counted on election day and during the recount greatly exceeded the margin between the candidates ?
Trial Court 's Ruling : Already - counted absentee ballots , even if illegal under the court 's own definition , were properly included in the tally because Minnesota law does not provide any remedy for retracting such ballots from vote totals and the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that similar ballots in the same election be treated the same .

3 ) Whether the trial court violated the constitutional protections of equal protection and due process when it imposed a strict compliance standard for rejected absentee ballots rather than a substantial compliance standard like that actually applied by election officials ( and in accord with this Court 's longstanding policy favoring enfranchisement ) ?

Coleman 's initial brief " contains 13,751 words " across five sections and focuses on the five points outlined above ; the document was also written in " 13 - point Times New Roman format , " as detailed within the Certificate of Compliance at the end of the brief .
I 'll now provide a brief analysis of each of the five main points : 1 . The basis of this argument is that if different ballots were subjective to different standards , all ballots were treated differently .
Coleman argues that had the court allowed additional evidence , a more accurate definition of a legally cast vote would have been ascertained .
The Coleman campaign did not however provide any specific evidence , in this brief , to illustrate that the correlation between inconsistent standards caused any discrepancy in the final vote count .
The ECC excluded this evidence because the Coleman campaign did not show that specific ballots were miscounted .
2 . The " Coleman [ campaign ] ultimately compiled that evidence in written offers of ... more than 425 illegally cast absentee ballots counted on election day .
See , e.g. , A.570-591 ; A.709-919 . "
This number of 425 is larger than the current margin of 312 , but election history and apportionment would indicate that a much larger number of illegally cast and counted votes would be required to alter the outcome ; especially given the apparent randomness of the illegally counted ballots proposed by Coleman .
3 . Each and every ballot that was counted by an election official , using any standard , could have been presented to the ECC for review by the Coleman campaign .
The very purpose of the ECC is to act as the final arbiter for any contention raised by any participating party ; their jurisdiction implies the existence of a uniform standard .
If a ballot is presented to the ECC it receives uniform treatment under the strict compliance standard ; if a given ballot is not alleged to contain errors , it is assumed to have been properly counted by the local election official under the strict compliance standard as dictated under MN Law .
If a uniform standard was not applied by the local election officials , it was the responsibility of the Coleman campaign to flag the error for correction by the ECC ; a mechanism which satisfies equal protection .
4 . The Coleman campaign never presented any compelling evidence to suggest that double counting occurred .
They presented a fairly limited number of precincts exhibiting overcounts ( more votes than voters ) and attempted to imply that double counting only occurred to the detriment of candidate Coleman ; they did not however provide any concrete reasoning to support this claim either through evidence or witness testimony .
Their double counting argument might have been more effective had they addressed all [ PDF ] overcounted precincts .
Lets also not forget that the MNSC previously issued a non-binding order , before the ECC , addressing the flimsiness of the double counting evidence presented by the Coleman campaign .
5 . The MN State Canvassing Board determined that the Election Night totals from Minneapolis W3 - P1 should be used due to missing ballots and the ECC later adopted the Canvassing Board 's stance .
Without very compelling new evidence , which so far has n't been presented , the MNSC is not going to overturn the opinion of these two election governing bodies .
The Franken campaign 's response on May 11th mirrored the organization of the Coleman 's effort and also came on the last day of the designated timeline .
The Franken response contains a direct rebuttal of the five previous points , as excerpted below : RESTATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED 1 )
Whether the trial court acted within its discretion when it excluded cumulative and irrelevant evidence that would not have affected the outcome of the trial .
Trial Court 's Ruling :
On multiple grounds , the evidence was properly excluded .
Authorities : State v. AmoJ , 6.58 N.W.2d 201,203 ( Minn. 2003 ) ; Minn. R. Civ. P. 61 . 2 ) Whether the trial court acted within its discretion when it prohibited Appellants from presenting evidence that had never been disclosed in discovery , where the effect was to preclude a claim that was procedurally barred , factually unsupported , and without legal merit .
Trial Court 's Ruling : Appellants not only failed to meet their burden of proving that certain accepted absentee ballots affected the outcome of the election ; they also waived these claims by failing to comply with discovery obligations .
Authorities : Minn .
Twim P'sbip v. Hatch , .592 N.W.2d 847 , 850 ( Minn. 1999 ) ; Hahn v. Graham , 225 N.W.2d 385,386 ( Minn. 1975 ) .
3 ) Whether the trial court was correct to judge the acceptability of absentee ballots under Minnesota statutes and case law , rather than under an invented standard that finds no support in the statutes , the Constitution , or the facts , where the party advocating the alternative , invented standard inadequately raised the claim and presented insufficient proof in support .
Ruling : Appellants ' claims fail on multiple grounds , and , in any event , Minnesota law governs the treatment of absentee ballots .
Authorities : Cranford v. Marion County Election Bd. , 128 S. Ct. 1610 ( 2008 ) ; Bell v. Gannaway , 227 N.W.2d 797 ( Minn. 1975 ) ; Minn. Stat. §§ 203B.02 et seq .
4 ) Whether the trial court acted within its discretion when it determined that Appellants had failed to show a need for certain pretrial inspections .
Trial Court 's Ruling :
On multiple grounds , Appellants failed to meet their burden .
Authorities : Minn. Stat. § 209.06 .
5 ) Whether the trial court properly refused to overturn the certification by the State Canvassing Board , where the latter had determined , after a hearing and on advice of the Attorney General , that the Election Day returns were the best evidence of the votes in a certain Minneapolis precinct .
Ruling : The Board acted correctly and Appellants presented insufficient evidence to overturn its certification .
Authorities : Moon v. Harris , 142 N.W. 12 ( Minn. 1913 ) .

The Franken campaign basically took Coleman 's argument and added a " no " or a " not " to the beginning and provided the typical supporting legal references .
This is by no means unexpected , but it highlights the futility of Coleman 's appeal .
The Coleman campaign 's best case scenario has shifted away from that of winning to that of not - losing ; an invalidation seems to be their best case scenario .
The Franken campaign is simply attempting to eliminate that possibility .
On an interesting side note , the Franken response " contain[ed ] 13,998 words " about 200 more than Coleman 's first brief , but the Franken campaign chose to use the " Garamond font , " instead of Times New Roman as the Coleman campaign used .
The Coleman campaign responded with their reply brief on May 15th , again the last day of the deadline : CONCLUSION In order to satisfy Minn .
Stat . § 209.12 and the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process , the Court should vacate the order for judgment and reverse and remand with instructions to count the remaining absentee ballots cast by eligible voters who substantially complied with the directives of Minn.
Stat. § 203B .12 . Dated : May 15 , 2009 Source : Appellant 's Reply Brief [ PDF ]
Parsing through all the legal pretense reveals the core of Coleman 's strategy ; to count sum " 4,400 " absentee ballots that have yet to be counted .
Whether Coleman can legally justify the counting is a different matter ; he seems to be using the one wrong needs another wrong to make a right approach .
Illegal ballots were probably counted , and the only way to counteract the problem is by counting more illegally counted ballots .
My pragmatic solution is take the 4,400 absentee ballots and separate them into piles of lawlessness ; then you count the most legal pile , then the next most legal and so on and so forth until it matters , or perhaps it wo n't .
The counting process would have to be done blindly so that only the MNSC would know the result of each pile .
If the entire batch of 4,400 is iterated through , degree by degree , and Franken still leads , the legality is moot ; grant Coleman 's central request and then declare Franken the winner .
If the counting of these 4,400 alters the outcome , then the lawyers can fight about whatever their side needs to fight about , but at least we know the legal battle has a purpose .
Coleman is currently down by 312 votes , and I highly doubt he could overcome this deficit within the 4,400 currently rejected and likely illegally cast ballots his campaign seeks to enfranchise .
The Coleman campaign 's requested remedy may not even matter at this point , but its their best shot and both campaigns know it .

Last Friday the MN Supreme Court released their schedule for the MN Senate appeals process ; the entire order is excerpted below : ORDER On Monday , April 20 , 2009 , appellants Cullen Sheehan and Norm Coleman filed a notice of appeal from the judgment entered by the three - judge panellin Ramsey County District Court in the above - referenced election contest On Tuesday , April 21 , 2009 , respondent AI Franken filed and served a motion for expedited briefing and proposed a particular briefing schedule ; appellants filed a written response and proposed briefing schedule on Wednesday , April 22 .

R. Civ. App. P. 134 . 5 . Respondent 's motion for expedited briefing is otherwise denied .
Dated : April 24 , 2009 Source : Order of Scheduling via MNCourts.gov
The MNSC essentially adopted the Coleman campaign 's requested timeline for briefing submissions while delaying the oral arguments for roughly two weeks beyond the final submission deadline .
The first document is due this Thursday from the Coleman campaign with the Franken response due two weeks hence on the 11th of May .
At that point the Coleman campaign will have 4 days to submit a final reply brief before the proceedings adjourn until June 1st ; the day allocated for oral arguments .

Yesterday the Franken Campaign presented their pre-litigation timeline , and today the Coleman campaign responded : Appellants agree this is a time - sensitive case that should be resolved as expeditiously as possible , Appellants respectfully submit , however , that the parties , and the Court , must be given enough time to fully develop and consider the issues on appeal .
Accordingly , Appellants respectfully request a slight modification to the briefing schedule proposed by Respondent as follows : 1 . Opening brief of Appellants - April 30 , 2009 ; 2 . Opposition brief of Respondent - May 11 , 2009 ; and 3 .
Reply brief - May 15 , 2009 .
The Court may then schedule oral argument at a time convenient to it .
Dated : April 22 , 2009 Source : Appellants ' Response to Respondent 's Motion for Expedited Schedule via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
The schedule above concludes on May 15th , a Friday , which seems to suggest that oral arguments would begin the following Monday , May 18th .
The Coleman timeline is about two weeks longer than Franken 's timeline ; this discrepancy manifests itself at each stage of the pre-litigation process .
It appears as though the Coleman campaign wants 3 more days to file their initial brief , above and beyond the schedule already outlined by the Franken campaign .
It 's also interesting to note that the Coleman schedule allows about ten days for the Franken response , while the Franken campaign only indicated that they would need five days .
The Coleman campaign also increased their reply time by two days beyond Franken 's proposition .
It would make sense for the court to grant Coleman the additional time he is requesting for his own case , but to follow the schedule presented by Franken for deadlines that apply to Franken .
It does n't make sense to allocate ten days when they ( Franken ) said they could do it in five .
I think the court will ultimately compromise between the two campaign 's requests ; thus resulting in an oral argument start date of May 11th .
The Franken campaign also filed a motion with the MN Supreme Court today , although theirs was comparatively meaningless : David L Lillehaug does hereby move the Court , pursuant to Minn. R Civ. App , P 127 and 143.05 , subd .
1 , for admission of Marc E. Elias and Kevin J. Hamilton as attorneys pro hac vice to appear before this honorable Court on behalf of Respondent Al Franken in the above - captioned matter , This motion is based upon all files , records and proceedings herein , as well as the attached Affidavits of Marc E. Elias and Kevin J. Hamilton .
This motion is submitted on the papers , and oral argument is expressly waived .
Dated : April 22 , 2009 Source : Respondents 's Motion to Admit Attorney 's Pro Hac Vice via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
Marc Elias and Kevin Hamilton both actively participated in the Election Contest Court ; this is simply a procedural motion that will grant these two attorneys the privilege of practicing law before the Minnesota Supreme Court .
Marc Elias is registered with the DC Bar , while Kevin Hamilton is registered with the Washington State Bar .
The MN Supreme Court will probably present the official appeal timeline / schedule within the next few days at which point the litigation process begins , again , although slightly different in nature and much shorter .
Update [ 3:47 AM CT 4/24/2009 ] : The Supreme Court has granted Franken 's request for the admission of two lawyers pro hac vice .
This order really is n't a suprise , but I guess it brings the resolution just a little closer : ORDER Based upon all the files , records and proceedings herein , IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion of David L Lillehaug to admit Marc E. Elias and Kevin J. Hamilton , Perkins Coie , LLP , pro hac vice in the above entitled matter be , and the same is , granted .

The bulk of the proceedings will occur out of court , through the exchange of filings , and will culminate with oral arguments presented by each campaign in public court .
In previous MN Supreme Court cases relating to this election , the oral arguments have been scheduled for a single hour ; the court may however allocate more time as they deem necessary .
This is not a typical trial format , once the oral arguments conclude , the court will deliberate until a decision is reached .
The schedule will effectively dictate the duration of the trial , unfortunately the court has not released their final timeline ; but I 'm sure its in the works .

The Coleman campaign filed their motion for appeal yesterday , and today the Franken campaign responded with the following requests : Cullen Sheehan and Norm Coleman ( " Appellants " ) have appealed the unanimous decision of the three - judge election contest court ( " the District Court " ) , which , after a seven week trial , affirmed the unanimous Minnesota State Canvassing Board certification that Al Franken ( " Respondent " ) received the highest number of votes in the 2008 general election for the office of United States Senator .
Because of the overriding public interest in the expeditious handling and resolution of this historic matter , Respondent respectfully moves for an order that :
1 . The record of the District Court proceedings be provided to the Court by the close of business tomorrow , Wednesday , April 22 , 2008 ; 2 . Briefing be expedited pursuant to the schedule below , so that the case will be ready for argument twelve calendar days following provision of the record , or Monday , May 4 , 2008 ; and 3 .
A date for oral argument be set such that the case will be argued promptly after briefing is complete .
This motion is made pursuant to Minn .
Stat § 209.09 , subds .
2 & 4 , Minn. R. Civ App. P. 102 and 126 , and the Court 's inherent authority .
GROUNDS FOR MOTION
Under the United States Constitution , Minnesota is entitled to be represented by two United States Senators , Minnesota has been without its second Senator for more than 100 days ,
In a trial that lasted seven weeks , Appellants were given every opportunity to make their case to the District Court In its unanimous decision , the District Court declared that Respondent is entitled to the certificate of election .
Now , because of the important public policy concern of ensuring that the interests of the citizens of Minnesota are properly represented in Congress , this appeal should be expedited .
... 1 . Expedite the Preparation and Filing of the Record . ... 2 . Expedite the Briefing Schedule . ...
Accordingly , Respondent suggests the following briefing timeline : A. Opening brief of Appellants - Monday , April 27 , 2009 , five calendar days after delivery of the record ; B , Opposition brief of Respondent - Saturday , May 2 , 2009 , five calendar days after service of the opening brief ; and C. Reply brief - Monday , May 4 , 2009 , two calendar days after service of the opposition brief .
3 . Set an Expedited Date for Oral Argument .
Respondent respectfully suggests that the Court schedule oral argument now for a date very shortly after the reply brief is submitted .
More than five full months have elapsed since the November 4 , 2008 , general election .
More than three months have elapsed since the State Canvassing Board declared the election result and the United States Senate convened to address the nation 's urgent business .
Yet , unlike every other state in the union , Minnesota stands alone with only a single United States Senator to represent its citizens and respond to their concerns .
While Appellants had the right to challenge the State Canvassing Board 's decision before three judges and now have the right to appeal the District Court 's unanimous decision rejecting their claims , Respondent submits that the overriding public interest in resolving this dispute promptly requires that this appeal be expedited .

The Franken campaign is seeking to accelerate the litigation proceedings to the greatest extent possible ; they cite several Minnesota Statues , which I detailed yesterday , that give precedent to this election contest appeal .
It should also be noted that the MN Supreme Court arranges their own schedule in accordance with Rule 102 of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure .
I am however sure , that the MN Supreme Court will address this appeal in the most efficient manner possible .
The Franken campaign is pushing for a May 4th start date , and their request seems reasonable given the circumstances .
If I had to bet , I would say that May 4th would be the absolute soonest the oral arguments could start , with May 11th , the following Monday , presenting as another realistic start date .

The representation of Norm Coleman has filed paper work with the Minnesota Supreme Court appealing the decision of the Election Contest Court .
The filings came in the form of three documents , each of which I will highlight below .
The first document is the Notice of Appeal : TO : Clerk of the Appellate Courts

The second document contains 10 items that more or less summarize the appeal .
Some of these items are simply procedural while others contain useful information .
Section 5 is by far the most relevant as it directly lists the claims that the Coleman campaign is actually appealing ; I 've excerpted all of section 5 and the headings of the other 9 sections below : 1 . COURT OF CASE ORIGINATION AND NAME OF PRESIDING JUDGE 2 .

The most interesting point of appeal comes from section 5.2 and seems to highlight Norm Coleman 's attempt to invalidate the election , rather than prevail as the top vote - getter .
This marks the first time , that I can recall , where the Coleman campaign has sought relief that would not result in him being declared the winner .
The other four items in this section do however encompass the potential addition or subtraction of votes , that could result in Coleman taking the lead , albeit it unlikely .
The final document is simply the judgment entered by the ECC last Monday that asserted Franken 's victory by 312 votes .
I assume , that when filing an appeal , you must file the judgment which you are actually appealing .
Any future court filings will be filed on the MN Supreme Court litigation page ; a change from the previous ECC litigation website .
I have no idea when the actual litigation process will begin , although , according to MN § 209.10.4 , " the appeal from an election contest relating to the office of state senator or representative takes precedence over all other matters before the Supreme Court . "
MN § 209.10.4 further pertains " to a contest regarding a statewide office " as noted within MN § 209.09 ; this classification includes the US Senate Election .
Although the appeal will have precedence , I would still expect the Franken campaign to push for an expedited schedule .
Update [ 7:38 PM CT ] : I found other relevant law ( § 209.09 ) that applied to § 209.10.4 and thus establishes the election contest appeal as paramount to MN Supreme Court 's duties .
I 've updated the article to clarify and reflect these changes .

A relatively quiet week ensued , after the Election Contest Court 's Monday ruling , but a few pertinent if seemingly unrelated events did transpire .
I 'll cover two events , as reported by the two major Minnesota papers , and present the time frame for Norm Coleman 's potential appeal to the MN Supreme Court .
Our first event features a meeting between Norm Coleman and the Minneapolis Star Tribune 's Editorial Board .
The meeting took place on April 16th , and a small portion of the video has been posted online at the Star Tribune website .
The excerpt shows Norm Coleman visibly upset over the Star Tribune 's conduct , with regard to the allegations of money laundering , in the days directly preceding the election .
I covered the allegations back in November , if you 're curious about the back story .
It 'll be interesting to see if the Star Tribune alters their reporting procedures in the coming weeks to make amends ; even though they already tend to lean right .
Our next story involves another act of vandalism levied against Norm Coleman 's house ; as reported by the Pioneer Press : St. Paul police are investigating after eggs were thrown at former U.S. Sen .
Norm Coleman 's house in the Crocus Hill neighborhood .
It happened about 9:20 p.m. Tuesday , according to a police report that recorded the incident as misdemeanor criminal damage to property .
After eggs had hit the front door of Coleman 's home in the 600 block of Osceola Avenue , a resident of the home saw a man who appeared to be in his 20s outside , said Peter Panos , police spokesman .
The report did n't say who the resident was or whether Coleman was home , Panos said today .
The resident then saw the man throw a few more eggs , Panos said .
The number of eggs thrown was n't in the report , he said .
The egg thrower was n't caught , Panos said .
Coleman said Wednesday that a young man had bicycled past his home this week and thrown eggs at him .
... Republican Coleman has said he will appeal this week 's court ruling that Democrat Al Franken won last year 's U.S. Senate race .
Source : St. Paul Pioneer Press
I do n't know if this is particularly important , but it happened , so I 'm reporting it .
The last line of the excerpt does however provide a perfect segue .
Norm Coleman , lost his election contest , and now he has the opportunity to appeal the ECC 's ruling ; which he has indicated he will do .
Let 's began by looking at the relevant law proscribing the time frame in which an appeal must occur : Subd .
4 .Appeal .
The judge 's decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court no later than ten days after its entry in the case of a general election contest or five days after its entry in the case of a primary contest .
The record on appeal must be made , certified , and filed in the Supreme Court within 15 days after service of notice of appeal .
The appellant shall file in the district court a bond of $ 500 for the payment of respondent 's costs if appellant fails on appeal .
The appeal from an election contest relating to the office of state senator or representative takes precedence over all other matters before the Supreme Court .
A copy of the decision must be forwarded to the chief clerk of the house of representatives or the secretary of the senate , as appropriate .
Source : § 209.10 , 2008 Minnesota Statutes
We know that Coleman has " ten days " to appeal , but the above article makes no reference to calendar days , business days or whatever ; so the question then becomes , when does the tenth day occur ?
Another Minnesota Statute seems to outline the proper interpretation : 6.01 Computation
In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules , by the local rules of any district court , by order of court , or by any applicable statute , the day of the act , event , or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included .
The last day of the period so computed shall be included , unless it is a Saturday , a Sunday , or a legal holiday , or , when the act to be done is the filing of a paper in court , a day on which weather or other conditions have made the office of the court administrator inaccessible , in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not one of the aforementioned days .
When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than seven days , intermediate Saturdays , Sundays , and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation .
As used in this rule and in Rule 77 ( c ) , " legal holiday " includes any holiday defined or designated by statute .
Source : Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure
The ten day appeal period began on Tuesday , April 14th because the day of the ruling , Monday , " shall not be included . "
It 's not clear whether the judgment was actually legally entered on Monday , as MN Rule 58.01 dictates that order " shall be entered forthwith by the court administrator " , which may or may not be the date of filing .
There may exist other legal contingencies that could extend the start date for the appeal window .
If we assume that the judgment took effect on Monday April 13th , that makes the tenth day Thursday , April 23th as weekends and legal holidays are included because the prescribed time is more than seven days .
Therefore , the Notice of Appeal must be filled on or before Thursday , April , 23 ; unless weather or other extenuating circumstances arise which facilitate the closure of the court offices .
In this event , the Notice of Appeal must be filed on the next day the court office is open and this " next day " can not be a weekend or a legal holiday .
I doubt , the Coleman campaign is in a hurry to file their appeal , my guess is at least Wednesday .
In the mean time , Franken will still not be seated in the US Senate without an Election Certificate which , according to MN § 204C.40 , cannot be issued until after " a court of proper jurisdiction has finally determined the contest . "
In the case of an appeal , this would be the MN Supreme Court .
If by next Thursday ( or Friday ) , an appeal is not filed by the Coleman campaign , a Minnesota Election Certificate could be legally issued to Al Franken .
Update [ 9:31 PM CT ] : I clarified some of the appeal deadlines and accounted for other contingencies that could alter the window for appeal .

The 2008 Minnesota Senate Election officially has a winner , at least according to the Election Contest Tribunal .
The three judge ECC issued a 68 page order late Monday declaring Franken the winner .
The body of the order is excerpted below : ORDER FOR JUDGMENT
Based on the above findings of fact and conclusions of law , and pursuant to Minn .
Stat . § 209.12 , the Court DECIDES , DECLARES , AND ADJUDGES that Contestee Al Franken is the party to the contest who received the highest number of votes legally cast in the 2008 United States Senate general election and is therefore entitled to receive the certificate of election .
Accordingly , IT IS ORDERED that : 1 . Contestants ' Notice of Contest is dismissed with prejudice ; 2 . Contestee 's Counterclaims are dismissed without prejudice as moot ; 3 . Pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 209.07 , subd .
3 , costs of the contest must be paid by Contestants , and Contestee and the Court shall prove up the applicable costs by affidavit after all proceedings in this matter are concluded ; and 4 .
For the reasons stated in the Court 's Order of March 2 , 2009 , imposing a sanction on Contestants , Contestee is awarded his reasonable costs and attorneys ' fees in connection with Contestants ' failure to disclose , such costs and fees to be proved up by affidavit .
5 . Any request for relief in these proceedings not specifically granted herein is denied .
There being no just reason for delay , LET JUDGMENT BE ENTERED ACCORDINGLY Dated : April 13 2009 Source : Findings of Fact , Conclusions of Law , and Order for Judgment via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
Before the above order , the ECC presented 157 individual findings of fact over 24 pages .
Finding # 120 addresses the missing ballots in Minneapolis W3 - P1 and findings # 137 and # 138 detail the voters whose ballots were opened and counted on April 7th : 120 .
Given the evidence presented , the Court finds that 132 ballots from Minneapolis Precinct 3 - 1 were cast and properly counted on Election Day and were lost at some point after they were counted on Election Day but before the administrative recount .
... 137 . The evidence was sufficient to prove that the absentee ballots of the persons identified in Attachment A were legally cast and wrongfully rejected .
138 .
The following additions shall be made to the vote totals certified by the Board on January 5 , 2009 : 111 additional votes for Coleman and 198 additional votes for Franken .

Attachment
A contains the names and counties of 351 voters , along with a reference to the exhibit or court document in which they were originally presented .
A greater majority of the exhibit reference appear to begin with an " F , " meaning that the Franken campaign originally presented that voter 's absentee ballot .
This is not however a scientific analysis , simply a brief observation .
I 'll digitize the document later and provide an exact count at a later date .
Follwing the findings of fact , the court then presented two memorandums addressing specific , yet unresolved issues .
The first memorandum is entitled " RULE 9 / DOUBLE COUNTING MEMORANDUM " and can be characterized from the following excerpts on page 30 and 31 of the order , respectively :
Any argument that Contestants did not realize that Rule 9 might lead to possible " double counting " of ballots has been waived by their conduct and delay in raising this issue .
This court emphasized in earlier orders that this is an expedited proceeding .
Contestants ' unreasonably delayed raising their claim and are now barred from asserting it .
...
This Court received evidence that it is not uncommon for discrepancies to exist between the number of ballots cast in a precinct and the number of voters shown on Election Day rosters .
These Election Day discrepancies can be caused by voters failing to sign rosters before voting and election judges failing to mark the acceptance of absentee ballots on the rosters .
The Court cannot conclude that double counting occurred simply because the number of votes counted during the recount is greater than the number of voters on the rosters .
Source : Findings of Fact , Conclusions of Law , and Order for Judgment via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
Basically the court acknowledged that discrepancies between the number of physical voters and the number of physical votes existed , but the court was unmoved by the Contestant 's [ Coleman ] attempts to prove that these discrepancies were caused by double counting .
The next memorandum is entitled " EQUAL PROTECTION MEMORANDUM , " and as you might guess , deals with Coleman 's equal protection claim .
The court first summarized Coleman 's argument on page 33 and then states , on page 37 , that the proper jurisdiction for this argument lies within the US Senate : I. Introduction Contestants argue that similarly - situated absentee ballots were treated differently throughout Minnesota 's counties and cities , and that this inconsistent treatment implicates the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions .
The Court reviewed this argument respectfully in light of the mandates of the United States Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution that all persons similarly - situated be treated alike under the law .
See U.S. CONST . amend .
XIV , § 1 ; MINN .
CONST .
Art. 1 , § 2 . ... Thus , to the extent Contestants ' equal protection argument alleges " deliberate , serious , and material violation [s ] " of Minnesota 's election laws , this Court lacks jurisdiction to make findings or conclusions on these points and the matter is preserved for the United States Senate .
See Minn. Stat . § 209.12 ( " Evidence ... including ... the question of the right of any person to nomination or office on the ground of deliberate , serious , and material violation of the provisions of the Minnesota Election Law , must be taken and preserved by the judge trying the contest .
.. . " ) ; U.S. CONST .
Art. 1 , § 5 , Cl. 1 ( " Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections , Returns and Qualifications of its own Members . " ) ; see also Odegard v. Olson , 119 N.W.2d 717 , 719 ( Minn. 1963 ) .
The Minnesota Supreme Court recently addressed this issue directly and ruled as follows :
When the election contest concerns a congressional office , the only question to be decided is which candidate received the highest number of votes legally cast at the election .
Minn. Stat. § 209.12 ( 2008 ) .
Nevertheless , evidence on any other issues specified in the notice of election contest is to be preserved and forwarded to the presiding officer of the Senate or House of Representatives of the United States , as the case may be .
Id. Coleman v. Ritchie , 762 N.W.2d 218 , 226 ( Minn. 2009 ) .

The equal protection memorandum continues until page 56 and addresses many of Coleman 's additional claim 's by essentially stating that the 2008 Minnesota Senate Election administration was conducted in accordance with the US Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution .
The ECC concluded their order by stating the following :
The citizens of Minnesota should be proud of their election system .
Minnesota has one of the highest voter - participation rates in the country .
The Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State and election officials throughout Minnesota 's counties and cities are well - trained , fair , and conscientious and performed their duties admirably .
Minnesota could not conduct elections without the hard work and diligence of its dedicated professionals and citizen volunteers , and the Court is proud of their service .

All that remains is for Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( R ) and SOS Mark Ritchie ( D ) to sign the Election Certificate as directed , although not legally obligated , by the above order .
Coleman has 10 days to file an appeal to the MN Supreme Court , but the ECC states that the US Senate has the ultimate jurisdiction .
Al Franken officially received more votes than any other candidate , but his path to the US Senate may still be lined with political obstacles .
The Coleman campaign has already acknowledged their intent to appeal , and there are rumors that Tim Pawlenty may not sign the certificate until the appeals process has ended .
In any case , Al Franken received the most votes , by 312 , for US Senate in the State of Minnesota on November 4th , 2008 .
Update [ 3:08 AM CT ] : I went ahead and parsed through Attachment A [ CSV ] and the results were mildly surprising : Record # Ballots Coleman : 110 Franken : 193 ( 194 ) Nauen : 36 ( 37 ) Contestee 's SJ : 10 Testimony : 1 Total : 351
The parentheses denote a voter who was listed within both a Franken Exhibit and a Nauen Summary Judgment order .
More than half of the 351 absentee ballots contained within Attachment A originated from evidence presented by the Franken Campaign .
It 's interesting to note that the number of ballots accepted from each campaign almost identically replicates the final result of the 351 ballots ; the final allocation was Coleman 111 , Franken 198 and 42 to Other .
The most interesting inclusion does however come from a Coleman presented witness .
If you recall from the litigation proceedings , Robert Peter DeMuth filled out his voter registration form with the aid of a computer by digitally signing his absentee ballot request form .
Mr. DeMuth 's ballot was included in the ECC certified result as the ECC only required that the voter sign the physical envelope ; which Mr. DeMuth apparently did .

On Tuesday , April 7th , the MN Senate Election Contest Court sat down at 9:30 AM CT with 387 absentee ballots and began the tedious process of opening , sorting and counting their contents .
The counting process did not began for some time , but when it did , the court had identified 351 ballots which merited inclusion into the vote tally .
The ECC court released the following order detailing the specific voters contained within the 351 identified ballots :
This matter comes before the Court after its review of certain original absentee ballot materials pursuant to this Court 's Order for Delivery of Ballots to Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State for Review by the Court .
After review , IT IS HEREBY ORDERED : 1 . The absentee ballots in the attached Exhibit A shall be opened and counted in accordance with Paragraph 4 of the Court 's Order for Delivery of Ballots to Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State for Review by the Court .
2 . Any other relief not fully set forth herein is expressly denied .
Dated : April 7 , 2009 [ Exhibit A : List of 351 Voter 's Names and County , CSV ]
Source : Order for Opening and Counting of Ballots via MNCourts.gov
Parsing through the list revealed that 41 of the 42 Nauen Petitioner 's identified within the ECC 's request were also listed within the ECC 's order for opening and counting .
Each of the 41 voter 's is assumed to have voted for Franken because the Franken campaign was funding their intervention .
This leaves 310 voters with unknown allegiances ; 10 of the 12 voter 's identified within Contestee 's [ Franken ] Partial Summary Judgment are also listed within this 310 vote subset .
I updated my extrapolation to account for the 41 Nauen Petitioner 's and the remaining 310 voters ; I assume that the Nauen voters will break for Franken in a 90 - 5 - 5 fashion and that the 10 Partial Summary Judgement voters have no inclination to vote for one candidate or another : Extrapolations : ECC Accepts 351 Additional Absentee Ballots [ PDF , 141KB ] Identified Extrapolation Voters Coleman Franken ECC Ordered Opened 310 130.66 129.33 Coleman Regions 190 91.85 66.61 Franken Regions 120 38.82 62.72 Nauen Petitioners 41 2.05 36.90 Newly Orded 6 .30 5.40 Previously Ordered 35 1.75 31.50 Extrapolation Total 351 132.71 166.23 Actual Result 351 111 198
The Pioneer Press and the Star Tribune have both reported that the final resolution of these 351 ballots resulted in Franken increasing his lead by 87 votes from 225 , to 312 .
At this point it seems unlikely that further ballots will be opened and counted , but the possibility does remain .
The ECC also has yet to address the 133 ( or 134 ) lost ballots in Minneapolis W3 - P1 and any remedy to the Coleman campaign 's argument of double counted ballots .
It seems unlikely that a ruling will be released today , as the ECC just released an order clarifying the resolution of the Nauen Petitioners :

The above order details the 36 petitioner 's listed within previous orders granting the opening and counting of their ballots , a number I arrived at on Monday .
The final count , as noted above , included 35 of the 36 plus 6 other petitioners who had not previously been granted relief .
This brings the grand total of relieved Nauen Petitioners to 41 .
I 've updated my Nauen voter table to reflect the result of the counting procedure ; the contents of this most recent order did not reveal any new information .
It simply outlined the result of the Nauen Petitioner 's and dismissed the remaining petitioner 's request for relief : Extrapolation : Nauen Petitioners and ECC Ordered Opened & Counted Aftermath [ PDF , 125KB ]
Despite the ECC 's detailed and straightforward resolution of the Nauen Petioners , Rachel E. Stassen - Berger of the St. Paul Pioneer Press still managed to a provide inaccurate information :
The order the court did issue today dismissed the case of the voters who sued on their own but have n't had their ballots counted .
Sixty - one voters sued early this year to have their absentee ballot votes counted .
That suit , which was funded by Franken , was folded into Coleman 's larger suit .
Thirty - six of those voters had their ballots opened and counted on Tuesday , along with 315 other absentee ballots .
The results on those ballots boosted Franken 's lead to 312 votes .
Today , the judges said that the case of the other 25 votes was dismissed .
[ emphasis added to depict inaccuracies ]
Source : St. Paul Pioneer Press Rachel 's entire article contained just 217 words , but three glaring inaccuracies : 1 . There were 64 Nauen petitioners , not " sixty - one ; " although three voters did eventually withdraw their claim .

2 . Forty - one of the Nauen petitioners eventually had their vote counted ; the " thirty - six " Rachel presents originates from today 's order and tells me that she cannot read footnotes .
Thirty - six voters were originally presented , but Roxanna Saad 's ballot was never counted because it did not contain a completed voter registration form .
3 . The " 25 " other votes should actually read 23 , but its hard to get this number right , when the two previous numbers were completely wrong ; 64-41=23 .
The ECC will probably present their ruling some time next week , at that point , the loser will have 10 days to present an appeal to the MN Supreme Court .

Before the court even begins counting tomorrow morning , thirteen ballots will be eliminated from their original request of 400 .
The Star Tribune is reporting , by way of the Deputy Secretary of State , that 13 of the 400 ballots have already been counted and were erroneously requested due to clerical errors .
The relevant portion of the Star Tribune article is excerpted below : Deputy Secretary of State Jim Gelbmann said Monday that 13 of the 400 ballots on the judges ' list had already been counted , on Election Day or during the recount , putting the number of ballots that might be added at 387 .
Once opened , outside envelopes -- which contain voters ' names -- will be separated from the security envelopes that contain the original ballots , said Secretary of State Mark Ritchie .
Poser will then sort the ballots into three piles -- Franken , Coleman and other .
Source : Minneapolis Star Tribune
This reduction of the potential pool of additional , countable absentee ballots will likely facilitate an MN Supreme Court appeal by Norm Coleman as the number of physical ballots quickly approaches his current deficit .
Once the ballots are counted , hopefully by the end of tomorrow , the court still has other issues to confront before they present their ruling .
Once the ECC determines the victor , the loser will have 10 days to appeal to the MN Supreme Court .
In other related news , the Franken campaigns has asked the court to allow another attorney , Lisa Marshall Manheim from Seattle , WA to practice before the court : Contestee Al Franken hereby moves for permission for Lisa Marshall Manheim , attorney with Perkins Coie LLP , to practice before this Court pro hac vice in this matter .
