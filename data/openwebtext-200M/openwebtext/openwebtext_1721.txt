The News Media at War
Ed : As AE911 Truth makes many efforts to promote its mission among and through the mainstream media , this article offers some reasons why that has proven to be a daunting and largely unsuccessful effort .
For many Americans , one of the strongest reasons for accepting the official story about the shocking events of Sept. 11 , 2001 , is their deep - seated belief in the free press .
We are taught from an early age that the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution guarantees us many cherished freedoms , among which is freedom of the press .
If there were really any serious problems with the official 9 - 11 explanation , many Americans reason , this information would n't go unreported for long in our media - saturated society .
Major news organizations such as CNN , Time , and the New York Times would most certainly investigate and report any serious problems almost immediately .
Nearly all major American news organizations have embraced the government 's version of events with few questions asked .
Consequently , many Americans naturally conclude that it 's safe to accept the official story at face value .
There is a very serious flaw in this line of reasoning , however : The United States is at war and , for nearly a hundred years , the U.S. government , major media companies and leading journalists have joined forces with the military during wars and other national emergencies to shape public opinion by carefully controlling what Americans are told about world events .
Especially since World War I , whenever the U.S. government has chosen to take the nation to war , or to address some other major emergency , it has quietly called upon top journalists and media executives to help overcome anti-war sentiment , promote popular hostility toward a designated enemy , or simply calm public anxieties .
This may seem surprising to many readers , so it is worth reviewing a few historical examples of such media - government collusion .
Because deception is a fundamental technique of warfare , military organizations have sought control over war - related information virtually since the dawn of human history .
The Chinese writer Sun Tzu put it well in his classic work , The Art of War : “ All war is based on deception , ” he wrote .
“ Therefore , when capable , feign incapacity ; when active , inactivity .
When near , make it appear that you are far away ; when far away , that you are near .
Offer the enemy a bait to lure him ; feign disorder and strike him . ”
1
In modern times , deception has always employed two fundamental stages : censorship followed by propaganda .
Censorship deprives the public and enemies of accurate information about what is taking place .
Once this information vacuum has been created , propaganda is injected into this conceptual void , thus creating a false but entirely believable picture of events .
In the age of mass media , this simply could n't be achieved without the assistance of major news organizations , journalists , and other communication outlets .
Thus , governments nearly always appeal to these organizations for help in this complex task .
The British Empire , which once ruled much of the planet , was for some centuries among the most skilled practitioners of this dark art .
Unlike revolutionary America , imperial Britain never embraced the notion of a free press , since centralized control of news and information was essential to its global deception activities .
According to Philip Knightly , author of The First Casualty : From Crimea to Vietnam : The War Correspondent as Hero , Propagandist , and Myth Maker , Britain was so skilled in the use of propaganda during World War I that it became a major inspiration for the later efforts of Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels .
2
The keystone to British deception plans was always a close but clandestine working relationship with newspaper publishers and other media organizations .
A War to End All Wars
Prior to World War I , when America 's imperial aspirations were still relatively modest , the U.S. military was correspondingly unsophisticated in the uses of deception .
With the coming of World Wars I and II , however , this situation changed drastically , mainly through the assistance of British intelligence which tutored its American counterparts , largely out of a desire for self - preservation .
In the early years of World War I , Britain was locked in a military stalemate with Germany from which it could not extricate itself without help from the United States .
There was one problem , however : American citizens were overwhelmingly opposed to involvement in the war .
To alter America public opinion and bring the U.S. into the war on its side , Britain retargeted its propaganda machine toward North America .
It also urged the U.S. government to create a home - grown censorship and propaganda apparatus , which it soon did with help from U.S. media organizations and journalists .
First , though , the U.S. government cracked down on the anti-war press and public dissent using the then newly passed Espionage and Sedition Acts .
3
This nearly did away with free speech .
Once it was certain Americans could get little accurate news about the senseless bloodbath taking place across the Atlantic , President Wilson , largely through the influence of journalist and public - relations expert Walter Lippmann , soon set about creating a vast American propaganda machine similar to Britain's .
Wilson , in what could be viewed as a political masterstroke , hired the noted progressive journalist George Creel to build and manage the new U.S. propaganda bureaucracy .
This gave the organization instant credibility with the public and helped Creel recruit more top journalists into the program .
The new institution was given the innocent - sounding name , “ the U.S. Committee on Public Information ( CPI ) . ”
Creel staffed his new propaganda team with experts from all aspects of the U.S. media industry .
Virtually all available modes of communication were soon put to work selling the war to the American public including newspapers , posters , cartoons , films , radio broadcasts , academic pamphlets , and even public speeches .
4
Looking back at the CPI 's efforts from the perspective of some decades , communications scholar and author Stewart Ewen concluded , “ In spite of Creel 's consistent denials , the ' House of Truth ' was perched not on a foundation of facts , but upon a swamp of emotions . ”

After Pearl Harbor
With the coming of World War II , America 's uses of deception became considerably more extensive and sophisticated , thanks again to help from British intelligence .
World War II was total war and the already fuzzy dividing line between journalism and deception virtually disappeared .
American journalists were now fighting on the same team as the generals .
Censorship and propaganda were by this time such large operations that they could no longer be managed by a single organization , such as the CPI .
Media censorship was handled by the U.S. Office of Censorship , headed by Byron Price , formerly executive news editor of the Associated Press , later given the title Director of Censorship .
Propaganda was by now a much more scientific business than it had been during World War I. Foreign propaganda was initially created and distributed by a new super - intelligence agency called the Office of Coordinator of Information ( COI ) , under the direction of Col. William “ Wild Bill ” Donovan .
COI drew its staff from newspapers , radio - broadcasting organizations , and Hollywood studios who then happily set to work fighting “ the good war ” with carefully crafted ( and often overtly racist ) words and images .
6
Domestic propaganda , designed to keep the American public solidly behind the war effort , was managed by an organization called the Office of Facts and Figures ( OFF ) , later renamed the Office of War Information ( OWI ) .
The overall job of promoting the war at home was given to Elmer Davis , an author , CBS radio announcer , news analyst , and former New York Times reporter .
OFF / OWI was managed by poet Archibald Macleash , formerly head of the U.S. Library of Congress .
7 , 8
Donovan 's COI later became the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) which , after the War , became the Central Intelligence Agency .
The job of censoring the news and creating war propaganda required the services of many thousands of journalists , editors , and media executives on both sides of the Atlantic .
This massive effort has been the subject of many books and scholarly articles , and could not possibly be adequately described here .
Suffice it to say , however , that the American public never received an accurate account of World War II at the time it was being fought , and there is considerable evidence that they have n't been given the full story , even today .
9
What American journalists produced was essentially a carefully edited and largely fictional account of the war .
Charles Lynch of Reuters news service later put it this way : “ We were a propaganda arm of our governments .
At the start , the censors enforced that , but by the end we were our own censors .
We were cheerleaders .
I suppose there was n't an alternative at the time .
It was total war .
But , for God 's sake , let 's not glorify our role .
It was n't good journalism .
It was n't journalism at all . ”
10
America emerged from World War II a very different country than it had been at the start .
The new “ military - industrial complex , ” as President Eisenhower dubbed it in a famous 1961 speech , had achieved enormous size and frightening political influence .
In the view of President Eisenhower , it threatened our traditional values of open , accountable government .
The close ties between the news media and the military not only persisted but grew stronger during the Cold War .
In 1947 , Congress passed the controversial National Security Act which created a powerful new organization from the bones of the old OSS : The Central Intelligence Agency .
Although the Agency 's title gives an impression it merely collects information , the CIA was , from the start , assigned the task of creating and disseminating propaganda .
In short order , the Agency set about forging secret alliances with hundreds of journalists , writers , media executives , news organizations , book publishers , and other influential organizations , with the stated aim of fighting Communism at all costs ( though it dabbled in many other deception activities as well ) .
Among these people and organizations were some of America 's best - known media figures and most major news organizations .
Frank G. Wisner was the CIA 's man in charge of the new propaganda effort and he once bragged that he could make the world 's media play any tune he desired .
Hence , the CIA 's global propaganda machine came to be called “ Wizner 's Wurlitzer . ”
11 Internally , the CIA 's program was known as Operation Mockingbird .
12 The American public , of course , was kept completely in the dark about all this because , had they known , they'd have been less likely to trust those who were lying to them .
In 1975 , the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Operations revealed much about the CIA 's secret media connections but not everything .
Disturbing details continue to emerge .
In 2001 , for example , the New York Times reported that the CIA had maintained a close working relationship with the leading news - wire services such that it could place propaganda stories directly onto the news wires .
This meant that newspaper editors and other media personnel would accept the false stories without question .
13
It should be stressed that , if this was possible , then covert censorship of the wire services was also possible .
Have such covert media relationships ceased as a result of exposure ?
The truth is , we can never be certain , particularly given the CIA 's known history of secretive and often lawless activity .
One thing is known , however : the CIA and the U.S. military have not exactly gone away , nor has their need to influence media content and shape American public opinion .
America , once a democratic republic , has gradually morphed into an empire with over 725 foreign military bases spread around the globe to protect its sprawling commercial interests .
14
It has boldly declared its right to invade any nation , at any time .
It is now engaged in several major wars simultaneously , with no clear end in sight .
As the old saying goes , during war , the first casualty is always the truth .
So , if you still trust the U.S. news media to expose government lies , you 're making a serious mistake .
For nearly a hundred years , they 've actually been the ones assigned by the government to tell them .
There was a time during the George W. Bush years when both National Public Radio and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting were administered by former U.S. government propaganda experts .
Some of them are still working there .
Just a coincidence ?
Whatever the case , such connections should n't inspire confidence in the independence and accuracy of American news .
One final thought : A hallmark of an effective propaganda campaign is consistency of message across all media sources .
The name of the game is to create what propaganda theorists call “ a pseudo - environment . ”
That is to say , the public must not be exposed to any credible contradictory information , especially from news sources they 've come to trust .
It is important , for example , that both the right - and left - leaning media are both carrying the same official message .
To make the public believe official lies , all the media must be playing an identical tune , from The Nation to Fox TV .
It is deeply unsettling , then , that the American news media have been so remarkably consistent in endorsing the official 9 - 11 story , despite widespread dissent from thousands of technical experts , academics , eyewitnesses , government officials , military officers , intelligence analysts , and informed members of the general public .
If all this causes you to wonder what might be going on behind the printed pages , radio speakers , and TV screens of America . . . well , it certainly should .

I pride myself on being a dad .
Feel like the height of my success is my little young 'un seeing me brush my teeth on a regular basis , which might be a low standard of success -- except , fatherhood , for me , is rooted on being there .
And I woke up this morning thinking that I 've yet to really publicly talk about this circle of madness I 'm now in .
To talk about these hot coals that I 'm told I must walk over .
Imagine this : you get invited to lecture at a university .
You 're excited .
You 're amped .
You 're sicced up .
Then you realize you have no babysitter .
You fret , but you say to yourself , " It 'll be cool to take little man to see me work . "
Forget the fact that he's two , that he 's not all that interested in seeing you work .
This is father - son time at its best .
So I take him .
All the way out to Baltimore with me .
His day care is in D.C. , so we had a bit of a hump to make .
Now mind you he 's potty training , and I wanted to throw a pull - up on him , but they said putting a pull - up on a baby that 's potty training is like handing a open bottle of Guiness to someone on the wagon -- so I did the daddy thing , I grabbed two extra pairs of underwear and some extra jeans .
But come on now , you know I got those things " in the event of , " not with any expectation of the event happening .
I get to the school in Baltimore .
Shout out to Sojourner College .
The class was filled , brimming , overflowing with black women .
There was one man there , but true soldier though he was , he was really providing the support for his wife , watching the children as she studied .
Anyway , I digress .
My son is there , and he 's cool .
He 's chilling why I talk .
True , he drops some Chex Mix on the floor and proceeds to ask me to help him pick up each piece one at a time , but that happens .
We were straight ( sidebar : I copped Jelani 's book just cause he said screet and scrait in a bio ) .
But we were straight , until he went behind the podium .
I thought it was a sign of brilliance .
My son preparing to follow in my footsteps .
A talking .
A haranguer .
Poet laureate of Swann Rd. No dice .
One of the wise women on the front row looked at me , " Is he okay ? "
I 'm like , " Is he okay ?
Is he okay ?
He cool -- hold up , wait , what 's the smell , ah noooooooo . "
And this is fatherhood right here .
He looks at me , " Daddy , I gotta go potty . "
Kids are really good at giving you that piece of wisdom five minutes too late .
Anyway , we went to the bathroom , and I managed to clean him up and clean out his clothes in about ten minutes flat .
A true feat , for me .
Back in the room I was asked , " What will you do if your son starts to bend the wrong corners like you did ? " I stared at her .
My fingers still seemed to have a trace of my boy 's number two , though I 'd just washed my hands and his hands six times .
" Are you serious ? " I told her what I 'd gone through in the bathroom .
Told her about catching little homie 's throw - up on the side of 50 headed to Annapolis one day .
Told her about catching him as he jumped into the pool like he could swim .
Then I told her again about the potty training .
The washing out of underwear by hand .
Told her I 'd remind my son of those days -- said that gave me the right to see him to 25 and a career or a college graduation by any means necessary .
The executive producer of Top Gear has admitted that the show should have ended two years ago .
Speaking to The Daily Telegraph , Andy Wilman explained that the programme will eventually come to a close .
" We 'll run out of steam , " he said .
" We will .
If we'd had the balls , it would have been two years ago , when we were absolutely peaking ...
But we 're going , ' No , we 've got gainful employment .
We 'll crack on ' . "
Wilman confirmed that the show has changed slightly but promised that hosts Jeremy Clarkson , James May and Richard Hammond will still be involved in pranks and challenges .
He also defended the show 's humour , saying : " [ It ] is a bit end of the pier , but it 's done quite charmingly .
We know it 's sort of crap .
Anyone who gets high - minded and says , ' This is schoolboy stuff ' , we 're like , ' And your point is ? ' "
Top Gear returns on Sunday at 8 pm on BBC Two .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - A team of U.S. scientists on Tuesday upped their high - end estimate of the amount of crude oil flowing from BP Plc ’s stricken Gulf of Mexico well by 50 percent , the second major upward revision in less than a week .
A bird flies above oil seen on the surf and the shore in Gulf Shores , Alabama June 12 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Lyle W. Ratliff
The scientists said the “ most likely flow rate of oil today ” ranges from 35,000 to 60,000 barrels ( 1.47 million and 2.52 million gallons / 5.57 million and 9.54 million liters ) per day .
That is a significant jump from the last estimate issued by the Flow Rate Technical Group on June 10 and pegging the well ’s flow at 20,000 to 40,000 barrels per day .
And those figures were considerably higher than the previous “ best estimate ” of 12,000 - 19,000 bpd issued by the flow rate group on May 27 .
“ This estimate brings together several scientific methodologies and the latest information from the sea floor , and represents a significant step forward in our effort to put a number on the oil that is escaping from BP ’s well , ” said Energy Secretary Steven Chu .
The team of scientists said they may revise the estimates again as they gather new data on the well , one mile beneath the ocean surface .
Even at the minimum estimated rate of 35,000 bpd , the ruptured well has dumped nearly 2 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 -- nearly eight times the amount that the Exxon Valdez spilled into Prince William Sound in Alaska in 1989 .
At the U.S. government ’s direction , BP is boosting its oil capturing capacity to up to 53,000 bpd by the end of June and to 80,000 bpd by mid-July from about 18,000 bpd .
The new estimates come from detailed pressure data taken by instruments inside BP ’s oil - containment device on the sea floor over the last 24 hours , the government said .
“ This estimate , which we will continue to refine as the scientific teams get new data and conduct new analyses , is the most comprehensive estimate so far of how much oil is flowing one mile below the ocean ’s surface , ” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement .

This week , the internet is abuzz about a provision included in The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
Act that expands reporting requirements related to forms 1099 .
As per usual , there ’s some good information out there and some bad …
Let ’s see if we ca n’t sift through it .
The best place to start when you ’re trying to make some sense out of changes to the tax laws – or any laws for that matter – is the actual source .
In other words , take a peek at the law .
A good place to find laws that are either pending or on the books is the THOMAS web site at thomas.gov , maintained by the Library of Congress “ in the spirit of Thomas Jefferson . ”
You can find a bunch of information on the site including the sponsors of a particular bill , actions related to the bill , the status of the bill and , perhaps most importantly , the text .
So here ’s the specific text of the health care bill that has everyone aflutter :
SEC . 9006 .
EXPANSION OF INFORMATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS .
( a ) INGENERAL .
— Section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new subsections : ( h) APPLICATION TO CORPORATIONS .
—
Notwithstanding any regulation prescribed by the Secretary before the date of the enactment of this subsection , for purposes of this section the term ‘ person ’ includes any corporation that is not an organization exempt from tax under section 501 ( a ) .
( i ) REGULATIONS .— The Secretary may prescribe such regulations and other guidance as may be appropriate or necessary to carry out the purposes of this section , including rules to prevent duplicative reporting of transactions .’’. ( b ) PAYMENTS FOR PROPERTY AND OTHER GROSS PROCEEDS . —
Subsection ( a ) of section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended — ( 1 ) by inserting ‘‘ amounts in consideration for property , ’’ after ‘‘ wages , ’’ , ( 2 ) by inserting ‘‘ gross proceeds , ’’ after ‘‘ emoluments , or other ’’ , and ( 3 ) by inserting ‘‘ gross proceeds , ’’ after ‘‘ setting forth the amount of such ’ ’ . ( c ) EFFECTIVE DATE .
— The amendments made by this section shall apply to payments made after December 31 , 2011 .
I know , it sounds a bit like gibberish .
What it does is modify a section of the Tax Code – that section is 6041 , Information at source .
You can find the whole text of that section here .
It ’s important to read both sections for context .
If you do n’t , you ’re liable to believe statements made on * other * web sites that imply that forms 1099 ( which is the form used to report much of the information referred to in section 6041 ) are now required for every single transaction ever .
What you get when you mash the two sections together is this , more or less :
All persons engaged in a trade or business and making payment in the course of such trade or business to another person ( including corporations otherwise not exempt ) , of rent , salaries , wages , amounts in consideration for property , premiums , annuities , compensations , remunerations , emoluments , or other gross proceeds , fixed or determinable gains , profits , and income … setting forth the amount of such gross proceeds , gains , profits , and income , and the name and address of the recipient of such payment .
That ’s my own little mash - up of the law .
I suspect it ’s pretty close to what the revised section 6041 will look like .
And here ’s what it means now :
1 , Previously , forms 1099 were issued only to individuals and partnerships , not to corporations .
That has changed .
Corporations are now included in the potential pool of form 1099 recipients .
2 , Previously , forms 1099 were issued only for rents , services and financial transactions .
That has also changed .
The sales of tangible goods are also potentially reportable .
What stays the same :
1 , The $ 600 reporting threshold .
Since I ’m a pretty Pollyanna type of girl , I ’ll point out the positives first …
The current reporting requirements stink .
They constantly confuse taxpayers .
A huge reason for the confusion : who the heck knows whether a vendor or service provider is a corporation ?
When entity choices were simple ( sole proprietor , partnership , corporation ) , it was much easier .
But now there are more choices ( LLP , LLC , s corporation , LLLP , PC , etc. ) made even more confusing by the notion that an entity can have a completely different tax classification ( an LLC can be taxed as a partnership , a c corporation or an s corporation ) .
Like many other taxpayers , I do n’t know whether my plumber for my business is an individual or a corporation – I just hired him off of Angie ’s List .
So I do n’t know whether to report those payments or not – and neither do most taxpayers …
Every tax season , I get a slew of “ do I have to issue a 1099 to ( fill in the blank ) ? ” type questions because the current law is just so confusing .
So what I think Congress was trying to do was make things easier .
But Congress being Congress , they did n’t .
As a practical matter , expanding the definition of person to include corporation means more reporting requirements .
And for small businesses , in particular , that can be fairly burdensome .
What Congress also did is expand the definition of what ’s reportable to include sales of goods .
While the $ 600 threshold remains , the inclusion of goods will definitely up the quantity of required paperwork .
Again , I think Congress was trying to do a good thing here .
I think they were trying to make it more difficult for businesses who sell goods online , etc. , to hide income .
It ’s also intended to cut down on fraudulent deductions – if you report that your business spent money on window cleaning services to Clear , Inc. – and you have to issue Clear , Inc. a form 1099 for that amount – you ’re more likely to report it accurately .
Cause you ’re not going to tell Clear , Inc. that you spent $ 1,000 when you actually spent $ 500 .
So the result is more accurate reporting .
That ’s good , right ?
It ’s all about closing the tax gap and trying to recover some of that $ 300 billion in unreported income each year .
But again , Congress just made it more difficult for taxpayers .
The expanded reporting requirement means that not only must businesses ( not individual taxpayers ) keep excellent records of payments , they must keep addresses and TIN numbers on hand for all of their vendors .
That ’s a bit of a nightmare in the making .
But all of that said , I do n’t think it ’s going to be quite as nightmarish as some in the blogosphere would have you believe .
There is an important phrase in the new law that ’s likely to ease the potential reporting chaos :
The Secretary may prescribe such regulations and other guidance as may be appropriate or necessary to carry out the purposes of this section , including rules to prevent duplicative reporting of transactions .
In other words , the IRS has some leeway here .
And let me give you a heads up : the IRS does n’t want this to be a reporting nightmare anymore than businesses do .
I suspect we ’ll get some guidance – and some relief – once the IRS issues Regs on the matter .
If I had to guess , I would think that there will be some sort of exception for large national retailers or regular / repeat transactions – meaning that you wo n’t have to report your monthly shopping sprees at Staples via a form 1099 .
If any of this matters to you ( and if you ’re a business person , it should ) , plan on following this discussion pretty closely .
The IRS will hold public hearings on any proposed Regs and give you , as a taxpayer , the right to put in your two cents .
They usually also accept public comment via US mail and email .
Take advantage of the opportunity to make your voice heard .
Since the new law is effective January 1 , 2012 , you can likely count on seeing those proposed Regs and public hearings in 2011 .
Of course , I ’d love to hear your comments on this now …

During its flyby of Saturn in November 1980 , the spacecraft 's cameras and remote sensing instruments revealed stunning images and information about Saturn 's rings and atmosphere , as well as its giant moon Titan .
In early 1990 , Voyager 1 captured the now - famous image known as " Pale Blue Dot . "
As the spacecraft was on its way out of the solar system , astronomer Carl Sagan commanded it to turn its camera and take a picture of planet Earth dangling in the vastness of space .

Last October , the PDEng Independent Review from three external reviewers was released to the students .
Shortly after the release , Dean Sedra announced the formation of the Task Force , which included CECS , PDEng , Departments , and the student representatives Sasha Avreline and David Lui .
From January until the end of April , the task force met three or more hours a week to discuss how to make improvements .
On May 10th , the final report was released from the Dean ’s office to the students on and off campus .
The 23 page report can be found on the PDEng Renewal website at http://engineering.uwaterloo.ca/pdengrenewal/.
For those without the time to read through the entire report , all recommendations can be summarized into the immediate changes to the program and long term goals for improving the new program .
The first immediate change is that PDEng will be discontinued and professional development for engineering students will be given by the WatPD - Engineering program .
A program with emphasis on engineering specific curriculum delivered by the WatPD office .
Throughout the process , the Task Force has been working with the director of WatPD , Judene Pretti , to make sure that the transition from PDEng to WatPD – Engineering is successful .
As the transition phase goes on , the previous Director of the PDEng programme , Professor MacGregor , has stepped down from the position , and Dr. Dwight Aplevich has taken her place as the PDEng Director until the transition to WatPD - Engineering is complete .
To date , the Academic Director has also been appointed , Dr. Gord Stubley , who will be overlooking the new WatPD - Engineering programme and acting as the liaison between the Dean ’s office , WatPD Director , and those working on the Curriculum Committee .
The job of the Academic Director will also be to manage course critiques , coordinate new professional development courses , and to handle any extraordinary cases involving engineering students ( i.e. course overrides , special accommodations , etc . )
Marking has also gone a drastic , immediate change .
The previous method of marking for PDEng involves that you need to show competency on all skills in order to get competent on the assignment .
This is being changed to an averaging system , in which a mark from 0 to 4 will be given for each skill , and an average of 2.8 on all skills needs to be obtained in order to pass the assignment .
This scheme has retroactively been used for Winter 2010 PDEng courses and will be used in future offerings .
WatPD - Engineering will use the Wat - PD marking scheme which is the same as any other UW course .
Workshops have been removed from PDEng , so instead of doing a workshop , a second resubmission will be available for each major assignment , which will be due within the first two weeks of the following academic term .
This will allow for students to discuss with their mentors problems with the assignment in person .
The first long term goal is to change the PDEng curriculum from five core courses that everyone has to take to two core courses that focus on practical skills for the workplace that engineering students will need .
The remaining three courses will be elective courses depending on student goals , such as project management , contract negotiation , and preparing for the professional practice exam .
As of right now , the change in the curriculum needs to be approved by senate , and will ideally be completed for the class of 2015 , while the change to elective courses may start for the ’ 12 , ’13 or ’ 14 class , depending on when changes get approved .
Another long term goal involved the creation of a committee which is now called the “ Curriculum Committee ” with representation from all departments that will review all course content and make changes as needed .
This committee , which has alrady been created , will work on ensuring content is more instruction based and will deal with the complaints of course material from students .
The committee will look to also ensure assignments are not completely relied on by work term experience , with more consideration given to students with unique work terms , and different types of media that can be used for teaching purposes than just from PDFs .
Overall , there is a large number of changes that are going to be going through with the PDEng programme .
For those who are on co-op right now , you will see a big change from the previous term on how the courses will be run .
For those who are still doing courses , look out for when the major changes , like the switch to two core courses and three elective courses , are made .
The Exploring Islam Foundation has put up a series of “ Inspired by Muhammad ” ads on buses in London .
Because when you think Muhammad , obviously the first things that come to mind are social justice , women ’s rights , and the environment …
( Women ’s rights ?
Really ?!
The woman saying that is wearing a hijab , something that many Islamic women are forced to wear ! )
This commenter debunks every one of those claims above .
Journalist Douglas Murray can’t believe this either :
The campaign posters show British Muslims saying things like : “ I believe in protecting the environment .
So did Mohammed . ”
Funniest of all is a woman barrister in a headscarf who fronts the poster : “ I believe in women ’s rights .
So did Mohammed . ”
Unless , like the female poet Asma bint Marwan , you did something Mohammed did n’t like .
( According to various hadiths , he had her killed for criticising Islam . )
Or unless , like his bride Aisha , you were nine years old and he decided , at the age of 52 , that it was time to consummate the marriage .
A blogger at Uzza ’s Notes created alternative versions — and , unlike the original ads , the blogger backs these up with citations from the Koran :
The parodies are gonna be ripe for this one …
Even Jesus and Mo are getting in on the action :
It ’s a nice attempt at a campaign .
There ’s obviously something wrong with the image of Islam .
But unlike the image problems for atheism ( that prompted all of our ads ) , the negative perception of Islam is n’t unwarranted .
Radical Muslims , no doubt , have done awful things and continue to do them .
But Moderate Muslims are n’t helping their cause .
They do n’t do nearly enough to criticize the radicals .
Sure , they denounce violence in the name of Islam , but how often do you hear them denouncing things like the female face coverings ?
Anyone remember when they got mad at us for drawing images of Muhammad ?
One of the most outspoken moderate Muslims , Eboo Patel , compared atheists ’ harmless stick figure drawings to a swastika !
You ’ll never see an ad in this “ Inspired by Muhammad ” campaign that says “ I believe in free speech .
So did Muhammad . ”
Or “ I believe in peace .
So did Muhammad . ”
Or “ I believe in religious freedom .
So did Muhammad . ”
Because even the ads creators know those posters would just lead to raised eyebrows and laughter .

Fischer hooks in to FRC 's cast
by Jeremy Hooper
The American Family Association 's Bryan Fischer is on record saying that only gays were savage enough for Hitler and that because of this , " homosexuals in the military gave us ... six million dead Jews . "
He 's also said that " gay sex is a form of domestic terrorism . "
Then there was the time he directly compared laws against gay soldiers to those that apply to bank robbers .
Oh , and who can forget the time Fischer turned his proficiency for and with militarization back to Biblical times , invoking a story about stabbing " sexually immoral " people with spears , saying we need this kind of action in modern day ?
Well apparently none of this " expertise " escaped the Family Research Council , for they have just added this exact same incendiary voice to an anti-DADT repeal webcast that they 've planned for next week :
FRC , together with some distinguished guests from across the military and political spectrum , will be tackling these issues in next Tuesday 's webcast , " Mission Compromised . "
Confirmed speakers include General John Sheehan ( USMC , Ret. ) , Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) , Rep. Todd Akin , Frank Gaffney of Center for Security Policy , Austin Nimocks of ADF , Bryan Fischer of AFA , Dr. Robert Labutta ( U.S. Army , Ret. ) , and FRC experts Cathy Ruse and Jeanne Monahan .
Do n't miss this important event , which kicks off on July 20 at 8:30 p.m. ( ET ) .
Get Your Marching Orders on FRC's Special Military [ FRC ]
Yes , that 's right : A senator , a congressman , and some retired military personnel will sit alongside a man who has become known in " culture war " politics for being perhaps the most volatile voice from the " pro-family " side .
A man who has publicly vowed to refrain from any kind of truce on any of these conservative - declared battles :
" ... [ T] the other side will never give up , never back down , never quit .
They pursue their radical agenda with a mindless persistence , pressing , clamoring , hectoring , demanding , bloviating without ceasing .
There can be no truce with such an adversary .
I 'm reminded of the homosexuals who demanded sex with Lot 's guests , as recorded in Genesis 19:4 - 10 .
They " surrounded the house " and " pressed hard against the man Lot " until they were blinded by God .
Even that did n't stop them .
" They wore themselves out groping for the door . "
We are up against tireless adversaries and we ourselves must be tireless and unflagging in our opposition to their life - and culture - destroying agenda .
Whether we want to be at war with them is immaterial .
They are at war with us and our values , and we either fight back or we lose our country . "
Gov. Daniels : A ' truce ' is a surrender [ Bryan Fischer ]
Not only is this booking offensive to LGBT people and allies :
It 's offensive to every one of our soldiers , all of whom deserve to have this national conversation play out in the most rational way possible .

LONDON --
The American owners of Manchester United are $ 1.6 billion in debt , leaving their control of the club in doubt , the BBC reported Monday .
The BBC said its investigation found the Glazer family 's debts are $ 570 million greater than previously known .
Malcolm Glazer and his sons also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers .
The Glazer family has been the subject of protests by a group of Manchester United fans who want it to sell the team .
Andrew Yates / AFP / Getty Images
All the extra debt comes after the Glazers borrowed extensively against their shopping mall business in the United States .
The extent of the debt could fuel a further revolt by a group of United fans who oppose the Glazers ' ownership .
The Glazers took over United in 2005 in a leveraged buyout worth $ 1.4 billion .
The BBC said it saw mortgage documents showing the Glazers have borrowed $ 570 million against shopping malls owned by their company First Allied Corporation .
That 's in addition to $ 1 billion in debts tied to Manchester United and $ 95 million to the Buccaneers .
The Buccaneers released a statement Monday trying to reassure their fans that the team is not in financial trouble .
" Buccaneers fans should know that the Glazer family is as financially well - positioned as ever before .
Companies they own generate revenues in excess of $ 800 million each year , " Jonathan Grella , the team 's director of communications , said in the statement .
" Sophisticated real estate experts know that the family 's refinancing of their commercial real estate before the global meltdown has proven to be the wise move .
" While First Allied represents only a small portion of their asset portfolio , it continues to generate significant profits , enjoys over 90 percent occupancy , and has long - term non-recourse financing .
An astonishing number of news outlets have reported that poor Ashleigh Hall ( above ) " met " her rapist and murderer Peter Chapman on a social networking site .
It 's rather like saying that you " met " someone by letter , " met " them on the telephone , or " met " them by carrier pigeon .
Had the teenager " met " the serial sex offender only on the internet , then she would not have suffered her terrible fate .
This might seem like a petty semantic point , but as discussion rages about how to make social networking sites more safe , it might be worth looking at the language used to describe virtual encounters .
When the BBC , for example , accepts that a social networking contact is someone that you have " met " , what 's to stop an impressionable young girl from presuming that she already knows a person she has never , in fact , " met " .
Electronic contacts are not meetings , and they should not routinely be described as if they are .
This idea that you can meet people via a machine is a fantasy , perhaps for most people a harmless one .
But some people 's fantasies are very dark indeed , which is why this collective fantasy of virtual " meeting " should not be pandered to .
Discoveries about tropical coral reefs are expected to be invaluable in efforts to restore the corals , which are succumbing to bleaching and other diseases at an unprecedented rate as ocean temperatures rise worldwide .
The research gives new insights into how the scientists can help to preserve or restore the coral reefs that protect coastlines , foster tourism , and nurture many species of fish .
The research , which will be published in the journal PLoS One , was accomplished by an international team whose leaders include Iliana Baums , an assistant professor of biology at Penn State University .
The team focused on one of the most abundant reef - building species in the Caribbean , Montastraea faveolata , known as the mountainous star coral .
Though widespread , this species is listed as endangered on the Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature because its numbers have declined significantly -- in recent years , up to 90 percent of the population has been lost in some areas .
Discovering how corals respond to ocean warming is complicated because corals serve as hosts to algae .
The algae live in the coral and feed on its nitrogen wastes .
Through photosynthesis , the algae then produce the carbohydrates that feed the coral .
When this complex and delicate symbiosis is upset by a rise in ocean temperature , the coral may expel the algae in a phenomenon known as coral bleaching , which may cause the death of both algae and coral .
The challenge is to figure out why some corals cope with the heat stress better than others .
" We decided to focus on coral larvae because the successful dispersal and settlement of larvae is key to the survival of reefs , " explains Baums .
" Also , since free - swimming larvae do not yet have symbiotic algae , we can record the expression of different genes in our samples and know that we are looking at the molecular response of the coral itself to heat stress . "
Star coral broadcasts eggs and sperm into the water column in mass spawning events , which occur in the Caribbean a few days after the full moon in August .
Fertilization occurs quickly when the larvae reach the surface , and then they drift for as much as two weeks before settling on the hard surfaces where they will spend the rest of their lives .
Free - swimming larvae are especially vulnerable to ecological changes because they have limited energetic reserves .
Scientifically , studying coral larvae has distinct advantages over documenting the response of adult coral to thermal stress .
Logistically , however , studying larvae scientifically is not so easy .
" We have to find suitable reefs with known , and therefore roughly predictable , spawning habits , " explains Baums .
" These reefs have to be close enough to shore that we can get into the water and out to the corals within the first hour of spawning , which always happens at night .
When we see that the corals are about to spawn , we set up nets over coral colonies to catch the fragile gametes before they can reach the surface , then we rush back to shore to set up controlled matings and get the young corals back into aquarium tanks before they die . "
Once spawning started , the scientists worked nearly around the clock for a few days .
If they failed to capture enough larvae , or if the larvae died in captivity , the experiment could not be repeated until the following year .

The team successfully collected spawn from two populations of mountainous star coral , one off Key Largo , Florida , and one off Puerto Morales , Mexico .
Keeping spawn from the two sites separate , the scientists allowed fertilization to occur in captivity , then they raised the embryos at different temperatures .
They recorded the developmental stage and gene expression in the embryos between 12 and 48 - to - 50.5 hours after fertilization , comparing those embryos raised at normal temperatures with those raised at temperatures that were 1 - to - 2 degrees Centigrade higher .
The embryos from Florida and Mexico developed similarly in the first 50 hours , with the high - temperature embryos maturing only slightly faster than the embryos raised at normal temperatures .
Strikingly , larvae raised at higher temperatures showed many more irregular , misshapen embryos than those raised at normal temperatures .
For example , after 46 hours , fully 50 percent of the high - temperature embryos from Florida were deformed as compared to the normal - temperature embryos , none of which were malformed .
The Mexican samples showed the same pattern but those embryos were less strongly affected by the elevated temperature .
Although both populations represent the same species , they responded differently to heat stress , showing genetic variability within the species .
In addition to examining the physical appearance of embryos as they developed , the team extracted RNA from approximately 1,500 embryos from each location to see how much of each of 1,300 molecular products were being transcribed at a given time .
Genes that were transcribed in different amounts between high - temperature and normal - temperature samples were called deferentially expressed genes .
Twenty - four hours after fertilization , embryos from the same site showed similar gene expression profiles regardless of the temperature at which they were raised .
As the time since fertilization increased , the samples showed more and more deferentially expressed genes , 458 in all .
Of the 218 deferentially expressed genes that were sensitive to temperature , almost none were shared between the two locations on the first day of sampling , but by the second day , roughly 25 percent were shared between samples from Mexico and Florida .
By 48 hours , thermal stress -- not sampling location -- became the dominant factor influencing gene expression .
At that point , the gene expression of coral subjected to similar temperatures clustered together regardless of their place of origin .
The team then classified the deferentially expressed genes into functional groups and found that the genes most sensitive to temperature changes were primarily those involved in cell proliferation , growth , and development .
The genes that varied according to location of origin were most often involved in cell adhesion , protein degradation , and protein biosynthesis .
" Our study shows that the response of larvae to changing conditions depends upon where the parent colonies lived , " says Baums .
" Clearly the coral larvae from Mexico and Florida respond differently to heat stress , even though they belong to the same species , showing adaptations to local conditions .
The two populations have different adaptive potential . "
Baums said she is excited by the clear evidence of local adaptations in populations that this study documented .
Previous work by Baums and her colleagues has included experiments in restoring damaged coral reefs by creating larvae from controlled genetic crosses , growing them in captivity until they settle onto ceramic tiles , and then transplanting them into selected areas to replenish damaged reefs .
Some crosses survive in higher - temperature water better than others , some survive in captivity better than others , and some settle more reliably onto the prepared tiles that are used to form or restore colonies .
The new information from the current study will be invaluable in restoration work .
" Variation among populations in gene expression offers the species as a whole a better chance of survival under changing conditions , " Baums said .
" We might be able to screen adult populations for their ability to produce heat - resistant larvae and focus our conservation efforts on those reefs . "
Giving the Amazon some iron ( Image : Jeroen Oerlemans / Panos )
WINDBLOWN dust from a dried - out African lake that was once the size of California is nourishing rainforests in the Amazon and algae in the Atlantic .
Previous modelling studies estimated that the Bodélé depression in Chad , which formed when the largest lake in Africa dried out about 1000 years ago , is responsible for about 56 per cent of the dust from Africa reaching the Amazon , amounting to millions of tonnes per year .
Now , researchers have estimated how much fertiliser , in the form of iron and phosphorus , is in the dust .
Although the …
Perhaps it was only a matter of time .
But wireless security researchers say they have uncovered a vulnerability in the WPA2 security protocol , which is the strongest form of Wi-Fi encryption and authentication currently standardized and available .
Malicious insiders can exploit the vulnerability , named " Hole 196 " by the researcher who discovered it at wireless security company AirTight Networks .
The moniker refers to the page of the IEEE 802.11 Standard ( Revision , 2007 ) on which the vulnerability is buried .
10 of the worst moments in network security history
Hole 196 lends itself to man - in - the - middle - style exploits , whereby an internal , authorized Wi-Fi user can decrypt , over the air , the private data of others , inject malicious traffic into the network and compromise other authorized devices using open source software , according to AirTight .
The researcher who discovered Hole 196 , Md Sohail Ahmad , AirTight technology manager , intends to demonstrate it at two conferences taking place in Las Vegas next week : Black Hat Arsenal and DEF CON 18 .
The Advanced Encryption Standard ( AES ) derivative on which WPA2 is based has not been cracked and no brute force is required to exploit the vulnerability , Ahmad says .
Rather , a stipulation in the standard that allows all clients to receive broadcast traffic from an access point ( AP ) using a common shared key creates the vulnerability when an authorized user uses the common key in reverse and sends spoofed packets encrypted using the shared group key .
Ahmad explains it this way :
WPA2 uses two types of keys : 1 ) Pairwise Transient Key ( PTK ) , which is unique to each client , for protecting unicast traffic ; and 2 ) Group Temporal Key ( GTK ) to protect broadcast data sent to multiple clients in a network .
PTKs can detect address spoofing and data forgery .
" GTKs do not have this property , " according to page 196 of the IEEE 802.11 standard .
These six words comprise the loophole , Ahmad says .
Because a client has the GTK protocol for receiving broadcast traffic , the user of that client device could exploit GTK to create its own broadcast packet .
From there , clients will respond to the sending MAC address with their own private key information .
Ahmad says it took about 10 lines of code in open source MadWiFi driver software , freely available on the Internet , and an off - the - shelf client card for him to spoof the MAC address of the AP , pretending to be the gateway for sending out traffic .
Clients who receive the message see the client as the gateway and " respond with PTKs " , which are private and which the insider can decrypt , Ahmad explains .
From there , " the malicious insider could drop traffic , drop a [ denial - of - service ] attack , or snoop , " Ahmad says .
The ability to exploit the vulnerability is limited to authorized users , AirTight says .
Still , year - after - year security studies show that insider security breaches continue to be the biggest source of loss to businesses , whether from disgruntled employees or spies who steal and sell confidential data .
What can we do about Hole 196 ?
" There 's nothing in the standard to upgrade to in order to patch or fix the hole , " says Kaustubh Phanse , AirTight 's wireless architect who describes Hole 196 as a " zero - day vulnerability that creates a window of opportunity " for exploitation .
Please bear with me as I swim through the multi-layered clouds of this Dispersant story , like so many underwater plumes .
Its twist and turns , go on for miles it seems , but each is relevant to the bigger picture ... ( and skimming through it , is OK too .
Or just look at the Pictures . )
[ The ProPublica investigation
by Marian Wang , ProPublica - May 18 , 2010 continues ...]
Given that the dispersants are EPA - approved , the choice of which ones to use was left to BP , which had stockpiled large amounts of Corexit and is now ordering more .
[...]
BP has defended its choice to use Corexit .
A BP spokesman called the product [ 5 ] " pretty effective , " and said it had been " rigorously tested . "
It is not testing other dispersants , he said , [ 5 ] because it ’s focusing on stopping the spill .
Mani Ramesh , the chief technology officer for Nalco , which makes Corexit , disputed claims that the product is harmful to the environment [ 10 ] , telling Reuters that Corexit ’s active ingredient is " an emulsifier also found in ice cream . "
Do n't you love it when Company spokesmen assure us " everything 's fine " -- while at the same time refusing to disclosure all those " secret ingredients " in their " wonder product " .
We can't violate those ' sacred ' Copyrights now , can we ?
Oil cleanup chemicals worry environment watchdogs
By Deborah Zabarenko , Environment Correspondent , Reuters -- May 4 , 2010
The use of dispersants could be a trade - off between potential short - term harm to offshore wildlife and possible long - term damage to coastal wildlife habitat if the oil slick were to reach land .
[...]
So - called dispersants work on an oil spill as dishwashing detergent works on a greasy skillet : they break up oil into tiny droplets that sink below the water 's surface where naturally occurring bacteria consume them .
Without dispersants , oil stays on the water 's surface , where bacteria can't get at them , Ramesh said .
The problem , according to Jackie Savitz , a senior scientist at the marine environmental group Oceana , is that the dispersants themselves can be toxic to wildlife .
Dispersants can also enhance oil 's toxicity in the dispersion process .
" Dishsoap " may be perfectly safe for doing dishes -- but that does n't mean I want to drink the stuff , with every meal !
" Dispersants can also enhance oil 's toxicity in the dispersion process . "
I wonder if the EPA knew about this " magnifier " effect ?
( The sum is greater than its parts , idea ? )
I wonder if they knew about it , and approved it anyways -- it 's an Emergency situation afterall .
Drastic times , call for drastic measures , sometimes .
This is funny , the EPA recently updated their Dispersant Product list .
Hmmm ... I wonder why ?

Blogger , raises Eyebrows , scratches Noggin ... that 's odd .
Somebody just gave Corexit the " Official stamp of Approval " again .
I wonder Who , and more importantly , Why ?
OK , that 's a story for another day ...
What about the Toxicity Specifics on Corexit 9500 -- the dispersant that BP has boat - loads of ?
The one that marine biologists are so worried about ?
OK , Here 's the Beef :
TECHNICAL PRODUCT BULLETIN : COREXIT ® EC9500A
EPA Home - Emergency Management TECHNICAL PRODUCT BULLETIN #D - 4
COREXIT ® EC9500A -- ( formerly COREXIT 9500 )
VI . RECOMMENDED APPLICATION PROCEDURE 1 ) Application Method : COREXIT ® EC9500A contains the same surfactants present in COREXIT ® EC9500A and a new improved oleophilic [ strong affinity for oils ] solvent delivery system .
Aerial Spraying - Aircraft provide the most rapid method of applying dispersants to an oil spill and a variety of aircraft can be used for spraying .
For aerial spraying , COREXIT ® EC9500A is applied undiluted .
Typical application altitudes of 30 to 50 feet have been used , although higher altitudes may be effective under certain conditions . [...]
Boat Spraying - COREXIT ® EC9500A may also be applied by workboats equipped with spray booms mounted ahead of the bow wake or as far forward as possible .
The preferred and most effective method of application from a workboat is to use a low - volume , low - pressure pump so the chemical can be applied undiluted .
Spray equipment designed to provide a five to ten percent diluted dispersant solution to the spray booms can also be used .
COREXIT ® EC9500A 9500 should be applied as droplets , not fogged or atomized .
Natural wave or boat wake action usually provides adequate mixing energy to disperse the oil . [...]
2 ) Concentration / Application Rate : A treatment rate of about 2 to 10 U.S. gallons per acre , or a dispersant to oil ratio of 1:50 to 1:10 is recommended .
This rate varies depending on the type of oil , degree of weathering , temperature , and thickness of the slick .
3 ) Conditions for Use : As with all dispersants , timely application ensures the highest degree of success .
Early treatment with COREXIT ® EC9500A , even at reduced treat rates , can also counter the " mousse " forming tendencies of the spilled oil .
COREXIT ® EC9500A is useful on oil spills in salt water .

Oy Veh ! ... there 's that " jargony math wall " I warned you about .
This time however I was able to " decipher the jargon " using some very incisive Q&A from an EPA FAQ page .
My explanations , as best I understand it ( now ) , are shown in square brackets [ ah hah ! ] , in both the next , and previous blocks .
EPA Toxicity tests : FAQ
EPA Toxicity tests Question )
What is a toxicity test ?
Answer )
Toxicity tests are methods for determining the impact of a chemical or an effluent on living organisms and measure the degree of response using commonly tested species .
Many different kinds of tests can be used to identify potential toxic effects but since toxic effects differ , comparing the toxicity of one to another may not be appropriate .
Question )
There is toxicity test data available for the dispersants on the NCP Product Schedule ( http://www.epa.gov/...) and it talks about LC50s .
What is an LC50 ?
Answer )
In environmental studies , LC stands for " Lethal Concentration " and
is the concentration of the chemical , given all at once , in the water that causes the death of 50 % of a group of test animals
in a given time ( for example , during a 96 - hour period ) .
[ LC50 means " what it took " for 50 % of the test species to die , when exposed to toxic level ( in ppm ) , for the stated time . ]
In general , the smaller the LC50 value [ in ppm ] , the more toxic the chemical .
The opposite is also true : the larger the LC50 value [ in ppm ] , the lower the toxicity .
For example , a chemical with an LC50 of 2 parts per million ( ppm )
would be more toxic than a chemical with an LC50 of 20 ppm .
[ Relative Toxicity : 2.0 ppm > 20.0 ppm -- 2 drops is more toxic than 20 , if both cause the same " kill rate " ]
The LC50 is the measure of the immediate ( or acute ) toxicity of a chemical for the particular animal species being tested .
The LC50 was not designed nor intended to give information on the long - term exposure effects of a chemical .
Here are my Take - Away points :
A ) Disperant + Fuel Oil ( when combined ) is much more Toxic than either alone .
B ) Disperant + Fuel Oil ( when combined ) is about 3 x more Toxic than EPA 's Reference Level for Toxicity !
[ Remember : the smaller the LC50 level , the MORE toxic {potent} the toxin . ]
----------
Species LC50 ( ppm )
COREXIT ® EC9500A & No. 2 Fuel Oil ( 1:10 ) [ Dispersant to Oil ratio ]
Menidia beryllina 2.61 96 - hr [ about 3x MORE toxic than Reference ]
Mysidopsis bahia 3.40 48 - hr [ about 3x MORE toxic than Reference ]
Reference Toxicant ( SDS )
[ This looks like the baseline for Toxicity ]
Menidia beryllina 7.07 96 - hr [ Reference Toxicity level ]
Mysidopsis bahia 9.82 48 - hr [ Reference Toxicity level ]
----------
Show your work , my math teachers always said :
7.07 / 2.61 = 2.71 x more potent than reference level ( about 3 x )
9.82 / 3.40 = 2.89 x more potent than reference level ( about 3 x )
[ Note to self : Find out what sort of Toxicity Reference ( SDS ) is . ]
It 's just like those Marine Biologists have been telling us -- Oil and Corexit COMBINED , is much worse , than either one alone .
Smart Marine Biologists .
They must of learn to read Toxicity Tests , back in their Lab classes .
Most likely .
So the EPA runs Toxicity Tests using bacteria and phytoplankton , right , those hyper - sensitive canaries of the sea ?
Well NOT Exactly ... these Toxicity " test critters " are a step or two beyond that ...
EPA Test Species Number 1 :
Inland silverside ( more photos )
Scientific name : Menidia beryllina
Common name : Inland silverside Ecology : Silversides occur in estuaries along the Atlantic , Gulf , and Pacific coasts .
Uses in Aquatic Toxicology : Menidia beryllina are the current EPA - approved marine vertebrate used in both acute and chronic toxicity testing .
In acute toxicity testing , one to 14 day - olds are used and survival is recorded .
In chronic toxicity testing , seven to eleven - day olds are used and survival and growth are recorded . [...]
Other Uses : Silversides have been used as a forage species for game fish and as a biological control for reducing gnat and midge populations .
They are also often used as a bait fish .
EPA Test Species Number 2 :
Mysid shrimp ( more photos )
Scientific name : Americamysis bahia
Common name : Opossum shrimp , Mysid shrimp , Mysids Ecology : Mysids are small shrimp - like crustaceans found primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern coast of Florida .
They commonly occur at salinities above 15 - ppt and are found in greatest abundance at salinities near 30 - ppt .
Use in Aquatic Toxicology : Americamysis bahia is currently the primary estuarine species in toxicity testing .
It is used in both acute and chronic tests .
In acute testing , one to five day old Mysids are used and survival is recorded .
In chronic toxicity tests , seven - day old Mysids are used to test survival , growth , and fecundity . [...]
Other Uses : Used as a live food source for seahorses , seadragons , and pipefish .
Both of the " test " Species , sound like important " fish food " at the base of the Gulf Food Chain .
Must be why they picked them , in the EPA 's initial Toxicity Tests .
Smart EPA Scientists .
And Smart US Representatives too .
Seems this one knows how to listen to the Smart Scientists .
Seems like he knows how to ask the right questions , when those Scientists get him up to speed :

Napolitano Defends Government Response to Spill
In a letter to Lisa P. Jackson , the E.P.A. administrator , [ Representative Edward J. Markey , Democrat of Massachusetts ] said that some formulations of Corexit had been banned in Britain because of harmful effects on sea life .
More than half a million gallons of the dispersants have already been used in the Gulf , and hundreds of thousands more gallons are being prepared for use .
He asked E.P.A. to provide information on the effect of water temperature and pressure on the dispersant , a combination of solvents , surfactants and other compounds .
He also requested detailed data on the subsea tests that led E.P.A. and the United States Coast Guard to approve its use a mile below the surface .
He also asked for information on whether the chemicals accumulate in marine life over time and whether they could affect human health through gulf seafood .
-----
Some pretty good questions from Rep Markey 's Letter to the EPA Director , May 17 , 2010 , for instance :
1 ) d.
Was the toxicity to other subsurface aquatic life evaluated ?
If so , please provide details , and if not , why not ?
2 ) How is EPA tracking the volume of dispersants being used both in both surface and subsurface applications ?
How does EPA plan to determine whether their use causes harm to the aquatic ecosystem they come into contact with ?
3 ) Is EPA fully aware of all chemical constituents contained within the two formulations of Corexit dispersants currently being used ?
If so , please provide a list of each such constituent .
4 ) Did EPA ensure that tests were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the 18 dispersants it has approved for use ?
What were the results of the tests ?
Is n't it something -- what can happen when Representatives step up for the People 's interests .
And say
Hey wait a minute , BUT ...
AND just 3 days later ... how 's that for a coincidence ?
Timeline of Events in BP Oil Spill : Day by Day , April 20 to May 26
BeforeItsNews.com
Day : May 20 , 2010
The EPA also issued a directive requiring BP to identify and use a less toxic and more effective dispersant from the list of EPA - authorized dispersants .
The directive required BP to identify a less toxic alternative – to be used both on the surface and under the water at the source of the oil leak – within 24 hours , and to begin using the less toxic dispersant within 72 hours of submitting the alternative .
That was probably easier for the EPA Director , than finding all that " other " paperwork Representative Markey , was after .
( Is this what they used to call , Congressional " Checks and Balances " over the Executive branch ? )
What 's that you say , Director Jackson ?
BP really does n't like to take orders from the U.S. Government Officials .
Well imagine that !
BP really does n't have to answer to the " Checks and Balances " built into our 3 Branch system ( that is , unless you start counting Lobbyists as the 4th branch of Government , or something ? )
Well this is really turning into a bit of " a sticky wicket " now , is n't it Guvner ?
Secret Formulas , Data Shortages Fuel Arguments Over Dispersants Used for Gulf Spill
By PAUL QUINLAN of Greenwire , NYTimes -- May 24 , 2010
As the quantity of dispersant that BP has sprayed on the spill surpassed 800,000 gallons last weekend , experts say the secret formulas , combined with the sparse water - quality data released by U.S. EPA , make an independent assessment of the dispersant strategy next to impossible .
Some scientists are calling for all dispersant use to be halted until the ingredients and effects are better understood .
" The data is horrible , " said Carys Mitchelmore , an environmental chemist and toxicologist at the University of Maryland 's Center for Environmental Science .
A co-author of a 2005 National Academy of Sciences report on dispersants , she has testified repeatedly on Capitol Hill over the gaping holes in the scientific knowledge regarding the chemicals .
[...]
The company responsible for containing the spill , BP PLC , continued to spar with EPA over the company 's decision to rely on two types of Corexit -- proprietary dispersant formulas manufactured by Nalco Holding Co. , which has close ties to both BP and Exxon Mobil Corp .
[...]
On Saturday , BP rejected the order , citing an ingredient in a potential alternative formula , called Sea Brat # 4 , that could degrade into a nonylphenol , a class of chemicals believed to be disruptive to hormone systems .
BP 's letter and accompanying analysis , which included numerous redactions , also said the company was unable to identify ingredients in other proprietary oil dispersants , concluding that Corexit remained the safest and most abundant option available .
" We 're still using it because , as of today , it 's still the best product available , " said Doug Suttles , chief operating officer for BP , on CNN today .
" It is on the approved list .
It is safe to use .
It is the most widely used . "
AND 4 more days later ... and BP 's still stone - walling ?
you do n't say !
And what 's the final result of BP stalling and waffling ?
... well that 's NOT exactly CLEAR yet ... just who 's zooming who .
And the Corexit ( c ) final results on the many Ecosystems of the Gulf , well only time will tell , and perhaps a few intrepid Reporters ... and some of those dogged Scientists too .
Swimming Through the Spill ...
By Susan D. Shaw , NYTimes -- May 28 , 2010
[...]
What I witnessed was a surreal , sickening scene beyond anything I could have imagined .
As the boat entered the slick , I had to cover my nose to block the fumes .
There were patches of oil on the gulf ’s surface .
In some places , the oil has mixed with an orange - brown pudding - like material , some of the 700,000 gallons of a chemical dispersant called Corexit 9500 that BP has sprayed on the spreading oil .
[...]
Only a few meters down , the nutrient - rich water became murky , but it was possible to make out tiny wisps of phytoplankton , zooplankton and shrimp enveloped in dark oily droplets .
These are essential food sources for fish like the herring I could see feeding with gaping mouths on the oil and dispersant .
Dispersants break up the oil into smaller pieces that then sink in the water , forming poisonous droplets — which fish can easily mistake for food .
Though all dispersants are potentially dangerous when applied in such volumes , Corexit is particularly toxic .
It contains petroleum solvents [ oleophilic ? ] and a chemical that , when ingested , ruptures red blood cells and causes internal bleeding [ Lethality ? ] .
It is also bioaccumulative , meaning its concentration intensifies as it moves up the food chain .
The timing for exposure to these chemicals could not be worse .
Herring and other small fish hatch in the spring , and the larvae are especially vulnerable .
As they die , disaster looms for the larger predator fish , as well as dolphins and whales .
Amazing is n't it , just how SO much trouble , can be caused by such a little fish ( and tiny shrimp , and their aquatic cousins too ) ...
And the Latest Tactical stance of BP with regards to the their " wonder product " that exists with such abundance ?
BP reduces use of dispersants amid sea life concerns
By Matthew Tresauge , Houston Chronicle -- May 27 , 2010 , 7:49 PM
BP has scaled back the use of chemical dispersants to combat the massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico amid concerns over the long - term effects on sea life , officials said Thursday .
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson told a House panel that the oil giant has reduced daily use of dispersants to 12,000 gallons from 70,000 gallons at the urging of the agency .
BP , which is responsible for the cleanup , has used more than 850,000 gallons of dispersants in an attempt to break up the oil before it reaches Louisiana 's fragile coast — a tactic that Jackson described as the lesser of two evils .
[...]
[ Erik Frywald , president and CEO of Nalco , Dispersant Manufacturer ] said Corexit 9500 consists of six chemicals that are in everyday products , such as skin creams and shower cleaners , and should not be a risk to aquatic life , especially in the vast waters of the Gulf .
BP , however , has used an unprecedented amount of the chemicals to combat the spill , raising concerns among some government officials and environmental groups .
In a letter to BP last week , the EPA gave the company three days to find less toxic and more effective dispersant than Corexit 9500 .
Federal officials later acknowledged that alternatives are not available in sufficient quantities .
Well that 's a NOT - so - fine ending , to a dreadfully Toxic problem ...
" BP rejected the order , citing an ingredient ... "
BP sez : 12,000 gallons of a day of poison ' Approved Surfactants ' , is MUCH BETTER than 70,000 gallons a day of the stuff .
" Federal officials later acknowledged that " ... BP has a point .
And that , is THAT !
( They 'll just pour it out more s.l.o.w.l.y , BUT they WILL keep on pouring ... afterall , it 's going to be a long , hot summer ... and who in the world can find a safer substitute , in sufficient quantities ?
... sounds like a job for Super - Capitalist ! )
And people wonder , Why I 'm so snarky !
Here are a few more Dispersant Lessons the EPA should of learned , too , maybe ?
When Life gives you an unstoppable Oil Gusher ,
Do n't mix it with something that makes it EVEN MORE Toxic ,
to the ENVIRONMENTAL Food Chain ,
that you 're suppose to be PROTECTING !
Otherwise those pesky Congress Reps may start asking for some valid reasons ,
[ Hmmm ?...
Are n't those inquiries of Markey still on the Table , about now ? ]
and those pesky Bloggers might start doing their pesky research ,
and may even manage to break through that " jargony math wall "
and figure out the sequence of events .
Drats !
One other lesson , the EPA and Friends , might of learned :
That we just might need to create another 4th Branch of Govt ,
one specially made for those BP - type " persons "
( a branch of Govt ' all to itself ' , like Dick Cheney wanted ) ,
because sometimes CEO's and COO's
find it extremely difficult " to follow orders " --
without some sort of sufficient Penalties attached ...
except for maybe those ' Orders ' of its Shareholders ?
( or maybe those of its Customers , too ? )
Who knew !

With a leaky piece of undersea equipment repaired , engineers were ready to begin a twice - delayed test of the leaking BP well to determine if the well 's piping beneath the sea floor is strong enough to withstand a full seal from a new cap .
" We are ready now to restart the procedure , " said Thad Allen , the retired U.S. Coast Guard admiral who is heading up the federal response to the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster .
The leak was discovered Wednesday night in one of the lines that diverts oil from the new , tight - fitting cap on top of the well .
Allen said at a news conference Thursday that the equipment had been repaired .
That means the most important part of the test -- a measurement of the pressure inside the well -- probably will likely begin Thursday , after BP slowly closes the valves in the cap that are allowing oil to escape .
A BP spokesman would not pinpoint how far along engineers were with the valve closure procedure late Thursday morning .
Once the well is sealed at the top , experts will closely monitor pressure measurements .
Low pressure may indicate that the well is leaking oil from other locations .
If that is the case , the cap could exacerbate the flow from cracks in the well .
In the worst - case scenario , oil could rise to the sea floor , creating new surface leaks .
BP officials said that if they detect low pressure , they will unseal the cap and revert to their oil collection plan , using a series of pipes leading to containment ships on the surface .
But if the pressure readings are consistently high for 48 hours -- meaning the well may be strong and intact -- there is a chance that BP will keep the cap completely sealed .
That decision will not be made immediately , however .
After those 48 hours , Allen said , BP will go back to taking up the oil using the pipes and containment ships .
Then , Allen said , a seismic test of the sea floor will be conducted " to see if there are any areas where pockets of oil may have formed as a result of being forced out of the well bore . "
-- Richard Fausset in Atlanta
Alvin Greene Cleared In Investigation of His Finances ; Continues To Inspire Nation With His Wisdom
1 . We 're here at the Scottish Ruby conference 2010 in Edinburgh and I 'm sitting here with Carl Lerche .
Carl , who are you ?
I 'm a guy who lives in San Francisco , Ruby developer .
I 've been a Ruby developer for about 6 years .
I got into it just about when Rails was first publicly announced .
It had a lot of hype , I checked it out and I liked what I saw .
I was a PHP developer before that and I was glad I got out of that .
2 . You work at Engine Yard right now .
Why do n't you talk about that ?
Back when Merb came out as an alternative to Rails , I was interested , because I hit a lot of the specific problems that Merb was trying to solve .
I checked it out and I started using it , started contributing back , I got more and more involved in the contribution side , ended up on the core team there writing pretty large chunks .
Since Engine
Yard was our sponsor in development they saw me and asked if I wanted to work for them and that 's how it happened .
3 . You were involved in the Rails 3 refactoring .
That was a big task , was n't it ?
Yes , it was .
We 've been at it for about 14 months now , I think , maybe a bit less , more like 12 , 12 - 14 and we 're getting really close to release .
I 'm pretty excited about that .
We released one Beta , the second one is coming if it has n't already been out .
I 've been online the past couple of days , so the release should be coming out soon .
4 . Are there any big changes in the Rails 3 ?
There are actually quite a significant amount of changes , but most of those are in terms of implementation .
We were quite careful about the API that most people use .
We only changed it slightly and there was a lot of consideration put into whether or not we would break something .
The vast majority of changes are in terms of the configuration of the Rails application so everything in config in the root level .
Besides that , a lot of the internals change , there is a lot of refactoring that happened pretty much everywhere .
When I started out , the first thing we tackled was ActionPacks , specifically ActionController .
Then we touched ActionView to do a lot of cleaning up in there and refactoring to make it easier for plug - in developers , specifically since Rails has been out for about 6 years now and we have a better idea of what people will want to do with it .
We refactored Railties a lot , but we changed the way you would configure an application slightly like we specifically made an Application class .
We cleaned up the initializers , we removed all the ones that were not necessary , we added a way for plug - in authors to hook into the initialization system .
We added Bundler which is a way for you to manage your dependencies .
There has been a lot of other work that lots of people were working on , ActiveRecord was cleaned up and the query generation stuff was removed and replaced by Arel , which is a relational algebra library .
We added ActiveModel , which it 's actually twofold - one is an interface that defines how ActionPack expects to interact with the model because all the view helpers , like respond_with and all those helpers assume it would take a model .
Previously it had to be ActiveRecord like an instance of the ActiveRecord class .
Now , anybody like the DataMapper or the Sequel guys can implement that interface and Rails will just go along happily in all the view helpers and just output everything that 's needed .
5 . What was the influence of Merb on Rails 3 ?
Merb started with a Gist or was it a Pastie back then that Ezra put together .
It was about a hundred and some lines , it was a light Ruby framework that sat next to our Rails application and handled file uploads , because back then Rails was intolerantly bad with file uploading .
It grew from there and it became a replacement for ActionPack .
Specifically when I used Merb I kept my ActiveRecord models with it because I still liked ActiveRecord .
It was targeted around trying to build a modular framework , trying to build a light framework .
A framework that gave you the Rails experience but when you needed to change something or to tweak something it did n't get in the way .
It was trying to define public APIs that plug - in developers could use .
It was built with the really light core and all the extra features were built - in modules , kind of like plug-ins into Merb .
The Merb community proved that you could get that Rails experience with the modularity and that 's when all the Rails developers said " Why do n't we just work together on something ?
We can get the best of both worlds and move forward with the next version of Rails " .
It made sense to everybody so that 's how it happened .
6. Rails 3 is now much more modular than previously .
How small can you make Rails 3 ?
I think Yahuda tweeted this , basically Rails is a kit to make Rails .
You can get as small as you want .
You start with Rack and everything on top of that is middleware or really light layers .
Rails 3 is a lot more modular than Merb ever was , which is great .
It 's not just Merb and Rails , it 's a completely new thing that 's much improved .
For example , controllers now you have different actions in them and you can get a Rack app for a specific controller action .
You do n't need to use anything and all the sessions , cookies , basic error handling , basically everything , the router also is just middleware .
You could , just for example if you like the Rails router , you can only use that .
There is ActionDispatch inside of ActionPack , which is a collection of all these middleware and everything that 's Rack related .
You do n't have to use ActiveRecord with ActiveModel , which is an API that defines that interface that Rails has .
With models you can use anything else - you can use DataMapper , Sequel , custom , build ones , whatever .
You can get it as small or as big as you like .
7 . What is Rails Metal ?
Right now Rails Metal is the base class of ActionController : : Base .
The way we broke it up is that you have AbstractController , which is a whole other thing , all AbstractController does is handling dispatch into a specific action .
Then we have ActionController : : Metal , which inherits from ActionController : : Base and all it does is add the Rack element to action dispatching .
If you want to use Metal right now , you just make a class inherit from Metal , define your action and that 's all you have .
Then , you just hook it up to the router and you do n't have access to rendering callbacks , anything .
It 's basically 2 method calls on top of just Rack and it lets you write really light Rack apps in one class with the action dispatching features .
8. Say I 'm new to Rails 3 and I want to write an application , where do I start ?
Do I start with Rails Metal ?
Do I start with the full Rails 3 ?
What 's the way to go ?
If you 're new , basically you would start exactly the same place you would with Rails 2 .
you check out whatever tutorial , you 'd install the Rails gem , you would do ' rails my_app ' , you would generate all the scaffolding for you , not controller scaffolding , just the Rails application scaffolding .
You would then generate controller , it would look exactly the same .
On that respect , nothing has changed .
9 . You mentioned the work on Arel .
What is that ?
Arel is object oriented implementation of relational algebra that was done by Nick Kallen who works at Twitter right now , he also did NamedScope in ActiveRecord .
What it really is , it 's a way for you to build your relations , which are kind of like the queries in SQL in a really nice API and then you just tell ActiveRecord " Give me the records for this query " and it would then say " Ask Arel , here is the relation I built for you , now please give me the rows back . "
Arel will then generate the SQL for it in a really much better way than it used to do as it has the full tree that is the query that you want to build .
It would build a SQL , execute it , get you back the records so all ActiveRecord will do right now is ask for rows to Arel , get them back and instantiate the models for you .
It 's a much better way to generate SQL and the main thing about Arel is that it 's the relational model not SQL .
You can take anything that 's relational data and write an Arel engine for it and Arel will be able to handle that , write queries for that .
10 .
You mentioned some example backends for Arel .
Specifically what I was playing around with since I work at Engine Yard , our main product is built on Amazon 's EC2 infrastructure .
EC2 has a REST interface to handle everything and it really is relational data because you have AMIs which are the operating systems .
The AMIs have many instances that are your running servers , the instances have many volumes that are mounted to it .
All these relationships are just relational algebra .
I started playing around with implementing an Arel engine that takes the query that I want and converts it to a bunch of API calls and returns that data .
Eventually , ActiveRecord should not see any difference between that and SQL .
We 're not quite there yet , because it 's a large refactoring work that 's not 100 % done , but that 's my goal in 3.1 , to work on cleaning up the interface between ActiveRecord and Arel .
I 'd like to add , if you are just using plain Arel , which also has it's own API , you can do that right now .
A South Korean rocket appears to have exploded moments after take - off , ending the country 's latest attempt to join the space - launch industry .
The Korea Space Launch Vehicle 1 is thought to have blown up 137 seconds after take - off , said science minister Ahn Byong - man .
The rocket lifted off from Goheung 's Naro Space Centre at 1701 ( 0801 GMT ) .
But contact was lost as the rocket reached an altitude of 70 kilometres ( 44 miles ) .
" Looking from the bright flash seen on the camera mounted on the tip of the rocket , it appears [ the KSLV - 1 ] exploded in flight during the first - stage ignition , " said Mr Ahn .
Pictures on South Korean television appear to show the rocket 's final moments , with the cameras following a white speck on its downward trajectory into the sea .
Analysts say the reported failure is a major setback for South Korea in what some observers have described as an " Asian space race " .
Malfunction
The launch was South Korea 's second attempt to put a satellite in space , after a launch in August 2009 failed .
The country had been hoping to become only the 10th in the world able to put satellites into space , and thereby gain a lucrative slice of the growing space launch industry .
Analysis
This was South Korea 's second attempt after the first , in August last year , also failed to place a satellite into orbit .
There were high expectations .
The launch was carried live on major news networks , and crowds of people on beaches along the south coast whooped and danced as the rocket lifted off from the nearby launch base .
But failure is commonplace for any nation trying to develop a new rocket ; some estimates put it as high as 50 % .
South Korea had spent $ 400 m on what was always known to be a high - risk mission to become one of only a handful of countries with an independent satellite launch capability .
So far it has come to nothing .
China , India and Japan have developed a launch capability ; China has also sent three manned missions into space .
The KSLV - 1 , built partly in Russia and partly in South Korea , had cost 500 billion won ( $ 400 m ; £ 275 m ) .
The satellite - which had been intended to study the effects of climate change - should have separated from the rocket and deployed its solar panels some nine minutes after take - off , at an altitude of 302 km .
The rocket had been due to take off on Wednesday , but lift - off was cancelled three hours before launch after fire extinguishing fluids were detected leaking from parts of the equipment .
South Korea 's Ministry for Education , Science and Technology said thorough checks had confirmed the leaks did not affect the safety of the rocket and the launch had been rescheduled .
Weather conditions had been closely checked in the final hours before the latest launch .
A spokesman for the Korea Aerospace Research Institute ( Kari ) said all faulty hardware had been replaced and steps taken to prevent a repeat of the earlier faults .
The rocket stood 33 m ( 108 ft ) tall and was launched from the country 's new spaceport on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula .
South Korea 's first launch of the two - stage KSLV - 1 , in August last year , failed to place its satellite payload into the proper orbit .
Four months previously , an attempted space launch by North Korea was deemed to have failed when the US reported that both rocket stages had fallen into the Pacific Ocean .
The North 's launch was seen as a cover for a long - range missile test , and prompted UN sanctions .
Pyongyang had voiced irritation at the South 's rocket development , but most other powers in the region accepted that its attempt was part of a peaceful civilian programme .

Stack Exchange Q&A site proposal : Statistical Analysis
And commit yourself to using the website for asking and answering questions .
144 peoples already committed to using the website , we need 356 more … 🙂
If you are looking for the reasons to do so – read on …
What is the StackOverFlow Q&A website about ?
StackOverFlow.com ( “ SO ” for short ) is a programming Q & A site that ’s free .
Free to ask questions , free to answer questions , free to read .
Free ,
And fast .
For the R community , SO offers a growing database of R related questions and answer ( click the link to check them out ) .
You might be asking yourself what ’s so special about SO over other available resources such as R mailing lists , R blogs , R wiki and so on ?
That is a great question .
The answer is that SO succeeds in doing a great job synthesizing aspects of Wikis , Blogs , Forums , and Digg / Reddit to offer a very powerful Q&A website .
In SO , the new questions are like forum / blog posts ( A main text with comments / answers ) .
After someone answers a question , other users can give a thumb - up or a thumb - down to the answer ( like digg / reddit ) .
And all content can be edited , like a wiki page , by the users ( provided the user has enough “ karma points ” ) .
You also get badges ( “ awards ” ) for a bunch of actions ( like coming to the website every day for a month .
Giving an answer that got X amount of thumb - ups and so on ) .
The awards allows someone who is asking a question to see how much the person who had answered him has good reputation ( in terms of acceptance / appreciation of his answers by other SO members ) .
It also offers a small ( but effective ) ego - boost for the person who gives answers .
So if StackOverFlow is so great – what is this new website you wrote about in the title ?
Well , StackOverFlow has one limitation .
It deals ONLY with programming questions .
Other questions like :
Which of the following three graphics best displays this data set ?
Why ?
Can you give an example of where I might prefer to use a z - test vs a t- test ?
What is the relationship between Bayesian and neural networks ?
Will not be answered , and the threads will get closed as being “ off topic ” .
Why ?
because such questions are dealing with : statistics , data analysis , data mining , data visualization – But in no means in programming .
So there is no StackOverFlow - like Q&A website for data analysis …
Until now !
In the past few weeks , Rob Hyndman and other users , have made much effort to push the creation of a new website , based on the StackOverFlow engine , to allow for statistically related Q&A .
His proposal for a new website is almost complete .
All it need is for you ( yes you ) , to go to the following link :

LAKEWOOD --
Investigators said a man and his teenage son apparently drowned while playing with a remote control boat at an Ocean County fishing pond .
But it 's still not clear how Mark Volz and his 17 - year - old son , Mark Jr. , ended up in the water on Monday afternoon .
The Toms River residents were last seen operating the four - to five - foot boat around 4:30 p.m. at the edge of the pond here .
Nearly two hours later , a passer - by saw the boat bobbing in the water and noticed an empty pickup truck nearby , along with a fishing pole , boats , wallet and keys in the grass .
The passer - by called the police , and the bodies were found a short time later .
Family members declined to comment on the accident .

This is a review of Edward S. Herman and David Peterson ’s ‘’ The Politics of Genocide ’ , Monthly Review Press , New York , 2010 .
Edward Herman is a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania and David Peterson is described as a Chicago - based journalist and researcher .
Those who have read Herman 's work , some of it in collaboration with Noam Chomsky , will only partly know what to expect from his latest book .
Herman and Peterson argue that in a world controlled by the American empire and its media and intellectual lackeys , genocide has become a political construct largely manipulated by Washington and its allies .
The claim of genocide becomes an excuse for so - called humanitarian intervention that disguises malevolent imperial motives : ‘ The Western establishment rushed to proclaim “ genocide ” in Bosnia - Herzegovina , Rwanda , Kosovo , and Darfur … In contrast , its silence over the crimes committed by its own regimes against the peoples of Southeast Asia , Central America , the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa is deafening .
This is the “ politics of genocide ” . ’
Herman and Peterson give some examples that should be familiar to all who reject the notion of the US as a unparalleled force for good in the world .
The suffering of Iraqis under US - led sanctions in the 1990s , American support for Israel 's repression in Gaza and destruction in Lebanon , the American role in the brutal massacres of Guatemalans and Salvadorans in the 1980s , America 's backing for Indonesia 's blood bath in East Timor – all are true , all are appalling , and all have been thoroughly documented .
No doubt it 's good for a new generation to be reminded of these atrocities , invariably distorted or ignored by the mainstream media .
But I 'm not at all sure that it 's helpful to explore these issues against a frame of genocide , and it 's supremely destructive that incontrovertible incidents of American crimes , such as the above , are included with bizarre fictions that have poisoned the authors ' minds , such as below .
This was decidedly unexpected from Edward Herman .
PLAYING THE ‘EXPERT ’ CARD IN RWANDA
To this stage , this little volume might on balance just be considered recommended reading .
Despite its strange biases and excesses in belabouring its thesis , it 's a useful reminder of American double standards that should not be forgotten ( particularly given the disappointing record of the Obama administration ) .
But all of this is mere preliminary for Herman and Peterson .
Their main target , which is none of the cases mentioned so far , can be found squarely in the heart of the book .
It 's chapter 4 , the longest single section , and its purpose is to show that the 1994 genocide of the Rwandan Tutsi never happened .
In fact the entire ‘ genocide ’ in Rwanda is an elaborate American conspiracy to ‘ gain a strong military presence in Central Africa , a diminution of its European rivals ' influence , proxy armies to serve its interests , and access to the raw material - rich Democratic Republic of the Congo ’ .
The authors ' greatest bete noir is Paul Kagame , commander of the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) rebels during the 1990 - 94 civil war and 1994 genocide , long - time president of post - genocide Rwanda – and leading Yankee stooge .
Yes , in order to blame the American empire for every ill on earth , Herman and Peterson , two dedicated anti-imperialists , have sunk to the level of genocide deniers .
And the ‘ evidence ’ they adduce to back up their delusional tale rests solidly on a foundation of other deniers , statements by genocidaires , fabrications , distortions , innuendo and gross ignorance .
In this Grimm fairy tale , everyone who contradicts their fantasies is an American / RPF pawn – Paul Kagame , human rights investigator Alison des Forges , the head of the UN military mission in Rwanda during the genocide General Romeo Dallaire , and entire human rights organisations .
The main authorities on whom the authors rest their fabrications are a tiny number of long - time American and Canadian genocide deniers , who gleefully drink each other 's putrid bath water .
Each solemnly cites the others ' works to document his fabrications – Robin Philpot , Christopher Black , Christian Davenport , Allan Stam , Peter Erlinder .
It 's as if a Holocaust denier cited as supporting evidence the testimonies of David Irving , David Duke , Robert Faurisson or Ernest Zundel .
Be confident Herman and Peterson are now being quoted as authoritative sources on the genocide by Robin Philpot , Christopher Black , Davenport and Stam , Peter Erlinder .
In reality , there is only a relative handful of these American deniers , but the vast power of the internet makes them seem ubiquitous and forceful .
Any online search for ‘ Rwanda genocide ’ gives them a vastly disproportionate pride of place .
Besides the five cited by Herman and Peterson , this rogue 's gallery of American deniers also includes Keith Harmon Snow and Wayne Madsen , who will bitterly resent the authors for failing to invoke them in their book .
Let me take a moment on Peter Erlinder , since he 's been in the news recently .
( Pambazuka News 466 , January 21 , 2010 .
While my review regretted that the Rwandan government had n't sought an independent investigation to take place , and while the Committee had obvious pro-RPF biases , I nevertheless found their comprehensive report highly persuasive .
They also smartly included a ballistics report from staff at the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom based at Cranfield University that supported their conclusions .
The report demonstrates why the RPF could not have been in a position to launch the fatal missiles while elements of the Rwandan army and Presidential Guard had the capacity , the means and the will to do so .
The report also documents the only logical motive for the attack , one that many other scholars had already anticipated .
In the Dar es Salaam meeting of regional presidents that he attended on his final day , 6 April , Habyarimana announced what he had just told his own senior advisors .
After stalling for months ( a fact Herman and Peterson seem not to grasp at all ) , he was finally about to implement the Arusha Accords .
That meant power - sharing in government and the full integration of the Rwandan and RPF armies .
The personal consequences for many Hutu government and military officials would be disastrous .
The latter had long sworn , publicly and privately , that they would accept Arusha over their dead bodies , and had pressured Habyarimana not to succumb to external pleas to implement .
Finally , however , he decided he had no recourse but honour the agreement , and the extremists decided to nullify Arusha over their president 's dead body .
Any reasonable person open to the evidence , including the likely motivation for the deed , will find the Mutsinzi Report credible .
But I do n't expect for a second that Messrs .
Peterson or Herman or Black or Erlinder or Stam or Davenport or Philpot to accept a single word of it .
No more do I expect them to agree with a single word in this review .
They are well beyond evidence or reason or commonsense .
They live in a different universe of witnesses and evidence , enough to satisfy themselves that the world has gotten Rwanda wrong and only they in the world have got it right .
THE TRAGEDY OF AMERICAN ANTI -IMPERIALISM
Edward Herman and David Peterson have written a very short book that 's not nearly short enough .
It should never have seen the light of day .
It brings shame to its two American authors , its publisher Monthly Review , and all those who have provided enthusiastic jacket blurbs , many of them prominent in progressive circles – Noam Chomsky , John Pilger , Norman Solomon , David Barsamian .
If this is what Anglo - American Marxism , or socialism , or anti-imperialism has degenerated into , we can hang our heads in shame for the future of the left .
Why a lifetime anti-imperialist leftist like Herman ( and presumably Peterson ) wants to exculpate the Serbs of Bosnia , Croatia and Serbia of crimes against humanity is beyond my understanding .
Why would it not have been enough to point out that appalling crimes were committed by all sides , but in every case Serbs were one of those sides ?
The only conceivable reason seems to be that the US and its allies singled out the Serbs for attack , which ipso facto makes them the real victims .
Indeed , the authors ' ally Christopher Black perversely sees Milosevic as an heroic figure .
As we 've already seen , hyperbole and slipperiness are cherished tools of the authors , and not just in regards to Rwanda .
‘ The leading mainstream experts on “ genocide ” and mass - atrocity crimes today , ’ they assert , ‘ still carefully exclude from consideration the US attacks on Indo - China as well as the 1965 - 1966 Indonesian massacres within that country ’ .
First note the way they add ‘ mass atrocity crimes ’ to genocidal crimes .
In fact , in many circles it surely remains widely accepted that the US was guilty of appalling atrocities in its aggressions against Viet Nam , Laos and Cambodia .
As for the ‘ exclusion from consideration ’ of those Indonesian massacres , chapter 7 of Totten and Parson 's popular volume ‘ Century of Genocide ’ , is titled ‘ The Indonesian Massacres ’ .
Two other similar examples :
In true conspiratorial fashion , they argue that the crisis in Darfur was exaggerated to distract attention from America 's real African interest , the mineral resources of the Congo .
Why both were n't worthy of serious attention is beyond me .
Nonetheless , they insist that Darfur solidarity activists dishonestly succeeded in framing Darfur as the ‘ unnoticed genocide ’ , though many , including me , have long understood that it's been the best publicised international crisis in decades .
And they charge that it 's the calamity in eastern Congo that ‘ has been truly ignored ’ , even though numerous celebrities , including playwright Eve Ensler ( The Vagina Monologues ) , actor Ben Affleck ( at least four times ) , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have all made high - profile visits to the Kivus .
When the US Secretary of State visits a small province in eastern Congo , you know it 's the opposite of being ignored .
Many of the Rwanda deniers flaunt their left - wing credentials .
As this essay makes clear , they are driven by their anti-Americanism .
Certainly I agree that every progressive necessarily must be anti-American to some degree or other .
But this little band has driven over the edge .
As Peter Erlinder once wrote , America is ‘ the most dangerous Empire the world has ever seen ’ .
Everything bad must be America 's responsibility .
There 's not even room for others to share that responsibility , though the French government 's complicity in the Rwandan genocide , for example , has been definitively documented and is now even implicitly accepted by President Sarkozy and his foreign minister Bernard Kouchner .
Why the deniers are so determined , so passionate , so intransigent , so absolutely certain , so satisfied to remain part of a tiny minority of cranks , is completely unknown to me .
Why they want to create such gratuitous , almost sadistic hurt for the survivors of the genocide in Rwanda is impossible to fathom .
But in the end , it 's irrelevant what furies drive their obsessions .
It 's their egregious views – not their motives – that matter .
And their views relegate them squarely to the lunatic fringe .

The London - based oil trader Trafigura faced criminal charges for the first time today , over the environmental scandal which caused international uproar last year and forced it to compensate thousands of Africans made ill by toxic waste .
At the start of a trial in Amsterdam – at which Trafigura is accused of an initial attempt to get rid of the waste cheaply in the Netherlands – prosecutor Look Bougert told the court the company had put " self - interest above people 's health and the environment " .
He said Trafigura first tried to conceal how dangerous the waste was , then pumped it back on board its tanker and left the Netherlands with hundreds of tonnes of oil residue , contaminated with foul - smelling sulphur mercaptans and toxic hydrogen sulphide .
Instead of paying for specialist disposal , Trafigura " dumped it over the fence " in Abidjan , the main port of poverty - stricken Ivory Coast in west Africa .
" Cheap , but with consequences , " Bougert said .
Trafigura lawyer Aldo Verbruggen said the charges were based on an unfounded moral judgment .
He said : " Trafigura is a company that takes responsible entrepreneurship very seriously . "
The Dutch charges , if upheld , could lead to a large corporate fine and prison sentences of up to six years for two relatively junior individuals , the tanker 's Ukrainian captain , Sergey Chertov , and a London - based Trafigura employee , Naeem Ahmed .
Evert Uittenbosch , director of the Dutch waste disposal firm Amsterdam Port Services , and the Amsterdam city authorities also deny charges of " leaving dangerous waste in the hands of someone not qualified to process it " .
It has been ruled that the company 's chief executive , Claude Dauphin , should not face personal charges .
Nor does the prosecution cover the events after the tanker , the Probo Koala , left Amsterdam , and the subsequent dumping in Abidjan , which sent 30,000 people choking , retching and seeking medical treatment .
Instead , the trial , which is expected to last two months , focuses on the relatively technical question of Trafigura 's behaviour in Amsterdam when the tanker made its first attempt to dispose of the contaminated waste .
The prosecution says it was misdescribed as routine " slops " from ordinary tank - cleaning .
When the disposal company received protests from residents about the foul smell and demanded payment for specialist disposal , Trafigura was allowed instead to pump the waste back aboard and leave the port .
It is illegal to export hazardous waste from a European location to be dumped in Africa .
Trafigura gained notoriety last year when it hired British lobbyist Bell Pottinger , and libel lawyer Carter - Ruck , to threaten European media organisations which sought to investigate the firm 's behaviour .
The company overreached itself and was forced to withdraw , when it attempted to enforce a so - called " super- injunction " against the Guardian , gagging it from reporting proceedings in the British parliament .

This undated image taken from the Russian social networking website " Odnoklassniki " , or Classmates , shows a woman journalists have identified as Anna Chapman , who appeared at a hearing Monday , June 28 , 2010 in New York federal court .
Chapman , along with 10 others , was arrested on charges of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the U.S. attorney general .

Before James
Bond heads out on a mission , he has to stop in Q's laboratory for custom - made gadgets such as an exploding watch .
Life was n't so dashing for the suspected Russian spies arrested this week :
They allegedly relied heavily on off - the - shelf consumer electronics .
" In the old days , they 'd have special KGB - type equipment .
Now they use normal computers , normal laptops , " said Sujeet Shenoi , professor of computer science at the University of Tulsa and a frequent consultant to the FBI .
" Technology is so powerful now that you do n't have to have special - purpose equipment anymore . "
According to the FBI 's complaints that sought the arrest of the 11 suspects , the array of tools included laptops , flash memory cards and at least one prepaid cell phone .
The suspects are accused of backing that up with old - fashioned spy technology such as short - wave radios , invisible ink , and a classic , manual encryption method known as a " one - time pad . "
Short - wave radios were once relatively common in homes .
Today , they 're a bit of a giveaway if the FBI already suspects you 're a spy .
Not so with laptops , cell phones or flash drives .
But that does n't mean spies can feel safe .
The way the Russian suspects used these gadgets was revealing to FBI agents who followed them for years .
The use of " spy - fi " is a case in point .
The FBI said that one of the suspects , Anna Chapman , would go to a coffee shop in Manhattan on Wednesdays and set up her laptop .
A little while later , a minivan the FBI knew was used by a Russian official would drive by .
To the naked eye , there was no contact between them .
But the FBI said it figured out that Chapman 's computer was set to link wirelessly to a laptop in the minivan , using a standard , built - in Wi-Fi chip .
In the short time the computers were close , they could transfer encrypted files between each other .
The agency figured this out with commercial Wi -Fi analysis software , not with something from Q's lab .
Glenn Fleishman , editor of the Wi-Fi Net News blog , said that from a technical standpoint , the Wi-Fi link appeared to be fairly amateurish and laughably easy to sniff out .
He pointed out that there 's at least one other commercially available technology for short - range transmissions , known as ultra - wideband radio , that would likely have been impossible for the FBI to pick up .
On the contrary , Keith Melton , who co-authored the book " Spycraft " with the former director of the CIA 's Office of Technical Service , said the use of Wi-Fi could have been " very smart " because no data passed through the Internet .
The connection would have been impossible to trace - if the FBI had n't been smart and dogged enough to have Wi -Fi analysis equipment in place at the right time .
Melton said the technique is reminiscent of a precursor to today 's BlackBerry , developed by the CIA in the 1970s to give its spies in Russia some way to pass messages unseen to receivers close by .
The downfall was that being caught with the equipment could lead to a death sentence .
In another example of an everyday item allegedly being used for secret communications , the FBI said Chapman bought a cell phone last Saturday under a fake name .
This was probably a " prepaid " phone , which does n't come with a contract .
Because there 's no long - term commitment from the buyer , the sellers do n't check the IDs of the buyers .
That means law enforcement do n't know which numbers suspects are using , making wiretapping very difficult .
Not surprisingly , prepaid phones used once or twice and then thrown away are a favorite tool of criminals and terrorists .
Faisal Shahzad , who admitted to trying to bomb New York 's Times Square on May 1 , used a prepaid phone .
A proposed Senate bill would require buyers to show ID .
In the FBI 's documents , there is no mention of the agency intercepting a call from Chapman 's disposable cell phone .
She bought it just after meeting an undercover FBI agent posing as a Russian official .
He told her to meet another spy the next day , but she did n't show up .
Presumably , she had been suspicious of the " Russian , " called her handler on the cell phone and was warned to stay away .
But again , her behavior was a giveaway , according to the FBI .
She bought the phone in a Brooklyn store , then immediately threw away the bag containing the charger and the customer agreement .
The FBI retrieved the bag , and found she 'd given her name as " Irine Kutsov , " living on " 99 Fake Street . "
Another person charged in the case , Richard Murphy , received a bag with cash and a memory card from a Russian official at a White Plains , N.Y. , train station in 2009 , according to the FBI .
That would be a classic " brush pass , " where conspirators walk by each other and quickly pass an item from one to the other .
The FBI said it caught this exchange on surveillance video .
It was only later that the agency figured out , by eavesdropping , that the bag contained a memory card .
For more than a century , spies have employed methods to miniaturize documents , usually by photographic means that require special equipment .
Flash memory chips , the kind used in cameras , phones and USB drives , make it child 's play to stuff thousands of documents in a tiny , concealable area .
It 's surprising , then , that the spy ring is also alleged to have used one of the oldest ways to conceal writing : invisible ink .
Its height of popularity in intelligence circles was World War I , Melton said .
Now , it 's mainly found in the toy aisle , but that does n't mean it 's obsolete .
" The beauty of it is that no one is looking for it .
It 's so old that it 's been forgotten , " Melton said .
Indeed , the FBI 's complaint does n't mention that it found any documents written in invisible ink .
It just says that it overheard suspect Juan Lazaro telling his wife , Vicky Pelaez , that he was going to write something in " invisible " that she was supposed to pass along to someone on a trip to South America .
A modern update on invisible ink is digital steganography .
Messages can be hidden in images , songs or other files , then uploaded to public sites on the Internet .
No one 's the wiser without knowing which images to look for , and how they are encoded .
In three homes belonging to suspects , the FBI found disks that it suspects were used for steganography .
Agents also said they found a password written on a piece of paper in the Hoboken , N.J. , home of Richard and Cynthia Murphy during a 2005 search .
( The couple later moved to nearby Montclair . )
This allowed agents to decode more than a hundred messages between the Murphys and Moscow , the FBI said .
Although the FBI used high - tech techniques such as surveillance cameras and Wi-Fi sniffing , it got its biggest payoffs from old - fashioned , risky and expensive methods like tailing and house searches .
You can use all the technology you want to hide your tracks , but if you leave the password to your secrets on your desk , old - fashioned sleuthing can still beat high - tech .

Brilliant Star in a Colourful Neighbourhood
A spectacular new image from ESO ’s Wide Field Imager at the La Silla Observatory in Chile shows the brilliant and unusual star WR 22 and its colourful surroundings .
WR 22 is a very hot and bright star that is shedding its atmosphere into space at a rate many millions of times faster than the Sun .
It lies in the outer part of the dramatic Carina Nebula from which it formed .
Very massive stars live fast and die young .
Some of these stellar beacons have such intense radiation passing through their thick atmospheres late in their lives that they shed material into space many millions of times more quickly than relatively sedate stars such as the Sun .
These rare , very hot and massive objects are known as Wolf– Rayet stars [ 1 ] , after the two French astronomers who first identified them in the mid-nineteenth century , and one of the most massive ones yet measured is known as WR 22 .
It appears at the centre of this picture , which was created from images taken through red , green and blue filters with the Wide Field Imager on the MPG / ESO 2.2 - metre telescope at ESO ’s La Silla Observatory in Chile .
WR 22 is a member of a double star system and has been measured to have a mass at least 70 times that of the Sun .
WR 22 lies in the southern constellation of Carina , the keel of Jason ’s ship Argo in Greek mythology .
Although the star lies over 5000 light - years from the Earth it is so bright that it can just be faintly seen with the unaided eye under good conditions .
WR 22 is one of many exceptionally brilliant stars associated with the beautiful Carina Nebula ( also known as NGC 3372 ) and the outer part of this huge region of star formation in the southern Milky Way forms the colourful backdrop to this image .
The subtle colours of the rich background tapestry are a result of the interactions between the intense ultraviolet radiation coming from hot massive stars , including WR 22 , and the vast gas clouds , mostly hydrogen , from which they formed .
The central part of this enormous complex of gas and dust lies off the left side of this picture as can be seen in image eso1031b .
This area includes the remarkable star Eta Carinae and was featured in an earlier press release ( eso0905 ) .

New 1st Doctor Who & Tardis Set
| By
And the Doctor Who news keeps on rolling .
It ’s a new item that ’s shown up on Ebay , the 1st Doctor in his alternate outfit in the Tardis .
The Tardis is a repaint of another classic Tardis it appears .
Early word is that this might be a SDCC exclusive , but that is n’t confirmed yet .
Actually as is often the case with Character Options …
Nothing is confirmed .
The Underground Toys logo is right there on the front , so that might lead some credence to the idea that this is a SDCC exclusive commissioned by them .
I missed this version of the First Doctor the last time it came around , so I ’ll pick up Bill Hartnell in his magic Police box if I get the chance in this set .
I fear there is even more Doctor Who stuff that ’s going to be coming soon .
Time to crack open those piggie banks !

In Tampere , Finland , the pre-Akademy party kicked off the conference last night .
Hundreds of KDE contributors were there , meeting old and new friends and enjoying the party .
Rowdy Brazilians and Dutch cheered on their teams as their countries battled each other in the World Cup on the big screen .
Others spent time reliving their childhood on the classic arcade machine .
This morning , the main conference will start with a keynote by Valtteri Halle , member of the MeeGo technical steering group and director of Nokia Meego Software .
He will open the conference talking about one of the main tracks at Akademy this year , mobile computing interfaces and their influence on modern interfaces .
Over the course of two days , over 40 other speakers will discuss topics as diverse as Cloud computing , speech recognition and our efforts on porting to MS Windows .
Those talks will be recorded as much as possible so those who had to stay home will be able to see what is being discussed .
The dot editors and the KDE promo team look forward to keeping you all informed on what is going on here and sharing a bit of this experience !
Be sure to join the !
Akademy group on identi.ca to follow the buzz .
For every other manufacturer - do the model names and numbers have to be so opaque ?
They could all cut it down to 5 or 6 well designed , sensibly named models and still sell more units .
Whenever a friend is looking for a machine they try and wade through the HP , Dell and Sony websites .
Eventually they give up trying to decipher the model names , and whether they should be looking iin " Everyday " , " Performance " , " Thin & Light " or " Business " categories and end up ordering a Macbook .

They were pretty good , but are apparently discontinued .
It 's no secret that affording college tuition and all the related expenses can be a daunting prospect for students and families .
According to the College Board in New York , tuition costs in 2010 have increased 6.5 % for public universities and 4.4 % for private — that 's about twice the national inflation rate .
Students who are responsible for all or part of these costs are in for a rude awakening regarding debt levels and should prepare themselves for a crash - course in frugal living .
Since graduating from college 18 years ago , I 've had the opportunity to work with younger people struggling to pay undergraduate loans , graduate students embarking on a whole new debt load , and my own peers finally making those last loan payments .
Though each circumstance is unique , there appears to be a few common strategies that can help contain the financial impact of college .
They may not appeal to everyone or always fit in with the idyllic notion of ivy - draped walls or lingering existential exploration , but they can help keep students focused and insulated from some of the worst financial blows .
Here are my seven tips for minimizing the costs of college .
1 . Get in and get out
The average yearly tuition at a public university is $ 7,020 and more than $ 26,000 for private .
This is no time to dawdle .
Enjoy your college experience , make friends , learn , and broaden your horizons , but do so with intent .
More time in college now means more time paying for college ( with interest ) later .
Realize that it 's not just tuition that 's putting you in the red .
Textbooks , housing , lost earnings and lost time invested in actively building your career all impact the bottom line .
Beyond getting what you came for ( a 4 - year degree ) , get in and get out .
2 . Make your adviser your best friend
A college degree is formulaic :
By following a predetermined combination of coursework ( minding prerequisites and GPA ) , you 're rewarded with a particular number of credits which equal a degree .
Done .
Your college adviser keeps you on - track for graduation by monitoring your adherence to the formula and informing you of acceptable variables within it .
As you meet with him , make certain you have all the information necessary to help him do the job .
Take notes , ask questions , follow - up , and double - check the facts .
Being an active advisee helps ensure that you do n't take courses you do n't need or face unnecessary delays on your degree path because of an unforeseen prerequisite .
No one 's infallible ; keep your own spreadsheet of coursework completed and coursework remaining and compare it your official transcripts periodically to ensure accuracy .
3 . Do n't change majors
College should be a time when you have room to explore interests and some liberty to revise your goals .
Use the first two years of your general education coursework to actively explore different fields of study so that you are more certain when the time comes to declare a major .
Once declared , realize that any significant change means more coursework , more time and more money .
4 . Be a four - season learner
Minimizing the number of calendar years that you devote to college can't be overstated .
A well - paced , credit - focused college life that makes room for friends , study and part - time work should be a year - round , uninterrupted endeavor .
Summers off - campus disrupt routine and can allow the temptations of life to derail college plans altogether .
Summer coursework , though condensed , can give you a head start on credit requirements for the following term with reduced distractions and a quieter campus .
5 . Do n't discount community colleges
Community colleges may not inspire us to wax nostalgic about our alma mater later in life , but if tuition costs are a real concern , start here .
Tuition at community colleges can be significantly lower than even public universities .
Explore your options , pay attention to how your credits will transfer , and see if this option might work for you .
6 . Avoid the bookstore blues
Getting your textbooks at the campus bookstore may be easier and quicker , but you 'll pay for that convenience .
Check out Amazon.com or Half.com for deeply discounted prices .
With a little planning and legwork , the price of those textbooks each term can be a little less stratospheric .
7. Rethink housing
One of the smartest housing strategies I remember from my own college years came from the sister of dear friend of mine .
Before her freshman year , her parents made a trip to the town where she was to attend college and purchased a modest two - bedroom mobile home in a quiet mobile home park .
The place cost about $ 15,000 , if I remember correctly .
She moved in a few weeks before classes started and rented the spare bedroom to a friend .
The rent she charged took care of the utilities and lot fee .
This situation , with the expected roommate turnover , lasted the entire four years .
Upon graduation , the parents sold the mobile home for a couple thousand more than they paid for it .
I 've always remembered this approach as keenly efficient and pragmatic — essentially zero housing costs for their daughter and some real - life landlord responsibilities and experience to boot .
Lovely .
College should n't be all science and no art ; there are larger life lessons to learn than money management .
But at times , the combination of youth , the first tastes of freedom and the array of choices can all conspire to make college more expensive than necessary .
These are just a few ideas that can help reign in those costs and keep students on - track .
Grants , work - studies , and careers paths that allow for eventual loan forgiveness are all important avenues to investigate too .
Prepared or not , Frugality 101-301 become part of the required coursework for both students and parents during these years .
The Beaver Street Reprise in San Francisco , California – home to the Craig Steely Architect office as well as Steely ’s “ home ” in a more traditional sense – was getting too cozy for comfort .
To accommodate his own blooming business and that of his painter wife , as well as their growing son , rather than moving homes the architect opted to reconfigure the existing plan .
The makeover meant relocating the kitchen , living room and dining area to a new rooftop level atop the existing two - storey , wood - clad home .
The elegant new addition features floor - to - ceiling windows ( like every level of the house ) and opens onto a little private piece of heaven in the city – an outdoor living space with a sod roof and lovely south - facing outdoor deck , complete with a chic fireplace .
The professional office occupies the lower part of the house .

Are You There ?
W.H. Auden
Each lover has some theory of his own
About the difference between the ache
Of being with his love , and being alone :
Why what , when dreaming , is dear flesh and bone
That really stirs the senses , when awake ,
Appears a simulacrum of his own .
Narcissus disbelieves in the unknown ;
He cannot join his image in the lake
So long as he assumes he is alone .
The child , the waterfall , the fire , the stone ,
Are always up to mischief , though , and take
The universe for granted as their own .
The elderly , like Proust , are always prone
To think of love as a subjective fake ;
The more they love , the more they feel alone .
Whatever view we hold , it must be shown
Why every lover has a wish to make
Some kind of otherness his own :
Perhaps , in fact , we never are alone .
Commentary :
Imagination , born from pain , gives us true love in our dreams .
“ Dear flesh and bone ” is there ; the price is two different aches , though – one pain from the absence of the lovers ’ body , the other from the absence of his soul .
Those pains correspond to “ the ache of being with his love , and being alone . ”
The literal reason why they correspond is that we are not given an instance in the poem of anyone actually having a lover .
The only thing that comes close is the dream of the second stanza .
The three stanzas before the last give us the pain of youth , childhood , and the aged , in that order .
Narcissus , a youth , can be said to be self - absorbed because he believes love is real : the problem of youth is the arrogance which stems from actually having something to believe in , one ’s dreams .
The child ’s “ pain ” comes from a different problem : it is unclear the child has pains .
The list of water , fire and stone implies a fourth element : wind .
A child is mischievous like the wind , taking everything for granted .
Can taking everything for granted be said to be a hallmark of love ?
Of course not – if the child has a “ pain ” as regards love , it is the lack of love coming from the child ’s inability to conceive an Other .
Finally , Proust very much thinks love a “ subjective fake : ” “ Swann ’s Way , ” the first volume of Remembrance of Things Past , was very good btw , and all you really need to read of Proust ’s in order to see this .
In that work , Proust turns to nature over and over again to search for meaning in life , and when we realize that , we realize that jumping into a lake or acting like the wind are also manifestations of humanity mimicking nature .
The distance which creates love is written into the world .
The lack of a lover ’s body is nowhere more apparent than in loving your own reflection ; the lack of a lover ’s mind is nowhere more apparent than in jumping from tree to tree in joyful , thoughtless bliss .
Yet the lack of body , for Narcisssus , comes about because he thinks he understands that which he sees : the reflection and him share the same mind , he hopes .
Similarly , the child , in not thinking , is the sensuality of the world : being young , he does not just recall the newness that creation speaks , he also demonstrates , in his activity , the truest love of body in play .
Who cares how nature thinks ?
What matters is that it is there , and wonderful .
Now that we have exhausted this poem quite a bit , the cryptic final stanza should make more sense .
The want for otherness is less a “ want ” but more a realization of self .
If you look at what you want , you see who you are .
And so it cannot be said that we are alone , inasmuch we are creatures of desire .

Seton Shields * Genealogy Grants
222 grants awarded since May 2000 !
After 20 years beginning in 2000 and a total of 222 grants , I decided it was a fitting time in 2020 to wrap up the Seton Shields Genealogical Grant program ( something about all those 2s and 0s appealed to me ! ) , so no further applications will be accepted .
It 's been my pleasure to play a small part in supporting a variety of projects spearheaded by genealogical societies , local and specialized libraries , and avid genealogists around the world these past two decades .
If you 've got a few minutes , please consider perusing the recipients below and on linked pages as many have worthy endeavors still worthy of the support of fellow genealogists .
Thanks !
What Do You Mean by " Genealogy Grants " ?
Genealogical societies , local and specialized libraries , and avid genealogists are always short of the funds they need to access or buy appropriate research resources , acquire computers and other equipment , get collected information into print , digitized , and / or online , and pursue other projects .
I ’d like to take a tiny step toward addressing this problem .
If you represent an organization which serves the genealogical community at large - or if you serve a smaller community ( perhaps you produce a family newsletter , host a website , organize reunions or some such thing ) -- and find yourself shy of necessary funds , please consider filling out the form below to apply for a small grant .
I will review all submissions and periodically select one for a donation .
My goal is one per quarter .
Submissions will remain active candidates for six months from the date of receipt .
Hint : I find myself drawn to innovative ideas that can serve as a model to others !
Why not give it a go ?
I 'm just one person , so I can only give small amounts , but I 'm operating on the optimistic principle that every little bit helps .
For the few minutes it takes to complete this form , you may be able to buy that handful of books or that scanner that 's been on your wish list for so long .
What 's the Catch ?
There is none .
Honest .
I have had so much fun with genealogy for three decades and have benefited from the help of countless other genealogists .
Now it 's my turn to give back to the genealogical community .
Read More about Megan 's Seton Shields Genealogy Grant program here and in this Wall Street Journal article .

BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The counter - revolution is underway .
The G - 20 calls for members to slash their budget deficits .
The U.S. Senate ices further aid for the unemployed .
The head of the Business Roundtable slams President Obama for undermining American capitalism .
Wall Street succeeds in watering down reform .
Depending on your politics , you 'll love this or hate it .
But there 's just one problem .
We 're still living in a fantasyland .
Most people have no idea what 's really going on in the economy .
They 're living on spin , myths and downright lies .
And if we do n't know the facts , how can we make intelligent decisions ?
Key updates on the economy this week
Here are the three biggest economic myths -- the things everything thinks they know about the economy that just ai n't so .
Myth 1 : Unemployment is below 10 %
What nonsense that is .
The official jobless rate , at 9.7 % , is a fiction and should be treated as such .
It does n't even count lots of unemployed people .
The so - called " underemployment " or U - 6 rate is an improvement :
For example it counts discouraged job seekers , and those forced to work part - time because they can't get a full - time job .
That rate right now is 16.6 % , just below its recent high and twice the level it was a few years ago
And even that may not tell the full story .
Many people have simply dropped out of the labor force statistics .
Consider , for example , the situation among men of prime working age .
An analysis of data at the U.S. Labor Department shows that there are 79 million men in America between the ages of 25 and 65 .
And nearly 18 million of them , or 22 % , are out of work completely .
( The rate in the 1950s was less than 10 % . )
And that does n't even count those who are working part - time because they can't get full - time work .
Add those to the mix and about one in four men of prime working age lacks a full - time job .
Dean Baker , economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington , D.C. , says the numbers may be even worse than that .
His research suggests a growing number of men , especially in deprived , urban and minority neighborhoods , have vanished from the statistical rolls altogether .
Myth 2 : The markets are panicking about the deficit
To hear the G - 20 tell it , the U.S. and other top countries had better slash those budget deficits before the world comes to an end .
And maybe the markets should be panicking about the deficits .
But they 're not .
It 's that simple .
If they were , the interest rate on government bonds would be skyrocketing .
That 's what happens with risky debt : Lenders demand higher and higher interest payments to compensate them for the dangers .
But the rates on U.S. bonds have been plummeting recently .
The yield on the 30 - year Treasury bond down to just 4 % .
By historic standards that 's chickenfeed .
Panicked ?
The bond markets are practically snoring .
They are n't seeing inflation either .
On the contrary , they 're saying it will average just 2.3 % a year over the next three decades .
That 's the gap between the interest rates on inflation - protected Treasury bonds and the rates on the regular bonds .
By any modern standard the forecast is low .
Instead of worrying about inflation , some are starting to worry about something even more dangerous : deflation , or falling prices .
If that takes hold , cutting spending and raising taxes would be a bad move .
It 's certainly possible the lenders buying these bonds are being foolish .
And it 's worth noting that the Treasury market is also subject to political distortions , because foreign are among the heavy buyers of bonds .
So it 's worth treating its apparent verdicts with some caution .
Nonetheless , the burden of proof , as usual , is on those who argue the market is wrong .
Myth 3 : The U.S. is sliding into " socialism "
For a system allegedly being strangled in its bed , U.S. capitalism seems to be in astonishingly robust shape .
Numbers published by the Federal Reserve a few weeks ago show that corporate profit margins have just hit record levels .
Indeed .
Andrew Smithers , the well - regarded financial consultant and author of " Wall Street Revalued , " calculates from the Fed 's latest Flow of Funds report that corporate profit margins rocketed to 36 % in the first quarter .
Since records began in 1947 they have never been this high .
The highest they got under Ronald Reagan was 30 % .
The picture is also similar when you exclude financials .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , +1.19 % is above 10,000 .
Small company stocks have rallied astonishingly since early last year :
The Russell 2000 index is back to levels seen not long before Lehman imploded .
Meanwhile Cap Gemini's latest Wealth Report notes that the North American rich saw an 18 % jump in their wealth last year .
Meanwhile , federal spending , about 25 % of the economy this year , is expected to fall to about 23 % by 2013 .
In 1983 , under Ronald Reagan , it hit 23.5 % .
In the early 1990s it was around 22 % .
Some socialism .
These days , three - fifths of the entire budget goes on just three things :
Insurance for our old age ( through Social Security and Medicare ) , defense , and debt interest .
Conservatives do n't want to cut the $ 700 billion - plus we spend on defense .
We can't cut debt interest payments .
And while Social Security and Medicare certainly need reform , the main " problems " are simply rising life expectancy and health care demands .
If we did n't provide for the insurance through our taxes we'd have to do it individually .
What about the rest of the budget ?
It 's jumped from around 7 % of GDP a few years ago to about 10 % now .
Out of control ?
It 's been in the 6 % to 9 % range for decades .
It 's forecast to fall to about 8 % again in a few years .
So much for a revolution .
But here comes the counter - revolution just the same .
You will go blind if you watch this for more than 1 minute .

This is a brief guide to the completely legal activity of squatting - occupying an empty property and making it your home .
It helps avoid homelessness , since renting or buying a house can be prohibitively expensive for many people .
There is a fair chance that you may believe squatting in England and Wales to be illegal .
This is most definitely not the case .
Squatting is not a crime , and if anyone says it is , they are wrong !
With a few exceptions , if you can get into an empty building without doing any damage and can secure it , you can make it your home .
The 1994 Criminal Justice & Public Order
Act has made some changes to the laws about squatting but it is still as legal as it is necessary .
Always remember that squatting is unlawful , not illegal which means that it is a civil dispute , dealt with by a civil court ; and the police have nothing to do with civil disputes .
You will almost certainly be evicted eventually , perhaps very quickly , but you have the same rights as other householders ; the right to privacy , rubbish collection , postal delivery , social security and essential services like water and electricity .
Many squats last only a time but if you choose your place carefully , you may be able to stay for years ( pictured above is St Agnes Place , a whole street in South London squatted for over 30 years ) .
Choosing carefully usually means taking time to gather information .
You could quite easily open the first empty building that you come across , but the chances are that you would not stay there forever .
Opening a new squat is always a bit of a gamble but the more you know the better your odds .
Read on !
Finding a place
All property is owned by someone and it is a good to find out who that someone is before breaking a new place .
Some types of landlord are far easier to deal with than others , so here are a few tips on what to expect from various landlords :
Council Property :
In the past the best places to squat have been local authority owned properties that are not going to be re-let .
This is for a number of reasons .
Councils have a lot of empty properties and often do not have the money to keep them in a lettable state .
Often quite reasonable properties are left empty because of mismanagement , bureaucracy or low demand on hard to let estates ( as people do not want to move to them ) .
If there are a lot of squatters the council will take longer to evict people .
Some councils or individual employees may be unofficially sympathetic to squatters and leave eviction until the properties are required .
Also , councils do have some duties to house people and these duties can sometimes be used as legal defences in possession proceedings .
Be warned , though , that recently more and more Councils have become more hard line in their attitudes towards squatters , and in fact any - one living in council property ; and the incidences of false PIOs , illegal or heavy - handed evictions and trashing property have increased .
Council properties will either be letting stock , ( i.e. properties fit to be let ) , hard to let or awaiting renovation , demolition or sale .
Housing Associations / Trusts :
These are government and or charitably funded housing organisations .
They also have large numbers of empty properties and some are quite reasonable in their attitude to squatters .
Others can be particularly stupid - and nasty .
The different categories of Housing Association property are basically the same as Council property .
Other Large Organisations :
Many government departments and newly privatised quangos own lots of empty properties .
These include the MOD , the police and railway companies , as well as hospitals and schools .
Mortgage Repossessions :
These are places owned by banks or building societies , and are an attractive option simply because there are huge numbers of them .
As long as the previous owners have been evicted , the owners will have to take you to court .
Commercial Property : Private landlords and property companies are always the most unpredictable type of owner - they could send in the heavies or ignore you for years .
They are the type of owner most likely to evict you if you leave the place empty .
In the past few years many pubs have been closed and left empty for years , and have sometimes been successfully squatted .
Private Houses : Empty houses with ' For Sale ' signs outside are not a good option .
If an owner has recently moved out , it is quite likely that someone else is about to move in and so would be very inconvenienced .
A new private owner is able to use the PIO provisions of Section 7 , and is highly likely to do so .
Best avoided .
Moving in
The most difficult part of squatting is actually gaining possession .
Squatters are sometimes arrested for Criminal Damage , which , taken in it 's strictest possible form , is an offence which almost all squatters commit .
Removing steel doors , boards , damaging the front door , even taking out broken parts of a house can be considered Criminal Damage .
But do n't get paranoid !
Only a very small minority of squatters ever get nicked - and with good legal advice they often get off .
The greatest time of risk is when you have just moved in - the police are bound to come nosing around and may accuse you of having smashed windows , etc .
If any damage has been done , make sure it 's repaired immediately .
Opening a squat by yourself can be risky - it 's safer and more fun to do it with others .
Most forcible evictions happen in the first few days , so make sure there 's a group of you who open up the squat and are ready to move in at once .
If the police want to charge you with criminal damage , they 'll have to sort out who actually did it .
Provided no one is caught red - handed or makes any stupid statements , they will obviously have a difficult time deciding who to charge .
The first thing to do once you 're in is to change the lock on the front door and secure all the entrances .
Until you have control over who comes in and out , you do not have possession and can be evicted straight away if the owner or police turn up .
Remember secure all windows and skylights .
Putting up a legal warning ( see below ) in a front window may be helpful , as it may deter the police or owner from breaking in , but you must have someone in the place all the time to back it up .
A legal warning will not stop you being evicted on it's own .
Put up curtains and try to make the place look lived in .
Get down to the gas and electric board quickly - before the owners do .
If the services are on , take a note of the meter readings .
If you use gas or electricity without paying , you can be charged with theft .
If you have neighbours , and enlist their support .
Explain why you are homeless - you may get a surprisingly sympathetic response .
Dealing with the police
It 's best to expect a visit from the local police soon after you 've moved in , as they are bound to turn up sooner or later .
Remember , they have no right of entry without a warrant , so do n’t let them in if you can avoid it .
Let them know the situation .
Say something like :-
" We have moved in here because we have nowhere else .
We did not break anything when entered and we have not damaged anything since .
It is n't a criminal matter ; it 's a civil matter between us and the owners , and they must take us to court for a possession order if they want us to leave " .
Some police act as if they can evict or arrest any squatter they see .
This is not true .
Try to talk to them through the letter box .
Make sure you know the legal situation better than they do ( not usually very difficult ) and show them a copy of the Legal Warning .
If they simply say " get out , do n't be clever " , etc you can point out that they may be committing an offence under section 6 of the Criminal Law Act , because they will be violently entering premises where there is some opposing their entry .
Eviction
Unless you are evicted under Section 6 or 7 of the 1977 Criminal Law Act or the owners have evicted you while you were out , the owner must apply the courts for a possession order .
Any other method will probably be illegal .
Nearly all squats are evicted after a possession order has been made by a court .
The notorious 1994 Criminal Justice & Public Order
Act has not actually changed the position very much .
Apart from a few minor changes to the law about PlOs , it has produced an extra type of possession order called an INTERIM POSSESSION ORDER ( IPO ) .
This can be nasty , but has turned out to be not nearly so bad as everyone thought when it was going through parliament .
It can not be used on the majority of squatters , and so far there have very few IP0s .
Most IP0s which squatters defended have flopped and the owners have been forced to use the old procedures instead .
The important thing about IP0s is that you get very short notice .
You need to take action THE SAME DAY as you get served with the papers .
Get legal advice straight away .
The first warning
The first warning you get may be someone calling your squat saying they are the owner or are acting for the owner .
Ask to see their identification and note the name , address and phone number .
They will probably say something like , " ' You are trespassing and you must leave " .
They may also give you some bullshit about the new IPO procedure and say that the police could come and arrest you at any time .
Make sure you know the facts about IPOs and do n't get intimidated by this sort of talk .
Make a note of everything you heard and said as soon as they leave .
Sign and date it , as it may be useful evidence if you fight the court case .
They will probably ask for the names of all living in the squat , and there is no advantage in withholding this information .
If you volunteer a lot of names - particularly in a big squat – and they forget to send summonses to all those people , you may have a defence in court .
You do n’t have to give your real name , but if you fight the case and require legal aid , you ca n’t get it in a false name !
Quite often the first warning will be a letter rather than a visit .
It will say the same sort of things and probably that you must leave by a certain date or else the owner " will take proceedings " .
Do n't panic about such a letter .
It just means the owner has found out that you 're there .
It 's quite possible that the first warning you get will be the summons .
A summons is the formal notice of the court hearing , and you have the right to get one .
These are civil courts , not criminal ones , so you do n't have to go if you do n't want to .
It 's more of an invitation , but one you should think about accepting if you value your home and want to fight for it .
Of course , some cases are not worth fighting if there is no defence .
You may be better off looking for another place than putting energy into a court case that will go against you sooner or later .
On the other hand , even technical defences can give you a little more time and sometimes quite a lot .
IP0s should always be opposed if possible .
It is beyond the space limitations of this guide , to go into the details of fighting court cases , and it is recommended that you get hold of a copy of the Squatters Handbook which contains stacks of info on every aspect of squatting ( details below ) .
Squat now while stocks last !
If you are homeless and have tried all the accepted ways of getting a home , do n't be afraid to take matters into your own hands instead of letting the system grind you down .
Everyone has the right to a home .
If others can squat , so can you .
Take control of your own life instead of being pushed around by bureaucrats and property owners who are more concerned with money and status than the quality of people 's lives or their happiness .

WASHINGTON – US Congressmen ratcheted up their criticism of Turkey Wednesday , warning that Ankara was risking its historically warm ties with Congress by reaching toward Iran and breaking with Israel .
In a press conference defending Israel ’s raid on a Turkish - flagged aid ship trying to break the Gaza blockade , several dozen of whose passengers had ties to terror organizations , numerous members of Congress turned their ire toward Turkey .
“ Turkey is responsible for the nine deaths aboard that ship .
It is not Israel that ’s responsible , ” declared Rep. Shelley Berkley ( D - Nevada ) , who pointed to Turkish funding and support for the expedition .
“ If Israel is at fault in any way , it ’s by falling into the trap that was set for them by Turkey .
” She continued : “ The Turks have extraordinary nerve to lecture the State of Israel when they are occupiers of the island of Cyprus , where they systematically discriminate against the ecumenical patriarch , and they refuse to recognize the Armenian genocide .
” Her comments – which were accompanied by an announcement that Turkish representatives were no longer welcome in her office – touched on sensitive issues with Turkey that the US has often shied away from pressing Ankara on aggressively .
Her words raised the prospect that the US Congress at least would be more assertive about its displeasure with Turkey .
Speaking at the same press conference , Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Indiana ) said he recently warned the Turkish ambassador that “ With regard to Congress of the United States , there will be a cost if Turkey stays on its current path of growing closed to Iran and more antagonistic to the State of Israel .
” Among other issues , he said , he was now likely to switch his vote to support a resolution recognizing the mass killing of Armenians during the Ottoman empire as a genocide , a move he had voted against in the past because he thought relations with Turkey were more important .
Turkey has vehemently opposed the resolution , briefly recalling its ambassador to the US when the measure passed a House committee earlier this year .
The Obama administration , in keeping with past administrations , has opposed the resolution moving to the full chamber for a vote because of Turkish sensitivities .
Many Jewish lobbies in Washington opposed the resolution on the same grounds .
That argument also resonated in the past with Rep. Peter King ( R - NY ) , another participant in the press conference who said he was now likely to switch positions – as were many other of his colleagues .
King stressed that this was n’t just about Turkey ’s support of the Gaza flotilla and its heavy criticism of Israel , but the government ’s move toward Iran and its turn away from running a secular democratic state .
“ This is a clear effort , I believe , by Turkey to distance itself from the West , and there have to be consequences for that , ” he said .
Indeed , Adam Schiff ( DCalifornia ) cited Turkey ’s opposition to sanctions against Iran in circulating a letter Tuesday calling for his colleagues to take up the Armenian genocide resolution .
“ Now is the time to recognize the Armenian genocide .
As Turkey sides with Iran , why defend its campaign of genocide denial ? ” asked Schiff , who sponsored the resolution .
At this point , Capitol Hill watchers do n’t see enough momentum to force a floor vote , given how explosive the resolution would be in the current state of tension between the US , Turkey and Israel .
But that could change , and insiders did see dissatisfaction with Turkey pushing forward initiatives to investigate the country ’s connection to the flotilla and other moves opposed by Ankara .
The shift in tone , at least , was also evident in a letter Gary Ackerman ( D - New York ) sent to the Woodrow Wilson Center Tuesday afternoon calling on the think tank to rethink honoring Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu with its public service award .
“ Publicly honoring Foreign Minister Davutoglu at this time is absolutely inconsistent – absolutely inconsistent – with the mission of the WWC and the ideals that animated President Wilson ’s administration and foreign policy , ” he wrote in a letter to the center .
At the same time , members of Congress are reaffirming their strong support of Israel and calling on the White House / administration to do the same .
A letter collecting signatures among members urges US President Barack Obama “ to remain steadfast in the defense of Israel in the face of the international community ’s rush to unfairly judge and condemn Israel in international fora such as the United Nations Security Council . ”
The letter has the support of many American Jewish groups , including the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations , which put out a statement strongly backing the measure Wednesday .
But some have taken issue with it .
The progressive J Street lobby urged senators and representatives to amend the letter , or write their own .
“ The sign - on letters now circulating in the House and Senate , while expressing strong American support for Israel – a position we endorse – fail to address the impact of the present closure of Gaza on the civilian population , the deep American interest in resolving this conflict diplomatically , or the urgency of moving forward with diplomacy before it is too late , ” J Street writes .
“ By ignoring these critical issues in favor of a simplistic statement that supports Israeli policy and actions , Congress is serving neither the best interests of the United States or of Israel . ”
British Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party David Cameron has called on civil servants to make suggestions on how the government can save money .
The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has published a list of ideas to " help get more for less " in order to " tackle the deficit " as part of the Spending Review .
The 8th item on the newly published list suggests that the whole of government , including the NHS and the Education services , migrate from Microsoft products , such as Windows and Office , to Linux and other open source software , specifically mentioning the OpenOffice.org office suite .
Under the Spending Challenge , the government is also reaching out to British tax payers directly and asking for ideas as to what can be done to improve services and provide better value for money .
Just last month , for example , the British Cabinet Office said that it would begin to save money through a " clamp down on government web sites " that were unnecessary or too expensive .
The idea of implementing more open source in government is far from a new idea .
In February of 2009 , Osborne published an article in The Times that said when it comes to IT , big companies should take steps towards open standards and that government should take advantage of available open source technologies .
Many other governments and local government organisations in countries and cities around the world , such as Munich with the LiMux project for migrating the city 's public administration to Linux , have launched their own campaigns to reduce costs and switch to open source , with varying degrees of success .

My project .
This post assumes that the reader has read my last post .
This week I had less time to work on my project than the last ones , because it was kind of the last week of the semester for some disciplines .
This was unfortunate from a point of view , but it ’s good in another , because now I ’ve finished most of my disciplines and can focus more .
This is also the reason why the weekly report is slightly delayed .
Most of my work this week was continuing the investigation of the segfault caused by my implementation of allocation in lines .
The most interesting thing I discovered came after a suggestion from my menthor : to use +RTS - DS to turn on the sanity checker .
I runned the code with my allocation implementation and the sanity checker and got a segfault .
I runned again only with the code to free memory in lines and I got also a segfault .
Then I runned without all my patches , using sweep , and I got the segfault .
So it seems that there is something wrong with sweep , and now I ’m investigating this new segfault .
I ’m using the bernouilli program from nofib to test , running with 148 as a parameter and , naturally , +RTS -w - DS passed to the RunTime System .

I started the investigation with the most obvious test : to remove the call to sweep ( ) in rts/sm/GC.c .
if ( major_gc && oldest_gen -> mark ) { if ( oldest_gen -> compact ) compact( gct->scavenged_static_objects ) ; // else // sweep ( oldest_gen ) ;
The result was the same , same segfault in the same place .
So I decided to do it a little stronger and avoid the blocks getting the BF_MARKED flag , so that they are not even marked .
if (!( bd->flags & BF_FRAGMENTED ) ) { // bd->flags |= BF_MARKED ; }
This one worked .
The code in sweep ( ) is not commented , but it ’s irrelevant , since it ignores blocks that do n’t have this flag .
My third try was to comment the places where the BF_MARKED flag is read , to see each one was causing the segfault .
I got a list of places to search with grep , and there were n’t a lot of them .
$ grep BF_MARKED rts/sm/*.c rts/sm/Compact.c : if ( bd -> flags & BF_MARKED ) rts/sm/Evac.c : if ( ( bd -> flags & ( BF_LARGE | BF_MARKED | BF_EVACUATED ) ) !=
0 ) { rts/sm/Evac.c : if ( bd -> flags & BF_MARKED ) { rts/sm/GCAux.c : if ( ( bd -> flags & BF_MARKED ) && is_marked ( ( P_ ) q , bd ) ) { rts/sm/GC.c : if (!( bd->flags & BF_MARKED ) ) rts/sm/GC.c : // time , so reset the BF_MARKED flags .
rts/sm/GC.c : // compact . ( search for BF_MARKED above ) .
rts/sm/GC.c : bd->flags &= ~BF_MARKED ; rts/sm/GC.c : //
Also at this point we set the BF_MARKED flag rts/sm / GC.c : // BF_MARKED is always unset , except during GC rts/sm/GC.c : bd->flags |= BF_MARKED ; rts/sm/Sweep.c : if (!( bd->flags & BF_MARKED ) ) {
The first one is in rts / sm / Compact.c , so it ’s not relevant to the use with - w .
The second one , in rts / sm / Evac.c , is a bit indirect .
if ( ( bd -> flags & ( BF_LARGE | BF_MARKED | BF_EVACUATED ) ) !=
0 ) { // pointer into to - space : just return it .
It might be a pointer // into a generation that we are n't collecting (> N ) , or it // might just be a pointer into to - space .
The latter does n't // happen often , but allowing it makes certain things a bit // easier ; e.g. scavenging an object is idempotent , so it 's OK to // have an object on the mutable list multiple times .
if ( bd -> flags & BF_EVACUATED ) { //
We are n't copying this object , so we have to check // whether it is already in the target generation .
( this is // the write barrier ) . if ( bd -> gen < gct-> evac_gen ) { gct->failed_to_evac = rtsTrue ; TICK_GC_FAILED_PROMOTION ( ) ; } return ; } /* evacuate large objects by re-linking them onto a different list .
*/ if ( bd -> flags & BF_LARGE ) { info = get_itbl( q ) ; if ( info -> type == TSO && ( ( StgTSO *)q ) -> what_next == ThreadRelocated ) { q = ( StgClosure *) (( StgTSO *)q ) -> _link ; *p = q ; goto loop ; } evacuate_large ( ( P_ ) q ) ; return ; } /*
If the object is in a gen that we 're compacting , then we * need to use an alternative evacuate procedure .
*/ if ( ! is_marked ( ( P_ ) q , bd ) ) { mark ( ( P_ ) q , bd ) ; push_mark_stack ( ( P_ ) q ) ; } return ; }
The first if , in line 466 , is executed if any of the three flags is present : BF_LARGE , BF_MARKED or BF_EVACUATED .
The second if , in line 474 , checks for BF_EVACUATED , and returns .
The third if , in line 487 , checks for BF_LARGE and returns .
The code in lines 502-505 is only executed if BF_MARKED is present , and not the other ones .
I tried commenting this code , and got an assertion fail in the user code , so I think this is not a good path to follow .
The second occurence of BF_MARKED is in the same file .
if ( bd -> flags & BF_MARKED ) { // must call evacuate ( ) to mark this closure if evac==rts True *q = ( StgClosure *) p ; if ( evac ) evacuate(q ) ; unchain_thunk_selectors(prev_thunk_selector , ( StgClosure *) p ) ; return ; }
Commenting it , with or without the call to sweep ( ) commented , causes the same segfault .
So , I ’m tending to think this part of the code is unrelated to the issue .
The third occurence is in rts/sm / GCAux.c .
I tried commenting it with all the four combinations of the two others commented and not commented , and all resulted in the segfault in the same place .
There ’s another place to check in rts/sm / GC.c .
Again , commenting it made no difference .
The last one is part of sweep ( ) , so it ’s avoided anyway when the call to this function is commented .

The activists admitted breaking in to EDO MBM and damaging equipment
Seven anti-war activists have been cleared of plotting to damage a Brighton weapons factory after claiming to be preventing Israeli war crimes .
During their three - week trial at Hove Crown Court the activists said they were acting with " lawful excuse " during the break - in at EDO MBM in 2009 .
Five Smash EDO activists were cleared on Wednesday , with the remaining two acquitted on Friday .
The defendants were from Brighton , Bristol and Islington , north London .
Extensive damage was caused to the EDO MBM Technology building in Moulsecoomb along with computer equipment and precision machinery .
EDO MBM is an approved supplier to the Ministry of Defence and governments worldwide .
The activists admitted they broke into EDO MBM in the early hours of 17 January last year and sabotaged equipment worth about £ 200,000 .
But they said they were acting to prevent further alleged war crimes being committed by Israel against Gaza .
It sends a clear indication that sometimes direct action is the only option when all other avenues have failed Solicitor Lydia Dagostino
Simon Levin , 35 , of Montpelier Place , Brighton ; Tom Woodhead , 35 , of London Road , Bristol ; Ornella Saibene , 50 , of Brigstock Road , Bristol ; Bob Nicholls , 53 , of St Nicholas Broad , Bristol and Harvey Tadman , 44 , of Croydon Street , Bristol were all found not guilty of conspiracy to commit criminal damage on Wednesday .
Elijah Smith , 43 , of no known address and Christopher Osmond , 30 , of Islington Park Road , Islington were cleared on Friday .
The defendants ' solicitor , Lydia Dagostino , said : " We are delighted at the result .
" It sends a clear indication that sometimes direct action is the only option when all other avenues have failed . "
Mr Osmond said : " It was the right verdict .
During one operation 1,400 people had been killed , 350 children had died , and nobody was willing to take action .
Major demonstrations
" Our politicians and the United Nations were not taking action to support the people of Gaza and it was necessary for ordinary people to take action like we did . "
He added that there would no let - up in the six - year campaign against the company .
Sussex Police said that , while they respected the decision of the court , 20 people had been convicted following four major demonstrations or targeted action aimed at the firm over the past two years .
" Sussex Police want to facilitate peaceful protests to ensure the safety of both participants and members of the community and to minimise disruption to the city , " said Chief Supt Graham Bartlett .
" When these are not peaceful , we need to fulfil our duty to take action and where necessary investigate and present evidence before the court . "

That ’s the message to NASA from a key group of senators , urging the agency to provide a launcher capable of carrying astronauts beyond low - Earth orbit .
Yet if their measure becomes law , it could come at the expense of more advanced technologies like orbiting fuel depots .
In April , President Barack Obama said he wanted NASA to send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025 , but that the agency would not develop the rocket needed to do so until 2015 .
By this time technologies might have become available that would offer advanced features , such as the ability …
Teenage football fan ' shot dead in South Africa by neighbour after annoying him by playing a vuvuzela '
Popular : Vuvuzelas have been played throughout the World Cup in South Africa
A teenage football fan has been shot dead after irratating his neighbour by playing a vuvuzela .
Asanda Cele was blasted twice in the head and once in the arm , according to police .
The 14 - year - old was found in the man 's back garden and rushed to hospital but died of his injuries .
His father , Sandile Cele , claims Asanda was returning to his home near Durban , when he was shot by a local resident who was known to dislike the horns which have become a major factor in this summer ’s World Cup .
The boy had been watching the national team Bafana Bafana ’s 2 - 1 defeat of France two weeks ago when he was killed .
Mr Cele said : ‘ My son loved soccer and his teams were Manchester United and Bafana Bafana .
' He would always be blowing his vuvuzela , whether his team won or lost .
‘ My neighbour recently moved into the neighbourhood , he did n’t like vuvuzelas and the noise they made .
I think that ’s the reason he killed my son . ’
Mr Cele said his wife , Nontobeko , a nurse , collapsed after hearing of her son ’s death .
Police spokesman Captain Thulani Zwane of KwaZulu Natal police said the suspect was arrested the same day and charged with murder .
He was later released on bail and is expected to re-appear before magistrates next month .
He said : ‘ The man thought the victim was a robber and shot at him .
He was arrested on the same day and has been charged with murder . ’
However Mr Cele disputed the claim .
He added : ‘ It was not that dark and my son was not covering his face so my neighbour could clearly see who he was firing at .
‘ If he thought my son was a criminal he should have fired a warning shot , not shot him three times . ’
Two weeks ago a Zimbabwean man in Bulawayo , Zimbabwe , lost an eye in a fight with three men over a vuvuzela after they claimed the horn belonged to their friend .
I
n the same week South African Yvonne Mayer from Cape Town ruptured her throat in a vuvuzela - blowing competition although doctors said she would not suffer any permanent damage .
The vuvuzelas are a major part of domestic football but have annoyed television fans around the world with their constant loud noise inside stadiums which have been compared to a swarm of bees or rampaging elephants .
Scientists claim they can damage hearing with noise up to 140 decibels prompting some entrepreneurs to sell earplugs at World Cup venues .
' The intent of both proposals is to make the Senate more like the Senate '
By Dylan Matthews
This morning , I went to the latest in a series of Senate Rules Committee hearings on filibusters and holds .
This one focused on two reform proposals , offered by Sens. Michael Bennet and Frank Lautenberg .
Bennet 's proposal is quite sweeping .
It would eliminate anonymous holds , limit holds without bipartisan support to two days , and limit all holds to 30 days .
It would require 41 senators to vote to uphold the filibuster , reversing the current requirement that 60 senators vote to stop it .
That puts the onus of organizing support on those who are filibustering .
It would also try to encourage bipartisanship by allowing 45 senators to kill a filibuster if the filibuster does n't have at least three members of the other party signed onto it .
Lautenberg 's proposal is more modest .
Called the Mr. Smith Bill ( Lautenberg brought a cardboard image of Jimmy Stewart from the film to the hearing ) , the bill would allow the Senate majority leader to call an immediate cloture vote as long as there is no discussion occurring on the Senate floor and the deadline for amendments has passed .
This would force filibusters to actually be conducted on the floor -- hence the " Mr. Smith " moniker -- if the opposition wants to take advantage of the two - day " ripening period " before the Senate can vote to end a filibuster .
Neither Lautenberg nor Bennet wants to eliminate the filibuster entirely .
" The Senate can and must defend the rights of individual or small groups of senators , " Bennet insisted .
But members of the committee thought even the men's more limited measure might go too far .
Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer was enthusiastic about Lautenberg 's plan , calling it " ingenious , " but was more measured on Bennet 's , saying only that it was " extremely interesting " and acknowledging that Bennet had " worked long and hard " on it .
Robert Bennett , the committee 's ranking Republican ( and no relation to Michael Bennet ) , expressed concern that the proposals would turn the Senate into the House , and wreak havoc on the Senate calendar by effectively establishing a one - track legislative process .
Currently , while cloture motions are ripening , the Senate can conduct other business .
Bennett expressed concern that Lautenberg 's plan would prevent this , and stop the Senate 's business in its tracks .
The three experts the committee had called then stepped in to quell his concerns .
Gregory Koger , a professor of political science at the University of Miami and author of a history of the filibuster , disputed the point about legislative tracking .
The Senate would function as usual under the Lautenberg proposal , he insisted , unless the majority leader decided to force on - the - floor filibustering .
A one - track process would be optional , a way for the majority to exert pressure during a filibuster battle .
Koger was strongly supportive of the Lautenberg proposal , saying it , combined with the Senate 's " Pastore rule , " which requires debate to be germane to the topic at hand , would force filibusterers to defend their actions and increase the price of obstruction , putting it closer to what it was before the filibuster became a common tactic in the 1960s .
Far from turning the Senate into the House , Koger insisted , its intent , like the Bennet proposal , is to " make the Senate more like the Senate . "
Koger also disputed the insistence of both Schumer and Tom Udall that the " constitutional option " of changing Senate rules by majority vote is only possible at the start of a Congress .
Koger insisted that the Senate can stop its rules at any point and change them by a simple majority , and that given political considerations , this might be the only way the filibuster can ever be reformed .
That said , given that there are not enough votes in the current Congress to pass a cloture requirement change by simple majority , even Koger 's method might not work .
Barbara Sinclair , a retired political scientist at UCLA , did not endorse either proposal , saying it was her job to present relevant data and senators ' jobs to strike a balance between , in her words , " deliberation and decisiveness . "
She did note , however , that the current system allows neither , creating the worst of both worlds .
Sinclair 's data are striking as always .
In her most vivid example of how the filibuster has slowed the legislative process to a halt , she compared the percentage of bills passed by one house of Congress but not the other before and since the 103rd Congress ( 1993 - 1995 ) .
Before , 6 percent of bills passed the House but not the Senate , and 5 percent passed the Senate and not the House .
Since the 1990s , only 1 percent of bills have passed the Senate but not the House , and a whopping 20 percent have passed the House but not the Senate .
The emergence of the Senate as the main legislative bottleneck , then , is a fairly recent phenomenon .
The most interesting witness , however , was Elizabeth Rybicki , an analyst at the Congressional Research Service .
Rybicki's presence itself was unusual .
CRS analysts do not usually testify before Congress , and Rybicki only appeared by special request of the Republicans on the committee .
Even then , she could not say anything that even looked like an opinion .
Stating her parameters , Rybicki recalled that when her mentor at CRS was asked what he thought about a piece of legislation , he replied , " I 'm not allowed to think . "
All the same , Rybicki had a point to make , and a persuasive one : the Lautenberg and Bennet proposals are too vague .
For example , Lautenberg 's proposal works by allowing the majority leader to " move the question " on cloture .
Rybicki noted that there is no such motion in the Senate rules .
It is clear enough what Lautenberg meant , but the bill as written would be hard to implement .
Similarly , Bennet 's bill seeks to regulate " holds , " which are not a formal process in the Senate .
They occur whenever a member tells the leadership he will object to a unanimous consent request regarding a bill or nomination .
The senator typically will not even have to object on the floor ; contact with the leadership is enough .
To eliminate secret holds , then , one would have to require senators to disclose certain types of communication with the Senate leadership -- which types , exactly , Bennet 's proposal does not specify .
To require holds to be bipartisan , and to expire , would involve tinkering , removing the requirement of unanimous consent itself for certain actions .
The most interesting ambiguities Rybicki identified had to do with Bennet 's proposals to increase the cloture - blocking requirement to 45 if support for breaking cloture is sufficiently bipartisan , or if opposition to it is not .
Bennet 's proposal says this would occur after three " attempts " to invoke cloture .
Does this mean that the majority leader could file four cloture motions on the same day , wait two days , and then have them in a row , with the last requiring 45 votes to break ?
Or could the leader only file another motion after a vote has failed , in which case the earliest the requirement could rise would be nine days after the first filing ?
What 's more , the proposal determines whether a proposal is bipartisan by having the Majority Leader submit a list of members of his caucus to the Congressional Record , a list he can revise at any time .
Let 's say , then , that the current GOP , along with Ben Nelson , Mark Pryor and Mary Landrieu , decides to filibuster a bill .
They would only have 44 votes , but they would have enough Democratic support to prevent the cloture - blocking requirement from rising to 45 .
Could Harry Reid submit a new caucus list to the Congressional Record , not including Nelson , Pryor , and Landrieu , see the requirement rise to 45 , and break the filibuster ?
Under the current wording of the Bennet proposal , this seems to be possible .
Far from encouraging bipartisanship , then , Bennet 's proposal could in effect raise the cloture - breaking requirement to 45 , with no additional wait , and no additional requirements .
Katrina Cover - Up : Cops May Face Death Penalty NOLA police officers accused of gunning down citizens , trying to cover it up .
July 14 , 2010  --
Four police officers , charged with shooting and killing two unarmed civilians on a bridge in the days after Hurricane Katrina , could face the death penalty .
Those four officers and two others are accused of gunning down citizens and trying to cover it up .
Five other former police officers have already pleaded guilty to helping cover up the killings , bringing the total to 11 charged so far .
The entire New Orleans police department is under investigation , stemming from allegations of misconduct .
" We will not tolerate wrongdoing by those who are sworn to protect the public , " said Attorney General Eric Holder , who was in New Orleans Tuesday to announce the charges in the civil rights investigation .
" This will not stand . "
In the chaotic days after the August 2005 storm , a family tried to cross the Danziger Bridge to get to the supermarket for food and supplies , and two other men were on the bridge on their way to check on their brother 's dental office when , justice officials allege , the shootings took place .
The FBI said New Orleans police showed up , responding to reports of gunfire , and opened fire with assault rifles and a shotgun .
When it was over , two unarmed citizens were killed and four wounded .
One of the victims was a severely mentally disabled man , who was allegedly shot in the back as he tried to flee .
" These police officers took oaths to protect the people of New Orleans and instead , as alleged in the indictment , they killed two people and wounded four others , " said Kevin Perkins , assistant director of the FBI 's Criminal Investigative Division .
Initially , police said they fired in self - defense .
" They approached the subjects who were several , several feet away , who fired on the police officers .
The officers returned fire , " said former deputy police chief Warren Riley at a September 2005 press conference .
Tuesday , the Justice Department said that statement was based on a lie , and that the officers shot civilians without cause and planted a gun at the scene as part of an elaborate cover - up , which included creating fictional witnesses and falsifying police reports .
" We recognize that for prosecutors and police alike , our integrity is our most important currency .
Without it we lose the confidence ... and respect of the community , " said Thomas E. Perez , assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division .
Bridge Shooting Case One of Many Allegations of Police Misconduct
Sgts .
Robert Gisevius and Kenneth Bowen , officer Anthony Villavaso and former officer Robert Faulcon were charged with deprivation of rights under the color of law and use of a weapon during the commission of a crime .
A lawyer for Gisevius told The Associated Press that Tuesday 's indictment did not come as a surprise .
" We have long anticipated that this day may come , " Eric Hessler said .
The Justice Department got involved in the case after a state judge threw out the charges of murder or attempted murder in August 2008 .
Justice Department officials vow to help clean up corruption in the New Orleans police department , which has been stewed in controversy for alleged misconduct after Katrina .
Tuesday 's charges come one month after five current or former New Orleans police officers were accused of fatally shooting 31 - year - old resident Henry Glover , and then burning his body in a car to cover up the crime .

Check Out This Chicago Style Tattoo

A furious diplomatic row erupted between London and Islamabad tonight after David Cameron accused elements of the Pakistani state of promoting the export of terrorism .
Speaking on his visit to neighbouring India , the prime minister launched the strongest British criticism yet of Pakistan , warning that the country could no longer " look both ways " by tolerating terrorism while demanding respect as a democracy .
Angry responses followed from Pakistani officials in the UK and the foreign ministry in Islamabad .
The row comes as Pakistan 's president , Asif Ali Zardari , prepares to visit Britain next week .
He is due to stay at the prime minister 's country retreat of Chequers .
Writing for the Guardian 's Comment is free site , Pakistan 's high commissioner to Britain accused Cameron of damaging the prospects for regional peace and criticised him for believing allegations in the secret military logs of the Afghanistan conflict published earlier this week .
The leaked documents suggest that the ISI , one of Pakistan 's two military intelligence agencies , was encouraging the Taliban as recently as last year .
Wajid Shamsul Hasan , Pakistan 's high commissioner , wrote : " One would have wished that the prime minister would have considered Pakistan 's enormous role in the war on terror and the sacrifices it has rendered since 9/11 .
" There seems to be more reliance on information based on intelligence leaks which lack credibility of proof .
A bilateral visit aimed at earning business could have been done without damaging the prospects of regional peace . "
The prime minister initiated the row this morning in a speech to Indian business leaders in Bangalore , when he spoke of his horror at the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai for which Delhi directly blamed the Pakistani authorities .
Cameron came close to endorsing that view when he said : " We can not tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able to promote the export of terror , whether to India or Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world .
" That is why this relationship is important .
But it should be a relationship based on a very clear message : that it is not right to have any relationship with groups that are promoting terror .
Democratic states that want to be part of the developed world cannot do that .
The message to Pakistan from the US and from the UK is very clear on that point . "
Pakistan took the rare step of issuing an official rebuttal .
Abdul Basit , a spokesman for the Pakistani foreign ministry , told Radio 4's World at One : " There is no question of Pakistan looking the other way .
I think the prime minister was referring to these reports , which are unverifiable and outdated .
If we start drawing inferences from these self - serving reports , then obviously we are distracting ourselves . "
Pakistani senator Khurshid Ahmad , vice - president of the Islamist Jamaat - e - Islami party , said : " I am deeply concerned .
The basis on which this statement has been made is very fragile .
The documents released are unreliable : 90 % of them have been attributed to Afghan intelligence agencies , whose reports are totally unreliable and fabricated .
On the basis of such a report , it is not acceptable to make the statement that has been made . "
Britain has spoken in the past of the terror threat from Pakistan , though ministers have restricted themselves to criticising Pakistan for tolerating terror groups .
But the prime minister 's language came close to endorsing the Indian view that authorities in Pakistan have a hand in the terror .
Cameron named several terror groups which are , according to India , sponsored by Pakistan .
" We – like you – are determined that groups like the Taliban , the Haqqani network or Lakshar - e - Taiba should not be allowed to launch attacks on Indian and British citizens in India or in Britain . "
Downing Street insisted the prime minister was not accusing Pakistan 's government of sponsoring terrorism .
But a few minutes after his speech , Cameron made clear that official agencies in Pakistan were responsible for harbouring terrorists .
Asked on the Today programme whether Pakistan exports terrorism , Cameron said : " I choose my words very carefully .
It is unacceptable for anything to happen within Pakistan that is about supporting terrorism elsewhere .
It is well - documented that that has been the case in the past , and we have to make sure that the Pakistan authorities are not looking two ways .
They must only look one way , and that is to a democratic and stable Pakistan . "
The prime minister 's words on Pakistan overshadowed the first day of a visit to India designed to herald a new special relationship .
Downing Street says the trip is meant to show that Britain can treat India as a normal trading partner , with the security issues surrounding Delhi 's troubled relations with Pakistan dealt with on a separate tack .
But the main business announcement – a relaxation of licence rules to allow the export of civil nuclear technology and expertise to India – had the potential to upset its nuclear neighbour .
Pakistan and India have refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , prompting the last Labour government to refuse to co-operate with India on civil nuclear power .
Ministers had feared there would be leakage to its military nuclear programme .
The US sanctioned the use of civil nuclear technology to India in 2008 .
Britain believes today 's agreement is compatible with the NPT , which bans the sale of nuclear technology to nuclear powers that have not signed it .

REUTERS / China Daily
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Almost a quarter of China ’s surface water remains so polluted that it is unfit even for industrial use , while less than half of total supplies are drinkable , data from the environment watchdog showed on Monday .
Inspectors from China ’s Ministry of Environmental Protection tested water samples from the country ’s major rivers and lakes in the first half of the year and declared just 49.3 percent to be safe for drinking , up from 48 percent last year , the ministry said in a notice posted on its website ( www.mep.gov.cn).
China classifies its water supplies using six grades , with the first three grades considered safe for drinking and bathing .
Another 26.4 percent was said to be categories IV and V -- fit only for use in industry and agriculture -- leaving a total of 24.3 percent in category VI and unfit for any purpose .
Despite tougher regulations over the last decade , the ministry has struggled to rein in the thousands of small paper mills , cement factories and chemical plants discharging industrial waste directly into the country ’s waterways , and the overuse of fertilizers has also left large sections of China ’s lakes and rivers choking with algae .
The ministry said there were noticeable improvements in air quality throughout the country ’s cities in the first half of 2010 , with sulphur dioxide emissions declining 30.2 percent compared to last year .
Airborne particulate matter in China ’s cities fell 12.1 percent and nitrogen dioxide declined 5 percent , the ministry said .
However , 189 out of 443 cities monitored suffered from acid rain in the first half of the year .
A while back I had a GIS project surrounding food deserts in southeastern Michigan .
Using locations of significantly sized grocery stores ( had to be a chain , such as Meijer , Kroger , Aldi , Save - A - Lot , etc. ) , I created the above layout .
Hopefully the layout does a good job at showing the locations of food deserts in the region , because I received an “ A ” for a grade .
There was a tweet this morning that set this blog post into motion : “ A Michigan couple helps to fill # Detroit ‘s fresh food void with their produce store .
http://ow.ly/249Uw via @urbanbydesign . ”
Oddly enough , the store mentioned in this post does not get business nor demand that it could being in Detroit ’s midtown neighborhood .
Furthermore , it ’s in a location of high density , traffic , and one of the city ’s most significant food deserts .
Detroit , not only being one of the nation ’s murder capitals , is also considered to be one of the heaviest cities in the nation , usually competing with St. Louis .
Furthermore , the latest escapade of previous Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick , who was just indicted on 19 counts of federal fraud , alongside the challenges of Detroit Public Schools , might suggest that the problems of education are deeply rooted in a city and that healthy eating is not on the top of the list to fix .
Combined with the severe spatial disparity of metropolitan detroit , perhaps people ’s idea of “ eating local ” is the McDonald ’s down the block rather than bussing it to the grocery store .
We know not everybody has the means to own a car , and crossing the city via bus can be a pain .
Food deserts for those who own cars are not as an immediate threat than to those who do n’t have the economic resources to drive daily .
If it were me , I ’d be more likely to feed my family off of what ’s closer , even if it were a good amount of fast food .
It ’s fortunate to hear about the growing number of urban farms , resources for local food pantries , and gardens .
However , the education does n’t seem to have reached a tipping point yet to the larger community to solve the problems caused by a food desert .
Thoughts ?
It ’s one of those dispatches from the world of social science that leave some gloating and some fuming :
A pair of researchers have concluded that when it comes to grasping basic economic concepts , liberals and Democrats are significantly less “ enlightened ” than conservatives and libertarians .
Researchers Daniel Klein and Zeljka Buturovic put forth their analysis in a recent article in Econ Journal Watch , an online scholarly journal , and in a subsequent column Mr. Klein wrote for the Wall Street Journal .
Needless to say , it has elicited a less - than - favorable peer review from liberal economists .
Americans describing themselves as conservative , very conservative and libertarian “ do reasonably well ” when asked about basic economic questions involving supply , demand and the effects of regulation , concluded Mr. Klein , an economics professor at George Mason University , and Ms. Buturovic , an associate researcher with the polling firm Zogby International .
“ But the left has trouble squaring economic thinking with their political psychology , morals and aesthetics , ” the two write .
Mr. Klein and Ms. Buturovic used a December 2008 poll conducted by Ms. Buturovic to gauge economic enlightenment , finding that a college education has less to do with an understanding of basic economic principles than the respondents ’ political leanings did .
The two analyzed Ms. Buturovic ’s data to determine which factors had the most impact on what they called “ economic enlightenment . ”
“ We think that , for many respondents , economic understanding takes a vacation when economic enlightenment conflicts with establishment political sensibilities , ” the two concluded .
To which their critics have essentially replied : Hogwash .
Liberal economists and analysts said the questions gave the study a conservative bias .
They did not dismiss the conclusions completely , but took issue with the way the data were gathered .
“ The study is essentially worthless as acknowledged by the author , ” said Philip Dine , an analyst on labor economics and a columnist for The Washington Times .
“ That said , the conclusions are not necessarily false . ”
Conservatives , he said , are often well - informed economically .
But he argued that economic literacy has less to do with party affiliation than “ experience , intelligence and open - mindedness . ”
Polling analyst Nate Silver wrote on his political blog FiveThirty Eight that the Klein- Buturovic study was “ so obviously flawed that it was n’t really worth commenting on . ”
He said the questions were slanted to reflect conservative beliefs , that the answers to some of the questions were ambiguous or debatable , and that the authors focused on only some of the questions answered by the respondents to reach their conclusions .
“ So basically , what you ’re left with is a number of questions in which people respond out of their ideological reference points because the questions are ambiguous , substanceless or confusing .
Klein is blaming the victims , as it were , ” Mr. Silver said .
“ It is not serious research , ” he said , “ and the fact that it was published both by the Wall Street Journal and by a journal which claims to be peer - reviewed is disturbing to me . ”
Mr. Klein and Ms. Buturovic said they focused on eight of the 21 questions in the survey to test economic literacy because they felt those questions provided the least ambiguous data for determining an understanding of economics .
Among the results :
Self - described liberals were more likely to disagree with statements that restrictions on housing development make housing less affordable ; that mandatory licensing of professional services increases the prices of those services ; or that overall , the standard of living is higher today than it was 30 years ago .
Ms. Buturovic acknowledged that conservative respondents ’ political leanings were not the sole determining factor in their relative economic sophistication .
“ Many variables that are associated with conservatism were also associated with greater enlightenment , ” he said .
“ Republicans scored better than Democrats , men better than women , married people better than those who are single .
Those who never shop at Wal - Mart and those who consider themselves residents of the ‘ planet Earth ’ ( as opposed to America or their city or town ) had particularly low scores . ”
Ms. Buturovic said she does not intend to blame a lack of economic enlightenment on political ideology .
“ I think the reason is that [ people ] have these primitive intuitions about how economy works , and they have for some reason either failed to acquire relevant cultural knowledge or are unable to apply it in the policy context .
It took many centuries for basic economic concepts and principles to be discovered so , in a sense , it is not that surprising that some people are having trouble grasping them . ”

In Europe , the birthplace of the Enlightenment , millions of citizens remain under the sway of superstition , with widespread beliefs in phenomena such as lucky numbers and worry that society depends too much on science and not enough on faith , anew EU survey has shown .
According to a study on public attitudes to science and technology published on Monday ( 21 June ) of over 30,000 people from EU member states and Croatia , Iceland , Norway , Turkey and Switzerland , two out of five Europeans are superstitious , with a full 40 percent of respondents saying they believe in lucky numbers .
Only slightly more than a third , 35 percent , do not , while the rest feel somewhere in between or say they simply do not know whether certain figures have a magical effect .
Such superstitious belief is on the increase , but only slightly , up from 37 percent in 2005 , the last time Brussels organised such a survey .
The strongest belief in lucky numbers tends to be found in poorer European countries in the east and south of the union , while wealthier states with more expansive social welfare systems tend to be less susceptible to myths and legends , although there is no across - the - board correlation , with , for example , 43 percent of Danes believing in the power of numbers while 39 percent of Bulgarians also feel the same way .
Women are slightly more likely ( 41 % ) to believe special numbers exist than men ( 37 % ) .
The survey also shows that across the EU , almost two fifths ( 38 % ) of respondents believe that society " depends too much on science and not enough on faith . "
But only just over a third ( 34 % ) feel the opposite way .
In a different vein of science - wary thinking , six out of 10 Europeans feel that science and technology can sometimes damage people 's " moral sense , " and only 15 percent disagreed with the statement .
Along the same lines , one in two Europeans feels that applications of science and technology can threaten human rights .
People are also growing more sceptical of scientists who depend on money from industry , with almost three fifths ( 58 % ) agreeing with the statement : " We can no longer trust scientists to tell the truth about controversial scientific and technological issues because they depend more and more on money from industry . "
In total though , just 16 percent of citizens disagreed , suggesting very strong disquiet about the corporate influence on science .
Interestingly , the more interested in science a correspondent was , the more likely they were to think that industry - backed scientists were less trustworthy .
In a complex picture of contemporary Europe , the EU survey also noted several pro-science trends , indicating that society is becoming increasingly polarised on the issue .
A notable handful of countries have seen very sharp drops in superstition , with 62 percent of Luxembourgers thinking lucky numbers are mumbo- jumbo in 2010 , up from just 35 percent in 2005 .
Malta has also seen a decided increase in those who say lucky numbers are humbug .
Just as more people are saying there should be more faith in society , more people are also saying the opposite .
Overall , 34 percent of people felt comfortable with a lack of faith in society compared to 29 percent in 2005 .
The level rose top 54 percent in Denmark , which saw a strong debate on religious extremism following the Mohammed cartoons row .
There seems to be a robust interest in science and technology everywhere on the continent , with , perhaps unbelievably at a time when so many eyeballs are focussed on the World Cup , more Europeans interested scientific discoveries than interested in sport ( 80 % to 65 % ) , politics and the arts .
Most people also remain overwhelmingly optimistic about science , with three quarters of citizens thinking that science and technology will bring more opportunities to future generations .
On the whole , the more rich and the less religious a country is , the more its society leans toward rationalism , creating a divide in the EU between the north and west of the bloc and its south and east .
But the correlation does not work across the board .
Countries which see a more pronounced free - market political discourse , such as the UK , Poland , and the Czech Republic , also place more trust in commercial science .
Neil Denny , the presenter of Little Atoms , a popular UK - based radio programme promoting science , rationalism and the ideas of the enlightenment , saw both worrying and heartening news in the results of the survey .
" While a statistic that suggests that only 46 percent believe ‘ The benefits of science are greater than any harmful effects it might have ' is disturbing , the fact that 61 percent disagreed with the statement " In my daily life , it is not important to know about science " was cause for optimism , " Mr Denny told EUobserver , " as was the fact that 57 percent of EU respondents think scientists should put more effort into communicating about their work . "
" Both of these statements suggest a huge public appetite for science and technology . " he added , stressing concerns he has about the affects of austerity measures on public funding of science and cheering the survey 's result showing strong support for increased spending in the sector .
The EU survey was conducted through face - to - face interviews with 31,243 citizens in 32 countries in January and February of this year .

[ This article is transcribed from the Libertarian Tradition podcast episode " The New Libertarian Generation . " ]
Mark Lilla is a professor of humanities at Columbia University , where he specializes in the history of ideas — in particular , the intellectual legacy of the Enlightenment .
Now , one of the principal intellectual legacies of the Enlightenment is the libertarian tradition , so it was not at all inappropriate that Lilla 's article in the May 27 , 2010 , issue of The New York Review of Books is on the growing influence of libertarian ideas in American society .
Lilla writes of the " libertarian impulses that have unsettled American society for half a century now . "
He writes of " the libertarian spirit [ that ] drifted into American life [ over the past 50 years ] , first from the left [ during the 1960s ] , then from the right [ during the Reagan ' 80s ] . "
He writes pessimistically of how this " libertarian spirit has spread to other areas of our lives , " but he reserves his main pessimism and hand wringing for the impact of this libertarian spirit on our national political life .
" Welcome , " he writes , " to the politics of the libertarian mob . "
LillaLilla'sLilla1960s80s
The " politics of the libertarian mob , " according to Lilla , is " [ a ] new strain of populism " that is " anarchistic like the Sixties , selfish like the Eighties , contradicting neither . "
He points out that " [ h ] istorically , populist movements [ have ] use [ d ] the rhetoric of class solidarity to seize political power so that ' the people ' can exercise it for their common benefit . "
But the " populist rhetoric " of the " libertarian mob " is " something altogether different . …
It fires up emotions by appealing to individual opinion , individual autonomy , and individual choice . "
More important , according to Lilla , this new populist rhetoric of the libertarian mob is " all in the service of neutralizing , not using , political power .
It gives voice to those who feel they are being bullied , but this voice has only one , Garbo - like thing to say : I want to be left alone . "
This rhetoric , Lilla tells us , " appeals to petulant individuals convinced that they can do everything themselves if they are only left alone , and that others are conspiring to keep them from doing just that . "
And , in Lilla 's view , such " petulant individuals " are legion in America today .
" Many Americans , " he writes , " a vocal and varied segment of the public at large , have now convinced themselves that educated elites — politicians , bureaucrats , reporters , but also doctors , scientists , even schoolteachers — are controlling our lives .
And they want them to stop . "
They say they are tired of being told what counts as news or what they should think about global warming ; tired of being told what their children should be taught , how much of their paychecks they get to keep , whether to insure themselves , which medicines they can have , where they can build their homes , which guns they can buy , when they have to wear seatbelts and helmets , whether they can talk on the phone while driving , which foods they can eat , how much soda they can drink … the list is long .
These disgruntled Americans , Lilla writes , " have two classic American traits that have grown much more pronounced in recent decades : blanket distrust of institutions and an astonishing — and unwarranted — confidence in the self .
They are apocalyptic pessimists about public life and childlike optimists swaddled in self - esteem when it comes to their own powers . "
This " apocalyptic pessimis[m ] about public life " that Lilla is talking about here has been showing up in major public opinion polls .
As Lilla himself puts it ,
Americans have far less trust in their government [ today ] than they had up until the mid-Sixties .
Just before the [ 2008 ] election , only a tenth of Americans said that they were " satisfied with the way things are going in the United States , " a record low .
They express some confidence in the presidency and the courts , but when asked in the abstract about " the government " and whether they expect it to do the right thing or whether it is run for our benefit , a relatively consistent majority says " no . "
Over the past half - century , according to Lilla , a great many of these people have begun " disinvesting in our political institutions and learning to work around them , as individuals . "
The principal example he gives — and a very good one it is — is the homeschooling movement .
" A million and a half students in the United States , " he writes , " are now being taught by their parents at home , nearly double the number a decade ago , and representing about fifteen students for every public school in the country . …
What 's remarkable [ about this ] is American parents ' confidence that they can do better themselves .
Many of the more - educated ones probably do , though they are hardly going it alone ; they rely on a national but voluntary virtual school system connecting them online , where they circulate curricula , materials , and research . "
More important , " they are [ now ] a powerful political lobby , having redirected their energy from local school systems to Washington and state capitals . …
They are the only successful libertarian party , " Lilla writes , " in the United States . "
So far , I have to admit that I can't argue much with the essentials of Lilla 's case .
It seems to me that he 's quite right when he claims that libertarian impulses and a libertarian spirit have been making themselves felt in various ways in American political life since the mid-1960s .
It seems to me Lilla is right when he claims that the rhetoric used by those promoting libertarian ideas today ( and also by those falsely claiming to promote libertarian ideas , of whom more below ) does appeal to individual opinion , individual autonomy , and individual choice .
It seems to me that Lilla is right when he claims that those promoting libertarian ideas today are bent on neutralizing , not using , political power and on empowering those who say they want to be left alone .
It seems to me that Lilla is absolutely and incontrovertibly right when he claims that millions of Americans are fed up with being told
what counts as news or what they should think about global warming … what their children should be taught , how much of their paychecks they get to keep , whether to insure themselves , which medicines they can have , where they can build their homes , which guns they can buy , when they have to wear seatbelts and helmets , whether they can talk on the phone while driving , which foods they can eat , how much soda they can drink … the list is long .
Lilla is also right to claim that millions of Americans no longer believe government is run for their benefit and can no longer be counted upon to do the right thing .
He is right to claim that millions of Americans have long since begun looking for ways to work around our useless and intrusive political institutions .
And he is right to claim that the homeschooling movement is one of the best examples of this trend .
He may even be right when he calls it " the only successful libertarian party in the United States . "
All this rightness does n't mean , however , that Lilla 's article is perfect .
Far from it , in fact .
Consider the unfortunate title of the piece ( which I know might well not have been chosen by the author ) : " The Tea Party Jacobins . "
This is utterly misleading .
In the first place , there is nothing even remotely libertarian about the tea parties .
There is nothing even remotely libertarian about Fox News , Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh , or Sarah Palin .
Yet these are the specific examples Lilla refers to throughout his article , as particular instances of the " politics of the libertarian mob " he so deplores .
Now ask yourself , does either Rush Limbaugh or Sarah Palin have even the slightest interest in " neutralizing , not using , political power " ?
Does Glenn Beck ?
Do any of his colleagues on Fox News ?
Could you say of any of these conservative Republicans what Lilla says of the proponents of the libertarian spirit , that " they want to be people without rules " ?
Merely to pose such questions in so open and bald - faced a manner is to see instantly what a preposterous absurdity we would have to pretend to believe in order to answer them in the affirmative .
As Johnny Carson would say , " it is to laugh . "
The only sense in which the likes of Limbaugh , Beck , Palin , the majority of the tea partiers , and the best known and most representative figures on Fox News may be said to represent the growing libertarian impulse or spirit in the land is this : their employment of a lot of libertarian rhetoric that does n't at all match the policies they endorse and proselytize for is in itself a kind of indirect symptom of the growth of the libertarian spirit .
Conservatives have been using libertarian rhetoric for many decades now , but they 've increased this tactic recently in response to the very phenomenon Lilla is writing about — the growing spread of the libertarian spirit through the land .
Libertarian ideas have come to exercise enough influence among the general public that at least certain major party politicians and major media feel compelled to pretend to espouse them themselves and do all they can to co-opt them .
Another point about Lilla 's title , " The Tea Party Jacobins " :
The Jacobins were a faction within the original Left , during the French Revolution .
Specifically , the Jacobins were the faction which demanded not just equality before the law but equality in fact , equality of result .
If Smith has more of something than Jones , take some of it away from Smith and give it to Jones .
It is little wonder that the other thing the Jacobins are famous for besides their misguided egalitarianism — which , arguably has led most of the left down the road to perdition in the two centuries since then — is their advocacy and practice of violence .
And it 's little wonder , as I say , because only the threat of violence would lead most people to accept the forced egalitarianism of the original Jacobins .
Today 's libertarians — the real libertarians , not the conservatives now so busily slinging insincere , phony libertarian rhetoric — are nonviolent partisans of peace among individuals and among nations , and they favor equality before the law , not forced equality of life result .
Whatever they may be , looked at historically , they are not the heirs of the Jacobins .
Mark Lilla also has a tendency , fairly common among those who write a lot about political topics , to think that politics naturally dominates all of human life .
The result is that he sometimes tends to put the cart before the horse .
He writes , for example , that
as the libertarian spirit has spread to other areas of our lives , along with distrust of elites generally , the damage has mounted .
Take health care .
Less than half of us say that we have " great confidence " in the medical establishment today , and the proportion of those who have " hardly any " has doubled since the early Seventies .
There are plenty of things wrong with the way medicine is practiced in the United States , but it does not follow from this that anybody can cure himself .
Nonetheless , a growing number of us have become our own doctors and pharmacists , aided by Internet search engines that substitute for refereed medical journals , the Food and Drug Administration , and the Centers for Disease Control .
" The trends , " Lilla continues , " are not encouraging . "
Because of irrational fear - mongering on the Web , the percentage of unvaccinated American children , while thankfully still low , has been rising steadily in the twenty - one states that now allow personal exemptions for unspecified " philosophical and personal reasons . "
This is significant : the chance of unvaccinated children getting measles , to take just one example , is twenty - two to thirty - five times higher than that of immunized children .
Americans currently spend over four billion dollars a year on unregulated herbal medicines , despite total ignorance about their effectiveness , correct dosage , and side effects .
And of course , many dangerous medicines banned in the United States can now be purchased online from abroad , not to mention questionable medical procedures for those who can afford the airfare .
The problems with this passage from Lilla 's article are legion .
Let 's begin with the fact that nothing he describes here can properly be understood as " the libertarian spirit … spread[ing ] to other areas of our lives . "
Rather it is a case of the spread from the culture generally of a generalized distrust of elites and other authorities — a spread of what I call decadent individualism into the political sphere , where it expresses itself as libertarianism .
This is what happened in the '60s , when hippie individualism was born and the libertarian movement , born 20 years before , received a massive injection of growth hormone .
The general condition of cultural decadence that took hold in the late 1950s and early 1960s both discouraged individuals from taking the conventional wisdom in any field of inquiry with undue seriousness and encouraged them to think for themselves , make their own decisions , and reach their own conclusions , even if those decisions and conclusions did n't match what most people believed .
I published a book a few years back called In Praise of Decadence , in which I develop this line of argument at much greater length .
It 's still in print and also widely available online from secondhand book dealers , who often offer it at extremely low prices .
I urge you to track down a copy and see what you think .
Whether you take me up on that suggestion or not , however , I 'm sure you 'll have guessed by now that the final major flaw in Mark Lilla 's otherwise excellent and provocative article on " The Tea Party Jacobins " from the May 27th issue of The New York Review of Books is its smug assumption that people like Mark Lilla really do know more than you do about how to best run your life and that they therefore have the right to force you to take their advice and run your life their way , whether you like it or not .
The fact is that , exactly as Mark Lilla fears , when people distrust authority in a generalized way and start thinking for themselves , often without much relevant information to guide them , they 'll make many decisions that they 'll later regret .
But whose decisions are they to make ?
Is it your right to make your own decisions about how you 're going to live your life ?
Or does that right belong to Mark Lilla and his fellow " progressives , " because they smugly know that they 'll do ever so much better with it than you will ?
That 's the issue .
Dog owners who walk their pets on leads longer than 6ft 8in face £ 1,000 fines
Barking mad : Dog walkers in Ashton - under - Lyne , Greater Manchester , must keep their leads short , as demonstrated here , or face large fines ( file pic )
They give dogs the freedom to run about without their owner having to worry about them dashing off to chase a passing cat .
But now long leads have become the latest casualty of what critics say is a campaign by councils to curb the rights of dog owners .
Wardens in Greater Manchester have been ordered to target anyone using a lead longer than 6ft 8in with the threat of a £ 1,000 fine .
Officials claim the tough rule - brought in by the last Government - is necessary to prevent dogs roaming out of control and to curb fouling .
But they admit there have been no complaints
The measure has been imposed by Tameside Council in Ashtonunder - Lyne and neighbouring towns under a dog control order
covering dozens of parks and playing fields .
It is thought to be among the first of its kind outside London .
Owners of some of Tameside 's 30,000 dogs have attacked the rules .
Bernard Lake , 67 , suffers from breathing difficulties and uses a 15ft extendable lead so his Yorkshire
terrier Micke can still run about .
' Most owners use common sense and the few who do n't are n't going to change their behaviour because of a change in the law , ' he said .
' It 's the irresponsible people that make life more difficult for the rest of us public - spirited ones . '
The
Kennel Club called the rules ' completely arbitrary and unnecessary ' and said it would penalise responsible owners .
Rules imposed under Labour 's Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act have proved equally unpopular across the country .
Kensington and Chelsea Council stipulates that on public footpaths and grassed squares , dogs must be kept on leads that are not more than 4ft long .
Earlier this year Newark and Sherwood Council in Nottinghamshire banned dogs altogether in 72 parks with the threat of £ 75 on - the - spot fines .
A Tameside Council spokesman said : ' The areas where we are asking people to keep their dogs on a lead include formal gardens and sports pitches in parks .
' However , there are open spaces very close by where people can exercise their dogs off the lead . '

One thing that money savvy people have learned from the recession is that income diversity is important .
Getting all of your income from one place can be devastating if you lose your job .
You do n’t have to quit your day job if you do n’t want to , but you can begin cultivating a little alternative income so that if you do lose your job , you have something that can help you get through the tough times .
Here are 4 ways you can cultivate alternative income streams :
1. Bonds
Bonds are basically loans you offer to organizations .
You provide capital for a corporation or government ( local , federal , foreign ) , and that organization promises to return the principal after a certain amount of time .
In the meantime , you receive regular interest payments .
The returns may not be huge , but a habit of investing in bonds can help you eventually create a solid revenue stream .
2. Dividend Paying Stocks
Dividends are coming back in vogue now that the recession is officially over .
A dividend is a payment that some companies make out of their earnings .
Some dividends are larger than others , and companies can change the dividend if they like , but careful investing can lead to a regular check four times a year , independent of your day job .
3. Build a Web Site
If you have a little more time , you can build a web site or blog and post useful and interesting content .
Promote your site to draw traffic .
You can use affiliate programs to earn money from click - throughs on advertisements on your web site or blog .
This takes a little more time to cultivate , but once you get it going , you can maintain the site or blog , and get a tidy little revenue stream flowing .
4. Royalties
Write a book .
If you can get it published , the royalties can provide a revenue stream — although you need to be aware that royalties can dwindle .
You can also develop a revenue stream by writing your ebooks and selling them on your own , to provide another source of direct income .
For maximum financial security , it is best to cultivate a few different alternative income streams if you can , avoiding the financial mistake of relying too much on one source of income .
That way , you are prepared with a diversity of income for tough economic times .
What other ideas do you have for cultivating alternative income streams ?
The Imminent Collapse Of Industrial Society
By Peter Goodchild
09 May , 2010
Countercurrents.org
The collapse of modern industrial society has 14 parts , each with a somewhat causal relationship to the next .
( 1 ) Fossil fuels , ( 2 ) metals , and ( 3 ) electricity are a tightly - knit group , and no industrial civilization can have one without the others .
The decline in fossil - fuel production is the most critical aspect of the collapse , and most of the following text will be devoted to that topic .
As those three disappear , ( 4 ) food and ( 5 ) fresh water become scarce ; grain and wild fish supplies per capita have been declining for years , water tables are falling everywhere , rivers are not reaching the sea .
Matters of infrastructure then follow : ( 6 ) transportation and ( 7 ) communication ?
no paved roads , no telephones , no computers .
After that , the social structure begins to fail : ( 8 ) government , ( 9 ) education , and ( 10 ) the large - scale division of labor that makes complex technology possible .
After these 10 parts , however , there are four others that form a separate layer , in some respects more psychological or sociological .
We might call these  the four Cs. 
The first three are ( 11 ) crime , ( 12 ) cults , and ( 13 ) craziness ?
the breakdown of traditional law ; the ascendance of dogmas based on superstition , ignorance , cruelty , and intolerance ; the overall tendency toward anti-intellectualism ; and the inability to distinguish mental health from mental illness .
There is also a final and more general part that is ( 14 ) chaos , resulting in the pervasive sense that nothing works any more . 
These are cascading dominoes ; all parts of the collapse have more to do with causality than with chronology , although there is no great distinction to be made between the two .
If we look at matters from a more purely chronological viewpoint , however , we can say that there is a clear division into two time periods , two phases .
The first phase will be merely economic hardship , and the second will be entropy .
In the first phase the major issues will be inflation , unemployment , and the stock market .
The second phase will be characterized by the disappearance of money , law , and government .
In more pragmatic terms , we can say that the second phase will begin when money is no longer accepted as a means of exchange .
The Triad
Modern industrial society is composed of a triad of fossil fuels , metals , and electricity .
The three are intricately connected .
Electricity , for example , can be generated on a global scale only with fossil fuels .
The same dependence on fossil fuels is true of metals ; in fact the better types of ore are now becoming depleted , while those that remain can be processed only with modern machinery and require more fossil fuels for smelting .
In turn , without metals and electricity there will be no means of extracting and processing fossil fuels .
Of the three members of the triad , electricity is the most fragile , and its failure will serve as an early warning of trouble with the other two .
[ Duncan ( a ) , ( b ) ]
Often the interactions of this triad are hiding in plain sight .
Global production of steel , for example , requires 420 million tonnes of coke ( from coal ) annually , as well as other fossil fuels adding up to an equivalent of another 100 million tonnes .
[ Smil ]
To maintain industrial society , the production of steel cannot be curtailed : there are no green materials for the construction of skyscrapers , large bridges , automobiles , machinery , or tools .
But the interconnections among fossil fuels , metals , and electricity are innumerable .
As each of the three members of the triad threatens to break down , we are looking at a society that is far more primitive than the one to which we have been accustomed .
Fossil Fuels
The entire world 's economy is ultimately based on oil and other hydrocarbons .
These provide fuel , fertilizer , pesticides , lubricants , plastic , paint , synthetic fabrics , asphalt , pharmaceuticals , and many other things .
On a more abstract level , we are dependent on hydrocarbons for manufacturing , for transportation , for agriculture , for mining , and for electricity .
Oil is the lifeblood of our civilization .
Even a bicycle , that ultimate symbol of an alternate lifestyle ,  requires oil for lubrication , for paint , and for plastic components .
The vehicle that delivers the bicycle runs on oil , over asphalt that is a form of oil .
 Rubber tires are often made of oil .
Oil is everything : that is to say , everything in the modern world is dependent on oil .
As the oil disappears , our entire industrial society will go with it .
There will be no means of supporting the billions of people who now live on this planet .
Above all , there will be insufficient food , and the result will be terrible famine .
A good deal of debate has gone on about  peak oil ,  the date at which the world 's annual oil production will reach ( or did reach ) its maximum and will begin ( or did begin ) to decline .
The exact numbers are unobtainable , mainly because individual countries give rather inexact figures on their remaining supplies .
The situation can perhaps be summarized by saying that at least 20 or 30 major studies have been done , and the consensus is that the peak is somewhere between the years 2000 and 2020 .
Within that period , a middle date seems rather more likely .
[ Campbell ( a ) , ( b ) ; Gever ; Simmons ; Youngquist ( a ) , ( b ) ]
One reasonable description of past and future global oil production is Campbell and Laherrére 's 1998 Scientific American article ,  The End of Cheap Oil ,  which serves as a sort of locus classicus .
Their main chart seems to indicate an annual rate of increase of about 4 percent from the year 1930 to 2000 , and an annual rate of post - peak decline of slightly over 3 percent , which would mean that around 2030 oil production will be down to about half of the peak amount .
[ Campbell and Laherrère ]
The chart is based partly on the bell - shaped curves that M. King Hubbert used in the 1950s when making accurate predictions of American and global oil decline .
[ Hubbert ]
More - recent predictions of the annual rate of post - peak decline tend to range from about 4 to 9 percent .
[ Foucher , Höök , Poston ]
Starting at a peak of 30 billion barrels in 2010 , a decline of 9 percent would mean dropping to half of that amount in 7 years ?
hardly enough time to blink .
The most likely figure might be 6 percent , and even that is ominous , resulting in a fall to half of peak production in 11 years .
These predictions of larger decline rates take into consideration the fact that advanced technology is used to maximize productivity , which in turn has the ironic result that when the decline actually occurs it is swift .
It is not the gentle slope depicted in Campbell and Laherrére 's article , but something that looks more like a cliff .
From a broader perspective it can be said that , as oil declines , more energy and money must be devoted to getting the less - accessible and lower - quality oil out of the ground .
[ Gever ]
In turn , as more energy and money are devoted to oil production , the production of metals and electricity becomes more difficult .
One problem feeds on another .
The issue can also be described in terms of money alone : when oil production costs about 5 percent of the economy , the latter begins a downward spiral .
[ Lardelli ]
It should also be mentioned that the above - mentioned quest for the date of peak oil is in some respects a red herring .
In terms of daily life , it is important to consider not only peak oil in the absolute sense , but peak oil per capita .
The date of the latter was 1979 , when there were 5.5 barrels of oil per person annually , as opposed to 4.5 in 2007 . [ BP ]
In 1850 , before commercial production began , there were about 2 trillion barrels of oil in the ground .
By about the year 2010 , half of that oil had been consumed , so about 1 trillion barrels remain ?
which may sound like a lot , but is n't .
At the moment about 30 billion barrels of oil are consumed annually , and that is probably close to the maximum that will ever be possible .
When newspapers announce the discovery of a deposit of a billion barrels , readers are no doubt amazed , but they are not told that such a find is only two weeks ' supply .
As the years go by , new oil wells have to be drilled deeper than the old , because newly discovered deposits are deeper .
Those new deposits are therefore less accessible .
But oil is used as a fuel for the machinery and for the exploration .
When it takes an entire barrel of oil to get one barrel of oil out of the ground , as is increasingly the case with new wells , it is a waste of time to continue drilling .
The problem of the world 's diminishing supply of oil is a problem of energy , not a problem of money .
The old bromide that higher prices will eventually make [ e.g. ] shale oil economically feasible is meaningless .
This planet has only a finite amount of fossil fuel .
That fuel is starting to vanish , and higher prices  will be quite unable to stop the event from taking place .
Much of modern warfare is about oil , in spite of all the pious and hypocritical rhetoric about  the forces of good  and  the forces of evil . [ Klare ]
The real forces are those trying to control the oil wells and the fragile pipelines that carry that oil .
A map of recent American military ventures is a map of petroleum deposits .
When the oil wars began is largely a matter of definition , though perhaps 1973 would be a usable date , when the Yom Kippur War  or , to speak more truthfully , the vulnerability resulting from the decline in American domestic oil  led to the OPEC oil embargo .
Coal and natural gas are also disappearing .
Coal will be available for a while after oil is gone , although previous reports of its abundance in the US were highly exaggerated .
[ Rebecca Smith ]
Coal , however , is highly polluting and cannot be used as a fuel for most forms of transportation ; the last industrial society will be a bizarre , crowded , dirty , impoverished world .
Natural gas is not easily transported , and it is not suitable for most equipment .
The problem of the loss of fossil fuels will , of course , be received in the same manner as other large - scale disasters : widespread denial , followed by a rather catatonic apathy .
The centuries will pass , and a day will come when , like the early Anglo - Saxons , people will look around at the scattered stones and regard them as  the work of giants . 
Global Energy and Electricity
Global production of energy for the year 2005 was about 500 exajoules ( EJ ) , most of which was supplied by fo ssil fuels .
This annual production of energy can also be expressed in terms of billion barrels of oil equivalent ( bboe ) [ BP ; Duncan ( a ) , ( b ) ; EIA ( c ) ]
In 1990 this was 59.3 bboe and in 2005 it was 79.3 , an increase of 34 percent .
However , the use of electricity worldwide rose from 11,865.4 terawatt - hours in 1990 to 18,301.8 in 2005 [ BP ] , an increase of 54 percent .
Since the use of electricity is rising much more quickly than the production of energy , it is uncertain whether in the future there will be sufficient energy to meet the demand for electricity .
If not , there could be widespread brownouts and rolling blackouts .
[ Duncan ( a ) , ( b ) ]
When electricity starts to go , so will everything else .
Alternative Energy
Alternative sources of energy will never be very useful , for several reasons , but mainly because of a problem of net energy : the amount of energy output is not sufficiently greater than the amount of energy input .
[ Gever ]
With the problematic exception of uranium , alternative sources ultimately do n't have enough bang to replace 30 billion annual barrels of oil ?
or even to replace more than the tiniest fraction of that amount .
At the same time , alternative forms of energy are so dependent on the very petroleum that they are intended to replace that the use of them is largely self - defeating and irrational .
Petroleum is required to extract , process , and transport almost any other form of energy ; a coal mine is not operated by coal - powered equipment .
It takes oil energy to make alternative energy . 
The use of unconventional oil ( shale deposits , tar sands , heavy oil ) poses several problems besides that of net energy .
Large quantities of conventional oil are needed to process the oil from these unconventional sources , so net energy recovery is low .
The pollution problems are considerable , and it is not certain how much environmental damage the human race is willing to endure .
With unconventional oil we are , quite literally , scraping the bottom of the barrel .
More - exotic forms of alternative energy are plagued with even greater problems .
Fuel cells cannot be made practical , because such devices require hydrogen derived from fossil fuels ( coal or natural gas ) , if we exclude designs that will never escape the realm of science fiction ; if fuel cells ever became popular , the fossil fuels they require would then be consumed even faster than they are now .
Biomass energy ( from corn , for example ) requires impossibly large amounts of land and still results in insufficient quantities of net energy , perhaps even negative quantities .
Hydroelectric dams are reaching their practical limits .
Wind and geothermal power are only effective in certain areas and for certain purposes .
Nuclear power presents significant environmental dangers , but the biggest constraints involve the addition of new reactor capacity and the supply of uranium .
Peak production of uranium ore in the United States was in 1980 .
Mainly because the US was the world 's largest producer , the peak of global production was at approximately the same date .
[ Energy Watch Group , Storm van Leeuwen ]
Statements that uranium ore is abundant are based on the falsehood that all forms of uranium ore are usable .
In reality , only high - quality ore serves any purpose , whereas low - quality ore presents the unsolvable problem of negative net energy : the mining and milling of such ore requires more energy than is derived from the actual use of the ore in a reactor .
The world 's usable uranium ore will probably be finished by about 2030 , and there is no evidence for the existence of large new deposits of rich ore .
Claims of abundant uranium are generally made by industry spokespersons whose positions are far from neutral , who have in fact a vested interest in presenting nuclear energy as a viable option .
[ Storm van Leeuwen ]
One must also beware , of course , of the myth that higher prices  will make low - grade resources of any sort feasible : when net energy is negative , even an infinitely higher price will not change the balance .
For all practical purposes , the nuclear industry will come to an end in a matter of decades , not centuries .
The current favorite for alternative energy is solar power , but proponents must close their eyes to all questions of scale .
The world 's deserts have an area of 36 million km 2 , and the solar energy they receive annually is 300,000 EJ , which at a typical 11 - percent electrical - conversion rate would result in 33,000 EJ .
[ Knies ]
As noted above , annual global energy consumption in 2005 was approximately 500 EJ .
To meet the world 's present energy needs by using solar power , then , we would need an array ( or an equivalent number of smaller ones ) with a size of 500 / 33,000 x 36 million km 2 , which is about 550,000 km 2 ?
a machine the size of France .
The production and maintenance of this array would require vast quantities of hydrocarbons , metals , and other materials ?
a self - defeating process .
Solar power will therefore do little to solve the world 's energy problems .
The Problem of Infrastructure
Most schemes for a post -oil technology are based on the misconception that there will be a technological infrastructure for such future gadgetry , similar to that of the present day .
Modern equipment is dependent on specific methods of manufacture , transportation , maintenance , and repair .
In less abstract terms , this means machinery , motorized vehicles , and service depots or shops , all of which are generally run by fossil fuels .
In addition , one unconsciously assumes the presence of electricity , which energizes the various communications devices , such as telephones and computers ; electricity on such a large scale is only possible with fossil fuels .
To believe that a non-petroleum infrastructure is possible , one would have to imagine , for example , solar - powered machines creating equipment for the production and storage of electricity by means of solar energy .
This equipment would then be loaded on to solar - powered trucks , driven to various locations , and installed with other solar - powered devices , and so on , ad absurdum and ad infinitum .
Such a scenario might provide material for a work of science fiction , but not for genuine science .
The technological infrastructure will no longer be in place : oil , electricity , and asphalt roads , for example .
Partly for that reason , the social structure will also no longer be in place .
Without the technological infrastructure and the social structure , it will be impossible to produce the familiar goods of industrial society .
Without fossil fuels , the most that is possible is a pre-industrial infrastructure , although one must still ignore the fact that the pre-industrial world did not fall from the sky as a prefabricated structure but took uncountable generations of human ingenuity to develop .
The pre-industrial world also did not include feeding 7 billion people .
For both reasons , we cannot suddenly step back into Jane Austen 's day , when the population was a mere billion .
The next problem is that a pre-industrial blacksmith was adept at making horseshoes , but not at making or repairing solar - energy systems ; those who expect to conquer the future with space - age technology will have to pray that nothing goes wrong with toys that were invented at a time of abundant petroleum and the machinery that went with it .
Other Minerals
Global depletion of minerals other than petroleum and uranium is somewhat difficult to determine , partly because recycling complicates the issues , partly because trade goes on in all directions , and partly because one material can sometimes be replaced by another .
Figures from the US Geological Survey , however , indicate that within the US most types of minerals are past their peak dates of production .
Besides oil , these include bauxite ( peaking in 1943 ) , copper ( 1998 ) , iron ore ( 1951 ) , magnesium ( 1966 ) , phosphate rock ( 1980 ) , potash ( 1967 ) , rare earth metals ( 1984 ) , tin ( 1945 ) , titanium ( 1964 ) , and zinc ( 1969 ) .
[ USGS ]
The depletion of all minerals in the US continues swiftly in spite of recycling .
Rare - earth minerals pose a special problem because so much of the more - advanced technology is dependent on them , and because nearly all of them now come from China .
[ Adams ]
Iron ore may seem infinitely abundant , but it is not .
In the past it was ores such as natural hematite ( Fe 2 O 3 ) that were being mined .
For thousands of years , also , tools were produced by smelting bog iron , mainly goethite , FeO ( OH ) , in clay cylinders only a meter or so in height .
Modern mining must rely more heavily on taconite , a flint - like ore containing less than 30 percent magnetite and hematite .
[ Gever ]
Iron ore of the sort that can be processed with primitive equipment is becoming scarce , in other words , and only the less - tractable forms such as taconite will be available when the oil - powered machinery has disappeared  a chicken - and - egg problem .
With the types of iron ore used in the past , it would have been possible to reproduce at least the medieval level of blacksmithing in future ages .
With taconite it will not .
Grain
Annual world production of grain per capita peaked in 1984 at 342 kg .
[ Earth Policy ( a ) ]
For years production has not met demand , so carryover stocks must fill the gap , now leaving less than two months ' supply as a buffer .
Rising temperatures and falling water tables are causing havoc in grain harvests everywhere , but the biggest dent is caused by the bio - fuel industry , which is growing at over 20 percent per year .
In 2007 , 88 million tons of US corn , a quarter of the entire US harvest , were turned into automotive fuel .
Fish
The world catch of wild fish per capita peaked in 1988 at 17 kg ; by 2005 it was down to 14 kg .
[ Earth Policy ( b ) ]
The fishing industry sends out 4 million vessels to catch wild fish , but stocks of the larger species are falling rapidly , so the industry works its way steadily down the food chain .
Janet Larsen notes in particular that over the past 50 years , the number of large predatory fish in the oceans has dropped by a startling 90 percent .
Catches of many popular food fish such as cod , tuna , flounder , and hake have been cut in half despite a tripling in fishing effort . 
The losses in the production of wild fish are made up by aquaculture ( fish farming ) , but aquaculture causes its own problems : inshore fish farms entail the destruction of wetlands , spread diseases , and deplete oxygen .
Although her study is otherwise excellent , Larsen omits the fact that millions of tonnes of other fish must be turned into food every year for use in aquaculture .
The FAO , with its usual pro-industry stance , labels these as low - value / trash fish . 
[ UN Food and Agricultural Organization ]
Fresh Water
Fresh water is declining in many countries around the world , particularly Mexico , the western US , North Africa , the Middle East , Pakistan , India , China , and Australia .
If a population crash does not occur in the next few years , by the year 2025 about 2 billion people will be living with extreme water scarcity , and about two - thirds of the world will be facing water shortages to some extent .
[ UN Environment Program ]
In Saudi Arabia and the adjacent countries from Syria to Oman , the annual water supply per capita fell from 1,700 m 3 to 907 m 3 between 1985 and 2005 .
In the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council , most fresh water is supplied by desalination plants .
The diversion of water for agriculture and municipal use , combined with the effects of global warming , is causing rivers to run dry .
The Colorado , the Ganges , the Nile , and the Indus are now all dry for at least part of the year before they reach the sea .
In previous years , this was also true of China 's Yellow River ; whether better management will prevail remains to be seen .
The Amu Darya , once the largest river flowing into the Aral Sea , now runs dry as its water is diverted for the cultivation of cotton .
[ Mygatt ]
Most countries with water shortages are pumping at rates that cannot be maintained .
The shallower aquifers could be replenished if pumping were reduced , but the deeper fossil aquifers cannot be rejuvenated when their levels are allowed to fall .
Among the latter are the US Ogallala aquifer , the Saudi aquifer , and the deeper aquifer of the North China Plain .
[ Brown ]
Agriculture uses more than 70 percent of the world 's fresh water and is mainly responsible for the depletion of aquifers of both types .
[ UN Environment Program ]
World grain harvests tripled between 1950 and 2000 , but only with increases in irrigation .
The US depends on irrigation for a fifth of its grain production ; in parts of the grain - producing states of Texas , Oklahoma , and Kansas the water table has fallen more than 30 meters , and thousands of wells have gone dry .
[ Brown ]
The situation is worse in China , where four - fifths of the grain harvest depends on irrigation .
The fossil aquifer of the North China Plain maintains half of China 's wheat production and a third of its corn .
As a result of the depletion of water , Chinese annual grain production has been in decline since 1998 .
All this excess use of water is leading to political strife .
While the seas have long been generally subject to international laws , it is only in recent decades that there have been major international problems with the world 's fresh water .
Because of falling water levels , new wells are drilled to greater depths than the old , with the result that the owners of the old wells are left without water .
The result is a cycle of competition in which no one wins .
A similar competition exists with the world 's rivers .
Sixty percent of the world 's 227 largest rivers have numerous dams and canals , and there are not many other rivers that are free from such obstructions .
[ UN Environment Program ]
Most countries sharing a large river with others are in the midst of violent struggle or about to become so .
For example , India 's Farakka Barrage , completed in 1975 , diverts water from the Ganges into its Indian tributary , thereby depriving Bangladesh of water .
[ Dan Smith ] Egypt and Sudan signed a treaty in 1959 allocating 75 percent of the Nile 's water to the former and the remainder to Sudan , with no provisions for the other countries through which the river flows , and Egypt has threatened military action against any of those countries if their irrigation projects reduce the flow .
[ Elhadj ]
It is not only military strength that settles issues of water distribution : countries with more water can produce more grain and thus influence the economies of less fortunate countries .
It takes a thousand tonnes of water to produce a tonne of grain .
In the short term it may therefore seem more sensible for water - poor countries to stop depleting their water by producing grain , and instead buying it from water - rich countries .
[ Brown , UN Environment Program ]
Between 1984 and 2000 , at a cost of about $ 100 billion , Saudi Arabia foolishly tried to produce its own grain but then gave up and switched to importing it .
Buying grain has its own negative side - effects , however , in terms of national security , foreign exchange , and lost local employment .
[ Elhadj ]
The biggest question of national security may be :
What will happen when the grain - exporting countries themselves start running out of both grain and water ?
Arable Land
With low technology ,  i.e. technology that does not use fossil fuels , crop yields diminish considerably .
David Pimentel explains that the production of so - called field or grain corn ( maize ) without irrigation or mechanized agriculture is only about 2,000 kilograms per hectare .
That is less than a third of the yield that a farmer would get with modern machinery and chemical fertilizer .
[ Pimentel ; Pimentel and Hall ; David Pimentel and Marcia H. Pimentel ]
Yields for corn provide a handy baseline for other studies of population and food supply .
At the same time , corn is an ideal crop for study because of its superiority to others : it is one of the most useful grains for supporting human life .
For the native people of the Americas , it was an important crop for thousands of years .
[ Weatherwax ]
Corn is high - yielding and needs little in the way of equipment , and the more ancient varieties are largely trouble - free in terms of diseases , pests , and soil depletion .
If it can't be done with corn , it can't be done with anything .
Of course , in reality no one would live entirely on corn ; the figures here serve merely as a basis of comparison with other crops in a mixed diet .
A hard - working ( i.e. farming ) adult burns about 1 million kilocalories ( calories  ) per year .
The food energy from a hectare of corn grown with low technology  is about 9 million kilocalories .
[ Pimentel ]
Under primitive conditions , then , 1 hectare of corn would support only 9 people .
Even those figures are rather idealistic .
We are assuming that people will follow a largely vegetarian diet ; if not , they will need even more land .
We need to allow for fallow land , cover crops , and green manure , for inevitable inequities in distribution , and for other uses of the land .
We must account for any rise in population .
Finally , most other crops require more land than corn in order to produce the same yield .
On a global scale , a far more realistic ratio would be 4 people to each hectare of arable land .
The average American house lot is about a tenth of a hectare , including the land the house is sitting on .
Those who expect to get by with victory gardens are unaware of the arithmetic involved .
Perhaps some of the misunderstanding is due to the misconception that humans live on vegetables  in the narrow sense of the word ( e.g. , in the sense of green vegetables ) .
In reality , it is not vegetables  but grains that are the foundation of human diet .
Thousands of years ago , our ancestors took various species of grass and converted them into the plants on which human life now depends .
Wheat , rice , corn , barley , rye , oats , sorghum , millet  these are the grasses people eat every day .
It is members of the grass family that are used in raising the pigs and cows that are killed as other food .
A diet of green vegetables would be slow starvation ; it is grains that supply the thousands of kilocalories that keep us alive from day to day .
In the entire world there are 15,749,300 km 2 of arable land .
[ CIA ]
This is 11 percent of the world 's total land area .
The present world population ( in 2010 ) is about 6.9 billion .
Dividing the figure for population by that for arable land , we see that there are about 440 people per km 2 of arable land .
On a smaller scale that means about 4 people per hectare .
Only about a third of the world 's 200 - odd countries are actually within that realistic ratio of 4:1 .
In other words , we have already reached the limits of the number of people who can be supported by non-mechanized agriculture .
The UK , for example , has a population - to - arable ratio of slightly more than 10 people per hectare .
What exactly is going to happen to the 6 people who will not fit onto the hectare ?
But many countries have far worse ratios .
Overpopulation
The world 's population went from about 1.7 billion in 1900 to 2.5 in 1950 , to nearly 7 billion in 2010 .
It has been said that without fossil fuels the population must drop to about 2 or 3 billion .
[ Youngquist ( a ) ]
The above figures on arable land indicate that in terms of agriculture alone we would not be able to accommodate the present number of people .
Another calculation about future population can be made by looking more closely at the rise and fall of oil production .
The rapid increase in population over the last hundred years is not merely coincident with the rapid increase in oil production .
It is the latter that has actually allowed ( the word caused  might be too strong ) the former : that is to say , oil has been the main source of energy within industrial society .
It is only with abundant oil that a large population is possible .
It was industrialization , improved agriculture , improved medicine , the expansion of humanity into the Americas , and so on , that first created the modern rise in population , but it was oil in particular that made it possible for human population to grow as fast as it has been doing .
[ Catton ]
If oil production drops to half its peak amount , world population must also drop by half .
Of course , this calculation of population on the basis of oil is largely the converse of the calculation on the basis of arable land , since in industrial society the amount of farm production is mainly a reflection of the amount of available oil .
If we look further into the future , we see an even smaller number for human population , still using previous ratios of oil to population as the basis for our figures .
But the world a hundred years from now might not be a mirror image of the world of a hundred years in the past .
The general depletion of resources might cause such damage to the structure of society that government , education , and intricate division of labor will no longer exist .
In a milieu of social chaos , what are the chances that the oil industry will be using extremely advanced technology to extract the last drops of oil ?
Even then we have not factored in war , epidemics , and other aspects of social breakdown .
The figure of 2 to 3 billion may be wildly optimistic .
Overpopulation is the overwhelming ultimate cause of systemic collapse .
All of the flash - in - the - pan ideas that are presented as solutions to the modern dilemma  solar power , ethanol , hybrid cars , desalination , permaculture  have value only as desperate attempts to solve an underlying problem that has never been addressed in a more direct manner .
American foreign aid has always included only trivial amounts for family planning [ Spiedel ] ; the most powerful country in the world has done very little to solve the biggest problem in the world .
The reasons for this evasion of responsibility are many , including the influence of certain religious groups with the misnomer of pro-life ; the left - wing reluctance to point a finger at poor people , immigrants , or particular ethnic groups ; the right - wing reluctance to lose an ever - expanding source of cheap labor ( and a growing consumer market ) ; and the politicians ' reluctance to lose votes in any direction .
[ Kolankiewicz ]
Overpopulation can also be seen in terms of the distribution of resources : there is some validity to the argument that imposing family planning on poor countries is unfair if rich countries consume far more resources per capita .
That argument , however , can be countered by the statement that overpopulation in one country leads to immigration , which in turn leads to overpopulation in another country ; the onus of responsibility therefore lies on poor countries , not rich ones .
It is also countered by the simple statement that people should not have children if they have no means of feeding them .
And in any case , spreading the misery out universally can hardly be considered a solution , no matter how anyone tries to juggle the figures .
Overpopulation can always be passed off as somebody else 's problem .
It is the fundamental case of what Garrett Hardin calls  the tragedy of the commons  [ Hardin ( a ) , ( b ) ] : although every oversize family knows the world will suffer slightly from that fecundity , no family wants to lose out by being the first to back down .
Without a central governing body that is both strong and honest , however , the evasion is perpetual , and it is that very lack of strength and honesty that makes traditional democracy an anachronism .
For all that might be said against their politics and economics , it is the Chinese who have made the greatest effort at dealing with excess numbers , although even their efforts can hardly be considered a success .
Discussion of overpopulation is the Great Taboo .
Politicians will rarely touch the issue , although we no longer hold our breaths waiting for such people to speak the truth about anything .
Even the many documents of the United Nations merely sidestep the issue by discussing how to cater to large populations , in spite of the fact that such catering is part of the problem , not part of the solution .
To speak against overpopulation is an exercise in futility .
How likely is it that the required massive change in human thinking will ever take place ?
For such a thing to happen , it would be necessary for a large percentage of the human race to become literate , to read books , and to understand difficult scientific abstractions , scholarly entanglements which are neither comic nor tragic but simply unpropitious .
Yet that is precisely the opposite of how most people behave .
To broach the topic of overpopulation is only to invite charges of racism and elitism .
Instead of dreaming of ways to reduce a population of several billion to a reasonable number overnight , therefore , it might be more sensible to think in terms of the medical system of triage : let us save those who can be saved .
Like so many other species , humanity expands and consumes until its members starve and die .
The two basic , reciprocal problems of human life have still never been solved : overpopulation and the over - consumption of resources .
As a result , the competition for survival is intense , and for most people life is just a long stretch of drudgery followed by an ignoble death .
It is ironic that birth control , the most important invention in all of human history , has been put into practice in such a desultory manner .
There is still no intelligent life on earth .
In view of the general unpopularity of family - planning policies , it can only be said euphemistically that nature will decide the outcome .
Even if his words owe as much to observation of the stages of collapse as to divine inspiration , it is St. John 's Four Horsemen of war , famine , plague , and death who will signify the future of the industrial world .
Nor can we expect people to be overly concerned about good manners : although there are too many variables for civil strife to be entirely predictable , if we look at accounts of large - scale disasters of the past , ranging from the financial to the meteorological , we can see that there is a point at which the looting and lynching begin .
The survivors of industrial society will have to distance themselves from the carnage .
The need for a successful community to be far removed from urban areas is also a matter of access to the natural resources that will remain .
With primitive technology , it takes a great deal of land to support human life .
What may look like a long stretch of empty wilderness is certainly not empty to the people who are out there picking blueberries or catching fish .
That emptiness is not a prerogative or luxury of the summer vacationer .
It is an essential ratio of the human world to the non-human .
Famine
Humanity has struggled to survive through the millennia in terms of balancing population size with food supply .
The same is true now , but population numbers have been soaring for over a century .
Oil , the limiting factor , is close to or beyond its peak extraction .
Without ample , free - flowing oil , it will not be possible to support a population of several billion for long .
Famine caused by oil - supply failure alone will probably result in about 2.5 billion above - normal deaths before the year 2050 ; lost and averted births will amount to roughly an equal number .
In terms of its effects on daily human life , the most significant aspect of fossil - fuel depletion will be the lack of food .
 Peak oil basically means peak food .
Modern agriculture is highly dependent on fossil fuels for fertilizers ( the Haber - Bosch process combines natural gas with atmospheric nitrogen to produce nitrogen fertilizer ) , pesticides , and the operation of machines for irrigation , harvesting , processing , and transportation .
Without fossil fuels , modern methods of food production will disappear , and crop yields will be far less than at present .
Crop yields are far lower in societies that do not have fossil fuels or modern machinery .
We should therefore have no illusions that several billion humans can be fed by organic gardening  or anything else of that nature .
The Green Revolution involved , among other things , the development of higher - yielding crops .
These new varieties could be grown only with large inputs of fertilizer and pesticides , all of which required fossil fuels .
In essence , the Green Revolution was little more than the invention of a way to turn petroleum and natural gas into food .
Over the next few decades , therefore , there will be famine on a scale many times larger than ever before in human history .
It is possible , of course , that warfare and plague will take their toll to a large extent before famine claims its victims .
The distinctions , in any case , can never be absolute : often war + drought = famine [ Devereux ] , especially in sub-Saharan Africa , but there are several other combinations of factors .
Although , when discussing theories of famine , economists generally use the term neo - malthusian in a derogatory manner , the coming famine will be very much a case of an imbalance between population and resources .
The ultimate cause will be fossil - fuel depletion , not government policy ( as in the days of Stalin or Mao ) , warfare , ethnic discrimination , bad weather , poor methods of distribution , inadequate transportation , livestock diseases , or any of the other variables that have often turned mere hunger into genuine starvation .
The increase in the world 's population has followed a simple curve : from about 1.7 billion in 1900 to about 6.1 billion in 2000 .
A quick glance at a chart of world population growth , on a broader time scale , shows a line that runs almost horizontally for thousands of years , and then makes an almost vertical ascent as it approaches the present .
That is not just an amusing curiosity .
It is a shocking fact that should have awakened humanity to the realization that something is dreadfully wrong .
Mankind is always prey to its own exuberance ,  to use Catton 's term .
That has certainly been true of population growth .
In many cultures ,  Do you have any children ?  or ,  How many children do you have ?  is a form of greeting or civility almost equivalent to  How do you do ?  or ,  Nice to meet you . 
World population growth , nevertheless , has always been ecologically hazardous .
With every increase in human numbers we are only barely able to keep up with the demand : providing all those people with food and water has not been easy .
We are always pushing ourselves to the limits of Earth 's ability to hold us .
[ Catton ]
Even that is an understatement .
No matter how much we depleted our resources , there was always the sense that we could somehow get by .
But in the late twentieth century we stopped getting by .
It is important to differentiate between production in an absolute sense and production per capita .
Although oil production , in absolute numbers , kept climbing  only to decline in the early twenty - first century  what was ignored was that although that absolute production was climbing , the production per capita reached its peak in 1979 . [ BP ]
The unequal distribution of resources plays a part .
The average inhabitant of the United States consumes far more than the average inhabitant of India or China .
Nevertheless , if all the world 's resources were evenly distributed , the result would only be universal poverty .
It is the totals and the averages of resources that we must deal with in order to determine the totals and averages of results .
For example , if all of the world 's arable land were distributed evenly , in the absence of mechanized agriculture each person on the planet would still have an inadequate amount of farmland for survival : distribution would have accomplished very little .
We were always scraping the edges of the earth , but we are now entering a far more dangerous era .
The main point to keep in mind is that , throughout the twentieth century , oil production and human population were so closely integrated that every barrel of oil had an effect on human numbers .
While population has been going up , so has oil production .
Future excess mortality can therefore be determined ?
at least in a rough - and - ready manner ?
by the fact that in modern industrial society it is oil supply that determines how many people can be fed .
An increase in oil production leads to an increase in population , and a decrease in oil production leads to a decrease in population .
In round numbers , global oil production in the year 2008 was 30 billion barrels , and the population was 7 billion .
The consensus is that in the year 2050 oil production will be about 2 billion barrels .
The same amount of oil production occurred in the year 1930 , when the population was 2 billion .
The population in 2050 will therefore be the same as in 1930 : 2 billion .
The difference between 7 billion people and 2 billion is 5 billion , which will therefore be the total number of famine deaths and lost or averted births for that period .
We can also determine the number of famine deaths and lost or averted births on an annual basis .
From 2008 to 2050 is 42 years .
The average annual difference in population is therefore 5 billion divided by 42 , which is about 120 million .
Many of those annual 120 million will not actually be deaths ; famine will cause a lowering of the birth rate .
[ Devereux , Ó Gráda ]
This will sometimes happen voluntarily , as people realize they lack the resources to raise children , or it will happen involuntarily when famine and general ill health result in infertility .
In most famines the number of deaths from starvation or from starvation - induced disease is very roughly the same as the number of lost or averted births .
In Ireland 's nineteenth - century famine , for example , the number of famine deaths was 1.3 million , whereas the number of lost births was 0.4 million .
The number of famine deaths during China 's Great Leap Forward ( 1958 - 1961 ) was perhaps 30 million , and the number of lost births was perhaps 33 million .
The normal ,  non-famine - related , birth and death rates are not incorporated into the above future population figures , since for most of pre-industrial human history the sum of the two  i.e. the growth rate  has been nearly zero .
If not for the problem of resource - depletion , in other words , the future birth rate and death rate would be nearly identical , as they were in pre-industrial times .
And there is no question that the future will mean a return to the pre-industrial . 
Nevertheless , it will often be hard to separate famine deaths  from a rather broad category of other excess deaths .
War , disease , global warming , topsoil deterioration , and other factors will have unforeseeable effects of their own .
Considering the unusual duration of the coming famine , and with Leningrad [ Salisbury ] as one of many precursors , cannibalism may be significant ; to what extent should this be included in a calculation of famine deaths  ?
It is probably safe to say that an unusually large decline in the population of a country will be the most significant indicator that this predicted famine has in fact arrived .
These figures obliterate all previous estimates of future population growth .
Instead of a steady rise over the course of this century , as generally predicted , there will be a clash of the two giant forces of overpopulation and oil depletion , followed by a precipitous ride into the unknown future .
The Passage
What seems the best general concept of human society later in this century is not easy to formulate .
The only keyword that seems applicable is survivalist ,  although for various reasons even that name is rather clumsy .
With a slightly optimistic view of the future , one can say that a few people will succeed , and that such people will generally be those who have the skills to do so , even if there will be other people who stay alive by sheer chance .
The greatest resource of all will be the knowledge inside one 's own head .
People with the information and skills required for supplying themselves and their community with food and shelter , however , can certainly be called survivalists , even if there should be a better label .
The trouble with the term survivalist is that it is often more suited to people who have been brought up on purely fictional accounts of Armageddon , as churned out by Hollywood film studios .
The pleasure derived from watching such depictions of violence is not as innocent as it seems .
Watching a movie is only one step removed from watching gladiators in an amphitheater hacking each other to pieces .
In both cases our moral sensibilities are dulled : we fail to disapprove of the behavior we are observing .
In both cases , also , the underlying message is that violence is the quick road to success .
In the real world of the future , however , such forms of behavior might be of questionable value in the long run .
The problem with cycles of revenge is that there is often no obvious distinction to be made between the good  and the bad . 
Bloodshed will be no more a lasting solution in the future than it was in Viking times .
We must not forget that even in the Dark Ages there were many who sought a better way of life .
We must also keep in mind that as the centuries unfold the human world will always be much smaller than it is today .
It may seem odd to speak of the social implications of hematite versus taconite , for example , but what we are really examining is a human population that will be shrinking considerably from its present numbers and living a less complicated life .
The world will not be smaller in the sense of  the global village with its rapid communication and transportation , but smaller in almost the opposite sense : that each person 's life will be lived within a smaller geographic range than today , and that the total of human numbers will be small .
That smallness will be repeated mile by mile , league by league : people will be counted in groups of hundreds rather than billions , and the kingdoms of the distant future will be the size of our present counties .
Other than the numbers and the technology , that future way of life may remain somewhat of a mystery for now .
We might think of the Dark Ages of Europe , as previously mentioned .
But then we must also consider scenarios of the past that are more pleasant ?
for example , the first people to cross the Bering Strait , many thousands of years ago , discovered two entire continents entirely uninhabited by humans .
What they found must have been an absolute paradise , or so it may seem us in our crowded day .
Of course the difference between AD 1000 and 10,000 BC is obvious : at the earlier time , there was an excellent ratio between population and resources .

The Buddha 's teaching , as expressed in the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path , can appear rational and perhaps even reassuring to many of us .
But these teachings lead to outcomes that we might find less palatable .
For example , in the Samyutta Nikaya ( 12.15 ) the Buddha tells Maha Kaccana :
Everything exists - that is one extreme .
Everything does n't exist - that is the other extreme .
Avoiding these two extremes , The Tathagata teaches the dhamma by the middle way .
I remember when I first read this phrase - goosebumps arose on my arm as I realized that this was not the cozy , familiar middle way between luxury and asceticism .
Rather , this statement of the middle way radically and completely cut away every sense of certainty , leaving me . . . where ?
With this teaching , the Buddha plunges the practitioner into profoundly unfamiliar territory - the unknown spaciousness where name and form no longer obtain .
For me , it 's the Buddha 's most profound declaration of do n't know .
The success of the ’ 94 World Cup led to the start of Major League Soccer two years later .
Kraft retains strong emotions regarding the Revolution , a team that has provided him with as much frustration as satisfaction .
“ And you saw all the people in the squares in Amsterdam and Madrid , hundreds of thousands of people all coming together .
Sort of like our first Super Bowl , the coldest day of the year and we have 1 1/2 million people on the streets of Boston , a city of 600,000 people .
This is the global sport .
You have all ethnic , racial , and economic backgrounds , all together .
It ’s great for Spain , given their economic problems , it binds people together , helps the social fabric of the community .
In the world we live in , the more ways we can build bridges and find ways for different cultures and backgrounds to learn to live together — this brings people together like no other sport . ’’
“ I just wish it was a little more exciting .
The US - Ghana game got 19.5 million viewers and that was more than watched the NBA Finals and three times the Stanley Cup finals , so think about what that means , vs. four years ago — ratings are up 30 percent , and I think there are a lot of viewers not reported , to be honest .
“ Our family loves sports , sports are part of the global community and the fabric of life , ’’ Kraft said .
“ And the World Cup is unique .
I was a little disappointed , the game was not as thrilling — I know how the American fan base thinks , and it was not the kind of game most Americans want to see .
The Kraft family viewed Sunday ’s final on Cape Cod .
A couple decades ago , they might have been in the minority among US families in terms of interest in the World Cup .
“ We were the last stadium to be chosen , ’’ Kraft said yesterday .
“ If you think about it , six games were held in the old stadium — out of 52 games , 10 percent of the World Cup was played here — that was a great sales job . ’’
When Kraft invested in the stadium in 1988 , one of his first directives was to secure approval as a venue for the World Cup .
It was an uphill battle .
Former stadium manager Brian O’Donovan had acted unilaterally to nominate Foxboro Stadium , but it had been crossed off the preliminary list , partly because of the artificial turf surface .
Kraft ’s commitment revived the bid .
While viewing Spain ’s victory over the Netherlands in the World Cup final Sunday , Robert Kraft ’s thoughts went back to July 9 , 1994 .
That was the last of six World Cup games held at Foxboro Stadium , Italy taking a 2 - 1 victory over Spain .
After the Revolution ’s 2 - 0 victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy before 20,000 - plus fans Saturday night , Kraft felt a sense of relief , and also a validation of his belief in professional soccer .
“ Here ’s the deal , ’’ said Kraft after the struggling Revolution knocked off the MLS - leading Galaxy .
“ Take our record over the last 10 years , wins and losses , we are in the top two or three teams .
I ’m not happy with how this team is performing [ this season ] , but getting three points Saturday night was really good .
We have some bad circumstances — Taylor Twellman and other injuries , we had Shalrie Joseph out for a while .
“ We do n’t think we ’re out of the playoff picture .
[ Sainey ]
Nyassi , the way he played — they played their hearts out Saturday night .
Believe me , we ’re on top of it .
Our cap space is tight but I think you will see a signing here in the next week or two . ’’
Whoever the newcomer is , he will not likely be of designated player caliber , someone who would be paid outside the salary cap limits .
“ There is a time and place for that , ’’ Kraft said .
“ In the end , we want to win — we ’re not trying to just get headlines .
I learned from the NFL , there are ownership groups who want to make headlines , but we need guys who can help us win .
It ’s like anything else , it ’s chemistry — football and soccer are the same , you need to play together as a team .
Look at Sunday ’s game , the score was 1 - nil , but look at how many small things made a difference . ’’
Kraft is committed to finding a location for a soccer - specific stadium .
“ We know eventually we will have a soccer - specific stadium , ’’ Kraft said .
“ There are a lot of different alternatives we are considering .
It ’s timing and location .
Probably an urban setting is where it belongs .
Believe it or not , people are coming to us from all over the New England region , from different urban settings , and we ’re just trying to figure out where the best location is .
Good public transportation is important .
Financing is not the problem .
I think it ’s finding the right location .
This is a permanent decision .
I have a saying , that you measure nine times and cut once .
You have the material to make a dress or suit , this is a custom - tailored operation , and when you cut the cloth it ’s going to be something that will fit .
We are not under the gun , so we are going to do the right thing . ’’
Kraft is on the US bid committee trying to win the 2018 or 2022 World Cup .

Henry tax review
The debate about the resource super profits tax is not just a fight over whether successful mining companies should pay a little more tax .
It is a battle for the future direction of tax reform in Australia .
It is a struggle between a social democratic view of the world warped by 30 years of disguising cuts as reforms and a neoliberal vision warped by 30 years of proclaiming the need to attack workers and their salaries and social spending .
The Henry Review has a 40 year social democratic vision for our revenue system .
It has at its heart what Henry describes as protecting ‘ the things [ Australians ] most value — including improving living standards , support for the needy , fairness , social advancement , security and protection of the environment . ’
Such improvements can only be built on the continued growth of the economy .
And therein lies the contradiction for social democrats .
Benefits for ordinary working people can only be built on the success of the exploitative relationship between capital and labour .
It is the classic dilemma for all tax policy designers – equity or efficiency .
Of course social democrats hide the contradiction with talk about Nordic models and the view that the exploitation of labour is enhanced by having a healthy and well educated workforce confident of its present and future well being , i.e. social spending on areas like health , education and retirement incomes .
These social gains can only exist if the economy prospers .
And taxes constrain the capital accumulation process ( even efficient ones ) .
But the real issue here is the decades ’ long decline of global profit rates , what Marx called the tendency of the rate of profit to fall .
This arises from the very way production under capitalism is structured , with increasing investment in capital at the expense of labour meaning that , as labour creates value , the long term trend asserts itself despite countervailing tendencies like the destruction of capital and its value , the lengthening of the working week , increased productivity and reduced wages .
The best indicator of the response of capital to the declining profit rate has been in labour ’s share of national income .
According to the ACTU “ Profits are at record levels of 26.9 % of national income , while the wages share is close to a record low of 53.6 % . ”
Despite this historic shift , profit rates are still stagnating in Australia .
In the hands of social democrats , policy , including tax policy , becomes an instrument to help address the tendency of profit rates to fall but is disguised in talk about equity .
For example the Resource Super Profits
Tax is a redistributive measure , shifting the value we workers create from one section of the capitalist class – mining companies – to the whole of that class through tax cuts and infrastructure spending .
Only 3 percent of the anticipated $ 9 billion will go to top up the superannuation accounts of low paid workers .
Given an aging population , the environmental degradation underway , the need of capital for an educated workforce , an expectation by most Australians of adequate healthcare during their life and especially in old age and with enough to live on then , Henry foresees increased taxation in future years – but not on companies or those well off enough to save .
The burden , if Henry Review ’s long term plans to move tax gathering from highly mobile to immobile property like minerals and land , and consumption and labour , come to fruition , will fall more and more on Rudd ’s clichéd working families .
This is because , although Henry proposes a massive increase in the tax free threshold to $ 25,000 , that will come at the expense of various benefits within the system .
In any event without a claw back , the benefits of increasing the threshold go overwhelmingly to those on high incomes .
In addition Henry proposes flattening the progressive income scales to make Australia effectively a flat rate tax country with only two rates once the threshold is reached .
Indeed his vision is for most Australians to pay tax on one set tax rate .
This makes the system even more inequitable than it is at the moment .
The Review noted ominously that Australia ’s GST rate was low by international standards and was not broad based .
This means
Henry would like to see the GST rate increased and exemptions on food , health and education abolished .
It wo n’t happen tomorrow but it will be tempting to Governments in the future who are short of cash and not wanting to tax capital .
Now taxing fixed assets , especially non-renewable ones like minerals , has appeal .
But the other immobile property Henry has concentrated on is land .
He recommended a land value tax .
But as he said : ‘[ L ] and tax is not a good tool for achieving vertical equity objectives . ’
A land value tax of 1 % would hit most working class people .
Even when Henry suggests progressive pro-capitalist measures like a bequest duty , the current Labor government has rejected such proposals .
The intention is clear .
Increase the tax burden on workers through regressive measures like land tax , consumption tax and flatter income tax rates and provide the benefits of that shift to business income through tax cuts and further state assistance .
If that does n’t work , cut back spending on school , hospitals and pensions .
It ’s the rich what gets the gravy , it ’s the poor what gets the blame .
That just about sums up Henry ’s long term tax vision for Australian capitalism .
Posted on June 16th , 2010
Friend of Beeriety Justin Lloyd recently began working at Chelsea Brewring Company in Manhattan as a cellar man .
Below is the first in a new series of articles by Justin about what it ’s like to work in the brewing industry .
Last year I set out across the country in search of the ultimate job — professional brewer .
After three months of visiting numerous breweries , pubs and festivals , I landed in Portland , Oregon and set out to find a job in a commercial brewery .
Despite dropping off resumes at every brewery , distribution company and beer bar in the area , I simply could not get a job in the industry and resigned myself to home brewing .
I eventually found a job in a restaurant but kept an eye out for a chance to work with beer .
Hours were spent scanning websites like ProBrewer.com and beer blogs for internship opportunities ; pint and after was consumed while chatting up brewers trying to discern their secrets for success ; I even convinced a film - making friend of mine to edit a video submission for a chance to work at Full Sail Brewing in Hood River , Oregon :
None of it worked .
About a year after I left New York , my father called me .
He found out that an acquaintance of a co-worker was friendly with the owner of Chelsea Brewing Company in Manhattan .
Even better news was that business at the brewery was steadily growing and they might need some extra hands .
I spent the several weeks making phone calls and set - up an interview .
Ten days later I was on a plane to New York , anxiously preparing for an interview .
I got hired as a waiter in Chelsea ’s restaurant and spent my days off volunteering in brewery .
In three weeks , the boss asked me if I ’d like to work at the brewery officially two days a week while waiting tables on the weekend .
I instantly agreed .
I started working at the Chelsea Brewing Company about a month ago .
Currently , I ’m considered the cellar man of the brewery .
This awesome and archaic sounding title means that I perform all the grunt work and help out the two brewers with whatever they need .
Mostly , I scrub , sanitize and fill kegs .
However , since Chelsea Brewing is a small operation — 30 bbl brewhouse and six 60 bbl fermentors — I work side by side with the brewers while they answer my incessant questions and show me the ropes .
My days in the brewery start at 7 am .
I get to work , hop on the forklift and get the brewery ready for the day .
Once the pallets of kegs , malts , hops or whatever happens to be lying around that day are cleared I fire up the keg washer and get to work .
We have a 4 - keg cleaner so after scrubbing the outside of each keg I load them up to the machine and flush and sanitize the inside of each .
Four kegs take 15 - 20 minutes on the machine so you can imagine that if I have thirty - six kegs to clean , the majority of my morning is spent cleaning .
Around 8:30 the head and assistant brewer show up .
By that time I ’m usually finishing up my keg washing and manipulate the machine to state bulk filling for our accounts .
Chelsea is a draught only brewery so although we do n’t bottle our beer , we have numerous accounts in Manhattan , Brooklyn and Queens to whom we provide full kegs , corny kegs , casks , firkins and pins .
Depending on the brewmaster ’s agenda for the day , I assist with the day ’s task while keg filling .
Since the summer has unofficially started in NYC — those beer gardens need to stay stocked — we ’ve been busy brewing to fulfill all of our orders .
Brewing generally lasts 6 - 7 hours depending on the style and the amount of cleaning we need to do .
Non - brew days are devoted to beer transfers , tank sanitizing and other odds and ends needed to keep the restaurant bar stocked and the beer delicious .
While it may not be a huge accomplishment on my part , I can safely say that I ’ve gained a feel for keg washing .
I wo n’t be creating recipes that will take the beer world by storm , but I ’m slowly gaining an understanding of the job , dirty keg by dirty keg .
Long lines , parking probs reported at county 's only two polling places opened for tight Democratic U.S. Senate run-off primary ...
Brad Friedman Byon 6/8/2010 , 2:44 pm PT
As we flagged last night , early reports today are that the concerns about the polling place fiasco in Garland County , Arkansas , have now " come to full flower . "
Garland Election Commissioner Charles Tapp had unilaterally ( without the vote of his two other commissioners ) decided to reduce the number of polling locations from 42 during the general primary on May 18th , to just 2 for today 's run-off primary .
The decision is expected to most drastically affect Lt. Gov. Bill Halter , who did exceptionally well in the county during the general Democratic primary in his now - very - tight race against incumbent U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln .
After Tapp had announced that an additional polling place would be opened last Saturday for early voting to ease the expected crowds today , he changed his mind at the last moment , and " hundreds of voters " are said to have shown up on Saturday , without being allowed to vote .
Today , long lines and parking problems are being reported at the county 's only two open polling places , after 12,000 had cast votes in the general primary on May 8th ...
Max Brantley at the Arkansas Times calls it a " cluster#@ % * " :
The mess that Garland County Election Commission made has come to full flower .
A voting rights activist reports long lines and parking problems at the two — count 'em , two — polling places that the Commission decided to open for runoff voting .
It closed 40 other polls to save money despite the fact that every voter in the county , where some 12,000 voted in the first primary , has three statewide races to consider .
There 's one poll in Hot Springs , at the election commission , and one in Hot Springs Village ( beyond the community 's access gates ) .
If it 's a close election and Bill Halter loses , somebody is going to howl , given Blanche Lincoln 's poor showing in Garland in the first primary .
She got only about 40 percent of the vote .
Those in line by 7:30 still may be able to vote .
One question , however , may be what constitutes a line .
Confident that Commission Chairman Charles Tapp and Co. will have a good answer ?
Michael Whitney at firedoglake has a bit more :
This county went heavily for Halter in a three - way race – a full 3 % of his total haul on primary day came from the county ’s 42 polling places .
Now that all the county ’s voters will be funneled into just two polling places , voters with tight schedules could decide to go home rather than face the “ long lines and parking problems ” already evident .
...
UPDATE : Reports from Arkansas indicate that after Halter volunteers spent the morning trying to direct the huge amount of traffic at the two polling places , the state police have been called in to try to alleviate the massive parking problems .
It is simply inexcusable that outgoing Sec. of State Charlie Daniels did not step into this mess to clean it up long ago , late last week when it had already become more than clear what was about to happen .
" Cluster#@ % * , " indeed .
Whenever I hear the word “ etiquette ” visions of stuffy old charm schools play in my head .
I do n’t believe you have to ( or even should ) be nice to everyone all the time just because you want everyone to like you .
It ’s okay to dislike people , disagree with people , and share honest opinions as long as you can back them up .
I ’m also not a big believer in wearing a peachy little persona all the time just because other people tell you that you should .
I ’m going to throw a buzzword at you , but one I think really matters — authenticity .
I ’d rather someone truly be themselves when I meet them in the social media space as opposed to watching them putting on a show .
That said , I ’m a surprisingly big fan of general social media etiquette .
I think it ’s often less about manners and more about basic common sense .
There are plenty of things that you would n’t want people doing to you while you ’re on social networks , blogs , or using other social media tools .
So do n’t do those things to others .
If you want to avoid coming across as a complete jackass , getting yourself banned , or just being blacklisted by your network , here are 20 tips for social media etiquette you might want to keep in mind .
DON ’T spam .
Ever —
Self - explanatory , no ?
DON ’T keep everything private . —
Online privacy is important .
It ’s very important .
But if you ’re keeping every social interaction private , why are you even taking part in social media ?
Stick to emails and instant messengers and text messaging if that ’s your goal , and stop making everyone else feel like your “ club ” is too exclusive .
DON’T “ go after ” competitors . —
If your competitor does something stupid , comment on it to your heart ’s content .
But do n’t take part in social media sabotage — trying to bury their posts or news stories , trying to get them banned from social media platforms , or pretending to be an unhappy customer for example .
DON ’T create multiple handles to “ gang up . ” —
If other people are n’t supporting your viewpoint , that should tell you something .
It ’s never okay to comment using multiple fake identities to try to support your own point ( making it look like several people are agreeing ) .
Not only is that idiotic , but you will get caught and exposed .
DON ’T try to incite a mob mentality .
—
In addition to not setting up multiple identities of your own , also avoid trying to incite a social media mob .
If you blatantly go around telling everyone to comment on something with the same opinion , you ’re guilty of manipulating the conversation .
Share a link ?
Yes .
Tell people what to say or encourage them to gang up ?
I do n’t think so .
DO think before “ speaking . ” —
Yes , social media involves the ability to publish your thoughts instantly .
But just because something pops into your head , it does n’t mean it should be shared with the world .
Think first .
DO personalize messages and introductions . —
When you first connect with someone new and they do n’t already know you , go ahead and say hello .
Let them know how you came across them .
It ’s a little less creepy and you might just make a great impression .
DO think ( and network ) outside your circle . —
If your social networks only involve people who agree with you , you ’re living in a box .
It ’s silly at best .
DON ’T post questionable photos of others without their permission .
—
Regardless of whether or not you legally need a model release to post a certain photo , do n’t post anything questionable or compromising of someone else unless you check with them first .
It ’s just the right thing to do .
And if you do n’t , remember this — karma ’s a bitch .
You have no idea what they have on you .
DON ’T send automated messages to new followers . —
When someone follows you on Twitter , do n’t use automated tools to immediately bombard them with messages ( no matter how sweet you think you ’re being in your not - so - personal “ hello ” ) .
Remember , it ’s not just you annoying them — others are doing it too .
DO use your real name whenever possible . —
At a bare minimum , use a recognizable name ( such as a common pen name everyone already knows for you ) .
When you interact anonymously , very little holds you accountable for your actions and words .
DON ’T excessively link to your own site (s ) . —
This is another common sense one .
No one cares about your site enough to want to see a link to it in every message you send out there in social media land .
You ’ll eventually just be viewed as a link spammer .
DO give back .
— Social media is a two - way street .
Give as much as you get .
Better yet , give even more !
DON ’T turn into a social media stalker .
—
Please do n’t follow people around on the social Web like a lost puppy .
It really is rather creepy .
Unless you ’re best buds , no one wants to see you not only on Facebook and Twitter but also on all of their niche social sites ranging from crocheting to auto body repair .
DON ’T invite everyone you know to every social media tool you decide to use . —
If they ’re already networking with you in two or three places , that ’s enough .
Really .
Unless the new service is completely ground - breaking , do n’t nag them with invites .
DO try to make your tweets comprehensible . — I try to avoid txt spk .
Not everyone is a teenager who grew up with it in their blood .
Cut the rest of us some slack and try to use … oh , I do n’t know … words ?
By all means , abbreviate when necessary .
Just try to use shortcuts your audience will widely understand .
DON ’T swap your name for a string of keywords .
—
When you comment on someone ’s blog or create a social media handle , stick to your name .
Do n’t use a string of keywords because you think it ’s good for SEO .
It ’s usually not ( most of those links are no - follow by default ) .
And people want to feel like they ’re talking to a person ( or your company ) — not “ detox foot spa . ”
I literally just pulled that example from some of my own blog spam .
DO listen to what others have to say .
— Conversations are two - way streets .
Enough said .
DON ’T unfollow people just because they do n’t follow you back .
— Seriously .
How lame is that ?
If the person noticed you and thought you were worth following , they would have .
Either tweet things that make you worthy of a follow , or knock off the follow spam crap just to try to build your own follower count artificially .
DO submit other people ’s material to news aggregators and social bookmarking sites . —
When you only share your own material , you just look like an egotistical little snot .
Oh … .
That ’s what you were going for ?
Then proceed .
I ’m sure you brilliant folks can come up with more tips on social media etiquette , so share some of your favorites in the comments .
They can be general tips on social media etiquette or tips specific to different tools and platforms .
Where have all the Free Quarks Gone ?

Universe began as an infinitely dense point in space .
The particles and the physics are exotic .
At 10 - 30 s , the Universe expands by a factor of 1026 , in a process we call Inflation .
10 - 14 s later , baryons and antibaryons annihilate and we are left with a quark - gluon plasma , in which quarks can exist by themselves , outside of a hadron .

FitNesse Open Source Testing Tool : A Tester 's Perspective
Lisa Crispin , http://lisacrispin.com
FitNesse is an open source test framework that allows software testers , developers and customers to collaborate to create test cases on a wiki .
Teams can take examples of desired software behavior and turn them into automated tests , integrated with narrative requirements documentation .
FitNesse runs its own wiki web server .
It 's possible to test applications written in Java , .
Net , Ruby , Python , C , and PHP using FitNesse .
My team has used FitNesse since 2004 .
This review is based on our experiences .
I hope it will help you decide whether you 'd like to try out FitNesse for your own test automation .
Web Site : http://www.fitnesse.org
Version tested : 20100308
License & Pricing : Open Source
Support : Yahoo group mailing list
Installation
Ease of installation is one of the strengths of FitNesse .
You can download FitNesse via http://fitnesse.org.
Installation is simple .
For a Java installation , type java - jar fitnesse.jar .
This will put all the necessary files in place .
To start the server , type java - jar fitnesse .
jar - p:xxxx where xxxx is your desired port number .
Now you can access FitNesse via your browser with http://<hostname>:xxxx/FrontPage where hostname is your localhost or the server where you just installed FitNesse and xxxx is the port number you used .
Yes , it really is that easy to get it installed .
You can write and execute FitNesse tests via the browser .
Tests and suites may also be run from the command line with a RESTful syntax , or from a JUnit test .
Configuration
FitNesse comes with its own version control and test history functionality , so it can be used stand - alone .
Everyone on the team can use a single FitNesse server , or each team member can import tests into their local environment , work on them , and export changes and new tests back to the main server .
You may also choose to integrate FitNesse with your existing version control , so that tests can be tagged along with the code that they test .
Each team member can have their own independent FitNesse environment , and check new and updated tests into the source code control system .
My team checks our tests into Subversion , and we run our FitNesse regression suites from our Hudson version control so that we get regular , speedy feedback and take advantage of Hudson 's test reporting features .
FitNesse tests may be run on top of either Fit , using additional fixtures in FitLibrary , or Slim .
Both currently come with FitNesse , although Fit may not be bundled with FitNesse in future versions and you 'll have to download it separately .
Each has its own set of test fixtures built in , with a lot of similarity between the two sets of fixtures .
For example , the ScriptTable in Slim and the DoFixture in FitLibrary can both be used to create flow tests that are more readable to the business .
You can use either or both , and your team will build on these built - in fixtures to automate your tests with your production code .
Documentation

Learning Curve
Learning to write test cases in the various formats such as Column Fixture is fairly easy .
Learning how to design them well , for efficiency and ease of maintenance , takes more time .
If you do n't have object - oriented design skills , pair with a programmer or other team member who does .
Apply good code design practices such as ' Do n't Repeat Yourself ' to your FitNesse tests .
If you 're not a programmer , you 'll also have to collaborate with a programmer who can write the necessary fixtures which take the test inputs , pass them to the production code , and send the results back to FitNesse for comparison with expected results .
Writing fixtures is fairly straightforward for programmers , as they will do this in the same language in which they write production code .
For our team , it usually takes two to four hours to write a new FitNesse fixture .
Occasionally , it can be tricky to come up with a fixture for a complex testing scenario .
Examples
There 's a wide variety of formats for FitNesse tests , both tabular and scenario style .
Our tests mainly extend the Column Fixture .
Here 's a simple example of from the FitNesse user guide .
Sometimes a tabular format does n't reflect the business example well , so there are other options .
Here is an example from our own tests , using the DoFixture .
The test takes out a loan with a given amount , interest rate , payment frequency , term and start date .
A payment is received and processed , then the test checks the interest and principal applied and the remaining balance .
This mimics the actual business flow .
Slim scenario tables are similar to the Fit DoFixture .
Well - Designed Tests
FitNesse provides features that enable you to design automated tests for ease of maintenance .
The ! include feature is one way you can extract duplicated test code and reuse it in several tests .
Variables can also be used so that when you need to make a change , you can do it in one location , and not have to change multiple test pages .
Here 's an example .
We can define a variable whose contents are a test table :
! define LoanSetup (! |Loan Processing Fixture|
|take loan in the amount of |$ {loanAmount}| with interest rate|${interestRate}|frequency|${frequency}| and term | $ {term} | year with loan origination date | $ {date} |
|check| periodic payment is|${periodicPaymentAmount}|
)
We can use this variable in multiple tests , substituting the desired values for loan amount , interest rate and so on for each test .
For example :
! define loanAmount ( 1000.00 )
! define interestRate ( 6.0 )
! define frequency ( Monthly )
! define term ( 1 )
! define date ( 09-31-2005 )
! define periodicPaymentAmount ( 86.07 )
$ {LoanSetup}
When we run the test , it is as readable as the test that does n't use variables :
The Scenario Tables in Slim provide similar functionality to this technique .
Test automation projects often fail because tests are not designed for maintainability , and the overhead to keep the tests up to date becomes overwhelming .
FitNesse 's design - friendly features help prevent this problem .
Add-Ons
FitNesse provides a framework for using other test tools , such as GUI drivers .
This allows greater flexibility , while taking advantage of the ease of writing tests in the Wiki and FitNesse 's excellent result reporting capabilities .
For example , you can drive Selenium ( http://seleniumhq.org/) GUI tests from FitNesse test tables .
A tool called Selenesse ( http://github.com/marisaseal/selenesse) provides a bridge that makes this easy for both Java and .
Net environments .
SWAT ( http://ulti-swat.wikispaces.com/) is another example of a GUI test driver that integrates well with FitNesse .
Many teams build their own custom tools using FitNesse or Slim as a base .
Drawbacks
Open source tools are only as good as their developer and user communities .
With any open source tool , there may not be a reliable schedule of releases with new features .
FitNesse has generally enjoyed frequent releases and improvements .
My team suffered some from a backward compatibility issued in a recent release .
Overall , however , useful new features arrive regularly .
We sometimes run into issues where we set up FitNesse in a new environment , without any error message or clue as to what is wrong .
For example , the tests often hang with no feedback if the classpath as defined in the ! path variable is invalid .
We 've worked around these issues by trial and error , and assume it has something to do with the architecture , but it can be frustrating .
We had a hard time integrating FitNesse into our Hudson continuous integration and build process , but the user and development community helped us find a solution .
There 's now a Hudson plug - in for FitNesse .
You may want to make sure FitNesse will work and play well with your CI before committing to using it long - term .
FitNesse is unique ( as far as I know ) in using a Wiki for creating and maintaining test cases , and the Wiki can also be used as a knowledgebase and repository for story and theme requirements .
The fact that anyone can contribute to the wiki is both a plus and a minus .
It 's a great collaboration tool , but it can easily go out of control .
My team has had trouble keeping our wiki organized well enough so that we can easily find information and tests when we need it .
You 'll need to budget time and perhaps have a technical writer help organize and maintain the FitNesse pages and hierarchy .
It can also be tedious to create and maintain test cases on the wiki , using the wiki markup .
FitNesse provides the ability to import and export test cases to and from an Excel spreadsheet , which helps .
However , an IDE plugin so that tests could be edited via Eclipse or other IDEs would be a big improvement .
Benefits
Our team found early on that writing FitNesse tests forced testers , programmers and customers collaborate more .
We expected it to provide a great safety net of regression tests , which it does , but we were surprised to find the greatest benefit was the increased communication during the development of a story or feature .
In the process of turning business examples into FitNesse tests , we discovered disconnects in our understanding of what a story should deliver .
When this happens , we can immediately get testers , developers and customers together to clarify the desired system behavior .
Writing code test - first meant that we did n't have many " bugs " in the traditional sense , but the development team often missed or misunderstood requirements .
The process of writing test cases in FitNesse helped us get quicker feedback and deliver the right business value .
Our FitNesse tests make superb documentation .
They include both narrative about the functionality they 're testing , and executable tests .
They have to keep passing , so unlike the written documentation many teams have , we 're forced to keep them up to date .
When someone from customer support comes over to ask what results should come out from a given set of inputs in production , we do n't get into a philosophical discussion over how the code works , or scratch our heads trying to remember .
We can prove how the code works with a passing FitNesse test .
Maybe this is n't how the business really wants the code to work , and in that case , they can write a story to change it .
This saves lots of time , and makes us look smart .
The ' Drawbacks ' section in this review is longer than the ' Benefits ' section , but for our team , the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks .
As I wrote this article , one of our FitNesse suites caught a regression bug 20 minutes after a code change was checked in .
We 'd have found the regression manually at some point , but it may have taken up to 24 hours .
The fast feedback helps us maintain a sustainable pace and ensure we can deliver high quality code to production anytime .

If you are unfamiliar with HARO , it is a service that reverses the usual dynamic between reporters and PR people .
Traditionally , PR pros pitch stories to journalists who , more often than not , spare no amount of energy and effort to avoid them like the plague .
With HARO , however , it is the reporters who reach out to the PR community for information , stories , and sources .
PR people sign up to receive three e-mails per day containing queries from reporters .
Typical examples include :
Summary : Looking for food trucks that have gone brick - and - mortar Name : [ deleted ] ( The Associated Press )
Category : General Email : [ deleted ] Media Outlet : The Associated Press Deadline : 12:00 PM EST - 21 July Query : Trying to track down food trucks that are so popular they 've been able to open real restaurants .
If you are a PR pro trying to get earned media coverage for your client , contacts through HARO can be a real boon .
It can be a boon as well for partisan political hacks looking for yet another avenue to work a preferred narrative into the news cycle .
For example , if you are a communication staffer at the RNC , the CATO Institute or the Heritage Foundation , you might just jump up on your desk and dance a little jig when you see a reporter from ABC News actively soliciting stories about " government waste " at the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
You might have to do no more than pull up the bullet points from your latest e-mail blast on that very topic .
It is interesting that ABC , in developing a story about " government waste " is targeting HUD .
HUD ’s mission is " to create strong , sustainable , inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all . "
Why , that sounds like socialism !
Just ask Michael Steele or any teabagger , they ’ll tell you .
Interesting also is the fact that this exposé of " government waste " is taking place against the backdrop of a move to further dismantle the social safety net in order to protect tax breaks for the rich .
Very serious people tell us that reducing Social Security benefits , for example , is absolutely necessary if we are going to reduce the budget deficit .
No " serious " pundits or reporters , however , are discussing any reductions in the bloated U.S. defense budget , which exceeds the military budgets for every other nation on earth combined .
If one were interested , one could no doubt find endless stories about massive government waste in the vast sums doled out to defense contractors for weapons that America does n’t even need .
But instead of looking at defense , along comes ABC News to blow the lid off of government waste at HUD , an agency that does things like :
ABC will almost certainly find plenty of ammo for this hit piece on an agency that exists to assist average Americans in times of hardship .
After all , that is what they ’re looking for .
The network has already decided that there is " waste spending in HUD . "
This is the story that the reporters and producers on this hit piece have been assigned to deliver .
They will deliver it .
The outcome is a foregone conclusion .
And when the narrative of waste and abuse and socialism at HUD becomes the next right - wing freakout du jour , remember , you read it here first .

Visually Programming Arrows and Arrowized Functional Reactive Programming
Within the space of the FRVR project , the Haskell language and particularly the Arrow programming extensions play a crucial part of the new system .
The FRVR system builds upon the Yampa ( Arrowized Functional Reactive Programming ) project , which is built in Haskell and relies heavily on the Arrow extensions .
When using the system , it quickly becomes obvious that programming in the arrow style is difficult .
The " syntactic sugar " of Paterson makes Arrow programming more accessible .
Yet , coding meaningful systems is both conceptually difficult and at times tedious , due to carrying around all values as required in functional programming .
When investigating the Dissertation of Courtney ( AFRP ’s main author ) one sees illustrations to clarify the meaning of code and syntax .
Even descriptions of the Arrow concept itself rely heavily on diagrams to explain how they behave , as seen below for the three functionalities of an arrow .
In the early development of the FRVR project , we found ourselves performing the same action , drawing diagrams for the reverse reason .
The act of drawing diagrams of systems helped in understanding how to code them .
Creating the diagrams solidified the concept of the program being created and made the structure of the Arrow based code more apparent .
An example that is bit more complicated is show below , and is part of the Arrow website when explaining the Syntactic Sugar of Paterson :
This usage of diagrams suggests that a potentially useful approach would be to use visual programming for the programming of arrow based programming .
Visual programming approaches have been used within the simulation communities to simplify programming for many years and is an integral part of their approach .
The visual programming approach seems to be particularly advantageous in cases where the described process is of a data - flow nature .
The >>> operator models precisely the data - flow nature .
The Arrow and Yampa approaches correlate directly to this structure .
Additionally , some work has been done on visual programming of functional languages and specifically Haskell code , but predate Arrows .
While those have limited success , the arrow base programming paradigm lends itself much more readily to the visual programming paradigm .
This project focuses on creating a visual programming environment for arrow programming and specifically for the needs of programming Yampa .
The resultant environment can be seen below in the screenshots of the application .
The program is written in Java to allow better cross-platform usage .
The basic functionality of the program allows the user to use all three of the basic arrow functionalities , though the ' first ' functionality is handled through a slightly different mechanism or can be built by the user .
The basic component of the visual programming environment is the arr functionality .
The blue boxes shown in the screen shots each represent an arrow created by using the arr function .
This diagram also shows how the ' first ' function can easily be recreated by the user , here using the identity function to make this explcit .
How this ' first ' functionality works in the rest of the program is explained next .
In the diagram below we see several other features of the visual programming environment .
The connections between Arrow boxes are simply the >>> function , routing the output of one function to the other .
The redish boxes are a compound box .
These boxes are a combination of other boxes , for instance the ' comp '
Arrow below is the first functionality in the diagram above .
As one can see here , we are using the lifting operator extensions , arr2 to arr8 to allow multi-input functions to be created , such as what the first expects , but doing it with primitives .
The visual programming environment handles this internally , alleviating the user from having to do this manually .
Also , in the image below we see that ArrowLoop is supported , allowing loops to be used in the visual programming environment .
Levels of the program code represent to SFs that in turn call internal SFs .
Below we see a code fragment , along with the level which generates it .
When " zooming out " a level , the code seen here is generated and displayed in the program window at the right hand side of the visual editing environment .
Additionally , as the goal of the project is to support programming of Yampa Signal Functions , several extensions are included .
Signal Functions are instances of Arrows , so the basic functionality is already include .
However , Yampa often relies on higher - level usage of SF .
To this end , two further functionalities are included , both to use the SF as an object .
The most common way this is used is in generating an SF via Haskell functions .
For instance , the switch command takes various inputs including two SF .
To achieve this in our system , a Haskell functions that produces a SF ( i.e. can be used as the SF it generates ) is required and a way to give SFs over as parameters .
Below , we see how this is realized ;
In this example an SF being given over to a Haskell function , which is in turn in the graph .
Numerous other functionalities are necessary to make this a usable visual programming environment .
For instance : the visual programming environment allows the user to save their modules and load them back in , including loading a portion of the saved environment back in .
This enables the creation of libraries of often used elements .
The export of the code is performed using the " Syntactic Sugar " style , so that the resultant code can be better understood and that the code better resembles the graphical representation .
People involved :
The World Cup favourites displayed their footballing pedigree with a ...
The first half of the encounter did not seem to be a true Brazil match , with few chances falling to either side , although Zimbabwe held their own and worked hard to keep the South Americans at bay .
It was only a matter of time however , and Brazil finally broke the deadlock through Michel Bastos who scored from a freekick in the 42nd minute , before Robinho made it two just before half time when he scored on the counter attack in the 45th minute .
The match in Harare meant a great deal to the hme team and fans , who savoured the opportunity to face such quality opposition , and they provided a stern test with their never say die attitude .
Brazil was using this game to prepare for the World Cup which begins next week , and they rounded up the win with a third goal in the 56th minute courtesy of Elano .
Brazil will be pleased with a comprehensive win against African opposition ahead of the tournament in which they are placed in the ' Group of Death ' alongside Portugal , Ivory Coast and North Korea .

Hackers are now exploiting the zero-day Windows vulnerability that a Google engineer took public last week , Microsoft confirmed today .
Although Microsoft did not share details of the attack , other researchers filled in the blanks .
A compromised Web site is serving an exploit of the bug in Windows ' Help and Support Center to hijack PCs running Windows XP , said Graham Cluley , a senior technology consultant at antivirus vendor Sophos .
Cluley declined to identify the site , saying only that it was dedicated to open - source software .
" It 's a classic drive - by attack , " said Cluley , referring to an attack that infects a PC when its user simply visits a malicious or compromised site .
The tactic was one of two that Microsoft said last week were the likely attack avenues .
The other : Convincing users to open malicious e-mail messages .
According to Microsoft , the exploit has since been scrubbed from the hacked Web site , but it expects more to surface .
" We do anticipate future exploitation given the public disclosure of full details of the issue , " said Jerry Bryant .
Microsoft 's group manager of response communications .
The vulnerability was disclosed last Thursday by Tavis Ormandy , a security engineer who works for Google .
Ormandy , who also posted proof - of - concept attack code , defended his decision to reveal the flaw only five days after reporting it to Microsoft -- a move that Microsoft and other researchers questioned .
Today , Cluley called Ormandy 's action " utterly irresponsible , " and in a blog post asked , " Tavis Ormandy -- are you pleased with yourself ? "
The five - day stretch between the day Ormandy reported the bug to Microsoft and when he publicly disclosed the flaw stuck in Cluley 's craw .
" Five days is n't enough time to expect Microsoft to develop a fix , which has to be tested thoroughly to ensure it does n't cause more problems than it intends to correct , " Cluley said .
In a message on Twitter last week , Ormandy said that he released the information because Microsoft would not commit to producing a patch within 60 days .
" I 'm getting pretty tired of all the ' 5 days ' hate mail .
Those five days were spent trying to negotiate a fix within 60 days , " Ormandy said on Saturday .
Microsoft confirmed that its security team had discussed a patch schedule with Ormandy .
" We were in the early phases of the investigation and communicated [ to him ] on 6/7 that we would not know what our release schedule would be until the end of the week , " said Bryant .
" We were surprised by the public release of details on the 9th . "
Microsoft issued a security advisory on the vulnerability last Thursday that acknowledged the bug and offered up a manual workaround it said would protect users against attack .
The next day , it posted a " Fix it " tool that automatically unregisters the HCP protocol handler , a move Microsoft said " would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available . "
The in - the - wild attack code is very similar to the proof - of - concept that Ormandy published last week , said Cluley .
That did n't surprise another security expert .
" Given the amount of detail that was released , it 's a ' script kiddie ' kind of exploit at this point , " said Andrew Storms , director of security operations at nCircle Security .
The fact that an exploit based on Ormandy 's code was published June 10 for the open - source Metasploit hacking toolkit probably was also a factor , said Storms in an instant message exchange .
" No surprise at all there , " he said .
" There is a large community of people submitting to the Metasploit project . "
Microsoft said that the current exploits work against Windows XP machines , but added that Windows Server 2003 , the other OS containing the flaw , was safe for the moment .
" Windows Server 2003 customers are not currently at risk from the Win Help issue based on the attack samples we have analyzed , " the company 's security team wrote on Twitter at 1.30 p.m. ET .
The next regularly - scheduled Microsoft security updates are to ship July 13 , but the company occasionally departs from its monthly practice with so - called " out - of - band " emergency updates .
Microsoft declined to comment on whether it would now step up its patch process to produce a fix before July 13 .
" We continue to monitor the threat landscape and will keep customers updated via our blog at and our Twitter handle , " said Bryant in an e-mail to Computerworld .

Heather Graham spent the weekend with her boyfriend at the beach in Ischia , Italy , and thanks to her rolling around with her legs spread this description does n’t exactly have to be theater of the mind .
Why ca n’t you keep your legs closed , Heather ?

Today , an 800 - pound virtual gorilla is going to help you get in shape .
Everybody has played the original Donkey Kong at one point or another , right ?
If you have n’t , here ’s the premise : Donkey Kong has kidnapped the princess , and it ’s your job as Mario to climb up ladders and over obstacles until you reach the top of the level where she ’s being held captive .
If you have no idea what I ’m talking about , take 30 seconds to watch this video , and then join the conversation .
Who ’s your princess ?
Mario is constantly risking life and limb to scale a treacherous obstacle course , climbing faulty ladders , dodging rolling barrels , and escaping pesky flames .
Why ?
Because his lady friend has been captured by an damn dirty ape and he is her only hope of survival !
If you were put in Mario ’s comically oversized boots , I bet you would do the same thing .
Take a look at your life and your quest for health : who is your “ princess ? ”
Why do you want to get in shape ?
If you say “ why not ! ” or “ my friend told me to , ” you probably wo n’t be jumping through hoops or over barrels to get there anytime soon .
Now , if you said , “ because I want to grow old with my wife ” or “ because my father died of heart failure at 53 , and I want to actually see my kids grow up , ” I bet you ’ll actually take steps to turn your life around .
It does n’t have to be this serious either : maybe your motivation is “ I want to impress the cute waitress at the coffee shop and I know she works out ” or “ I want to look in the mirror and be proud of what I see . ”
Whatever your “ princess ” is , keep that in your mind every day , especially on days when you feel like sleeping in / pigging out / doing nothing .
Secondly , do you have a set goal ?
Mario ’s girlfriend was waiting at the top of the level , which meant Mario had a specific challenge to accomplish to rescue her .
What are your specific goals ?
Lose 95 pounds .
Run 3 marathons in 2010 .
Bench press 200 pounds 5 times .
Get down to a 34 - inch waist .
Depending on how far away you are from your goal at the start , the longer and more perilous the level might be .
No matter how far away that goal is however , as long as it ’s in your mind and SPECIFIC , you ’ll remember why you ’re going through all this trouble and you ’ll know how much further you need to go .
Barrels and Hammers
Mario ’s journey from the bottom of the screen to the top is no cakewalk .
He ’s got all kinds of garbage to contend with , including barrels hurled with ferocity by our furry villain .
Fortunately , Mario ’s quite the acrobatic plumber , and provided he ’s paying attention he can leap over these rolling barrels with ease .
Of course , he can also grab a super hammer instead , turning temporarily invisible and whacking the hell out of those things .
What are the barrels in your life ?
These are the obstacles that have derailed your previous weight loss efforts and will threaten to do so again if you ’re not prepared .
Let ’s see if any of this sounds familiar :
1 ) Extra difficult project at work .
In the past , these stressful times at work are a reason to say “ hell with it ” and order pizza , hit up Taco Bell for fourth meal , and generally completely disregard your own well - being while putting the company first .
Jump –
Although it ’s difficult , find a way to eat sensibly while going out for food during these few bad days and make a pact to get right back on the train once the workload slows down .
You also de -stress by going for a brisk walk every few hours to clear your mind .
– Although it ’s difficult , find a way to eat sensibly while going out for food during these few bad days and make a pact to get right back on the train once the workload slows down .
You also de -stress by going for a brisk walk every few hours to clear your mind .
Hammer –
In anticipation of a rough work week , you fire up a bunch of grilled chicken and cut up a bunch of veggies on Sunday night so you have all meals ready for the week .
You deftly avoid the vending machines and instead chomp down on a healthy snack brought from home .
Recognizing the importance of a clear mind , you still find time to exercise and come back to your desk refreshed .
2 ) 3 - day holiday weekend .
Ugh .
A million beers , six dozen hot wings , a truckload of hamburgers , and a pallet full of Ruffles have all been invited to a party in your stomach .
Jump –
You know that a long weekend is coming up , so you eat extra diligently for the days leading up to it .
A few days off the wagon are n’t enough to sabotage your adventure , and you get right back on track when the holiday is over .

Hammer –
It ’s a weekend in the US , which means there ’s probably a fun race going on that morning .
Instead of sleeping in , you sign up for the race , maybe raise some money for a good cause , and get something accomplished before you would even normally wake up !
That runner ’s high carries you through the rest of the day while you enjoy some beers and surprisingly decent eating .
3 ) Freak snowstorm .
Aw crap , you were going to go to the gym today , but there ’s now eighteen inches of snow on the ground .
Oh well , looks like you now have the perfect excuse to lie the couch , eat Oreos , and watch a marathon of America ’s Funniest Home Videos , right ?
Fail .
Jump – Just because you ’re stuck inside does n’t mean you have to put your life on hold .
Go about your normal routine , do a kick ass body weight exercise routine inside , and take care of business .
– Just because you ’re stuck inside does n’t mean you have to put your life on hold .
Go about your normal routine , do a kick ass body weight exercise routine inside , and take care of business .
Hammer – Screw the gym and pretend like you ’re recreating the training montage from Rocky IV : go shovel the driveway , chop some wood , and climb a freaking mountain while screaming the name of your arch rival .
Our lives are full of these barrels .
Identify yours and have a game plan for how you ’re going to deal with them .
Be prepared , plan ahead , and then either jump over them or hammer the hell out of them .
What happens if you get hit by one ?
Sh ** happens , and every now and again you ’ll get hit .
We ’re all human , and this game of life is n’t easy .
Fortunately , unless you literally got run over by a barrel , you ’re probably okay to get up and try again ( wooo extra lives ! ) .
So you ate like a pig , drank like a fish , and exercised less than Jabba the Hutt , WHO CARES .
Set your alarm for 7 AM the next morning , get your ass out of bed , and get back on track .
That princess is n’t going to save herself .
The flames
As Mario is climbing the level , dodging barrels , grabbing hammers , and scaling ladders , there ’s this little rinky - dink flame hanging out at the bottom .
It ’s slow and clumsy , but it will eventually catch up to Mario should he become complacent and not advance further .
That flame is chasing you too .
Standing still and jumping over obstacles as they come to you can only take you so far – it ’s time to make some progress .
Be stronger and faster today than you were yesterday – find a way to lift one extra pound , do one extra rep , and be one second faster .
Always be leveling up , and always be moving forward .
How ’s your game of life going ?
This is the part where we all help each other win .
Who ’s your “ princess , ” what are your barrels , and how do jump / hammer them ?
Leave your advice for others in the comments !

AT&T is a very large , very old company .
It ’s so old , it has the stock ticker symbol “ T ” .
That ’s right , just “ T ” .
It ’s so large , the US government tried to break it up into a half dozen smaller companies 25 years ago , and ultimately failed .
But history is filled with very large , very old institutions that eventually failed : the Roman empire , the Dutch East India company , and the Atlantic slave trade , to name a few .
Recently I bought an HTC Evo ( Android ) on the Sprint network .
My plan was to try it for a few weeks , and if the battery life was as bad as some reviews said it was , or the coverage was as bad as AT&T ’s , I would return it .
I ’ve barely had the thing for 48 hours and I can’t imagine going back .
More than half of my joy is the phone itself .
The iPhone has always been a step backward , since its crippled OS means it ca n’t run a decent SSH terminal or chat client – two of my three primary uses for a mobile device .
( It has a great browser , though . )
The newly - named iOS 4 does n’t fix that .
We ’ve had multi-tasking on phones since 2002 , but Apple ca n’t seem to get it working on hardware that laptops barely had in 2002 .
The Evo evokes a sense of wonder and infinite possibilities , not too different from how it felt as a child to play with a computer for the first time .
Unlike the fortress - like atmosphere of an iPhone , the Android OS suggests that if you can think of something to try , it might just work .
For example , I browsed to a website offering an mp3 , and clicked on the link just to see what would happen .
The song started downloading !
It showed up in the music player !
I could listen to music on the internet without going through the tedious process of docking and syncing with a laptop !
Apple is not trying for this market , though .
They ’re aiming to be a shinier , more expensive RAZR ; a consumer phone that ca n’t do much , but can do it very well .
And they ’re very successful at it , to gauge from their sales numbers .
Very , very successful .
The iPhone is probably the most popular phone in the world .
People stood in line 14 hours this week to purchase a modest upgrade .
If , say , a cellphone carrier were able to get an exclusive contract for selling the iPhone for the first five years of its meteoric rise , that carrier might very well make bank .
They could become larger than all the other carriers combined !
They could add extra fees for the privilege of having an iPhone , and expand their reach and coverage to hitherto unknown extent .
AT&T has this exclusive contract , and they have the privilege fees .
But they have n’t expanded their coverage or their reach .
They have n’t done anything , as far as I can tell , except shovel wheelbarrows full of money into a Scrooge McDuck vault somewhere , while their name & brand have become a joke .
Whatever else AT&T did in the past , they now represent only “ incompetent wireless provider ” in the mind of the consumer .
How did this happen ?
I live in the second - most densely populated city in the US , with 6,700 people per square kilometer .
In the three years I ’ve been using AT&T ’s cell network , they have not managed to make a single improvement to their abyssmal coverage .
Entire neighborhoods , including popular ones like the Haight and the Mission , are giant dead zones .
My friends and I regularly use Skype to make voice calls , out of necessity .
If you ca n’t cover the end of a peninsula 10 km on a side , something is seriously wrong .
The only rational explanation is that AT&T is not trying .
One excuse often offered is that “ cities are hard to cover ” .
Sorry , I ’m not buying it .
If the task is difficult , we ’d be seeing progress , but slowly .
Seeing no progress means the task is either impossible or is n’t being attempted .
Since Sprint and Verizon are able to provide excellent coverage , I guess it ’s not impossible .
So , again , AT&T is not trying .
In fact , their coverage situation is dire throughout the bay area of California .
Why would they care to provide coverage to the bay area , though ?
Aside from it being the home of Apple and 7.4 million people , there ’s a really good PR reason why they might want to step up their game here .
It ’s the home of nearly every tech pundit and blogger on the net .
AT&T could improve coverage in every other part of the US , and still get a continuous stream of bad press about their network , because these journalists ca n’t make a phone call .
It ’s so self - destructive , it ’s mind - boggling .
Apple seems to have given up on AT&T .
Their latest new features , like video chat , wo n’t even try to use AT&T ’s network .
They ’re just hoping that you ’ll be in wifi coverage most of the time .
And sales of the wifi-only model of the iPad imply that a wifi- only iPhone would probably sell as well as the AT&T one .
All this money in the bank wo n’t save AT&T any more than it saved Microsoft .
And it wo n’t buy them happiness – ask Scrooge McDuck about that .
It might have bought them a future , but it ’s probably too late even for that , now .
It does n’t matter anymore , though .
Yesterday , from my Evo , I sent a text message from my bedroom !
The future is now !
Getting Kind of Heavy : World ’s First Map of Earth ’s Gravity
This map may be one of the most amazing and unique images ever created of Earth .
Using just two months of data , a gravity - measuring satellite made the first map of Earth ’s gravitational field .
It ’s a surprising and beautiful image of a force that we would never expect to be able to see – and yes , different places on Earth experience different gravitational pulls .
The map is technically known as a geoid , and it was created by the satellite known as GOCE : Gravity field and steady - state Ocean Circulation Explorer .
The satellite takes precise measurements of the Earth ’s gravitational field from an orbit so low that it nearly falls out of the sky .
The geoid is basically a level which measures even the smallest changes in the Earth ’s gravitational field .
The resulting map is what the oceans would look like if there were no tides , no current , no wind and no temperature changes .
Because of this , the geoid will be useful to oceanographers who are studying the effects of those factors on the world ’s oceans .
But it can also be used for a huge number of other applications , including predicting volcanoes and earthquakes , assisting engineers who are designing buildings , and simply gaining a better understanding of our planet ’s gravity .
The ESA expects that the satellite will be able to continue its mission until at least 2014 .

Andrew Breitbart , the blogger who helped destroy ACORN with heavily edited , racially tinged videos ( the unedited versions of which have still not been released ) , just scored another victory over reverse racism , proving once and for all that it ’s just like old - fashioned , regular racism : when it occurs , it ’s always a black person who suffers .
Ad Policy
If you need to search for culprits in the railroading of USDA worker Shirley Sherrod , Breitbart is the obvious heel , but hardly the only one .
( Tip to kids who live in Ag Sec Tom Vilsack ’s neighborhood : this Halloween , dress up like Glenn Beck , and the Vilsack household wo n’t just give you all the candy you want , they ’ll shoot the family dog and cook it up for you . )
The real creeps are anyone in the media who excuses or erases the role played by Breitbart , Fox News , and the Tea Party blogosphere in smearing Sherrod as a racist .
I say that because , once the full video had proven that Sherrod was not shooting off bigoted remarks but actually explaining how she overcame her own bias against whites ( and after the white farmer ’s wife had confirmed that Sherrod saved the family farm from auction and was a “ friend for life ” ) , the right - wing media turned on a dime and gave us nine cents change .
Following Breibart ’s lead , the winger media began parroting the line that the controversy was n’t about Breitbart or Sherrod herself but about the NAACP calling the Tea Party racist , and about NAACP members laughing when Sherrod said she had been tempted to do the wrong thing .
To do that , they had to write Breitbart out of the story .
The villains , they insist , are the NAACP and the Obama administration : those two organizations — both headed by African - Americans , BTW — fell for some silly ol ’ video and beat up on Sherrod , who the right is now trying to claim as their sister in victimhood .
As conservative David Frum writes :
There will be not even a flutter of interest among conservatives in discussing Breitbart ’s role .
By the morning of July 21 , the Fox & Friends morning show could devote a segment to the Sherrod case without so much as a mention of Breitbart ’s role .
The central fact of the Sherrod story has been edited out of the conservative narrative , just as it was edited out of the tape itself .
It ’s true that the NAACP and Vilsack acted like Pavlovian dogs , conditioned to cower before endlessly replayed video on rightwing TeeVee .
But the overreactions on the left and on the right are in no way equal .
NAACP head Ben Jealous made a heartfelt and cogent apology for allowing himself to be “ snookered ” into throwing Sherrod under the bus ; Vilsack not only offered Sherrod an apology and her job back , he tried to get her to accept some sort of promotion , apparently to help clear the massive overhang of minority lawsuits against the agriculture department left over from the Bush years .
On the other hand , on the basis of the edited tape , Beck bashed Sherrod as a reverse racist on his morning radio show ( " Have we suddenly transported into 1956 , except it ’s the other way around ? ” he queried ) .
Later that afternoon , as word of the full video was coming out , he defended her on his Fox show , bashing anyone ( though not himself or Breitbart ) who was stupid enough to take her speech out of context .
At the same time , he kept hurling reverse racism charges , asking , " When was the last time the NAACP did n’t give someone the benefit of the doubt right away who was African - American ? ”
As for Breitbart , well , he ’s still being reverse - whipped on his reverse - plantation , crying out in anguish , “ How long , O Lord ? ”
Last night on John King show , Breitbart did n’t so much defend the cleverly edited smear he ’d promoted as try to change the subject , harping repeatedly on videos that he insists “ prove beyond a shadow of a doubt ” that the Congressional Black Caucus members who said they were called the N - word at a Capitol Hill Tea Party rally back in March are lying to make the TP look racist .
( Here are the videos and they prove nothing . )
More weirdly , Breitbart suggested that Sherrod was hoodwinking CNN , asking King , “ You ’re going off of her word that the farmer ’s wife is the farmer ’s wife . ”
Let ’s be clear about the media hoopla over reverse racism this past month , from Rush Limbaugh ’s claim that Obama is causing high unemployment as a “ payback ” for black slavery to Michelle Bachmann ’s assertion that Obama is creating “ a nation of slaves ” to Fox host Megyn Kelly ’s eye - popping claims that the New Black Panther Party is somehow immune to prosecution by the Obama justice department :
We are not in a race relations crisis .
We are in an economic crisis .
And these manufactured racial melodramas are meant to frighten Vilsackian Democrats to never dare do anything that might ruffle Tea Party feathers , like push through a desperately needed second stimulus or nominate Elizabeth Warren as head of the consumer protection agency .
As Shirley Sherrod said in her speech , “ It ’s not about black and white , it ’s about poor versus rich , and how the system works to keep it that way … .
“ [ Historically , dividing the races had been ] working so well , they said , Gosh , looks like we ’ve come up on something here that can last generations — and here we are .
Over 400 years later , and it ’s still working .
What we have to do is get that out of our heads .
There is no difference between us .
The only difference is that the folks with money want to stay in power and whether it ’s health care or whatever it is , they ’ll do what they need to do to keep that power . ”
Somehow , that part of her speech did n’t get much play on Fox .
WASHINGTON , DC— In an effort to make America 's natural wonders available to all citizens , the Department of the Interior announced Monday the creation of a $ 2 million National Parks Website .
ParkNet , the new national parks website .
Advertisement
The new website clears the way for the wholesale development of the parks : Next Monday , bulldozers will begin leveling more than 100,000 square miles of pristine , federally protected national parkland , finally making it available for industrial use .
Jack Holm , designer of the website , believes nature lovers will find it superior to the real parks in every way .
" You will experience the same grand mountains , lush grass and wide variety of fauna , without ever leaving your home , " he said .
" And when you spot an animal on your cyber - tour , like a majestic elk , you can click on the elk and access information about its habitat and diet .
Elks in the wild do not offer this option . "
Advertisement
The website , located at www.natparks.gov, will feature 72 pixels - per-inch photos of parks and " hyper text " on the parks ' histories and wildlife .
It will also offer camping options , with which visitors can set up a " virtual campsite " inside a national park and watch a quick - time movie of the setting sun while RealAudio playback of crickets and coyotes runs at 44.1 kilohertz .
" We digitally enhanced actual recordings of coyotes from Arizona 's Saguaro National Park , " Holm said .
" It should sound better than the real thing . "

According to National Parks Destruction Chief Lew Hoffson , countless grizzlies , moose and bison will be incinerated when the 750,000 - acre Yellowstone National Park is slash - burned to make room for what he says will be the nation 's largest factory outlet mall .
" Yellowstone , like the other national parks , has proven to be a huge financial burden to taxpayers , costing more than $ 200 million a year to maintain , " Hoffson said .
" The new Yellowstone Factory Shoppes , on the other hand , are privately funded and should be immensely profitable right from the word go .
It just makes sense . "
Advertisement
The economic advantage of massive , unregulated development of the parks was only one reason for the website move .
Safety was also a factor .
" Every year , between 30 to 40 national parks visitors are killed in accidents , ranging from animal attacks to falls off cliffs , " Holm said .
" The website will be far safer , with the greatest danger posed to visitors being possible neck and back strain from prolonged sitting at the computer station . "
To avoid such discomfort when visiting the new cyber - parks , Holm strongly advised taking a " stretch break " every 15 to 20 minutes .
Advertisement
Yet another advantage of web - based camping will be the chance for visitors to enjoy interacting with talking , anthropomorphic wildlife , such as PC Puffin , a friendly , wise - cracking aquatic cartoon bird who gives visitors tours of Alaska 's Denali National Park .
" Non -cyber - parks do not feature puffin - led tours , for in real life animals do not talk , " Holm said .
U.S. Parks Department officials said the department is also planning an endangered - species website , enabling people to observe and study rare species on their computers .
Once the website is up and running , the actual endangered animals will either be allowed to die out naturally in captivity or be killed off wholesale by poachers .

U.S. Sen. Spencer Abraham ( R - MI ) , who sponsored the legislation , said that he and his family are planning a trip to the National Parks website this July .
" We 've never been to Yellowstone , " he said , " and I understand we 'll be able to download a sound effect of hot , splashing water digitally recorded right at Old Faithful .
We 're very excited . "

ALMOST EVERYTHING
you need to know about the warped priorities of capitalism is contained in the following contradiction : Unprecedented national resources were marshaled to fight a war for oil in the Persian Gulf , yet an oil spill on our doorstep in the Gulf of Mexico is left to gush for weeks .
Two months into the disastrous spill from the Deepwater Horizon well , and BP is still clueless about what to do , as it announces one half - baked plan after another and is essentially allowed to get on with it .
But as Joseph Romm pointed out on his Climate Progress blog , " spill " hardly describes what 's going on .
People " spill " coffee , but hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil pouring into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of perhaps 100,000 barrels a day is n't really the same thing .
A volcano of oil seems a more appropriate term .
BP 's ineptitude in stopping the flow of oil contrasts sharply with its astounding technological ability to discover and drill for more .
In September of last year , BP stocks rose when the company discovered a " massive " new oilfield in the Gulf .
Oil gushing from the broken BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig
But the unfolding catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico is far more than an indictment of BP , Transocean and Halliburton -- though the CEOs of those companies should certainly be facing trial for criminal negligence and manslaughter .
Government regulation of the industry by the Interior Department 's Mineral Management Service ( MMS ) does n't even deserve the word " oversight . "
And with President Barack Obama announcing that he would open the whole east coast and the Alaska coast to offshore drilling , it 's obvious the responsibility lies with government , too .
Ultimately , however , this is about the priorities of the capitalist system itself .
The drive for profit ensured that these different economic , governmental and political actors felt compelled to take appalling decisions -- treating human life as disposable while demonstrating the most callous contempt for the environment .
As Bob Herbert commented in the New York Times :
The fact that 11 human beings were killed in the Deepwater Horizon explosion ( their bodies never found ) has become , at best , an afterthought .
BP counts its profits in the billions , and , therefore , it 's important .
The 11 men working on the rig were no more important in the current American scheme of things than the oystermen losing their livelihoods along the Gulf , or the wildlife doomed to die in an environment fouled by BP 's oil , or the waters that will be left unfit for ordinary families to swim and boat in .
This is the bitter reality of the American present , a period in which big business has cemented an unholy alliance with big government against the interests of ordinary Americans , who , of course , are the great majority of Americans .
The great majority of Americans no longer matter .
THE BASIC story is this : BP , Transocean and Halliburton saw a legitimate ( by capitalist standards ) source of profit maximization .
These corporations were then encouraged to cut corners on health , safety and environmental regulations by a government agency that they knew was never going to call them to account .
They were given further encouragement by a supposedly " environment - conscious " president who had just authorized virtually unlimited offshore drilling , declaring a few weeks before the disaster , " It turns out , by the way , that oil rigs today generally do n't cause spills .
They are technologically very advanced . "
The more that is uncovered about the situation , the more despicable it appears .
Most of the oil that spewed into the Gulf is still below the surface .
Scientists have reported giant plumes of oil underwater , running up to 10 miles long by 3 miles wide by 300 feet thick .
Apart from the cancer - causing nature of many of the compounds in the oil in the first place , these concentrations are going to deplete oxygen from the water and create massive dead zones in the Gulf , toxic to all aquatic life that depends on oxygen .
Furthermore , BP has so far put almost a million gallons of toxic dispersant into the Gulf .
The dispersant it has been using , Corexit , has been shown to be less effective and more toxic than alternatives .
But it 's cheaper -- and , lo and behold , it 's manufactured by a company called Nalco , which has an ex-BP member on its board .
Corexit has never been used in such quantities before -- which prompted Environmental Protection Agency head Lisa Jackson to say : " I 'm amazed by how little science there is on this issue . "
As Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler asked during congressional hearings : " Why would you use something that is much more toxic and much less effective , other than you have a corporate relationship with the manufacturer ? "
A number of experts now believe that BP , in its effort just to disperse the oil on the surface so it does n't provide a photo opportunity for the media , may be making the problem worse .
Dispersants are mutagenic , carcinogenic and toxic .
They break the oil up into droplets the same size as the food particles ingested by filter feeders such as oyster and shrimp , which will therefore treat the oil drops as food .
Nobody has any idea what the outcome of this experiment on ocean life in the Gulf will be , but I think it 's fair to say it wo n't be good .
As Carys Mitchelmore of the University of Maryland 's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory commented : " Fish can ingest oil particles that then stick to their gills .
It 's like coating our lungs in oil .
They are n't going to breathe too well , and we would n't either . "
What kind of environment is BP pouring oil and dispersants into ?
Nearly three - quarters of all U.S. waterfowl and all of its 110 species of migratory neo-tropical songbirds use Louisiana 's 3 million acres of wetlands to rest or nest .
During the first two weeks of May , 25 million songbirds cross the Gulf every day .
This is also the most vital season for the Gulf 's fisheries -- oysters have just started to reproduce , speckled brown trout have started spawning , shrimp have just begun to grow .
Nine out of 10 of the region 's marine species rely on the wetlands at some point in their lifecycle .
These areas comprise 40 percent of the country 's total wetlands , and Louisiana produces more fish and seafood than any other state except Alaska .
Fishing is now banned over one - third of the Gulf .
According to Professor Robert Thomas of New Orleans ' Loyola University : " Worst - case scenarios almost never happen .
In this case , almost everyone I have known with technical knowledge of oil spills -- the people who have worked in the industry for 30 , 40 years -- say it is upon us .
Others talks of a ' Gulf Coast Chernobyl . ' "
WHAT ABOUT all those fail - safe devices that were supposed to kick in and stop a catastrophe like this from happening in the first place ?
With all its cost - cutting and nickel - and - diming on safety , BP seems to have almost gone out of its way to make sure this was an accident waiting to happen .
According to testimony before Congress , the so - called blowout preventers , which were supposed to be the last - ditch mechanism against an explosion on the Deepwater rig , had 260 ways they could fail .
As Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak asked at the hearings : " How can a device that has 260 failure modes be considered fail - safe ? "
When did BP and other operators know that there were problems with the blowout preventers ?
Ten years ago .
In 2000 , the Interior Department 's MMS published a report warning that there were several difficulties connected to deepwater well control , and that a blowout could be " a potential show - stopper . "
Until 10 years ago , drilling for oil so deep -- the Deepwater Horizon well lies more than a mile below the surface - - was virtually unheard of .
To give people an idea of how deep this is , naval submarines can't go below 900 yards because they are crushed by the water pressure .
Where BP is drilling is more than 1,500 yards beneath the surface .
Four years after that first warning , in 2004 , the MMS had a report prepared which concluded that while drilling technology had advanced , safety technology had stagnated -- it again highlighted blowout control as a particular concern .
In 2008 , the Society of Petroleum Engineers warned in a report that the blowout preventers might not be able to cut through the drill pipe in the event of a deepwater blowout .
The report 's authors included people working for Transocean and BP .
Between 1992 and 1998 , there were 319 failures of blowout preventers found in U.S. offshore drilling , an average of 45 a year .
Between 1992 and 2006 , there were at least 39 blowouts off the U.S. coastline , 38 of them in the Gulf of Mexico .
Meanwhile , the spill response plan that BP filed with the MMS -- and which the MMS approved -- had the most idiotic mistakes .
It declared that in the event of a spill , BP would consult with a local expert who had been dead for several years , and it cited the need to protect animals such as walruses and seals -- which , of course , have n't been seen within hundreds of miles of the Gulf since the last Ice Age , but which do inhabit Alaska , suggesting that the company simply copied its disaster plan for another part of the world .
Despite this , MMS issued BP with a " categorical exclusion " from all environmental reviews under the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act .
These exclusions are only meant to occur when projects are likely to have minimal or nonexistent environmental damage .
Hundreds of these waivers have been handed out by MMS for Gulf drilling operations .
Two years ago , MMS itself was investigated by the Interior Department for its " too cozy " relationship with the oil industry .
Earl Devaney , the Interior Department inspector general who oversaw the investigation , found a culture of corruption in which employees rigged contracts , engaged in illegal moonlighting , took gifts from oil company employees , and engaged in sex and drug parties with oil executives .
MMS was described in the Interior Department 's report as an " ethical wasteland . "
President Obama and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar promised to clean up the department , but instead kept on a host of officials from the Bush era and allowed the corruption to continue .
According to a shocking investigative report in Rolling Stone by Tim Dickenson :
Salazar did little to tamp down on the lawlessness at MMS , beyond referring a few employees for criminal prosecution and ending a Bush - era program that allowed oil companies to make their " royalty " payments -- the amount they owe taxpayers for extracting a scarce public resource -- not in cash but in crude .
And instead of putting the brakes on new offshore drilling , Salazar immediately throttled it up to record levels .
Even though he had scrapped the Bush plan , Salazar put 53 million offshore acres up for lease in the Gulf in his first year alone -- an all - time high .
The aggressive leasing came as no surprise , given Salazar 's track record .
" This guy has a long , long history of promoting offshore oil drilling -- that 's his thing , " says Kierán Suckling , executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity .
" He 's got a highly specific soft spot for offshore oil drilling . "
As a senator , Salazar not only steered passage of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act , which opened 8 million acres in the Gulf to drilling , he even criticized President Bush for not forcing oil companies to develop existing leases faster .
SINCE THE explosion , government agencies and officials have worked in tandem with BP to hide the true extent of the spill from the world .
Dickenson continued :
[ T ]he disaster in the Gulf was preceded by ample warnings -- yet the administration had ignored them .
Instead of cracking down on MMS , as he had vowed to do even before taking office , Obama left in place many of the top officials who oversaw the agency 's culture of corruption .
He permitted it to rubber - stamp dangerous drilling operations by BP - - a firm with the worst safety record of any oil company -- with virtually no environmental safeguards , using industry - friendly regulations drafted during the Bush years .
He calibrated his response to the Gulf spill based on flawed and misleading estimates from BP -- and then deployed his top aides to lowball the flow rate at a laughable 5,000 barrels a day , long after the best science made clear this catastrophe would eclipse the Exxon Valdez .
Within hours of the explosion , government scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were privately estimating oil flow rates of 64,000 to 110,000 barrels per day , even as federal officials publicly said the rate was only 1,000 5,000 barrels per day .
This should therefore be seen as a national political scandal -- our elected government sought to deceive the public about the extent of the crisis .
This deception reached absurd lengths .
According to the New York Times : " Anderson Cooper of CNN complained about seemingly ridiculous efforts to control the story , including the fact that rescued oil - covered birds were being guarded and hidden from view by members of the National Guard . "
Imagine if the collusion between the government and BP to manage the news and minimize the scale of the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf had been exposed when George W. Bush was still president ?
The level of anger and outrage from liberal groups and large environmental organizations would have been on a vastly different scale .
But so far , despite a significant drop in his popularity overall , Obama and the government are not being held accountable in the way they certainly deserve .
That was a point made by Arizona Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva , who oversees the Interior Department as chair of the House Subcommittee on National Parks , Forests and Public Lands :
People are being really circumspect , not pointing the finger at Salazar and Obama ...
But the troublesome point is , the administration knew that it had this rot in the middle of the process on offshore drilling -- yet it empowered an already discredited , disgraced agency to essentially be in charge .
Still , anger from ordinary people toward Obama 's lack of action and the long delay in holding BP 's feet to the fire is on the rise .
One sign appearing in Louisiana captures the mood perfectly : " President Obama , BP stole my money .
Where 's my change ? "
The parallels with the recent mining disaster at the Upper Big Branch mine in April that killed 29 miners are striking .
At that time , Don Blankenship , CEO of Massey Energy , told ABC News : " We have lots of regulators in the industry , probably more regulators in the coal industry than any other industry in the country , and the Mine Safety and Health Administration , the state agencies , all the safety people we have on hand felt this was a safe coal mine ... At the Massey level , we 're doing everything we can to make all of our mines as safe as we can . "
In reality , Blankenship is an infamous global warming denier and his company is also a serial breaker of health and safety regulations .
The lax oversight and disregard for the welfare of its workers at the Upper Big Branch mine is a mirror image of BP 's efforts to maximize profits over all other concerns .
Since 1995 , Massey has been cited for 3,007 safety violations and more than $ 2.2 million in fines , most of which it has contested .
When Massey is n't blowing the top off the last remaining mountains in central Appalachia , the company 's burying miners underneath them .
But that coal disaster , the worst in the U.S. in years , has barely affected the practice of any mine operator .
A crackdown in May by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration produced almost 1,500 citations at 56 underground mines in nine states .
Assistant Labor Secretary Joe Main , head of the mine - safety agency , said : " After last month 's tragic reminder of the consequences of failing to make safety a priority , it is appalling that these operations continued to flout fundamental safety and health standards . "
We have to ask , why are n't these mine operators on their way to jail ?
What unites these companies ?
According to the laws of capitalism , BP was acting perfectly rationally .
The company needs to maximize profits , and this compulsion , dictated by the iron laws of capitalist competition , will always conflict with environmental concerns or the health and safety of workers .
Trying to cut corners , lying and cheating are not aberrations of capitalist development unique to a few large and irresponsible oil and coal companies .
They are ingrained in the system .
The whole purpose of any capitalist entity is to make money and make more money faster than any other competing company .
The fact that the pattern is almost identical in the case of BP and Massey - - massive corporations relentlessly hunting for extra profits , lax government oversight and little sign of a political challenge - - requires us to examine the systemic nature of the problem , which is at the root of the global ecological crisis itself .
WHAT SHOULD a rising movement for justice for the Gulf fight for ?
Here are some suggestions :
An immediate halt to all deep - water drilling .
It 's clear that drilling so deep underwater is impossible to make safe ; we should therefore not do it .
We need to send a signal to the world and corporations that the U.S. is finally going to wean itself from oil .
For all the talk about the need to drill pretty much everywhere , the reality is that half of all oil recovered from the Gulf of Mexico is exported , giving the lie to the idea that these wells are making the U.S. energy - independent .
While Obama has declared a moratorium on new exploratory drilling , this only affects 33 deepwater sites -- less than 1 percent of the 5,106 drilling operations in the Gulf , and around 5 percent in deepwater areas .
We need to shut down the other 591 immediately , create jobs to re-employ all laid - off workers , and phase out offshore drilling altogether .
However , Ken Salazar has made it clear that this is not part of the Obama plan .
In congressional testimony in June , he made sure to emphasize that deepwater drilling will continue , saying , " It was the president 's directive that we press the pause button ...
It 's important for all of you on this committee to know that word - - it 's the pause button .
It 's not the stop button . "
Immediate recruiting of tens of thousands of workers , especially those laid off due to closure of fishing areas or the ban on oil drilling , to aid with clean - up efforts in the Gulf .
These workers should be paid by BP at the same rate they were formerly paid .
Immediate removal of BP from control and oversight of media operations and any spill response outside of BP 's efforts to contain the spill itself .
This is , in fact , required by federal law .
The federal National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan states that corporations cannot be in charge of spill response on this magnitude and mandates the government to take control to " direct all federal , state or private actions " and clean up a spill " where a discharge or threat of discharge poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States . "
An independent investigation of the government 's response to the spill .
There should be possible criminal charges or other sanctions against those found who obstructed a realistic assessment of the catastrophe or allowed BP and other oil companies to continue with their reckless practices .
A comprehensive energy bill .
This legislation must reject the compromises and false solutions proposed by Sens.
John Kerry and Joe Lieberman and encapsulated in the proposed American Power Act , and instead favor a massive jobs program based on energy conservation , public transit infrastructure and the construction of a new electricity grid that can utilize renewable energies , such as wind , solar and geothermal .
Such legislation could be financed by raising the top tax rate on individuals and taxes on corporations , plus a new tax on financial transactions carried out by Wall Street .
Another necessary measure would be to reverse the billions of dollars in subsidies going to fossil fuel - based and nuclear energy production and biofuels , and direct them toward the expansion of renewable sources of energy , infrastructure and the necessary jobs to build the new infrastructure .
Obama went for expanding offshore drilling as a concession to try to win the support of Democrats and " moderate " Republicans for climate legislation .
That backfired stupendously -- Republicans are completely uninterested in a rational energy plan for the U.S.
The more concessions that Obama makes to the right , the more the right will howl for more .
It 's time to stop making concessions to the right .
The only way that will happen is if a grassroots movement puts more pressure from Obama from the left .

The Chinese Premier , Wen Jiabao , has said that China will continue to invest in European markets , despite the debt problems affecting many eurozone countries .
He was speaking in Beijing alongside the German Chancellor , Angela Merkel .
She described his pledge as an important signal that China has confidence in the euro .
British Foreign Secretary William
Hague also met Mr
Wen this week and called for closer investment ties .
Mrs Merkel is in China with a delegation of German business leaders .
She called for greater openness in the Chinese economy , saying that German companies would like to have the same level of access to China that Chinese firms already enjoy in Germany .
Strong signal
Mrs Merkel said she had used her meetings with the Chinese to press them to open their economy further to foreign companies .
The pledge from the Chinese premier that China would continue to invest its reserves in European markets - now and in the future - was an important signal , the German chancellor said , that China had confidence in the euro .
That confidence has been shaken by the European sovereign debt crisis .
Europe is a key export market for Chinese manufacturers .
They are concerned that Europe 's problems could reduce demand for their goods , just as their own businesses start to recover .
China has signed deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars with Greek shipbuilding and construction firms to help Greece overcome its debt crisis .
Mrs Merkel said she had emphasised to Mr Wen Germany 's desire to see China introduce greater openness into its economy .
Mr Wen also said China would stick with policies that cooled economic growth in China in the last quarter .
Figures released on Thursday showed that Chinese GDP growth slipped from 11.9 % to 10.3 % in the last three months .
President Obama and Senate Democrats agreed on Tuesday to a three - bill agenda that they believe will strengthen their party for November ’s midterm elections .
Democrats agreed to send the Wall Street reform conference report , an extension of unemployment benefits and legislation bolstering credit for small businesses to Obama ’s desk in the next two weeks .

They calculate that all three bills fit the party ’s campaign narrative that Democrats are standing up for working people while Republicans act for Wall Street and corporate interests .
The three - bill agenda also embraces the notion that politics is the art of the possible , for the party appears to have the votes to pass these pieces of legislation .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidMeeting Trump Supreme
Court pick a bridge too far for some Democrats GOP senators confident Trump pick to be confirmed by November Durbin : Democrats can ' slow ' Supreme Court confirmation ' perhaps a matter of hours , maybe days at most ' MORE ( D - Nev. ) announced that the Senate will take up energy legislation before the August recess , but it is far from clear whether that bill will reach Obama ’s desk .
Energy and climate legislation was not discussed Tuesday in a meeting between Obama and a group of Senate Democrats at the White House .
Senators acknowledge that once members return from recess on Sept. 13 , little legislating will be possible before the election .
That leaves Senate Democrats with four crucial weeks to build a legislative message to voters .
They also expect to win confirmation of Obama ’s second pick for the Supreme Court , Solicitor General Elena Kagan , and move an emergency spending bill for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars .
But it is the three business bills that they see buttressing party chances this fall .
At his daily briefing , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said voters would get a clear choice between the parties on the three issues and cast the GOP as opposed to helping the long - term unemployed ; opposed to creating new rules in response to the financial crisis ; and opposed to increasing lending to small businesses .
“ Whether it is small - business lending or there ’s unemployment or whether it is financial reform , I think the message is going to be fairly clear , ” Gibbs said a few hours after Senate Democrats left their agenda meeting with the president .
The meeting took place against the backdrop of new polls suggesting Democrats are in danger of a historic drubbing that could give Republicans power of the House and even the Senate .
Gibbs himself on Sunday acknowledged there is “ no doubt ” that Republicans are within striking distance of taking control of at least one of the chambers .
The Wall Street legislation ’s conference report is the first piece of the three - part agenda likely to reach Obama .
Reid scheduled a cloture vote for Thursday , and with Republican Sens. Scott Brown ( Mass . ) , Olympia Snowe ( Maine ) and Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsGOP senators pan debate : ' S --- show , ' ' awful , ' ' embarrassment ' Budowsky : Senate 's Trump Republicans on trial , in trouble Senate Democrats want to avoid Kavanaugh 2.0 MORE ( Maine ) all supporting it , the regulatory overhaul is expected to pass .
Gibbs predicted that unemployment insurance benefits would come before the Senate and pass next week , leaving small - business lending as the outstanding piece of business .
Collins and Snowe voted for the unemployment legislation before the July 4 recess , and Democrats believe they will have the 60 votes needed to clear it through the Senate when West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin Joseph ( Joe ) ManchinManchin : Trump 's West Virginia ballot fraud claim ' just plain wrong ' Senate Democrats want to avoid Kavanaugh 2.0 Energy innovation bill can deliver jobs and climate progress MORE ( D ) fills his state ’s open Senate seat on Friday .
Despite rocky poll numbers , Gibbs said Democrats do n’t “ have anything to be dispirited about . ”
“ I think we can take a robust case to the American people about the steps that we ’ve taken to help this economy recover , to lay that foundation for economic growth in the long term , ” he said .
“ And I think we can have a debate about how we got into this mess , the eight years that ... produced the type of financial calamity that we dealt with .
I think that is a debate that will energize the whole of the Democratic Party . ”
Obama and Senate Democratic leaders also discussed the need to coordinate the legislative message better .
Democratic senators have been frustrated to see splits between Democrats on Capitol Hill and the administration emerge during some legislative debates .
“ We discussed a need to better coordinate our message , to simplify our message and to repeat it as much as we can , ” said one Democratic senator who was at the meeting .
A senior Democratic aide said the discussion was about “ getting on the same page so there ’s no more situations like we ’ve had . ”
The aide pointed to legislation passed by the Democrat - controlled House , which on July 1 approved a measure to fund teaching jobs by slicing $ 800 million from three of the administration ’s education initiatives .
That has drawn a veto threat from Obama .
During the debate over healthcare reform earlier this year , Democrats in both houses of Congress pushed single - payer healthcare proposals without administration support .
“ It ’s about syncing up the administration and congressional messages to make them a little tighter , ” the aide said .
“ When something is n’t echoed by the White House , it has less effect .
It ’s about reinforcement . ”

The Open Source Hardware folks are making progress toward a unified movement .
Today , they announced the first public draft of the " Open Source Hardware Definition " ( mirroring OSI 's Open Source Definition , which sets limits on what is and is n't open ) , and announced the first Open Hardware Summit in NYC for Sept 23 .
Open Source Hardware ( OSHW ) is a term for tangible artifacts — machines , devices , or other physical things — whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make , modify , distribute , and use those things .
This definition is intended to help provide guidelines for the development and evaluation of licenses for Open Source Hardware .
It is important to note that hardware is different from software in that physical resources must always be committed for the creation of physical goods .
Accordingly , persons or companies producing items ( " products " ) under an OSHW license have an obligation not to imply that such products are manufactured , sold , warrantied , or otherwise sanctioned by the original designer and also not to make use of any trademarks owned by the original designer .
The distribution terms of Open Source Hardware must comply with the following criteria :
This week , the University of California , Berkeley will mail saliva sample kits to every incoming freshman and transfer student .
Students can choose to use the kits to submit their DNA for genetic analysis , as part of an orientation program on the topic of personalized medicine .
But U.C. Berkeley is n't the only university offering its students genetic testing .
Stanford University 's summer session started two weeks ago , including a class on personal genomics that gives medical and graduate students the chance to sequence their genotypes and study the results .
The idea behind the two novel projects is that students will learn about optimizing treatment based on one 's genetic profile most effectively if they are studying their own DNA — an idea that has met with both praise for educational innovation and criticism centering on potential ethical issues .
" The concerns did not revolve around whether students should be taught about genetic testing — everyone agreed about that , " says Gilbert Chu , a Stanford professor of medicine and biochemistry .
" The concerns surround allowing students to undergo genetic tests themselves .
I do n't think it 's been an easy road to get to this , and I do n't think we know whether it 's going to be successful . "
George Annas , a bioethicist at the Boston University School of Public Health , worries that the projects are premature .
" This potentially is a model that other schools will copy .
I think it 's an innovative idea that can get students engaged , but from my perspective they are facing a very steep learning curve about how to do this .
I do n't think they 're ready . "
Stanford and Berkeley faced the same essential ethical dilemmas in creating their programs : avoiding coercion , protecting students ' privacy and adequately preparing students to interpret the results of their tests .
But the two universities took markedly different approaches to designing and executing their respective projects
Outsourcing vs. testing on campus
Berkeley 's project is essentially a modified version of the summer homework many colleges assign to new students in an attempt to foster intellectual discussion and class cohesion .
This year , instead of asking students to read the same book or watch the same movie for later debate on campus , Berkeley sent approximately 5,500 incoming freshmen and transfer students DNA sampling kits .
The hope is to spark discussion during orientation on how genetic testing works , the results of the students ' tests and their decisions on whether or not to participate .
The " Bring Your Genes to Cal " program is the first mass genetic testing project by any national university .
Although the program is entirely voluntary and confidential it has alarmed some bioethics watchers , who cite concerns about privacy , student health and the ambiguous nature of the project .
" This year we decided to take on the topic of personalized medicine , which in the future will allow doctors to tailor their treatments , " explains Mark Schlissel , dean of biological sciences at Berkeley and one of the program 's organizers .
" We wanted to provide an actual genetic test of the type that will become routine in the future and provoke very personal thought processes . "
After difficulty finding an affordable outside company that would agree to complete the genetic testing , Berkeley settled on a genetics laboratory in its School of Public Health .
The Berkeley lab will test students ' DNA for three specific gene variants that affect how the body metabolizes and uses alcohol , folic acid ( vitamin B9 ) and lactose .
Any student choosing to participate uses the provided kit to collect their saliva in the provided container and mail the sample to Berkeley with a unique bar code attached — a duplicate of which the student keeps .
Reportedly , test results will not be linked with any names — they will only be tied to the confidential bar codes that students use to identify their results online .
All participating students must provide informed consent and minors must obtain additional permission from their parents .
Stanford 's project , in contrast , is only open to medical and graduate students in the form of an eight - week elective summer class called " Genetics 210 : Genomics and Personalized Medicine , " in which about 50 students have enrolled , with a dozen more auditing .
Students in the class can choose to have their genotype analyzed by Navigenics or 23andMe—personal genomics companies that provide individualized risks for various health conditions and sensitivity to drugs ( 23and Me also provides additional information about ancestry ) .
The results of their tests will be incorporated into the class curriculum , although students can also opt to study publicly available genetic data in lieu of analyzing their own .
Professors will not know what decision the students make .
The idea behind the class is to prepare a new generation of physicians and scientists with the understanding that they need to properly analyze and interpret genetic data .
" When individuals want expert advice on their genetic test results they are going to turn to physicians or professors , so it 's particularly important for these individuals to be adequately prepared , " says Keyan Salari , a sixth - year MD / PhD student who originally proposed the course and is now its director .
Stuart Kim , a Stanford professor of developmental biology and genetics who served as Salari 's faculty sponsor , says the goal is to make sure Stanford students are prepared to handle the future of personalized medicine .
" The students are going to need extensive training , " he adds .
Two approaches to anticipated controversy
Despite enthusiasm from many Stanford students and professors , the course did not receive approval without significant deliberation .
" This is all new waters , " Kim says .
" I did n't think there would be such a controversy over writing this course , but it turned into a big debate . "
In fact , after Salari originally proposed the class last fall , a Stanford task force of about 30 basic scientists , clinical scientists , genetic professors , genetics counselors , bioethicists , legal counselors and students spent several months working through the various ethical issues and establishing safeguards to protect students .
In contrast , the organizers of Berkeley 's project incurred criticism because they spent hardly any time considering the potential reaction to their new orientation program .
Kimberly Tallbear , a professor of science , technology and environmental policy at Berkeley , explains that neither Mark Schlissel nor any of the project 's other organizers consulted with Berkeley 's bioethics community .
" Schlissel said several times they were surprised about the controversy , " Tallbear says .
" I said to him , ' Well does n't that tell you that you needed input from us ?
Because we could have told you about the controversy and debate . ' "
In response , Schlissel says that Berkeley does " not organize educational programs by inviting all 1,500 professors to participate in the design . "
The project was approved by Berkeley 's Committee for Protection of Human Subjects Institutional Review Board , which included bioethicists of its own , Schlissel adds .
Three bioethics issues
Apart from the preparation — or lack thereof — that shaped the new programs , three main issues concern critics in the bioethics community :
The manner in which universities are asking for genetic data from students ; what will happen to that information ; and how students will understand and respond to the results of their tests .
Berkeley is offering genetic testing to its students free of charge , a decision that could persuade students to participate , many bioethicists argue , because many may jump at the opportunity to obtain for free what is usually costly .
Furthermore , some argue that the assignment borders on coercion .
Any pressure from peers or the university to participate in the program should not be overlooked , say critics like Arthur Caplan , a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania ( Penn ) .
There 's already considerable excitement about the program on Facebook , according to Joanna Maltbaek , an incoming Berkeley freshman from Mountain View , Calif. , who says she will most likely participate in the " Bring Your Genes to Cal " program .
" I like that it 's a way for incoming freshmen to get involved in something important , " Maltbaek says .
" I can already see people wanting to go to campus and discuss it , and I think people might feel pressured , especially because Berkeley is n't offering an alternative [ to the class - wide summer assignment ] . "
Students enrolled in Stanford 's elective must pay a $ 99 fee to have their genotypes analyzed by 23andMe or Navigenics .
" These tests are normally offered to the general public at $ 500 or $ 600 , " Chu says .
" If students could get the testing for free there was some concern that it would encourage students to neglect all the risks involved . "
When Salari pointed out that 23andMe recently advertised their genetic testing package for $ 99 — a promotional offer for DNA Day on April 23 — the course 's organizers decided that would be an appropriate fee to request of students , just as many must pay for the materials they use in laboratory classes .
Beyond the incentives and pressures students might feel to participate in genetic testing , critics have called attention to a second kind of ethical dilemma : the question of how the universities will use the resulting data .
In Berkeley 's case , the matter is complicated by conflicting statements about exactly what kind of project the university is organizing .
The program 's founders insist it is not a research or medical project , but the informed consent document all participating students must sign explicitly characterizes the project as " a medical research study in the area of personalized medicine …providing free of charge information on three of your genes in which variants are common in the human population and which affect aspects of your health that you can address by simple , safe and effective dietary means . "
" If you look at the language in the informed consent , it looks like it's a study , " Tallbear says .
" I do n't understand — it 's not clear at all .
If it 's unclear to us who deal with consent forms all the time , how will it look to 18 - year - olds ? "
Privacy Concerns
Although all DNA samples collected by Berkeley will be incinerated after testing is complete , the results of those tests will be preserved as data sets on computers .
But the tests results will not be useful for research purposes , says Michael Eisen , a Berkeley biologist who has defended the " Bring Your Genes to Cal " program on his blog .
" It 's such a small sample of alleles that are not of significant research interest .
I could probably tell you in two seconds what the results are likely to be — it 's completely predictable . "
Schlissel says the data from the Berkeley tests will only be used for educational purposes , explaining that Jasper Rine — the Berkeley professor of genetics heading the project — will aggregate the test results for a presentation during orientation .
" If we provoke the kind of interest and discussion that we hope , we might write about it as an educational project , " Schlissel adds , " but not as a scientific study . "
Stanford cannot use the students ' physical DNA samples for research because 23andMe destroys DNA samples after testing , and Navigenics — although it may preserve the sample for a year — eventually does the same ( also giving customers the option to request earlier destruction ) .
The tests results , however , will be maintained on computer servers at the respective personal genomics companies .
The creators of Stanford 's new genetics class also claim their project is educational , and that students ' test results will not be used in research .
Stanford will , however , survey student attitudes to learn whether or not analyzing their own DNA facilitated learning about personalized medicine , says Charles Prober , senior associate dean for medical education .
" We 'll be conducting an educational study , " Prober says .
" If you choose to have your own genotyping done , will that make the information [ one learns ] stick more ?
That 's what we want to know . "
Student reactions
The third main ethical issue raised by bioethicists is how students will react to the results of their genetic tests .
Specifically , critics are concerned students will lack the proper context and knowledge to interpret their results and might make unwise lifestyle decisions .
One of the gene variants Berkeley 's project identifies , called aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( ALDH2 ) , codes for an enzyme crucial to breaking down alcohol in the body .
People with this particular variant may experience facial blushing and nausea when they drink .
" If they learn they do n't have the gene [ variant ] that makes them flush , they might think they can drink more , " Annas says .
Others argue that most Berkeley students will already know what their genetic tests tell them , because the conditions in question — like facial blushing and lactose intolerance — are so common and noticeable .
" First of all , it 's hardly like they need an excuse to binge drink , " Eisen says .
" Probably most people are already aware of their condition . "
To help students understand their test results , Berkeley is relying on a series of lectures and discussions during freshmen orientation .
But critics say that is not enough .
" I worry students wo n't understand or would easily misconstrue the information they are being presented , " Caplan says .
" A meeting in an auditorium is not the way to discuss genetic testing at this point in its evolution . "
Instead , critics argue that Berkeley must provide one - on - one genetic counseling to all participating students .
According to Schlissel , students will have the option to meet one - on - one with himself , Rine or a genetic counselor — but there is no mention of genetic counselors on the program 's official Web site or in the informed consent form .
" They say Rine would be available for counseling — that 's like insane , " Annas says .
" The students are going to tell their professor ?
It 's supposed to be confidential . "
Meanwhile , before students in Stanford 's summer class can choose to participate in genetic testing , they will attend two class sessions intended to provide them with adequate background on the potential risks as well as the relevant ethical and legal issues .
Once the results are in , students will have the option of one - on - one confidential genetic counseling offered by both Navigenics and 23andMe at no extra charge .
Still under negotiation is whether Stanford 's own genetic counseling program will offer additional services .
Alan Schatzberg , a Stanford psychiatrist on the original task force , also offered to counsel students .
Stanford v. Berkeley
Another big distinction between Stanford and Berkeley 's projects are the respective student populations involved , emphasizes Salari , the grad student who originally proposed the Stanford summer course and attended Berkeley as an undergraduate .
" The Berkeley population is 17 to 20 years old .
At Stanford they are all in graduate or medical school .
They are a generally older , more mature population .
I 'm proud of my alma mater for organizing their program .
I think it 's a good idea , but it 's very different from what we are doing . "
Not everyone at Stanford agrees that graduate and medical students are better able to interpret genetic data , however .
" I do n't like the idea of subsidized genotyping for students , " says Hank Greely , director of the Center for Law and the Biosciences at Stanford Law School .
" I think it 's less concerning when the students are medical students and PhD students than when they are freshmen , but the fact you are smart and know something about the Krebs cycle does n't necessarily mean you know genetic risk very well . "
" Those of us on the task force who opposed it are strong supporters of genetics , just genetics done carefully , " Greely adds .
" I think it 's telling that all the ethics and policy people were largely against it but the basic science people were the most supportive . "
Most critics of both university programs applaud innovation in teaching personalized medicine and genetics , even if they think the projects are poorly designed and full of ethical pitfalls .
" I agree with the idea of looking for more hands - on experiences , " Berkeley 's Tallbear says .
" They just collectively seem to be unaware of the controversial nature . "
Penn 's Caplan called the Berkeley approach " a clever class project , but I think they could have done it in a manner that was more sensitive to flaws in genetic testing . "
Greely says that neither project is reckless or grossly foolish , but he advises against them .
" There 's been the assertion that students will be more engaged if they are studying their own DNA , " he says , " but I have n't seen any empirical evidence for that .
How significant of an improvement would that even be ?
I think it 's a mistake . "

( Mashable ) -- Starting July 1 , Starbucks will offer free Wi-Fi nationwide , with no registration or account required .
Even better , Wi-Fi will not be time limited .
Starbucks joins an increasing list of brands and chains to offer free Wi-Fi in its stores .
For example , last December , McDonald 's rolled out free Wi-Fi to nearly all of its restaurants across the country .
Panera Bread also offers a similar program .
McDonald 's and Starbucks both have partnerships with AT&T , which , while often criticized for the quality of its wireless data network , is one of the largest Wi -Fi hotspot providers in the United States .
Starbucks was one of the first chains to offer Wi -Fi access to its patrons , first via an agreement with T - Mobile and then with AT&T .
Starbucks visitors have been able to enjoy up to two hours of free Wi-Fi from their favorite coffee house , provided they are either an AT&T customer or they use a Starbucks Card to login .
The new program will do away with any sort of registration , which will make those of us who always forget either our AT&T account information or can't find our Starbucks cards extremely happy .
In addition to the new free Wi-Fi program , Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told Wired 's Chris Anderson that the company is also planning on rolling out a new Starbucks Digital Network in partnership with Yahoo later this fall .
This network , which will only be accessible in U.S. company - operated stores , will offer customers free and unrestricted access to paid sites and services like WSJ.com and other content providers on their phones , tablets or laptops .
Bringing the Starbucks Experience Online
We spoke with Stephen Gillett , CIO , EVP and GM of Digital Ventures at Starbucks about the new plan for free Wi-Fi and the Starbucks Digital Network .
According to Gillett , the goal is to bring the overall Starbucks in - store experience online .
The first step is in providing an overall better online experience .
This is where one - click logon comes into play , as well as the ability to connect with your device , be it a laptop or phone or iPad .
The second part is the branded Starbucks online experience .
Rather than just trying to create an aggregated portal of sources , Starbucks will be bringing quality content that is usually behind a pay wall to customers to access for free while in Starbucks stores .
Different categories , like business news , lifestyle , music , entertainment , etc. will provide access to different content .
This means that you can visit the Wall Street Journal uninhibited , as well as Zagat and also get local content from services like Foursquare pulled into your default Starbucks page .
Furthermore , stuff like the Starbucks " Pick of the Week " iTunes promotion can now be integrated online , meaning that you can download the free weekly track from your iPhone or iPad or laptop , instead of having to use the cards with the redeem codes .
The physical cards will still be available but for connected visitors , this is an easier way to access free content .
The opportunity for premium service providers is that by offering free content to users while they are at Starbucks , they are potentially gaining new customers .
A user might find they really enjoy some of the pay Wall Street Journal content and look at subscribing at home , for example .
More and more providers will be announced as the launch date gets closer and Starbucks is committed to finding the best pay wall content it can bring to its audience .
What do you think of Starbucks new free Wi-Fi plan and the content deals ?
Let us know in the comments .

If you 're having trouble getting a date , French researchers suggest that picking the right soundtrack could improve the odds .
Women were more prepared to give their number to an ' average ' young man after listening to romantic background music , according to research that appears June 18 in the journal Psychology of Music .
There 's plenty of research indicating that the media affects our behaviour .
Violent video games or music with aggressive lyrics increase the likelihood of aggressive behaviour , thoughts and feelings -- but do romantic songs have any effect ?
This question prompted researchers Nicolas Guéguen and Céline Jacob from the Université de Bretagne - Sud along with Lubomir Lamy from Université de Paris - Sud to test the power of romantic lyrics on 18 - 20 year old single females .
And it turns out that at least one romantic love song did make a difference .
Guéguen and Jacob were part of a research team that had already shown how romantic music played in a flower shop led to male customers spending more money .
This time the researchers used questionnaires to pinpoint agreed - upon neutral and romantic songs .
They chose ' Je l'aime à mourir ' , a well - known love song by French songwriter Francis Cabrel , and the neutral song ' L ' heure du thé ' , by Vincent Delerm .
A group of young women separate from the main study rated 12 young male volunteers for attractiveness , and the researchers picked the one rated closest to ' average ' to help with the experiment .
The researchers then set up a scenario where the 87 females each spent time in a waiting room with background music playing , before moving to a different room where the experimenter instructed her to discuss the difference between two food products with the young man .
Once the experimenter returned , she asked them to wait for a few moments alone , and this gave the ' average ' male a chance to use his standard chat up line : " My name is Antoine , as you know , I think you are very nice and I was wondering if you would give me your phone number .
I 'll phone you later and we can have a drink together somewhere next week . '
The love song in the waiting room almost doubled Antoine 's chances of getting a woman 's number -- 52 % of participants responded to his advances under the influence of Francis Cabrel , whereas only 28 % of those who had heard the ' neutral ' song by Vincent Delerm offered their details .
" Our results confirm that the effect of exposure to media content is not limited to violence and could have the potential to influence a high spectrum of behaviour , " says Guéguen .
" The results are interesting for scientists who work on the effect of background music on individuals ' behaviour . "
The results also add weight to a general learning model proposed by Buckley and Anderson in 2006 to explain the effect of media exposure .
Their model states that media exposure in general , and not only aggressive or violent media , affects individuals ' internal states , which explains why prosocial media fosters prosocial outcomes .
Why did the music have this effect ?
It may be that , as shown in earlier research , the music induced positive affect ( in psychological terms , affect is the experience of feeling or emotion ) .
Positive affect is associated with being more receptive to courtship requests .
Alternatively , the romantic content of the song may have acted as a prime that then led to displays of behaviour associated with that prime .
In either case , further research is needed before the researchers will commit to wider generalisations on the targeted use of love songs .
But if you 're a hopeful single , awareness of the background music certainly wo n't do any harm .

A day after the door closed on NATO ’s deadliest month yet in Afghanistan , Britain ’s Major General Gordon Messenger is pointing the finger clearly at Pakistani and Iranian officials for the rising number of IED attacks .
Maj . Gen. Gordon Messenger
According to Maj. Gen. Messenger , the British military has “ evidence ” that the funding for the IED attacks and even some of the components used in the more advanced such devices are coming through both Pakistan and Iran , with some reports suggesting that the militaries and intelligence communities of those two nations are behind it .
The nature of the evidence he claimed to have was not revealed , but the claim of ties between the Afghan insurgency and Pakistan ’s largest spy group , the Inter - Services Intelligence Agency , was also supported by a previous report by the London School of Economics .
The claim of Iranian ties has been less well supported , as US military officials have insisted that they have n’t seen any proof that the cross - border traffic from Iran has anything to do with the Iranian government , which has a long history of animosity with the Taliban .
Tweet With Sarah Palin ’s alleged breast implants news , to which she categorically denies to be true , I think in 2012 when the Republican maverick decides whether or not she will run for the presidency , should consider this as her platform : Palin ’s boobs - A firm position for this country .
Palin ’s breasts have received more attention than anything she ’s ever said , including her author neighbor moving in next door to write a book .
In an interview with Greta Van Sustren the two talked about Palin ’s figure , with Palin saying , “ To be judged on or to be talked about on appearance — say chest size — it makes me wear layers , it makes me have to waste time figuring out what am I going to wear so that nobody will look at an area that I do n’t need them to look at . ”
People look at the “ area , ” meaning her breasts because they are tired of the lunacy that comes out of her mouth .
Palin has a great opportunity to win the nomination , but she has to flaunt it up a bit , speak less and change parties .
And change her name to something like a Bond villain , say Nipply Dollars .

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) -
It ’s been 40 years since Apollo 13 safely returned to Earth after a oxygen - tank explosion prevented the spacecraft from landing on the moon and put its three - man crew in danger .
Four decades later , NASA and the surviving two astronauts , Jim Lovell and Fred Haise , are celebrating an aborted mission that turned potential disaster into a successful recovery .
“ A ‘ successful failure ’ describes exactly what 13 was - because it was a failure in its initial mission -- nothing had really been accomplished , ” Lovell , the commander of Apollo 13 , now 82 , told Reuters Television in an exclusive interview .
But he hailed the nerve - racking mission , which had gripped the world in April 1970 , as “ a great success in the ability of people to take an almost certain catastrophe and turn it into a successful recovery . ”
The 40th anniversary of Apollo 13 is being celebrated on Sunday at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida ,
At the time of the oxygen - tank explosion two days into the mission , Lovell , Haise and fellow astronaut Jack Swigert were not initially aware of the seriousness of their situation .
“ Well , when the explosion occurred and we sort of found out and assessed on our own that we were n’t going to land on the moon , the first thoughts were one of disappointment , ” said Lovell .
“ We did n’t realize the significance or the danger . ”
But soon Lovell realized that so much of the spacecraft was virtually useless and he spoke to mission control at the Johnson Space Center in Texas those now - famous words : “ Houston , we ’ve had a problem . ”
“ The two fuel cells , or the three fuel cells , failed , ” Lovell said .
“ The two oxygen tanks failed .
We lost communication .
We lost the use of our computer for a while .
And consequently we had never really practiced for that . ”
For five days , the crew of Apollo 13 and mission specialists on the ground dealt with crisis upon crisis , rationing food and water , dealing with a loss of cabin heat and even using the Lunar Module as a so - called “ life boat ” during the return trip to Earth .
“ We always were able to solve a crisis as it came up some way , jury - rigging , or doing something to keep our spacecraft going , and finally for a safe landing , ” Lovell said .
The Apollo 13 crisis -- later made into a motion picture starring Tom Hanks -- captivated the nation .
Large crowds gathered at New York ’s Grand Central Station to watch the astronauts ’ successful splashdown in the Pacific and the hero ’s welcome for Lovell , Swigert and Haise aboard the U.S.S. Iwo Jima recovery ship .
In the end , Lovell never landed on the moon during his 11 - year career as a NASA astronaut .
WASHINGTON  Bankers have all but given up on defeating one of the most contentious provisions in the financial regulation bill  one that would effectively bar federally insured banks from trading for their own accounts  and are now focusing on battles like heading off a prohibition on derivatives trading .
As House and Senate negotiators head into a final push to send the legislation to President Obama , they have largely agreed to stricter limits on so - called proprietary trading than those envisioned in the versions passed by either chamber .
That outcome would be a victory for the White House and for the provision ’s most dogged advocate , Paul A. Volcker , the former Federal Reserve chairman .
But with the so - called Volcker Rule now likely to become law after appearing to be dead at earlier points in the legislative process , banks are battling hard to fend off further restrictions on their activities .

45 . Microscopic Life Hacks
Dear Mary , John , Jim , and Maggie ,
It has slowly come to my attention that it is no longer humourous to call myself a " middle - aged fart , " as Jeanne and I used to delight in doing .
In two months I will be 72 and one day .
I cop : I 'm now an old fart .
And part of that is very slowly working out what I call microscopic life hacks — solving teeny little problems that typically come with age .
I 've started to invent tricks I only just realized I need , now .
But you 're all younger than me , I think , and there seems to me an excellent chance that all of you might — how would I know , at this distance from you all ? — still consider yourself middle - aged farts .
You may not yet have had these sorts of miniproblems , or found them annoying enough to need workarounds .
So whenever I think of one , I 'm gonna type it out and send it to all of you , in hopes it will fairly soon prove useful .
If I find that old age continues to get trickier and more irritatingly interesting , perhaps one day I 'll have the makings of a book , titled Tiny Life Hacks .
Till then , you guys will be my test audience .
If you find these too boring to endure , just say so , and the book will be burned before publication for a change .
The one I encounter most often and find the most childishly satisfying , over and over again , is my Spider 's Carafe Cleaning Strategy .
I 'm pretty sure it will require some painstakingly awkward description of simple things that , if you were here , I could just point at , so let 's get started .

Where Tesla Meets Robinson .... Near Callahan's Place
( all photos by John Moore )
In the first photo ( #546 ) , the buildings visible on the right , behind my brother - in - law John Moore 's PT Cruiser , are all that remains today of Wardenclyffe , Nikola Tesla 's laboratory in Shoreham NY , designed by Stanford White .
All but invisible in the woods directly behind me is the huge circular concrete base of the 187 - foot - tall tower Tesla raised for the purpose of giving free limitless electricity to the whole world -- until his chief backer J.P. Morgan found out , and pulled the plug .
( Perhaps one of the most apt uses ever of that particular metaphor . )
Notice the street sign in the foreground .
I 'm shown standing at the closest spot a civilian can now get to the surviving structures : the corner of Tesla St. and Robinson St. ( See photo # 551 ) No shit .
It 's within a block or two of Rte. 25 - A -- which is the only location I ever gave for the original Callahan 's Place .
Some , including me , believe it was with that tower , designed by White 's associate W.D. Crow ( which , by the way , took the best efforts of three successive demolition firms to bring down ; a shitload of dynamite was required ) that Tesla accidentally caused the Tunguska Event of 1908 , which leveled 2,150 square kilometers of Siberian wilderness .
See my CALLAHAN'S KEY for details ( and see photo # 553 for a better shot of the tower 's base ) .
He also designed and produced the first Tesla Turbine there , and did the first mass production of Tesla Coils .
The site was subsequently purchased by the Agfa corporation , which polluted it with photographic chemicals so horrifically that it's now a Superfund Cleanup Site , which is why it 's surrounded by high chain - link with serious barbed wire on top and camera surveillance .
( see photo # 559 )
By a coincidence even more gasp - worthy to me than the name of the nearest intersection , the Wardenclyffe property is in the path of a huge power - line right of way corridor ( seen in photo # 562 ) , which was constructed for the purpose of carrying the immense amounts of electricity that were expected to be generated by the Shoreham nuclear power plant only a few miles away -- which never opened , thanks in part to the efforts of my anti-nuke friends David Crosby and Graham Nash .
The reactor was fired up exactly once before it was abandoned , but never produced a single watt .
TWO schemes to bring almost limitless power to the Long Island / NYC area , and both of them failed utterly , the first due to greed , the second to fear .
A dispiriting thing to see and contemplate .... relieved only slightly by the visible presence in that power - tower corridor of cell - phone towers ( see photo # 565 ) , a technology that did not fail .
In photo # 579 , taken from where John 's car is seen parked in the first photo , you can see the back stairway on which I like to imagine Tesla used to catch a smoke between experiments .
There are several groups presently trying to have Wardenclyffe cleaned up and turned into a museum / historic site / tourist attraction -- among them the Tesla Science Center mentioned at the bottom of this webpage .
Please Google them all , and support all you find worthy .
A science center and museum at Wardenclyffe would be a fitting memorial for the man who invented the modern world single - handed , and got screwed out of all the money and most of the credit .
As Wikipedia notes :
Designation of the structure as a National Landmark is awaiting completion of plant decommissioning activities by its present owner .
[ The Agfa Corporation -- SR ]
In 1976 , an application was filed to nominate the main building for listing on the National Register of Historic Places .
It failed to get approval .
The Tesla Wardenclyffe Project , Inc. was established in 1994 for the purpose of seeking placement of the Wardenclyffe laboratory - office building and the Tesla tower foundation on both the New York State and National Registers of Historic Places .
Its mission is the preservation and adaptive reuse of Wardenclyffe , the century - old laboratory of electrical pioneer Nikola Tesla located in Shoreham , Long Island , New York .
In October 1994 a second application for formal nomination was filed .
The New York State Office of Parks , Recreation and Historic Preservation conducted inspections and determined the facility meets New York State criteria for historic designation .
A second visit was made on February 25 , 2009 .
The site cannot be registered until it is nominated by a willing owner .
Anyway , that 's how I spent ( part of ) my winter vacation .
The first thing I intend to do when I get home in mid-January will be to record and post a new podcast for you .
In the meantime , I hope you 'll find these photos entertaining .
PEOPLE kill each other over diamonds ; countries go to war over oil .
But the world 's most expensive commodities are worth nothing in the absence of water .
Fresh water is essential for life , with no substitute .
Although mostly unpriced , it is the most valuable stuff in the world .
Nature has decreed that the supply of water is fixed .
Meanwhile demand rises inexorably as the world 's population increases and enriches itself .
Homes , factories and offices are sucking up ever more .
But it is the planet 's growing need for food ( and the water involved in producing crops and meat ) that matters most .
Farming accounts for 70 % of withdrawals .
Our special report this week looks at the increasingly visible consequences of the rising demand for water .
Few of the world 's great rivers that run through grain - growing areas now reach the sea all the year round or , if they do , they do so as a trickle .
Less obvious , though even more serious , are the withdrawals from underground aquifers , which are hidden from sight but big enough to produce changes in the Earth 's gravitational field that can be monitored by NASA 's satellites in space .
Water tables are now falling in many parts of the world , including America , India and China .
So far the world has been spared a true water war , though the belligerency in Darfur comes close to being one , and competition for water can sometimes bring rivals together as well as drive them apart .
But since over 60 % of the world 's population lives in a river basin shared by two or more countries , the scope for squabbles is plain .
Even if acute water shortages were to become widespread in just one country — India , say , or China — they could lead to mass migration and fighting .
Although the supply of water cannot be increased , mankind can use what there is better — in four ways .
One is through the improvement of storage and delivery , by creating underground reservoirs , replacing leaking pipes , lining earth - bottomed canals , irrigating plants at their roots with just the right amount of water , and so on .
A second route focuses on making farming less thirsty — for instance by growing newly bred , perhaps genetically modified , crops that are drought - resistant or higher - yielding .
A third way is to invest in technologies to take the salt out of sea water and thus increase supply of the fresh stuff .
The fourth is of a different kind : unleash the market on water - users and let the price mechanism bring supply and demand into balance .
And once water is properly priced , trade will encourage well - watered countries to make water - intensive goods , and arid ones to make those that are water - light .
Solutions on tap
All four approaches have a part to play in the solution , but none is likely to end the over - drawing of water at all quickly .
For instance , although crop yields may be improved by new technologies and even new breeds ( especially following this week 's genome advance ) , no one has yet managed to produce plants that offer dramatically more crop per drop .
Without such a breakthrough , growing more crops inevitably means losing more water , since each extra plant transpires water vapour into the atmosphere during photosynthesis .
Desalination looks more hopeful , since new technologies are being developed and prices are falling .
But it is still expensive , especially in terms of energy use , which is why at present it provides only 0.4 % of the world 's fresh water .
It will undoubtedly add to the supply of drinking water , of the ultra - pure water required for some industrial processes , even of irrigation for high - value crops , especially if grown for export .
But it wo n't solve most farmers ' water problems .
Liquid assets
As for the market , when it approaches water it meets all sorts of obstacles : water is difficult to move , difficult to measure , difficult to price and often difficult to charge for , since many people think it should be free .
Even in arid market economies where every drop is precious , the price of water seldom reflects scarcity .
Trading in water rights may one day bring order to the 20 m well - users in India , but not in time to feed the 1.4 billion Indian mouths expected by 2025 .
If that is to be done , it will be done largely by managing demand .
This is already beginning to happen in parts of both India and China , where farmers are learning how to measure the water they pump , how to use it to greatest effect and thus how to sustain aquifer levels .
The urgent need now is to spread their principles and practices at home and to other countries .
Even if the world manages to limit depletion , many water - related problems will persist .
About 1 billion people are still without access to a decent water supply , while others suffer from flooding , pollution and poor sanitation .
Yet if man wants to solve these problems , he can .
He has applied far more money and know - how to issues far less important than the shortage of water .
And if he does tackle them successfully , the big causes of human suffering — disease and poverty — will be automatically alleviated .
Investing more thought and cash in the better use of the world 's most valuable commodity is surely worthwhile .
Debiotech and STMicroelectronics rolls out its Disposable Insulin Jewel Pump that is touted to be the most advanced use of microfluidic MEMS technology in diabetes treatment .
This diminutive device is currently awaiting FDA clearance , where it can be mounted on a disposable skin patch in order to provide continuous insulin infusion .
This ought to allow substantial improvements in the treatment efficiency and the quality of life of diabetic patients .
The Jewel Pump will definitely be a whole lot smaller , thinner and lighter when compared to currently available insulin pumps , where it can be worn as a nearly invisible patch on the skin just in case you are rather self - conscious .
It will deliver 4.5 milliliters of insulin that is enough for a 6 - day treatment .
Hopefully the cost wo n’t be prohibitive to those living in poorer countries .

In Pixar movies , our consumer crap loves us .
Whether it 's toys , cars or trash robots , Pixar plays to our fantasies that our mass - produced semi-durable possessions have deep inner lives .
But Toy Story 3 takes this theme to a new place .
Advertisement
Oh , and there are spoilers in this review .
TOY spoilers !
Toy Story 3 , out today , is an awesome continuation of Pixar 's most famous saga .
Director Lee Unkrich and company have managed to find one more new spin on the over - arching theme of the Toy Story series : the emotional relationship between toys and their owners .
Toy Story , of course , is a fantasy in which seemingly inanimate lumps of plastic , metal and fabric come to life and have intricate social lives .
It takes place in " our " world , except that nobody 's ever noticed that all of the toys are running around and talking the moment they seem to be unobserved .
( It 's not a work of stark realism . )
Advertisement
This time around , the toys ' owner , Andy , is all grown up and off to college .
Somehow , amazingly , his toys are all intact and in perfect condition , but Andy himself has become obsolete .
Andy decides to put the toys into storage in the attic — all except for Woody the cowboy , whom he wants to take to college .
But through a series of miscommunications , the toys all end up at a day care center instead , and it turns out to be too good to be true .
Unlike in previous Toy Story movies , you 're not sure what to root for this time around — should the toys make their way back to Andy , just so he can stick them in his attic ?
There 's no possibility of a happy reunion between Andy and his beloved toys , so what resolution do you hope for ?
It 's sort of the dilemma hinted at in Toy Story 2 , where Jessie the cowgirl tells
Woody that she had an owner who got tired of her and left her behind .
The possessions that love us so fervently can get their hearts broken when we no longer need them .
It 's the whole " Velveteen Rabbit " scenario .
What 's great about Toy Story 3 — and what was hinted at at the end of Toy Story 2 — is that the toys ' love for each other turns out to be greater , and more important , than their love for Andy .
The toys may have been enlivened and animated by Andy 's imagination , as we glimpse at the start of the movie in a flashback to Andy 's childhood .
But they realize early on that it does n't matter who plays with them , as long as they get played with , and as long as they 're together .
And by the end of the movie , Woody is forced to make a choice between loyalty to an owner and loyalty to his fellow toys .
When Woody chooses , it 's incredibly moving and — as often is the case with Pixar movies — I got all choked up despite myself .
Advertisement
By the way , Toy Story 3 is probably not quite as brilliant as Toy Story 2 .
But it 's still so great that it puts every other movie I 've seen so far this year to shame , and it's yet another reminder of how creatively bankrupt the rest of Hollywood is in comparison to Pixar .
The idea of having interesting characters who face real challenges and make defining choices seems like kind of a radical one , but you never know , it might work for other people .
Advertisement
Much like Wall - E and Eve 's relationship in Wall - E seems far more meaningful than anything the humans in the movie experience , the toys in Toy Story 3 have long since outstripped the fickle Andy 's capacity for loyalty and affection .
We 've gone beyond fantasizing that our possessions can become as attached to us as we are to them , and now we 're on to imagining that our possessions love each other , too .
In fact , their love for each other can redeem our callowness and self - obsession .
I can't help wondering if artificial intelligences , a thousand years from now , will be as fascinated with Pixar movies as Wall - E is with Hello Dolly .
Perhaps future A.I.s are Pixar 's other target audience , besides today 's kids and parents .
Among the first movies made entirely by computer , they celebrate the idea that seemingly soulless items mass - produced by humans actually have more of a spark than their creators .
Films like Wall - E and Toy Story 3 celebrate our semi-irrelevance , as our creations become more meaningful than we are .
Advertisement
Of course , at the end of Toy Story 3 , those toys still need to be played with , just like Wall - E still wants to serve humanity .
But they 've also learned that no human will ever love them as much , or as meaningfully , as they love each other .
Humans will grow up , leave them , even die , but their plastic souls will go on .
If you ’ve been tinkering with the idea of making some quick money by printing fake notes using Adobe Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro , think again .
These applications will simply refuse to print fake notes and will instead show a warning message like the one below if you try the print command .
That ’s because currency notes are often protected through EURion Constellation - it ’s a secret pattern of symbols found banknote designs , including the American Dollar , Euro and the Indian Rupee , to help software easily detect that the image being edited is that of a currency note .
Apart from various image editing software , some scanners and photocopying devices also use this pattern to foil wannabe counterfeiters .

Guess nobody wants to smell like “ The Man Your Man Could Smell Like . ”
The Internet has fallen in love with Isaiah Mustafa , the hunky face of Old Spice body wash .
His television commercials went viral , as did a two - day YouTube ambush of video replies to fans .
Mustafa ’s first ad even won the Film Grand Prix at Cannes .
But buzz did not add up to sales , according to advertising news service WARC .
Red Zone After Hours body wash sales have fallen seven percent , despite the ads .
Yet BNET argues that Mustafa is such a media darling that nixing the campaign would be a PR disaster .
So why are sales down ?
Jezebel argues the brand sent mixed messages .
The ad ’s tagline was “ Smell Like a Man , Man , ” yet Mustafa opens the ads with “ Hello , ladies . ”
Who was supposed to actually buy the body wash ?
Plus , Old Spice has long been associated with our grandfathers , and it ’s going to take more than a shirtless , funny man to change that perception .
Even though the perception is hard to beat , NewsFeed would be crushed if The Man Your Man Could Smell Like left our TV ( and computer ) screens .
We need not fear , though — Mustafa has signed a talent deal with NBC .
( Update :
We might have been a little too specific with the sales stats .
Though Red Zone After Hours sales went down , overall body wash sales actually went up 107 percent , according to PRWeek .
Good — we hope this means more Mustafa in our lives . )
Seeking to inject urgency into the push for an overhaul of the nation ’s immigration laws , President Obama on Thursday called on Republicans to join the effort , telling them he can’t pass a bill without them .
After pushing through an economic stimulus bill and health care with barely any Republican support in the first 16 months of his administration , the president said this issue is too dangerous to tackle — for Democrats and the GOP — without having both parties involved .
“ I ’m ready to move forward , the majority of Democrats are ready to move forward , and I believe the majority of Americans are ready to move forward .
But the fact is without bipartisan support , as we had just a few years ago , we cannot solve this problem , ” Mr. Obama told about 250 immigration - rights advocates in a speech at American University in Washington .
On the hottest flash point in the debate , Arizona ’s new law targeting illegal immigrants , Mr. Obama said the rules are “ unenforceable ” for local police .
But he did n’t give any indication when the administration will file an expected lawsuit seeking to block the new law , which takes effect at the end of this month .
Mr. Obama has already missed his own self - imposed deadline for getting a broad immigration bill passed .
During the 2008 presidential campaign he told Hispanic audiences he wanted a bill in his first year .
And his new push is unlikely to bear fruit this year .
Advocates on both sides of the issue say they do n’t expect Congress to tackle the issue before the elections , both because of the already - crowded legislative schedule and because there is no clear consensus on how to proceed .
Key Republicans say the borders must be secured first before the government considers legalizing illegal immigrants , and they point to recent violent incidents — including the killing of an Arizona rancher — as evidence the border is still not under control .
But Democrats argue that legalizing illegal immigrants has to be done at the same time , both for practical reasons and because they fear if the borders are secured first , it might sap momentum from the push for legalization .
“ Our borders are just too vast for us to be able to solve the problem only with fences and border patrols , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ It wo n’t work . ”
He called for legislation that would toughen penalties for businesses that hire illegal immigrants , create a program to both increase legal immigration and streamline the process .
The president added that the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the U.S. should be given a long , multi-step path to citizenship if they pay fines , admit they broke the law and learn English .
Mr. Obama did not call for a guest - worker program , which business groups have argued would allow them to bring in the temporary workers they need .
That issue helped sink the 2007 immigration bill , which was the last time Congress tried to tackle the immigration question .
That bill failed when a majority of the Senate , including more than a dozen Democrats , joined in a filibuster .
And it ’s because the issue is so difficult for Democrats that Mr. Obama needs Republican support — in contrast to the stimulus , health care , and other major legislation which he was able to rely almost entirely on the overwhelming Democratic majorities in Congress .

New South Wales Labor MP
David Campbell will return to active duty at State Parliament after being appointed as acting speaker of the Lower House .
The Member for Keira resigned from the roads and transport portfolios three weeks ago after he was filmed leaving a gay sex club in Sydney .
Mr Campbell 's outing sparked a debate about whether an MP 's private life should be made public .
Independent MP Richard Torbay , who is the speaker for the Legislative Assembly , appointed Mr Campbell to the new role .
He says the MP 's history as a minister and parliamentarian will stand him in good stead .
David Campbell says even though his focus remains on representing his electorate , he is looking forward to the new challenge .
" I 'll be in parliament as the member for Keira for the overwhelming majority of the time , " he said .
" But I 'll also take the opportunity to serve as an acting speaker and I look forward to that challenge . "
Mr Campbell will take the chair later this month .
It rarely occurs to me to defend my interest in recreating the sound of live music .
I do it because I love to listen to beautiful sound .
Is wanting great audio crazy ?

A series of events — and evangelists — led me from a casual like of the pop songs I heard on my tiny transistor radio to an obsessive immersion in music .
Growing up in the early ' 60's , I heard the Hi-Fis of my parents and many of their friends .
The turning point for me was an uncle 's set - up with huge Altec Laguna corner - horns and an Ampex reel - to - reel tape deck ; I can still remember my astonishment at the lifelike presentation of Harry Belafonte at Carnegie Hall seemingly right there in front of me .
I quickly learned that music I did n't like could be captivating when played back on a " big Hi-Fi " .
Since that time I 've worked in all areas of the audio industry and I still look for that same overwhelming sense of involvement with whatever music or sound - system I encounter .
Many of the recordings I hear today are flat , compressed and uninvolving , but wonders still await in those old recordings made in the single - mic / vacuum tube era .
Even such often - heard chestnuts as the Flamingos ' " I Only Have Eyes for You " provide moments of joy and discovery when heard over a high - resolution sound system .
The music is not just a song but an event , a recreation of a particular time and place , with a sense of both the performers and the original recording venue .
The effects can be addictive .

How is it that Hi -Fi— or High End Audio — once the domain of doctors and attorneys , celebrated in magazines like Playboy and Esquire , essential element of bachelor - pads and dorm rooms alike , has come to be viewed as the realm of obsessives , a perverse diversion that requires defensiveness on the part of the " victim " of this illness ?
When was the last time you heard someone defend the purchase of a large flat - screen television , or a home theater system ?
Everyone understands the desire to create a greater sense of immersion in films and sports - events ; why is it hard to understand the desire for the same sensation with music alone ?
For over 20 years I 've attended the mammoth , trade - only Consumer Electronics Show .
During that time , I 've seen dozens of demonstrations of the current state of the art in video technology ; first with standard CRT monitors , then projection , HDTV , plasma , LED , LCD , and most recently , 3 - D technologies .
Not once have I heard a fellow show - attendee say , " I 'm not sure I 'll be able to see the difference .
I think my old Zenith is good enough . "
Those demos have been effective in conveying the improvements made in picture detail , depth and color rendition ; each year 's progress has been immediately obvious to all those present .
Once you 're acclimated to the increased level of involvement brought about by improvements in video technology , going back to a 19 " black and white portable becomes unthinkable .
Conversely , a refrain I 've heard repeatedly during my 40 - year involvement in audio has been , " I do n't think I could hear the difference with that really expensive stuff .
I think my console / jambox / iPod is good enough . "
For some reason , serious music - lovers and casual listeners alike are often convinced that whatever sound systems they 've heard , well , that 's as good as it gets .
Not only are they unaware that higher - quality sound systems are available and could greatly enhance their listening experience , it seems they are unable to even conceive of better sound - quality .
It 's as though having driven a creaking Volkswagen Beetle , they 're unable to even process the concept of a VW Golf , much less a Bugatti Veyron .
For those few who are aware of the world of High End Audio , expense in audio equipment is equated with loudness and Shaquille O'Neal - sized speakers , not with improvements in intelligibility , detail , frequency range or the listener 's emotional connection to the music .
And let 's not even consider such abstruse ideas as " soundstaging " , " depth of image " or the like .

It is a problem the audio industry has brought upon itself .
Rather than emphasizing how High End Audio can bring more enjoyment and involvement into the lives of music lovers , we have demonstrated systems with spectacular boom - and - blast film soundtracks at sound pressure levels close to those of a 747 in final approach .
In my mind such bruising demos date back to the arrival of " Sensurround " systems in theaters in the ' 70's ( think THX with plaster - cracking bass ) , and certainly the arrival of sub - woofers in home theater systems made for a more sound - effects - oriented sales pitch .
Today , we live in a world in which we are constantly bombarded by music , and thanks to the iPod , we can provide a soundtrack to our own lives .
We are perhaps more aware of and attuned to music than at any time in history .
But that does not mean we sit and actually listen to music , following a vocal part throughout a choral piece , or picking out Paul McCartney 's jazzy bass - lines in an old Beatles track .
Music is just there , as background noise .
Actual listening is an oddly Zen activity , a combination of awareness and anticipation .
It is anything but passive ; immersive listening is active and involving .
It can be as overwhelming and emotional an experience as a great novel or movie .
Does audiophilia require a defense ?
Perhaps ; there are any number of anti-social dweebs obsessed with the size of their speakers , just as there are any number of middle - aged - crazies seeking validation with that new red Porsche .

The act of listening , becoming involved with music , requires no defense !
It does n't require megabucks or Stonehenge in the living room to become more aware of and involved in music ; good quality sound systems start around a grand , and vintage used gear can often be had for almost nothing .
Affordable Starter Audio Gear
The best place to see what 's available in both new and vintage audio gear is Audiogon .
Founded in 1998 , the ' gon , as it's known to its ardent users , is the world 's most heavily trafficked audio website , and a place where you might see everything from iPod docks to plasma loudspeakers ( no , not plasma TVs ) .
As Director of Marketing for the site I 'm clearly biased , but more than 250,000 registered members visit the site regularly ; many would say " obsessively " .

A number of new products offer incredible bang for the buck .
Seth Krinsky 's Virtue Audio offers the tiny ONE.2 amplifier for $ 349 ; while small enough to fit under a computer monitor , the ONE.2 has 30 watts per channel of superb quality sound , and is routinely demonstrated at shows powering those huge megabuck speakers we all make fun of .
Next to the speakers , the ONE.2 looks like a Chihuahua hangin ' with a Great Dane .
Peachtree Audio offers two game - changing products in the Nova and the iDecco .
The $ 1199 Nova is an 80 watts / channel integrated amp with a cool vacuum tune preamp , and includes an excellent DAC ( digital to analog converter ) so that computer and iPod sources can be used with the big boy system .
The $ 999 iDecco offers fewer inputs , 40 watts / channel , but has a built - in iPod dock .
Both have headphone amps , and are beautiful and beautifully made .

Perhaps the biggest change the iPod has made in the audio world is that it 's made people used to wearing headphones ( or at least earbuds ) .
If you want to bypass speakers altogether , there are dozens of choices in good headphone amps and headphones .
A newcomer to the headphone amp world is Schiit (! ) ; industry veterans Mike Moffat and Jason Stoddard offer killer American - made amps for $ 249 -$ 349 .
Couple them with phones from Grado , Sennheiser , Beyer , Audio - Technica or Denon , and you might never leave home again !
The world may be getting more expensive every day , but the audio world has never offered as many bargains as it does right now .
Try them !

Luis Suarez says he now has the ' Hand of God ' after his handball helped Uruguay reach the semi-finals of the World Cup .
Striker says he had no choice but to block Adiyiah 's header
Instinctive
Luis Suarez says he now has the ' Hand of God ' after his controversial handball helped Uruguay reach the semi-finals of the World Cup .
Ajax striker Suarez 's deliberate handball on the goal - line in the final minute of extra-time prevented Dominic Adiyiah 's header from sending Ghana through to the last four .
Suarez was sent off for his action and then danced with glee on the sidelines when Asamoah Gyan smacked the resultant penalty against the crossbar .
Uruguay went on to prevail 4 - 2 in the shoot - out to set up a semi-final clash with Holland and Suarez 's handball drew comparisons to Diego Maradona 's infamous goal against England at the 1986 finals .
Prolific front - man Suarez is now claiming the ' Hand of God ' mantle for himself and insists he had no choice but to block Adiyiah 's header .
" This was the end of the World Cup .
I had no choice .
I have the ' Hand of God ' now , " said Suarez .
" I did it so that my team - mates could win the penalty shoot - out .
When I saw Gyan miss the penalty it was a great joy .
" Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez believes it would be wrong to accuse his team of cheating and insists Suarez was properly punished for the incident .
Tabarez said : " When there is a handball in the penalty area there is a red card and the player is thrown out of the game .
" Saying we cheated Ghana is too harsh a word to use .
We also abide by what the referee did .
It could have been a mistake .
Yes he stuck his hand out , but it 's not cheating .
I do n't think it 's fair to say that .
" I think it was instinctive .
The player instinctively reacted and was thrown out of the match and he can't play the next match .
What else do you want ?
" Is Suarez also to blame for Ghana missing the penalty ?
We try to be dignified and if we lose a match we look for the reasons for it .
You should n't look to third parties .
" This is football .
There are consequences to that handball and he did n't know that Ghana was going to miss that penalty . "
Welcome to Talking Points , where each week I will run down the stories that made the biggest splashes in the blogosphere last week and will tell you what to keep an eye on for the week to come .
It 's the perfect way to get all the local sports information you need to hit the water cooler with authority .
Last week sure was an exciting week , mostly because it was SB Nation D.C. 's debut !
I hope you read us each and every day , but if you did n't let 's take a look back at all the fun you might have missed .
Nationals
Two words can sum up the last week for the Nationals .
Or , should I say , two names : Strasburg and Harper .
If you were on this site at all last week , you saw a million different Stephen Strasburg stories , and why not ?
That kid is as much fun to watch pitch as he is to write about .
With his spectacular debut , people went all out to make a dollar on young Jeeezus , selling dirt , changing names of towns , creating baseball cards , inventing several new hamburgers , selling lots of tickets and selling tons of jerseys in opposing teams ' stadiums .
Even the media have a chance to cash in .
Instead of calling him Jeeezus , maybe they should call him " The Alchemist , " because he apparently can turn anything into gold .
Oh , by the way , he also won his second major league start , salvaging the series against the Indians .
Bryce Harper got drafted last week ( along with a bunch of other guys , read about the whole draft here and here ) and was told he could n't wear his trademarked crazy - man eye black .
He 's going to immediately be moved to the outfield .
Washingtonians can now commence the speculation on how much it will take to sign him .
Other Tidbits :
Wizards
The two largest stories for the Wizards this week were entirely due to off - court issues .
First , Reebok made John
Wall a very very rich man , signing him to an insane five - year , $ 25 million deal to be the new face of its basketball shoes .
Remember , he 's yet to even be drafted by the Wizards , but that apparently is a mere formality at this point .
I mean , if the new owner is doing the John Wall dance when he gets the No. 1 pick , one has to be pretty sure that he will be picking John Wall .
Wizards .
Leonsis Secondly , speaking of the new owner , yes it is official .
Ted Leonsis was approved to be the new owner of the .
Leonsis gave a press conference after he was approved , where he wound up talking about his plans as the new owner and even praising Gilbert Arenas himself .
Later in the week , Leonsis realized the folly of his behavior and turned around to diss ol '
Gil like he should 've been doing all along .
Ted also said the team would go ahead and reach out to former season - ticket - plan holders for a round - table discussion , proving , yet again , that he is the Anti-Snyder in almost all respects as a team owner .
Sadly for the squad , their unfortunate name is n't changing anytime soon but , mercifully , their uniform colors might .
I , for one , hope the colors go back to the red , white and blue that they used to rock back in the day and that eventually the name gets changed to something , anything , else besides the Wizards .
Lets make this happen Uncle Teddy !
Other Tidbits :
Redskins , which is a good thing according to my book .
This means the players , coaches and management are focused on one thing : turning this 4 - 12 team into something this city can be proud of .
Well , at least Another quiet week for the , which is a good thing according to my book .
This means the players , coaches and management are focused on one thing : turning this 4 - 12 team into something this city can be proud of .
Well , at least almost all of them .
Certainly this transformation will not happen overnight , nor do I have delusions of the playoffs with our offensive line , but it 's tough to not improve on four wins in the NFL .
Signs of progress , that 's all I want .
Other Tidbits :
Capitals
These guys seem to be quite content letting the Hershey Bears take up all of the local hockey spotlight for now , as they are currently one win away from capturing the Calder Cup .
Everyone should make an effort to tune into CSN to watch these guys try to win it all .
They 're a fun team to watch and they even blast Justin Beiber in the locker room .
Wait , that is n't good , let 's hope that at the very least this is being done in an ironic sense .
Other Tidbits :
Head into the wayback machine and remember the great Peter Bondra .
Should the Caps be looking for an enforcer in free agency ?
My quick take :
No , we need a solid and defensively sound player to help out our goalies , not some goon who will spend just as much time the box as he will attempting to defend attackers .

Final Thoughts
Stephen Strasburg , Bryce Harper , John Wall , Alex Ovechkin .
These are the names that everyone in this town are currently all talking about .
Harper is a good three years away from being here , if all goes according to plan , but the other three will all be full - time starters starting next season .
Another player you should add to that is list D.C. United 's 17 - year - old phenom , Andy " I 'm not Freddy Adu " Najar .
This kid is , by all accounts , everything Freddy Adu should 've been without any of the hype that Adu brought with him .
In other words , another game - changing player on a D.C. team .
However , which organization is missing from this list ?
Which team , that has had a stranglehold on the Washington D.C. sports scene for at least the last 40 years , does not have a young , dynamic game changing star that will hopefully be leading his team to the playoffs for years to come ?
That 's right , the Washington Redskins .
You would think that Snyder and his merry men would see a pattern developing in this city and want to change it through other means than trading away already limited draft picks for an aging quarterback and signing running backs nearing the end of their careers .
While the rest of this city 's teams have adapted their team - building strategies to compete for the present and future , Snyder has seemed to only care about the past and present ... except for the offensive line .
I do n't know what the Redskins are thinking there at all .
Sure getting Mike Shanahan to coach seems like a good move right now , and the draft that he ran with Bruce Allen seemed to have been solid , but the Donovan McNabb move reminds me too much of the Bullets getting Bernard King in the nadir of his career .
He might play alright for a bit , but it is not the way you want to run a team in the long term .
Was Jason Campbell the solution ?
Probably not , but neither is McNabb .
and they could 've saved some draft picks sticking with the status quo .
Not very forward thinking on their part .
The Capitals are already drawing away Redskins fans ' dollars ( have you seen the sold out stands rocking the red ? ) .
The Nationals are just starting to do the same with Strasburg mania , and the Wizards will do the same when Wall arrives .
If Snyder does n't start changing something very soon , the Redskins will lose their grip on this town ( if they are n't losing it already ) and might never get it back .
Keep in mind , I 'm not sad about fans paying attention to other sports .
Fans watching and supporting all the teams in D.C. is a great thing .
I 've long felt that the Redskins monopolize too much of the media and dollars of the fans and now there are many alternatives to cheer for and that is fantastic .
What I am sad about what it means to this once proud franchise .
I never wanted the Redskins to become like the Bullets , but it seems like that is what 's happening and there 's nothing we can do to stop it .

Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter 's opposition to renewing a contract allowing federal immigration authorities full access to city arrest records is infuriating local Tea Party activists and their allies who say the potential move could jeopardize the public safety of residents and visitors to the city .
Supporters of the contract held a news conference Thursday in Philly to express their safety concerns after they said the mayor 's office ignored their requests for a meeting but dispatched city officials to a meeting last month organized by a coalition of pro-immigrant groups where immigrants voiced their mistrust of the police .
" Mayor Nutter 's decision to conceal illegal alien criminals from federal immigration authorities will result in the deaths of innocent Americans , " Peter Gadiel , the president of 9/11 Families for a Secure America , said in a press release .
" We who have been the victims of crimes committed by illegal aliens have paid the price for such policies implemented by other politicians who are more interested in the votes of illegals and their supporters than in the safety of American citizens . "
Nutter has said he opposes the agreement because he believes it discourages illegal immigrants from reporting crimes out of fear that they will be deported -- a notion ICE disputes , saying it is only looking to deport violent criminals .
Under the agreement , feds can examine the city 's Preliminary Arraignment Reporting System , or PARS , a computerized record system that automatically releases information about victims and witnesses of crimes along with those arrested on criminal offenses .
The city 's contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , known as ICE , ends August 31 .
Nutter needs to convince the other stakeholders in the program , District Attorney Seth Williams and Municipal Court President Judge Marsha Neifield , not to renew the contract .
Neither has yet publicly stated a position .
City officials have said that PARS is no longer relevant because the city participates in ICE 's Secure Communities program , which allows authorities to check the immigration status of individuals they arrest through fingerprinting .
But Mariann Davies , an organizer with the Tea Party Immigration Coalition , told FoxNews.com that ending PARS would create a double standard because she said Philadelphia would still provide arrest records to the feds for anyone who is not an immigrant .
" So who is that protecting ? " she said .
" I think it 's more about political expediency on the mayor 's part .
He wants to win votes rather than increase public safety . "
Maura Kennedy , a spokeswoman for Nutter , told FoxNews.com that the city has fully cooperated with the federal government on immigration , saying that Philadelphia was the only big city in America to participate in PARS .
" Philadelphia was the only city in the country to cooperate with the federal government to this extent , " she said .
" But we have found this information that the federal government does not need or use has had a chilling effect on the process and reporting of crimes , which affects all Americans . "
" So now , we hope to restrict the sharing of data to what the federal government needs and wants , " she said .
Kennedy said the mayor has not ignored requests to meet with supporters of the program .
" The mayor has a very busy calendar , " she said , adding that it takes at least six weeks to get any event scheduled .
LOCKERROOM
The local people who have put so much of their heart and soul into the last month , are really just extras with local accents .
Backdrop .
SO SOUTH Africa ’s World Cup comes to an end , the beloved country ’s “ time to shine ” runs out and this morning it ’s back to the hump and grind of everyday living .
As the sun rises , the flatbed trucks will take to the highways of Johannesburg , filled at the back with men from Soweto crouching and holding the side for balance as they are taken away for a day ’s labour .
Meanwhile , the world will be evacuating through Oliver Tambo International with the odd gratuity and thank you fluttering behind .
The more World Cups you go to , the more you feel you are part of an ongoing confidence trick .
The South African people who have put so much of their heart and soul into the last month are really just extras with local accents .
Backdrop .
Everything else takes place as part of a franchised operation which , while retaining its slickness , is only seen every four years .
The media tent this is being written in could be anywhere in the world ( in fact , it was imported from Germany , Fifa finding the local makes unsatisfactory ) .
The hospitality tents outside .
The system of shuttles and traffic control .
The corporatised travel and accommodation operations .
The crowd control .
All the same .
Even the interior of the stadiums feels the same .
The trick every four years is for the usual corporate bandits to fool the local population into believing this World Cup is theirs .
And then to depart with the bill still on the table .
The stadiums here cost two billion rand more than they were supposed to and the host cities got to pick up the excess tabs .
Can there ever be a World Cup without cost over - runs ?
Not really if you are selling steel and the man from the World Cup comes looking to buy as much steel as you can give him .
Well , let ’s just say you see him coming from a very long way away .
The same if you are a labour leader .
And then you have to deal with Fifa .
And their likes and dislikes .
Fifa had € 2.6 billion in TV and marketing rights tucked away before a ball was kicked here and unconfirmed reports suggest they retain 94 per cent of total profits .
The German World Cup yielded € 2.3 billion in profits .
This World Cup will cough up more .
You would think they would be happy .
Yet , for instance , Cape Town had wished to revamp the existing Athlone Stadium to host its World Cup Games .
Athlone Stadium .
Fifa did not approve .
The surrounding area was too depressingly run down .
TV would n’t like it .
In Durban , a 56,000 - seater World Cup stadium was constructed a couple of hundred yards away from the existing Kings Park Stadium , which holds 50,000 .
Speaking of coming from a very long way away , the South African tourism industry was rubbing its hands at the prospect of attracting over three million tourists in their winter season .
No figures are available yet but every hotelier and taxi driver you speak to expresses disappointment .
Rightly so .
Forecasts are down hugely since the heady days when the South African bid succeeded .
Match AG , looking after the World Cup accommodation needs for the sixth tournament in a row , were forced to dump 450,000 pre-booked rooms back on the market .
The one place which is visibly thriving , stuffed all the time with tourists , is the white enclave of Sandton in Johannesburg ; its fine restaurants and couture shops and American - style malls have been the official and unofficial centre for the World Cup .
But Sandton did n’t need the World Cup .
Sandton , they say , is the richest square mile in Africa .
For South Africa , the overall cost of running the tournament increased tenfold from bid to ball being kicked .
A nation crawling from the wreckage of recession with an unemployment rate of 24 per cent has chucked € 4 billion in the direction of the world ’s richest sport and its corporate partners .
And the corporate partners know how to use the muscle .
In the World Cup zone you can only use an ATM if you have a Visa card .
McDonalds are everywhere .
This column attended a domestic league match here during a working visit eight years ago and the walk to the stadium was a long ramble and graze through a never - ending line of street vendors .
For the World Cup , that particular flavour of Africa has been disappeared .
Sponsors ’ tents are the only thing selling anything within the commercial exclusion zone around the grounds .
The humourless nature of this pin-striped Mafia pervades everything .
The heavy - handed treatment of the brewer Bavaria Beer for its amusing skirmishes was no surprise to those who had watched the local budget airline , Kulula , suffer the threat of legal action for using the mildly amusing slogan “ the unofficial national carrier of you know what ” .
Even the acts which opened and closed the tournament to such high visibility were bought in from a international promoter with just a token smidgin of African music thrown in .
Africa has seen worse obscenities so some perspective is necessary but with 355,000 unsold tickets left in a country where the host population had neither the money nor the infrastructure to be ordering them online , the South African government ( never the parasitical Fifa ) were forced into buying huge swathes of tickets for their own people and selling them at hugely subsidised rates .
That move chomped a huge part of the revenue stream they had been depending on but it was better than having Fifa and its broadcast partners bellyaching about half - empty stadia .
People are backdrop .
So we take our leave today and tomorrow , waving goodbye and telling our friends they were great .
Which they were .
This was an open - hearted and generous World Cup .
But we are first worlders and mé féiners and it is impossible to escape the feeling that once again South Africa has been pillaged for our pleasure and gain .
Farewell then , South Africa .
Hope you enjoyed having us .
Hope you enjoyed being had by us .
Microsoft just released its May Threat Report , and the results should give you pause .
With nearly 2 million infected systems cleaned , the nefarious Alureon rootkit came out on top .
Since it first appeared in 2006 , Alureon ( known in various incarnations as TDSS , Zlob , or DNSChanger ) has morphed into a mean money - making marvel : a varied collection of Trojans most famous for their ability to invisibly take control of your PC 's interactions with the outside world .
Alureon frequently runs as a rootkit , snatches information sent and received over the Internet , and may install a backdoor that allows Alureon 's masters to update your computer with the software of their choice .
[ Learn how to protect yourself with InfoWorld 's Roger Grimes and his 30 - minute Webcast on data loss prevention . ]
You may have heard of Alureon in connection with Microsoft 's ill - fated MS10 - 015 Security Bulletin .
The original version of the MS10 - 015 patch , when installed on some Alureon - infected Windows XP machines , resulted in a Blue Screen of Death .
Microsoft pulled the patch , then altered it to avoid Alureon - infested PCs .
This month Microsoft added Alureon .H , the latest variant , to the scanning engine of the Malicious Software Removal Tool .
( MSRT lies at the heart of Microsoft Security Essentials . )
The new variant led to a hefty 37 percent increase over last month in the number of infected PCs caught and cleaned by MSRT .
Right now , Alureon ranks as the No. 1 piece of MSRT - identified malware .
Most Alureon - infected systems run Windows XP .
Microsoft pegs the number at 78 percent , with Vista accounting for 18 percent and Windows 7 around 4 percent of infected systems .
As with most malware , people inadvertently install Alureon when they think they 're installing something else .
Microsoft's April Threat Report explains that a typical Alureon installer asks to be elevated to administrator status .
If you 're using Vista or Windows 7 and you have n't mucked with the User Account Control settings , Windows asks for permission to run the program as an administrator -- that 's one more chance to catch yourself before aiming at your foot and pulling the trigger .
If you 're running with an administrator account in Windows XP , you do n't get that one last chance .

In the fall of 1999 , the drug giant SmithKline Beecham secretly began a study to find out if its diabetes medicine , Avandia , was safer for the heart than a competing pill , Actos , made by Takeda .
Avandia ’s success was crucial to SmithKline , whose labs were otherwise all but barren of new products .
But the study ’s results , completed that same year , were disastrous .
Not only was Avandia no better than Actos , but the study also provided clear signs that it was riskier to the heart .
But instead of publishing the results , the company spent the next 11 years trying to cover them up , according to documents recently obtained by The New York Times .
The company did not post the results on its
Web site or submit them to federal drug regulators , as is required in most cases by law .
“ This was done for the U.S. business , way under the radar , ” Dr. Martin I. Freed , a SmithKline executive , wrote in an e-mail message dated March 29 , 2001 , about the study results that was obtained by The Times .
“ Per Sr. Mgmt request , these data should not see the light of day to anyone outside of GSK , ” the corporate successor to SmithKline .
The U.S. government will work to free up 500MHz of wireless spectrum for commercial and unlicensed uses over the next decade , an adviser to President Barack Obama said Monday .
Obama 's spectrum plan , which would nearly double the amount of spectrum available for mobile telephone and broadband service , largely mirrors a proposal set out in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission 's national broadband plan , released in March .
The White House plan will seek congressional approval for the FCC to share auction proceeds with U.S. television stations that voluntarily give up unused spectrum , said Lawrence Summers , assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the National Economic Council .
The Obama administration will ask for upfront planning and research funding for government agencies that agree to give up spectrum or relocate , Summers said in a speech at the New America Foundation .
" Opening up spectrum will .... create the foundation for new private - sector investment and economic opportunity in mobile broadband and a range of other high - value uses , " Summers said .
New spectrum will create jobs , with mobile carriers spending money to build out 4G networks , Summers said .
Mobile broadband will help bring broadband to rural areas and may become a low - cost alternative to fixed broadband , he said .
" Combined with increases of speed and functionality , the economic implications are likely to be profound , " he said .
" My guess is we can't really imagine what those implications will be . "
Most of the freed - up spectrum would be auctioned by the FCC and the sale would likely raise tens of billions of dollars , Summers said .
The proceeds from the auctions would pay for a nationwide mobile voice and broadband network for police and other emergency response agencies , pay down the national debt , and pay for upgrades to the nation 's communications infrastructure , such as the air traffic control system , he said .
U.S. lawmakers and public safety officials have called for a nationwide voice and broadband network for emergency responders since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S.
Many police officers , firefighters and other emergency workers responding to the attacks could n't talk to each other because they were using different kinds of communications devices and networks .
Under the White House plan , the U.S. government will create a publicly available inventory of the spectrum currently used by government and commercial users .
The goal of the inventory will be to allow spectrum holders and consumers to better understand how spectrum is used and to encourage new uses , the White House said in a statement .
Mobile - phone and broadband users are demanding more and more spectrum , with spectrum use rates often more than doubling in a year , Summers said .
Spectrum reform is needed to give the U.S. a competitive advantage over other nations that have n't assigned as much of their spectrum , Summers said .
" Our early lead in developing and disseminating technologies of yesterday leaves us ill - equipped for the technological challenges of tomorrow , " he said .
" So much more spectrum has been spoken for here than in the emerging nations we find ourselves competing with . "
Several trade groups and companies praised the White House spectrum announcement .
" The president 's order will facilitate all federal agencies working cooperatively to identify spectrum availability and best manage this scarce resource , " Vonya McCann , senior vice president for government affairs at Sprint Nextel , said in a statement .
" If the plan 's recommendations are implemented fully over the next 10 years , they will create jobs , promote innovation , and further expand the country 's broadband economy . "
But Robert McDowell , a Republican member of the FCC , said the agency can act on several spectrum initiatives right now .
The agency could decide what to do with the D block in the 700MHz band of spectrum , which did n't sell in an auction that ended in March 2008 , and it could take action on the advanced wireless services spectrum in the 1.9 through 2.1 GHz bands , he said .
In addition , the agency has n't followed up on a November 2008 vote to open up unused spectrum between television channels , the TV white spaces , he said .
" While I appreciate the spirit of today 's White House announcement regarding long - term spectrum planning , for too long the FCC has not moved forward on a number of more immediate opportunities to put the power of key slices of the airwaves into the hands of America 's consumers , " he said in a statement .

This is the rather simplistic conclusion of the big bang theory , whereby the original chemical elements of the early universe are thought to be limited to hydrogen , helium , and lithium .
According to this secular view , all the other elements , now numbering 111 , were later formed by nuclear reactions within the cores of ancient stars .
When these stars eventually exploded as supernovae , their many elements were spread far and wide throughout space .
The solar system , including the life upon planet Earth , is thought to be made of this star debris .
Thus has arisen the poetic generalization that we are all “ made of stardust ” or star debris and are therefore “ one with the universe . ”
This false idea fits in well with the New Age movement , which sees mystical connections between humanity and nature .
Man — in the form of Adam — was indeed made from the “ dust ” of the ground .
However , the Earth and its component materials were created before the stars , not from the stars ( Gen. 1:16 ) .

Elena Kagan ’s confirmation hearings this week were the first of the Tea Party era .
When Republicans pressed Ms. Kagan on the Constitution ’s commerce clause and whether she was a legal progressive , they were speaking not just about academic abstractions , but about the very ideas that animate the rebellious , conservative movement .
The Tea Party is often called “ loosely organized , ” but the unifying philosophy for groups across the country is a belief that the nation can solve its problems — primarily its economic problems , which is what its supporters care most about — if lawmakers stick to a strict interpretation of the Constitution .
Tea Party groups hand out pocket - size copies of the Constitution like party favors at their rallies and meetings .
Many supporters take classes about it on weekends , in the evenings or online , sponsored by groups like As a Mom , a Glenn Beck - inspired “ Sisterhood of Mommy Patriots , ” or the Campaign for Liberty , which Representative Ron Paul created after his unsuccessful run for president in 2008 .
They can recite parts of the Constitution by heart and refer to it , by article and section , in casual conversation .
They campaign for candidates who promote themselves as “ constitutional conservatives . ”
A few months ago , a picture appeared in The Denver Post .
On a local college campus — an alleged stronghold of free inquiry and debate — a leftist student , protesting some perceived injustice , was holding a sign that argued :
" Hate speech is not free speech ! "
Perhaps this earnest 20 - something had not fully thought through her illiberal position on " tolerable " political speech .
Perhaps she was part of that broader movement that sees " hate " everywhere among its ideological opponents .
Either way , it 's tragic that so many young people misunderstand the idea of open debate — or simply devalue liberty .
Some people accept that certain things cannot — rather than should not — be said .
Beyond the worrisome assaults on free speech ( fairness doctrines , higher education , etc. ) there is a slipperier concern .
Which brings me to Helen Thomas ' now infamous and career - ending comment , in which she helpfully suggested that the Jews get " the hell out of Palestine . "
True , I find some comfort in knowing that this unprofessional crackpot never will haunt a president , common sense , or the public again .
But I wince at the rapidity of her demise .
And I feel a nagging anxiety about a journalist 's losing her job over nothing more than a controversial statement .
" She should lose her job over this , " former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said before Thomas gave in to a forced retirement .
" As someone who is Jewish and as someone who worked with her and used to like her , I find this appalling . "
Cliff May , president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former roving reporter for Hearst ( which syndicated Thomas ' column ) , in a letter urged the company " strenuously " to " cut all ties " with Thomas " as quickly as possible . "
It seems an odd reaction , especially for conservatives , who are accused regularly of thought crimes and hate speech by outfits like Media Matters , which are in the business of smearing and discrediting those who disagree with them .
But an opinion — in Thomas ' case , an ugly opinion that in all probability is more common than some people might believe — is no more than the strength of the logic behind it .
As a regular defender of the moral right of Israel to fight the theocrats and fascists whom Thomas embraces , I never thought she was very credible or articulate on the topic , and she is unworthy of the over - the - top reactions of critics .
Nevertheless , at this point in her career , the 89 - year - old was still a columnist for Hearst newspapers .
A columnist offers provocative views .
You do n't have to like Thomas , and you do n't have to read her columns , but having a disdain for Jews in general or Israel in particular is hardly the most offensive thought that 's kicking around .
Though I do n't hold an earthly stake in debates over God , Bill Maher 's ludicrous anti-Catholic rants or a tome from a polemist like Christopher Hitchens ( who condemns all religion as a dangerous farce ) might be " appalling " to rather large swaths of the public .
Are certain topics off the table ?
Of course , I am not suggesting that Thomas has a birthright to sit in the front row at a White House news conference ( a situation that has n't made sense for at least three decades ) or that anyone has an inalienable right to pontificate about the world for a newspaper chain or anyone else .
And no , I can't mourn the loss of Helen Thomas ' detestable opinions .
But at the same time , I can't help but feel some trepidation about the ease in which some voices — in this case , one voice that is probably more honest than others of similar ideological disposition — can be expelled from the conversation simply for offending .

Washington ( CNN ) --
A long and winding road brought Sir Paul McCartney to the White House on Wednesday , where he was honored by the president of the United States and performed some of the most famous songs from his catalogue with the Beatles and after .
President Barack Obama awarded McCartney the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song and then , along with a little help from some of his friends , such as Stevie Wonder , Faith Hill , Elvis Costello , Emmylou Harris and others , McCartney rocked the East Room of the White House .
Obama noted McCartney had been involved in writing more than 200 songs that had made the charts of bestsellers , and his songs had stayed on those charts for a cumulative total of over 32 years .
McCartney shook his head in wonder at that fact .
" Nearly half a century since four lads from Liverpool first landed on our shores and changed everything overnight , " Obama said , noting that the bass McCartney played Wednesday was the same one from when the Beatles performed on TV's Ed Sullivan Show in the 1960s .
The Gershwin Prize , America 's highest award for popular music , was bestowed on behalf of a grateful nation , " grateful that a young Englishman shared his dream with us , " Obama said .
McCartney thanked Obama for the honor and , in a short political comment , said that he and " billions " of others supported what the president was doing in the face of many challenges .
Later , McCartney ended the night by saying , in reference to the prize from the Library of Congress , it was good that after the last eight years , America had a president who knew what a library was .
The music for the event , which was taped for a PBS special , included unique and riveting versions of well - known songs by a variety of artists .
Wonder performed " We Can Work Out It Out , " starting over at one point when he could n't find his harmonica .
Costello sang " Penny Lane " , noting his mother grew up near the location of the song , while Harris sang " For No One , " noting it was " the sad song . "
McCartney performed the duet " Ebony and Ivory " with Wonder , and then ended the event with some of the most popular songs of his career , including the love ballad " Michelle " in honor of the first lady , who attended with both first daughters and the first grandmother .
McCartney quipped that , given the song 's title , he might be the first guest to get punched out by the president .
He followed that with " Eleanor Rigby , " " Let It Be " and a rousing " Hey Jude " that concluded with the first family and all the performers on stage , singing along to the well - known refrain of the title .
On Tuesday , McCartney toured the Library of Congress , rehearsed for Wednesday 's concert and held a news conference with reporters .
They asked the former Beatle about everything from performance royalties and the role of songwriters today to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
McCartney noted that he is not a politician , but said the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is a disgrace .
" I think the fact that something like that can happen and the people who are to blame do n't have the ability to instantly cap it and clean it up is something that 's going to be addressed , " he said .
Obama mentioned the oil spill in his remarks Wednesday , saying the nation shared in the sorrow of people from the Gulf coast region that also has a rich musical heritage .
He noted that people on the Gulf Coast were " dealing with something we have not seen before , " and called the situation " heartbreaking . "
The president pledged the nation 's commitment " to see to it that their lives and their community are made whole again . "

Libraries !
They are perhaps the greatest social and financial ill of our time — a pox upon surfaces conducive to poxes !
It is with these opinions in mind that Fox News has formulated a very serious - minded and also tenable and effective solution to America ’s debt : “ Keeping libraries running costs big money .
In Chicago , the city pumps $ 120 million a year into them .
In fact , a full 2.5 percent of our yearly property taxes go to fund them .
That 's money that could go elsewhere — like for schools , the CTA , police or pensions . ”
Sorry , quick clarifying point : specifically the parts of schools that do n’t contain books .
And furthermore , “ with the internet and e-books , do we really need millions for libraries ? ”
The Chicago Fox affiliate even embedded a correspondent on the frontlines on the War on Literacy .

Ronnie O'Sullivan survived a Liang Wenbo fightback to reach the last 16 of the World Championship with a 10 - 7 win .
Resuming at 7 - 2 the three - time champion stole two of the first four frames which included a 60 break cut short by a pot before the black was replaced .
After a highest break of 39 on Monday , Liang roared back with a 103 and 127 to take four in a row and pile the pressure on O'Sullivan .
The ' Rocket ' clung on and now faces a resurgent Mark Williams on Saturday .
The unpredictable nature of O'Sullivan continued to plague his game and the 23 - year - old Chinese , while impressing with a number of long pots , failed to take advantage of a number of chances at crucial stages in this match .
Fighting to recover from 7 - 2 down , he started well but having led 60 - 7 in the 10th his opponent stole it with a stunning 34 that included a miraculous shot from pink to yellow .
606 : DEBATE
If Ronnie can't get his head right it will be an early exit this year
Dwayne Dibbley
It was a frame full of drama on and off the baize as referee Colin Humphries , 24 hours after warning O'Sullivan for a hand gesture , was forced to call a foul after Chigwell 's finest potted a red when on 60 with the black ball still to be returned to the spot .
The break had lasted just over two minutes as Humphries struggled to keep up with the pace of O'Sullivan in full flow .
The frame was already won but it certainly did not ease the tension clearly simmering between the pair in front of the packed Crucible audience .
Liang , the 2008 world quarter - finalist , who recently earned a place in the provisional top 16 rankings , kept battling and won three in a row which included knocks of 61 and a 103 .
O'Sullivan , eyeing his 23rd ranking title , looked increasingly concerned having to spend longer spells in his chair and worse was to come when Liang knocked in a 127 - the highest break of the tournament so far .
It was a very nervy finish for the 2001 , 2004 and 2008 champion but he hung on with a 73 in the last to set up a mouth - watering clash with Williams three months after their epic last - frame thriller in the Masters semi-final .
" I just did n't get going and he looked quite dangerous so the pressure was getting on me a bit and I had to find something from somewhere , " the 34 - year - old said .
" The nerves play a big part here and unless you settle and get into your rhythm it can be tough out there .
" I just need to find some consistency . "
Looking ahead to the contest with Williams he said : " It will be a tough game .
he 's playing well at the moment and it's a hard draw .
He 's the only player than can probably beat John Higgins .
I could have done with an easier match really . "

Anchovies
The base of this classic steak sauce is tiny saltwater fish that have been aged in vinegar - filled wooden tanks for 18 months .
The fermentation releases inosinate , a nucleotide that tastes savory , or , if you 're being technical , umami .
Vinegar
This mild acid breaks down the anchovies and lends a tart flavor note .
US formulations use white vinegar ( made from wine ) .
Canadian recipes require spirit vinegar and malt vinegar ( made from ale ) .
Onions
Steeping with the anchovies , onions provide glutamic acid to enhance savoriness .
Molasses
Heat up Worcestershire and you detect the unmistakable , deeply sweet flavor of dark , thick sugarcane extract .
Some lesser ( non - L&P ) versions just use brown sugar — sugar with residual molasses .
High - Fructose Corn Syrup
It 's tough to find a processed food in the US that does n't use HFCS .
If you want actual sugar , import some Worcestershire from Canada .
Salt
It takes a lot of salt to ferment the anchovies , so this condiment is clearly not for low - sodium diets .
Still , Worcestershire is only about a third as salty as soy sauce .
Garlic
Sulfurous compounds like allicin and diallyl disulfide give garlic its smell .
They also excite the body 's pain receptors and dilate blood vessels .
Garlic rush !
Tamarind
The sweet - and - sour aroma of this fruit comes through as a strong top note in a whiff of Worcestershire .
Legend has it that the first batch of the sauce was commissioned by a British nobleman trying to re-create a flavor he'd enjoyed in Bengal , adding a bit of colonial exoticism to what is basically fish sauce .
Cloves
Worcestershire 's sharp bite on the tip of the tongue starts with eugenol , an aromatic molecule that 's the main component in clove oil and similar to compounds found in nutmeg and ginger .
Chili Pepper Extract
The tangy flavor finishes here .
Technically called capsaicin , it 's a carbon ring followed by a chain of carbon atoms ( with nitrogen , hydrogen , and oxygen ) .
That structure fits more or less securely onto the heat receptors on your tongue , conning your brain into thinking your mouth is under assault without causing actual damage .
Natural Flavorings
The true secret of Worcestershire .
Heinz , which owns Lea & Perrins , wo n't confirm , but the cocktail allegedly contains a spice dubbed asafetida ( aka devil 's dung ) .
The raw stuff stinks like rotting garlic , but when cooked , the taste is oniony .
Soy sauce , lemons , and pickles might also have made cameos over the years .
Water
Straight out of the vats , the vinegar - anchovy - onion concoction is overpowering .
Water proofs down the pungency to make Worcestershire table - safe ( and presumably improves the profit margin ) .
Image caption Radiohead let fans name their own price for their last album , In Rainbows
Radiohead singer Thom Yorke has told aspiring musicians to avoid the " sinking ship " of major record labels .
Giving advice to young artists in a new school textbook , he said : " When the corporate industry dies it will be no great loss to the world .
" So , I guess I would say , do n't tie yourself to the sinking ship because , believe me , it 's sinking . "
Radiohead were signed to EMI for 12 years but released their last album In Rainbows via their own website in 2007 .
EMI is now in a particularly precarious position , with major debts and restructuring issues following a takeover by private equity firm Terra Firma in 2007 .
The songwriter made his comments in the Rax Active Citizenship Toolkit , published next month by New Internationalist magazine for students of GCSE Citizenship Studies .
' Matter of time '
In the interview , carried out in February , Yorke said the fate of new artists was " an obsession " of bandmate Ed O'Brien , who is a leading member of lobby group the Featured Artists ' Coalition .
Yorke said : " When we discuss it , he says it 's simply a matter of time - months rather than years - before the music business establishment completely folds .
" He is involved in trying to build a world where artists would finally get paid .
But we are up against the self - protecting interests of that industry . "
Radiohead are currently working on new material , but it is not known how they will release it .
Yorke has recently been performing with a new band , Atoms For Peace , and is playing a solo show at the Big Chill festival in Herefordshire in August .
President Barack Obama won a defense of his handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill from one GOP congressman on Thursday .
Rep. Ron Paul , the libertarian Republican lawmaker from Texas , said that people were expecting too much from the president in his ability to react to the ongoing spill into the Gulf .
" I'm a pretty big critic of the president , " Paul said during an appearance on " Imus in the Morning " on the Fox Business Network , " but I just do n't see the justification for coming down hard on the president . "
" I think it represents the idea that the American people think the president is everything to everybody that he should fix an oil leak , " Paul added .
Some lawmakers , including many Republicans , have questioned the administration 's responsiveness to the spill , as well as whether the administration has been aggressive enough in pushing BP , the oil company that leases the leaking pipeline , to end the flow gushing into the Gulf .
But Paul suggested that there was little the president could do personally to end the spill , arguing that Obama could do more to help out with the spill and the cleanup by clearing out and waiving federal regulations so that governors of the states affected by the spill have more leeway in addressing cleanup efforts .
The Icelandic parliament has voted unanimously to create what are intended to be the strongest media freedom laws in the world .
And Iceland intends these measures to have international impact , by creating a safe haven for publishers worldwide — and their servers .
The proposal , known as the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative , requires changes to Icelandic law to strengthen journalistic source protection , freedom of speech , and government transparency .
“ The Prime Minister voted for it , and the Minister of Finance , and everybody present , ” says Icelandic Member of Parliament Birgitta Jónsdóttir , who has been the proposal ’s chief sponsor .
Her point is that Iceland is serious about this .
The country is in the mood for openness after a small group of bankers saddled it with crippling debt , and the proposal ties neatly into the country ’s strategy to be prime server real - estate .
But although the legislative package sounds very encouraging from a freedom of expression point of view , it ’s not clear what the practical benefits will be to organizations outside Iceland .
In his analysis of the proposal , Arthur Bright of the Citizen Media Law Project has noted that , in one major test case of cross - border online libel law , “ publication ” was deemed to occur at the point of download — meaning that serving a controversial page from Iceland wo n’t keep you from getting sued in other countries .
But if nothing else , it would probably prevent your servers from being forcibly shut down .
There might be other benefits too .
Wikileaks says that it routes all submissions through Sweden , where investigations into the identity of an anonymous source are illegal .
Wikileaks was heavily involved in drafting and promoting the Icelandic package , and whatever your opinion of their current controversies , they ’ve proven remarkably immune to legal prosecution in their short history .
Conceivably , other journalism organizations could gain some measure of legal protection for anonymous sources if all communications were routed through Iceland .
All of which is to say that issues of press censorship have long since passed the point of globalization .
When an aggrieved party in country A can sue a publisher in country B through the courts of country C ( as in these examples ) , press freedom must be understood — and fought for — at an international level .
“ It has not only an impact here , but in changing the dialog in Europe , ” Birgitta Jónsdóttir told me .
But it will be some time before the full repercussions of Iceland ’s move are felt .
For a start , the new laws are not yet written .
Icelandic lawyer Elfa Ýir of the Ministry of Culture is leading the drafting effort , and expects to have the help of volunteer legal experts and law students .
( “ Iceland is still suffering from the financial meltdown , ” says Birgitta Jónsdóttir . )
The complex legislative changes will be passed in several parts , possibly beginning late this year .
“ It should be done in about a year , ” Birgitta Jónsdóttir said .
“ I ’ll be following this very closely . ”
And then it may be further years before we understand , from case law , exactly what an “ offshore freedom of expression haven ” means to journalists worldwide .
Nonetheless , I hope to get a discussion started among the high - powered media law types at the Annenberg - Oxford Summer Institute next month , and we ’ll see if we can get a more precise understanding of the practical consequences of Iceland ’s move — and how journalists might use it to protect their work .
If you have some insight , do drop the Lab a line .

A Giant Planet for Beta Pic
Credit : A. - M. Lagrange , D. Ehrenreich ( LAOG ) , et al. , ESO
Explanation : A mere 50 light - years away , young star Beta Pictoris became one of the most important stars in the sky in the early 1980s .
Satellite and ground - based telescopic observations revealed the presence of a surrounding outer , dusty , debris disk and an inner clear zone about the size of our solar system -- strong evidence for the formation of planets .
Infrared observations from European Southern Observatory telescopes subsequently detected a source in the clear zone , now confirmed as a giant planet orbiting Beta Pic .
The confirmation comes as the planet is detected at two different positions in its orbit .
Designated Beta Pictoris b , the giant planet must have formed rapidly as Beta Pic itself is only 8 to 20 million years old .
With an orbital period estimated between 17 and 44 years , Beta Pictoris b could lie near the orbit of Saturn if found in our solar system , making it the closest planet to its parent star directly imaged ... so far .
The planned permanent solution for the BP Macondo spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the killing of the well by drilling a relief well to intersect the blowout wellbore , enabling the placement of high density mud and eventually cement .
Currently , two relief wells are being drilled , one started on May 2 and the second on May 14 ( although the latter was delayed a few days later on ) .
On The Oil Drum and elsewhere , many have been questioning why only two relief wells have been sunk , given the risky and uncertain nature of the kill process and the long time lag in getting more wells drilled if the first two are unsuccessful .
There are many technical , political , and economic arguments that can be used to justify the need for more wells .
What I will do herein is develop a statistical model which can be used to weigh the potential benefits of additional wells added this late in the crisis .
One of the more critical factors is time -- the time it takes before the blowout wells is killed .
Does drilling more relief wells change the expected time before the kill ?
There is some recent news and concern about the relief wells and the delays in getting started :
But BP did n't begin drilling the relief well until 12 days after the start of the disaster as the company and government rushed through environmental reviews , permits and other plans .
The government does not require oil companies to have relief well plans in place ahead of time , and the lack of planning cost the company valuable time to get the spill under control .
The drilling seems to be on schedule ,
BP says the relief well has been a success and ahead of schedule , representing a welcome change for engineers who have been attempting one risky , untested maneuver after another .
Relief wells are a more proven method in the industry , and engineers are comfortable and confident in the process .
but it still will be a while .
Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president of exploration and production , said this week that more details would be released when the process nears completion in early August .
Should more have been drilled , based on the difficulties of the task and the chances for success ?
How do these chances affect the time frame we are looking at to get the well plugged ?
Here is one way of looking at the problem , starting with a game of chance .
Roll the Dice
Consider the following game which consists of the rolling of a single die .
A single play consists of rolling it again and again until you get a six , counting the number of rolls it takes .
Play the game many times , and keep score like this :
After many , many plays , the statistics get rather good and you can make a bar chart showing the frequency of each roll count divided by the total number of plays :
To be more exact , you would need to go higher than ten ( infinitely high , actually ) , but you get the idea .
This shows the statistics of how many rolls it takes to have a six come up .
One is the most likely number of rolls , although it is of course more likely to take more than one .
Now , let 's change the game a little .
We secretly replace the die with one that explodes occasionally , ending that particular play .
So you grab another ( similarly loaded ) die and play again -- but making sure to count the play that went awry as an attempt .
The same probability profile would appear , except that the overall probability for getting a six would be less .
Now let 's change the game a bit more .
Instead of the number of rolls it takes , we are interested in the amount of time it takes to get a six .
There is an average amount of time it takes to pick up the die and roll it again .
If it took five rolls on one particular play , it would take something like five times the average for one roll .
There would be some variability in the time , of course , and the spread would increase with the particular roll count we are interested in since there is a contribution from the spread of previous rolls .
Before I get more specific on how this is done , or what happens if we roll more than one die , let us leave the analogy behind .
But not before I add one more twist : the first roll seems to take forever .
Rolling Relief : The Assumptions
Let us consider the time probability for killing the blowout well with a relief well in the same way .
There is an initial drilling period ( rather long ) to reach near the blowout wellbore , and then a certain probability that it will be successfully intersected , called P s .
If the try fails , the drillbit is backed up some , the hole is plugged , and a new attempt to find the wellbore is made .
While not necessary , it will be assumed in this model that the probability for success remains the same for each retry .
Also included is a probability that , during each additional attempt to intersect the wellbore , that the relief well becomes useless , perhaps due to a hopelessly stuck drillstring .
I will call this the probability of " utter failure " , or P u .
The time needed to drill to the vicinity of the blowout wellbore will vary , as a number of things will affect the rate at which the drill bit moves .
If one were to attempt the same task many times independently with the same starting conditions ( obviously not possible ) , the set of the times required would take the form of some kind of statistical distribution .
I will assume the normal ( Gaussian ) distribution , as shown below ( e.g. mean time of 70 days and a standard deviation of 5 days ) .
Let us assume a 20 % probability for success ( P s =.20 ) , which could include both hitting the wellbore and successfully filling it with mud and cement .
Thus , the Gaussian above would be multiplied by that factor .
This gives us the probability at any point in time .
What we are more interested in , though , is how this probability is manifested in time ; that is , how long do we wait for success .
Instead of the probability distribution , we can look at the cumulative probability distribution , again scaled by the success probability :
This is arrived at by calculating a running sum of the probabilities from left to right .
With the values assumed in this example , it takes about 80 days for the full effect .
However , since we only have a 20 % success rate , this is not likely to be a successful resolution of the problem , and many wells would be required to insure a kill .
For a given relief well , however , we get more than one crack at it .
The drill bit is backed up , the hole is plugged , and a sidetrack is drilled for another attempt .
This retry consumes additional time , and we can also describe this time delay with a Gaussian distribution with a separate mean and standard deviation .
The effect of the additional delay is as follows : if we consider the distribution as a large set of kill attempts in identical circumstances , 20 % of these would be successful within about 80 days .
Aside from a small fraction that will have failed completely , the remainder of the set will continue on with a retry .
There will be a time delay , but we also have an additional spreading of the time distribution .
This can be mathematically described as the convolution of the initial time distribution with a second distribution corresponding to the retry .
Visually , one can describe various small segments ( or discreet points ) of the original distribution each giving rise to its own new distribution .
The sum of all such distributions comprises the overall distribution of arrival times for the second attempt .
This will be another Gaussian ; conveniently , the convolution of two Gaussians is another Gaussian with the standard deviation equal to the sum of the variances of the two and with a mean equal to the sum of the two means .
Defining the following parameters :
Mean Time for Initial Drill t 1 Spread for Initial Drill Time SD 1 Mean Time for Redrill t 2 Spread for Redrill Time SD 2
the successes from the initial attempt will be characterized by :
G 1 = P s .
Gaussian(t 1 , SD 1 )
where G( ) is a normalized Gaussian distribution with the given mean time and SD .
Those failed attempts that remain for each retry will give rise to a new Gaussian , displaced in time by that needed for the additional drilling etc. , and this will have the form has the form :
G i = Gaussian(t 2 , SD 2 ) * Gaussian(t i- 1 ,SD i- 1 )
Because of the convolution properties of Gaussians , this can be arrived at by constructing a new Gaussian displaced from the previous by the mean time for a retry and with a standard deviation somewhat larger :
SD i = SQRT ( SD i-1 ^2 + SD 2 ^2 )
and a scaling factor P i which can be calculated for each retry recursively as :
Alternately , one could for each retry perform a discreet convolution of the retry broadening / delay function with the previous result ( if something besides Gaussians were used , for example ) .
The back - up - and - redrill process can in principle be repeated infinitely many times , although there is probably a practical limit to how many side holes can be drilled in the single relief well .
Here is an example showing success probability distributions for a single relief well with multiple retries , with each retry contributing its own Gaussian :
The following values are assumed :
Mean time to drill well ( days ) 70 Mean time for each re-attempt ( days ) 10 Standard deviaton for initial drill time 5 Standard deviaton for each re-attempt 2 Probability for intersecting well per try 0.2 Probability for loss of well per try 0.05
The overall probability distribution for success will be the sum of the individual Gaussians .
To see how this impacts the anticipated time to kill the well , we look again instead at the cumulative distribution for all successes :
This illustrates the effect of the delay time for each retry , and why a single number , the overall success probability for a relief well ( even if one can arrive at such a number ) does not fully describe the situation .
That the probability converges on a number less than unity is due to the small probability of " utter failure " with each attempt , meaning that the relief well is abandoned , and also because a finite number of retries were included .
As it is , the overall success rate with the chosen parameters is higher than that occasionally mentioned for a single relief well ( ~75 % ) .
To get better odds -- and to decrease the amount of time before the blowout is killed , and hence the amount of oil potentially spilled -- more relief wells are needed .
More Wells = More Relief ?
To summarize where we have come thus far , I started with one relief well with a modest ( 20 % ) probability of killing the well in one try .
Because of the time needed to drill it , and some variability in the amount of time , this probability shows up within a small window of time ( ~70 days from the start of drilling ) .
Next , I added the possibility of more than one try with this well ( to back up a bit for another attempt takes some time ) .
Because we take more swings , the eventual probability gets much higher ( over 80 % ) , but there is a time lag in getting there .
So now we add more relief wells , identical to the first except perhaps with regards to the start time .
If we assume that additional relief wells have the same probability for success that the first had , it follows that each well will have the same cumulative probability distributions as the first .
But how do these act in concert ?
A simplistic assumption is that they just get summed together .
However , it is easy to see how this is not correct .
For example , flipping two coins does not give 100 % probability of one of them landing with heads showing .
The solution is to consider what is required for the oil to be still flowing at a specific time : none of the relief wells will have worked by then .
The probability of that being the case at a specific time , for each well , is 1 minus the cumulative probability distributions ( CDP ) at that time .
Furthermore , the combined probability that no wells have succeeded is the product of these calculated values as follows :
Let us consider the cases of 1 - 4 relief wells started at the same time ( increasing number of wells towards the upper left ) :
One effect is to increase the ultimate success probability , primarily after the addition of a second well .
Another effect , though , is to decrease the time elapsed before a certain probability of success is reached .
For example , it takes about 178 days to reach 80 % probability with one well , 115 days with two wells , 96 days with three , and 87 days with four .
With thousands of barrels of oil flowing into the sea per day , this is a lot of pollution potentially mitigated by a couple more relief wells .
Unfortunately , we no longer have the luxury of starting relief wells at time=0 .
The second relief well is perhaps 18 days behind the first , and no others are scheduled .
Does adding more now make a difference ?
Here is the effect of adding wells 3 and 4 , at +50 days , to the two currently being drilled at ( wells 1 and 2 at 0 days and +18 days ) .
Although the increase in the ultimate success probability is the same , the benefit at the 80 % probability level is minimal .
Is it worth it , then , to drill more wells now ?
Certainly , it is logical to conclude that the benefit of additional wells at this point is much less than if they were started right away .
Should More Be Drilled Now ?
Even if this model is a good one , the probabilities for relief well success are not known with any degree of confidence .
I have chosen parameters which are consistent with predictions of when the well could be killed ( August ) , the approximate probability of success , and time needed to regroup and try again after a swing and a miss .
But the results suggest that , barring the loss of one or more of the current wells , additional wells will not significantly affect the time before the blowout is quenched .
Readers are invited to download the spreadsheet used for this analysis , change the assumptions to those which you find more defensible , and offer up the results for further discussion .
In spite of that , Many will argue for at least one more well anyway , and I would probably fall into that camp .
Wells are drilled all the time based on the chance for a big payout , and then never go into production .
Hopefully another wo n't be needed , but the risk of not capping the well as soon as possible should be obvious to BP , and waiting until circumstances force the issue of another well will not go over well .
In retrospect , they should have looked at the calendar ( with the upcoming stormy season approaching ) , considered yet another unthinkable scenario regarding relief well success , and planned accordingly .
In lieu of that happening several weeks ago , the time is now for BP to go above and beyond what they think is required .
And with the deepwater drilling moratorium in place , many rigs are looking for something to do .
The spreadsheet which was used for these calculations can be downloaded here .
The " honey - do " yard list can get pretty long sometimes .
But what you do n't do is often just as important as what you do do — maybe more so .
Doing unnecessary jobs can even get you into deep doo - doo , for that matter .
Ponder these items for your " honey - don't " list :
Stop bagging the grass clippings : Bagging clips removes a great source of nutrients while adding to the waste stream .
Cut high enough and often enough that you do n't produce clumps , then let those clips break down in place .
And , no , grass clips do n't cause thatch .
No spraying everything just in case :
You 're polluting , wasting money and killing off the good bugs along with pest bugs .
Identify plant problems and treat only when and where necessary .
Most problems are fairly specific , temporary and cosmetic ... they do n't spread to kill everything in the yard if you do n't act .
Stop over - fertilizing : Many people overdo it with fertilizer , which also wastes money , pollutes and can be counter - productive to plant health .
Only potted plants benefit from regular fertilizer applications .
An annual spring organic or slow - release fertilizer is enough for most perennials , shrubs and evergreens , while trees usually are fine on their own .
Even lawns do n't have to have four or five feedings per year — especially not repeated doses of phosphorus , which is a big problem when it runs off into waterways .
Also never fertilize a lawn in summer when it 's brown or heading into dormancy from drought .
Less frequent watering : Again , pots usually need water daily but not in - ground plants .
Even young annual flowers in beds prefer a deep watering every three or four days to light waterings every day or two .
Established trees and shrubs and most established perennial flowers can go weeks without water .
Water deeply when you do — enough to dampen the root zone , not just the mulch .
Skip staking routinely :
If you 're planting a big tree with a little rootball ( not a good idea anyway ) or planting in a windy area , then , yes , stake .
But only for the first year .
Otherwise , skip it .
Tree roots actually establish faster when allowed some " play " in the breeze .
Just watch that your new tree does n't start to lean soon after planting .
Straighten it and then stake if it does .
Do n't remove every fallen leaf : Leaves are a gardener 's friend .
They insulate plants in winter and break down into wonderful , nutritious organic matter .
Only remove what threatens to mat down the lawn or evergreen groundcovers .
Mulch over the rest in spring .
And if you feel you must remove them , at least compost them .
Less mulch : Some wood or bark mulch over your beds is good for weed control and moisture retention .
Too much is bad .
More than 2 or 3 inches around woody plants and more than 1 or 2 inches around flowers can suffocate roots and hinder summer rain from reaching the soil .
Especially harmful is packing mulch up against stems and trunks , which encourages rot .
Do n't keep adding more and more mulch if you already have enough .
Just cultivate the existing mulch — and pull it a few inches away from those trunks .
Judicious pruning :
Do you really need those perfectly manicured balls and boxes ?
Constant healing and replacement of lost growth is energy - sapping for plants .
Consider lighter , looser and / or less frequent pruning instead of unrelenting , merciless shearings .
Also knock off all pruning by late summer as the landscape heads into dormancy .
That 's when people are most tempted to whack ( after a season 's worth of growth ) , but it 's the least healthiest time for plants .
Late - season pruning is also when you 'll cut the flower buds off of spring - blooming shrubs .
Less tilling :
This can be counter - productive by chopping up earthworms and disrupting air spaces among the soil particles — particularly if clayish soil is tilled when wet .
Loosening the soil makes sense at bed - building time when you 're adding organic matter , but after that , just mulch lightly and try not to walk on plant beds any more than necessary .

SALT LAKE CITY --
A puppy rescued from the bowels of a deep slot canyon is now recovering in Salt Lake City after a close brush with death .
The man who rescued him documented much of the incredible story with his own video camera .
Imagine trying to get a dog that 's near death out of a deep canyon , all by yourself -- and at the same time , getting yourself out by rope .
On top of that , imagine shooting video much of the time .
That 's the story we have to tell .
They do n't know his real name , so they just call him Puppy .
He 's now a temporary shop - dog at The Wrench - It Center , owned by Zak & Michelle Anderegg .
" He was completely starved , " Zak Anderegg said .
" He was , my best guess , 24 to 48 hours from being dead . "
That was last week in a slot canyon near the Utah - Arizona border .
It 's so deep and narrow and twisted , some sections are dark in the middle of the day .
Sometimes by flashlight , Zak was rappelling and climbing deep .
He suddenly saw a dog , starving , dehydrated .
" I cannot believe I found this guy down in this frickin ' pothole in this canyon , " he said .
He climbed out to get water .
On the way back down he wondered how the puppy got there .
" The rim of the canyon is 350 feet above us , so falling from the rim would have killed him , " Zak said .
" Every single time I work it through my head , I come up with the same answer : someone put him there " -- left , abandoned .
He climbed out again and drove to Page , Ariz. , to recruit a rescue team .
" They told me flat - out , ' We 're certainly not going to send out the fire department or the sheriff 's department to help you . '
So I said , ' All right , I 'll manage on my own . ' "
The next morning he was back with a cat carrier and a plan , using ropes in a one - man rescue operation .
" I took risks , " Zak said .
" But none above what I do anyway . "
He rigged up a system to attach the cat carrier to his ropes and stabilize it .
Then he climbed back out .
The Page Animal Hospital saved Puppy 's life .
Most of the costs were covered by the hospital 's Angel Fund .
" The rate of improvement is just incredible , " Zak said .
" I 'd say within two weeks he 'll be at his weight . "
Michelle and Zak still have n't decided whether to keep him , since they 're already a pet - heavy family .
They welcome inquiries from qualified people who can give him a good home , and they 're encouraging contributions to the Angel Fund for future emergencies .
Anyone interested in adopting Puppy can reach Zak at zak@wrench-it.com .

One of the advantages of handing out a new phone to developers ( and media ) at Google I\O a couple weeks before the public availability is that you get a whole lot of hardcore testing .
And such is the case of the HTC Evo 4G .
A little issue that 's cropped up is that the phone sometimes finds that it can't write to the storage card , which can cause crashes , hang - ups and occasional stiffness in joints .
I 've only experienced this a few times , and a reboot clears it right up , but it 's still a pain .
The good news is that HTC has been aware of the problem and tells us the following :
" We have identified the cause of the memory card issue and are testing a solution .
We expect to have a software solution available very shortly that will be automatically pushed to phones over the air . "
How 's that for service , boys and girls ?
So the sky 's not falling , your storage card is n't out to get you , and we 'll hopefully see this fix soon enough .

Whenever the astronauts look out of the window , they find themselves mesmerised by the glowing , shimmering sphere of plasma that surrounds their spacecraft .
Hard to believe that the modest electromagnet at the heart of their ship can produce something so beautiful .
Not that the magnet ’s raison d’être is aesthetic , of course .
Its main function is to keep the astronauts from a slow , horrible death by radiation sickness .
NASA is nervous about sending astronauts to Mars – and understandably so .

Earlier : Ladies Get A Special Kind Of World Cup Coverage
I had the distinct pleasure , this week , of bringing you a story straight from the bowels of /b/ on the notorious site 4 chan.org .
In case you ’re not familiar , 4 chan started innocently enough as an image board , what it has grown into is something far greater than the sum of its parts .
While this is n’t meant as a plug to the site , or to condone some of the things that happen on it , I think that there are some great lessons to be learned when we take away all of the rules .
1. OC Is King
Original content , often referred to as OC on 4 chan , is the holy grail of sharing .
Nothing can grab the attention of the masses faster or more solidly than a story that we ’ve not heard elsewhere .
In new media , we ’re all guilty of word play , fast switching and getting a story pushed out to our front pages as quickly as possible .
What happens , because of that , is a decided lack of OC .
Mike Arrington , of TechCrunch , I think said it best when referring to the iPhone 4 ’s antenna problems .
I ’m paraphrasing here , but he essentially said that if it ’s always a race to get the story out first then we ’ll never find the deeper issues .
In other words , spend less time worrying about the big headline and more time worrying about providing an original look at what you ’re writing about .
That lack of original content is a downward spiral of lacking creativity that seriously needs to end .
2. Be Your Audience
The single most telling factor in the success of a product is whether it appeals to its intended audience .
This is something that 4 chan has mastered long ago .
The site is full of people who are brazen and unashamed of who they are .
In that standoff against the rest of the world , they ’ve found common ground on which to unite .
New media , and bloggers especially , have an issue with remembering who they are .
Every day there seems to be a new article about blogging versus journalism or some other fanfare that honestly makes no difference .
In doing this , we ’re forgetting why we started blogging in the first place .
Most of us have a subject ( or group of subjects ) that we care about deeply , so we wanted to write about it .
We found common ground with other people who liked the same things , and they started reading what we wrote .
When we move away from that , when we start having contest to see who can urinate further , we turn our backs on who we are .
We become something else entirely .
3. SAUCE !
If you ’re going to write about something and it ’s not your original work , then you need to point to a source .
End of story .
In not doing so , you make yourself look like the south end of a northbound horse .
Your audience is n’t dumb enough to think that you sit around all day and come up with every hot headline in the news .
In fact , they ’ve probably already already seen your same story , written differently .
Sauce , on 4 chan , is a bastardized version of the word source .
When someone posts content that ’s funny , provocative or otherwise attention - grabbing , there are often posts with the single word “ sauce ” that follow the original poster .
Why ?
Because people care about where you found what you found .
They want to read it for themselves and see if there is information that you missed .
Giving up the sauce is giving what your audience wants .
Live by that , and simply be proud when you get to be the sauce instead of linking to it .
4. Own Your Brand
What angered the Anonymous masses of /b/ when they noticed that someone had stolen their slogan ?
It was theirs .
They created it and it summed up , though cryptically , everything that Anonymous stands for .
There are a lot of new media outlets that want to do things “ like ” someone else .
That copycat mentality only serves to degrade what every one of us does .
Find out what it is that you do , then do it well .
Once you ’ve established that , get ownership of each topic to the point that people will actually have to work to find something new about it .
Our Editor
In Chief , @ Zee , did this perfectly with his story about the App Store compromise .
Heck , it ’s a month later and we ’re still proud of him for it .
5. Failing All Else , Make ‘ Em Laugh
Sometimes , there just is n’t solid content to put out there .
Sometimes you ’re just not feeling it .
Regardless of the reason , you started this race and its your race to finish .
When a thread starts on 4 chan and things go awry , it ’s commonplace for a poster to throw in an off - the - wall image or story to break away from what ’s going wrong .
We could all do with a bit more laughter .
This new media thing ?
It ’s only semi-serious business .
We love it for various reasons , and for some of us it pays the bills .
But the important thing to remember is that we do n’t always have to be so serious .
That ’s an advantage given to us by our position in this field .
Sometimes , but only sometimes , the humor comes in when things do go awry .
So lighten up a bit , take a step back and pay attention to what ’s going on around us .
You ’ll be amazed at where you can pick up a valuable lesson if you ’ll just pay attention .

Laziness in Pure Functional Languages
Some collected comments on the advantages / disadvantages of laziness , assuming that you 've already committed yourself to a language which is free from side effects .
I have three major beefs with laziness : it 's not reflected in the types , it leads to space leaks far too often , and it makes it impossible to get stack traces ( which I think are more important than debuggers ) .
I also have two minor beefs with it .
Not Reflected in Types
For all of the Haskell community 's advocacy of types , I find it amazing that Haskell functions ' types do not express the strictness of the function !
This is a glaring , gigantic oversight !
Strict languages like ML do n't have this problem – every function is strict , so every type implicitly says “ and is strict in all arguments ” .
Haskell can't say “ and is lazy in all arguments ” because you need to use strict primitives to build nontrivial programs .
Total languages like Coq do n't have this problem either because their programs ' behavior is not influenced by choice of evaluation strategy .
Space Leaks
A contemptible observation is that sufficiently large programs seem only to work with added strictness annotations .
It might be a reason why monads are so popular at the moment since they often ' linearize ' the computation , resulting in more predictable behavior .
– marco , in this comment
Here is some advice on circumventing the disadvantages of laziness in Haskell .
This focuses mainly on the unpredictability of space complexity Stack Traces Note : I use the phrase “ stack trace ” below in a loose manner , meaning basically “ explanation of what computations led up to the error ” .
For imperative languages this is a stack trace , but I could be convinced that some similar - yet - not - identical notion is appropriate for functional languages .
So “ stack trace ” below does n't necessarily literally mean a silicon - level call stack of addresses .
The other major disadvantage to lazy - by - default ( as I see it ) is the lack of anything like a “ stack trace ” to include with runtime errors .
If I had to choose between living life without a debugger and living life with a runtime that did n't give me stack traces , I 'd choose the former ( I hardly ever use a debugger anyways ) .
Stack traces are just way too useful , both to developers and for collecting bug reports .
This is one place where Java has really advanced the state of the art in computing – it popularized the idea that the runtime should be able to give you high - quality stack traces without having to resort to a debugger .
Incidentally , inability to provide stack traces is often cited as a reason for not supporting tail - calls .
In my opinion this is n't a big enough problem : you can simply put a marker on the stack every time a tail call is made , and delete contiguous sequences of markers whenever the stack exceeds some fixed limit .
Deleted sequences should be replaced with a marker indicating that a deletion was performed .
The resulting debugging annotations will be asymptotically bounded by ( and in practice much smaller than ) the program 's true space requirements .
Current Stack Trace Technology for Haskell
This seems like a good place to summarize the current state of the art in Haskell pseudo - stack - traces .
GHC has a built - in feature , : trace , that will give you the last 50 execution steps .
This often means less than 50 frames of the “ call stack ” .
This is an “ accurate but bounded ” stack .
There is a tool called Hat which streams out an execution record of the program to the disk and then reconstructs an accurate stack trace from it .
Needless to say , the space requirements are gigantic , it impacts performance , and may cause Heisenbugs .
It can not be left “ always on ” like the JVM 's stack traces .
Finally ,
Hat works by source - to - source translation , so it often cannot cope with recently - added language features ( this is not an inherent difficulty with the Hat approach , however ; it is merely an artifact of the way it is implemented ) .
The paper Finding the needle : stack traces for GHC described a tool that maintains an abstracted stack whose size is bounded by the size of the programs ' text .
Unfortunately when it enters a function it elides any call frame involving that function further down the stack .
Imagine an execution sequence that arrives at this call stack ( bottom to top ) : foo999
...
foo1
foo0
foo999
...
foo1
foo0
main
The “ abstractor ” will elide the bottom 1,000 calls to foo0 - foo999 .
This is an essential feature of the way that the strategy in their paper avoids an asymptotic space explosion .
Now imagine that the top 1,000 calls return , and then the original call to foo999 throws an exception or otherwise wishes to examine the stack .
The elided stack will contain nothing but main !
So , there are completely reasonable situations in which the abstracted stack contains no useful information at all .
This is unfortunate .
Cost Model
I did n't notice this ( at least on a conscious level ) until reading this post by Bob Harper , though what follows is my own ( possibly inaccurate ) elaboration of his brief comment .
Haskell really has no language - based cost model , because pattern - matching – that is , case discrimination – may trigger an arbitrarily complicated computation .
Since the operational part of the language boils down to lambda , application , and case , this means that there is no cost model at all : lambdas cost nothing , and the cost of application and case can be anything at all .
Minor : Full Abstraction / Concurrency Laziness breaks full abstraction , and adding in the necessary operator to restore full abstraction forces you into accepting a sort of crippled concurrency .
People often forget that lazy PCF is n't fully abstract without an interleaving operator .
This operator is either missing or else a hacky second - class citizen in all implementations .
Lazy PCF can in fact be used as a semantics for concurrency ( for example , Kahn process networks use basically the same non-flat denotational domain as lazy PCF ) , but the more I learn about this the less I think that it 's a complete semantics for concurrency .
If you 've decided that you want to have concurrency , you probably want operators like “ fair merge ” which have no denotational semantics in the lazy PCF domain .
So I think that “ models concurrency well ” is a terrible argument for laziness .
Minor : Strict Constructors , Non-Strict Constructors , and newtype Haskell needs to distinguish between the following three definitions , which are non-equivalent under lazy evaluation .
Strict evaluation does not have this sort of complication .
data D1 = D1 Int
data D2 = D2 !
Int
newtype N = N Int
This example comes from the Haskell 98 Report .
Basically , the strict / lazy pattern distinction is required in order to control whether or not D1 has an additional member D1 bottom , whereas D2 bottom is indistinguishable from bottom :: Int .
The newtype definition for N is semantically equivalent to D2 : each type is isomorphic to Int , whereas D1 contains an extra element ( D1 bottom ) .
However , as noted here , although the types N and D2 are isomorphic , Haskell interprets pattern matching on these two types differently .
That is , the first two functions below will evaluate to bottom when given a diverging argument , but the last one will diverge : foo1 ( N n ) = 3 -- foo1 bottom ~~> 3
foo2 ( d:: D2 ) = 3 -- foo2 bottom ~~> 3
foo3 ( ( D2 d ) : : D2 ) = 3 -- foo3 bottom ~ ~ > bottom Similar problems crop up with lazy ( “ irrefutable ” ) patterns .
So - called “ irrefutable patterns ” are really just syntax for a type declaration – they 're not actually patterns .
For example , these two definitions are equivalent : foo ~ ( x , y ) = 3
foo ( p :: ( Int , Int ) ) = 3 because either one can be applied to bottom and still yield a result .
So there is n't really a pattern match going on .
Summary : a newtype is essentially a one - constructor data declaration with one field marked as strict ( ! ) for which all pattern - matches are automatically treated as irrefutable .
I understand why all of this is necessary , but it 's just way too complicated for the negligible amount of power it adds .
More than half of Germans reportedly want to go back to the deutschmark , 11 years after they dumped it for the euro .
Some 51 percent say they now detest the single currency , according to a survey by the U.K. Daily Mail Online .
Just 30 percent of those polled rejected the idea of going back to the fabled “ D - mark , ” while another 18 percent were undecided , the Hamburg - based institute Ipsos found .
German confidence in Europe 's single currency has been torpedoed in recent weeks by the Greek debt crisis and the euro zone 's ensuing bailout of Athens with Germany pledging the most to keep the European project alive .
Meanwhile , billionaire investor George Soros has said the euro is a flawed construct and Germany 's budget savings policy is making it harder for other countries in the currency bloc to regain competitiveness .
Soros said the euro was an incomplete currency from the start as the European Union 's Maastricht Treaty established a monetary union without a political union .
" The euro is a patently flawed construct , " said Soros , who earned $ 1 billion in 1992 by betting against the British pound .
But European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet has said the euro is n't in danger and remains a credible currency .
" It it clear .
The euro is not in danger , " Trichet told German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last month .
" The euro is a credible currency whose inflation rate has been below 2 percent for more than eleven years , " Trichet said .

By now you ’ve probably seen the @OldSpice campaign that has taken the Internet by storm and put advertisers on notice .
From Yahoo !
Answers to Reddit to Facebook , Old Spice is reaching their target group by engaging in a new way .
This is potentially game - changing for many reasons , let ’s look at a few below :
1. Videos are shot in one or two takes and released the same day because you have to keep up with a real - time stream .
Old Spice released one or two clips every hour – pretty impressive when you consider the production values .
If you ’re organized to do it , you can react quickly to take advantage of changes in the external environment .
Can you imagine if Axe had been able to mobilize a response , in real - time , to the Old Spice man ?
2. Clients will have to give up some control .
Putting something online requires a willingness to let it evolve and change .
You simply do n’t have time to go through the bureaucratic chain to approve every little detail .
Agencies and their clients need to put their brand in capable hands and trust them to do amazing things .
3 . Targeting influentials , as a stand - alone strategy , is n’t enough .
Influentials can get you started but the real gems of the Old Spice campaign came from the contributions of regular people .
Did you know that one couple is now engaged as a result of Old Spice ?
Respond to your customers .
Give them a memorable experience that can be shared for years to come .
Imagine an introspective Don Draper , reminiscing about his childhood in a smoke filled room while sipping a bourbon .
Or the Geico lizard fielding questions about ( insert bizarre topic from left field ) .
What if the characters of Toy Story had appeared on a Youtube talkshow prior to the movie ’s release ?
The Woot monkey running tech support for a day ?
That annoying Fountain
Tire guy on a cross-country roadtrip , talking to real customers .
It does n’t even require a full - day assault .
A seemingly out - of - the - blue video response to a well thought out forum post from the GM of the Calgary Flames would certainly get people talking .
Campaigns that surprise and delight customers are a surefire way to build brand equity .
Other creatives are going to respond to OldSpice .
Their clients will demand it .
In the next few months I expect we ’ll see a few copycats but also marketers that took the idea and made it their own – in a way that fits their strategy .
I eagerly await the latter .

This was the video I was looking for earlier , made by Charlie Brooker for BBC4 Newswipe , not long after I heard about the shootings .
Is n’t there a danger similar here that excessive coverage might prompt copycat killers ?
I asked this earlier on Twitter and Mr_Onions replied :
I do n’t think so .
Our attitude to guns and our tight gun laws says different .
Worst since Dunblane , though that was 14 yrs ago
I ’m still not convinced .
There are far too many studies that confirm this .

Desertec - Frankreich macht mit Matthias Brake
Postkoloniale Befindlichkeiten und Wassermangel der Atomkraftwerke
Vor gut einem Jahr wurde das Desertec Projekt gegründet .
Solarstromkraftwerke und Windparks in Nordafrika und dem Nahen Osten sollen Europa mit grünem Strom versorgen .
Von 400 Mrd. Euro Investitionen ist die Rede .
Aber gerade Frankreich , das sich in Nordafrika als ehemalige Kolonialmacht immer noch gerne in einer Art Vermittlerrolle zwischen Europa und Nordafrika sieht ; und dazu erst 2008 die " Mittelmeerunion " gegründet hatte , war bisher aussen vor .
Doch jetzt will Frankreich mitmischen .
Unter dem Namen Transgreen stellte der französische Energieminister Jean - Louis Borloo das neu gegründete französische Konsortium aus Electricité de France , Alstom , Nexans und RTE vor .
Es soll ein Transportnetz für Wind - und Sonnenenergie aus Nordafrika bis nach Europa bauen .
Kernstück sollen neue Gleichstromleitungen durch das Mittelmeer sein .
Beim Desertec - Gründungskonsortium , der Desertec Industrial Initiative , besteht dagegen erst einmal Aufnahmestopp für weitere deutsche Unternehmen , weil bereits 11 von 17 beteiligten Firmen aus Deutschland kommen und man den Eindruck vermeiden möchte Desertec sei ein in erster Linie ein deutsches Projekt .
Dagegen soll Siemens bei Transgreen mit einsteigen .
Für Frankreich , das bei seiner Stromversorgung sehr einseitig von seinen Atomkraftwerken abhängig ist , dürften die neuen Desertec - Leitungen besonders schnell von Nutzen sein .
ENTSO -E der Europäische Verband der Übertragungsnetzbetreiber sieht schon jetzt in seinem " Summer Outlook Report 2010 " wegen der Anfälligkeit der französischen Atomkraftwerke im Sommer , wenn die Flüsse weniger Wasser zum Kühlen führen , ein Problem .
ENTSO -E geht davon aus , dass das französische Stromnetz wegen der Kühlprobleme der Atomkraftwerke schon diesen Sommer " nah an seinem Grenzen " arbeiten wird .
In den Monaten Juni bis September wird wegen der voraussichtlichen Drosselung der Atomkraftwerke von 4000 MW ausfallender Kraftwerksleistung ausgegangen , die durch Importe aus den Nachbarländern - und zukünftig womöglich aus dem Maghreb - ersetzt werden muß .
Taking a post - workout plunge in an ice water bath is a common practice among many athletes .
Known as cold water immersion or cryotherapy , it is used to recover faster and reduce muscle pain and soreness after intense training sessions or competitions .
In addition to the ice bath , some athletes use and contrast water therapy ( alternating between cold water and warmer water ) to get the same effect .
From elite runners to many professional rugby and football players , the post - workout ice bath is a common practice routine .
Like many practices , it 's good to question whether this works .
See what research says about the pros and cons of cold - water immersion or contrast water therapy after exercise .
The Theory Behind Cold Immersion After Exercise
The theory behind ice baths is related to the fact that intense exercise causes microtrauma , which is tiny tears in your muscle fibers .
This microscopic muscle damage is actually a goal of exercise as it stimulates muscle cell activity and helps repair the damage and strengthen the muscles ( muscle hypertrophy ) .
But it is also linked with delayed onset muscle pain and soreness ( DOMS ) , which occurs between 24 and 72 hours after exercise .
The ice bath was believed to :
Constrict blood vessels and flush waste products , like lactic acid , out of the affected tissues Decrease metabolic activity and slow down physiological processes Reduce swelling and tissue breakdown
Then , with rewarming , the increased blood flow was believed to speed up circulation , and in turn , improve the healing process .
Although there is no current protocol regarding the ideal time and temperature for cold immersion routines , most athletes or trainers who use them recommend a water temperature between 54 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit ( 12 to 15 degrees Celsius ) and immersion times of five to 10 minutes , and sometimes up to 20 minutes .
While that ’s the theory behind the cold water immersion for exercise recovery , conclusive research about the pros , cons and ideal time and temperatures is still a way off .
Scientific Research Shows Pros and Cons of Ice Baths
Of the studies that have looked at the effects of ice baths , cold water immersion and contrast water therapy on exercise recovery and muscle soreness , most offer inconclusive or contradictory findings .
Research suggests that icing muscles immediately after maximal exercise suppresses inflammation , hinders muscle fiber growth , and delays muscle regeneration .
This would be bad news for athletes who are trying to increase muscle size and strength .
A Cochrane review of 17 studies concluded there was some evidence that cold - water immersion reduced delayed onset muscle soreness when it was compared to rest or no intervention .
There was n't enough evidence to conclude whether or not it improved fatigue or recovery .
The most effects were seen in studies of running .
All of the studies were of low quality and did n't have a standard for adverse effects or follow up with the participants actively .
Contrast water therapy was shown by a review of 13 studies to have some evidence that it was better at reducing exercise - induced muscle soreness recovery than passive recovery or rest , but the difference was minimal .
There was no difference in muscle soreness between contrast water therapy , cold water immersion , active recovery , compression , or stretching .
Ice Baths Offer Limited Benefits for Athletes
While it 's clear that more research is needed before a firm conclusion can be reached , so far the information that is available indicates the following :
Active recovery is generally still accepted as the gold standard , and arguably , the best way to recovery after hard exercise .
﻿ ﻿
﻿ Coldwater immersion after a single hard workout offers some temporary pain relief and may , in fact , help recovery — at least an athlete 's perceived experience of a faster recovery .
Alternating cold water and warm water baths ( contrast water therapy ) , may help athletes feel better and offer temporary pain relief .
Ice baths are not necessary .
Coldwater baths ( 75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius ) are as good , and perhaps better , than ice baths .
Passive recovery ( complete rest ) is not an effective way to recover .
﻿ ﻿
﻿ Hot baths after hard exercise may hinder exercise recovery .
How to Do Cold Water Therapy
If you are going to try cool or cold water immersion after exercise , do n't overdo it .
One review of studies found the best routine was 11 to 15 minutes of immersion at a temperature between 52 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit ( 11 to 15 degrees Celsius .
That should be enough time to get the benefit and avoid the risks .
Because cold can make muscles tense and stiff , it 's a good idea to fully warm up about 30 to 60 minutes later with a warm shower or a hot drink .
Contrast Water Therapy ( Hot - Cold Bath )
If you prefer alternating hot and cold baths , the most common method includes one minute in a cold tub of 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit ( 10 to 15 degrees Celsius ) and two minutes a hot tub of 99 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit ( 37 to 40 degrees Celsius ) , repeated about three times .
A Word From Verywell
Whether the science supports the ice bath theory or not , many athletes swear that an ice bath after intense training helps them recover faster , prevent injury , and just feel better .
You can give this a try to see if it works for you .
But if you decide you do n't like it , feel free to skip it the next time .
When a sequel to Mean Girls was announced last week , I started thinking of all the ways technology has changed since the 2004 original , and began to wonder how various classic teen film characters would handle today 's methods of communication .
Advertisement
You do n't really think of Mean Girls as being painfully dated until you start to consider that the film portrayed high school life without referencing texting or Facebook or Twitter , and that Regina George sought revenge on her friends by printing out pages from the Burn Book and physically distributing them around the school , as opposed to just scanning a copy of the book and sending it to every recipient she could think of .
As Irin noted last week , " while the Internet and texting existed when the movie came out , it was all but invisible in Mean Girls , technology has since enabled all sorts of cruel behavior to be disseminated more rapidly than ever . "

And while we can probably imagine the damage Regina George could do with a firm grasp on social networking , what of the teen film heroes and villains that came before her ?
Would today 's technology have a positive or a negative impact on their lives ?

Andie Walsh , Pretty In Pink
Pros : Could connect with people outside of her town , easier to find the vintage clothing she loves so much , could start an Etsy store to sell her homemade clothes and supplement the family income while her father looks for work .
Cons : iPods and mp3s might put her employer , the record store Trax , out of business ; Regretsy would totally pick apart her homemade prom dress ; cell phones would give Duckie a means to annoy her via voicemails , photographs , and texts .

Farmer Ted , Sixteen Candles
Pros : Could probably put his unfortunate gassy dancing incident on YouTube for a few million hits ; would probably enjoy starting a Facebook group titled " Girls With Hats Are Just So Vogue , " could argue with online strangers over whether or not he is , in fact , King of the Dipshits .
Cons :
Would probably be expected to produce actual sex tape , rather than Samantha Baker 's underwear , to prove to his idiot freshman friends that he'd slept with her ( which he had n't ) , would be caught by traffic surveillance tapes driving Jake Ryan 's dad 's car after drinking and without a license , would most likely be embarrassed forever by his Farmer Ted persona , which will live on through various abandoned MySpace and Xanga blogs .

Veronica Sawyer , Heathers
Pros :
If her diary was a blog , people would probably have called the cops on her before her teenage angst bullshit had a body count .
Cons :
The internet simply would have been another means for J.D. to manipulate everyone as only a psychopath can .

Pros : Would be ALL OVER Craigslist missed connections , looking for " the angel that fell from Heaven and landed at Subway so she could buy a mad delicious looking BMT last Saturday night , " could keep his pleasure chest filled by auto - ordering at Drugstore.com .
Cons :

AS the Gulf of Mexico continues to fill with oil this summer , condos and restaurants will sit empty , fishing boats will stay docked , and beaches  even those without a single tar ball  will attract fewer tourists .
Economists estimate that more than seven million businesses will suffer from both the spill and the tarnished reputation it has brought to the region .
BP has now begun reimbursing businesses that rely on the gulf for their revenue .
Since May , it has paid just under a third of the more than 90,000 claims it has received , with the checks totaling more than $ 144 million .
About 80 percent of the payments have gone to self - employed workers  including shrimpers , charter boat captains and beachfront condo owners  who can clearly show that the spill has affected their ability to make a profit .
Fewer large businesses have been compensated because their claims are more complex and take longer to process .
No wonder Congress was fighting so hard to pass the Mutant Registration Act .
I found this on my friend 's Facebook .
An imam who looks ambiguously Asian leads a cast of superheroes in salaah , the Islamic prayer , at what seems to be a mosque .
I asked my friend if he knew who made this , and he had no idea .
This painting (? ) is incredible .
Whoever made it , get at me , now .
EDIT : I realized that not everyone knows Muslim 's start their prayer in this stance .
Edited the second sentence for clarification .
During the meeting , a short todo list comprising the agenda for the next few weeks was created .
This list can be found at http://gitorious.org/social/pages/Home.
As this list shows , the two most important pieces to work on at this point are the relationship manager and preliminary design mockups .
The relationship manager will serve as a plugin to control access lists for your content on the network , and will serve as a basis for all of the other GNU social plugins .
Design mockups are necessary to nail down the default look and feel GNU Social should have , as well as lay the foundation for changes which must be made to the stock StatusNet views .
Once these two things are implemented , GNU social can begin working on the individual plugins , such as federated private messaging , photo sharing and video sharing .
A little fun ...
One fun thing that we need to decide on is an official GNU social logo .
We would like to open this up to everyone on the mailing list .
Send in your best work and show it off to everyone on the list .
Rob Myers , will judge every logo sent to this mailing list , by June 28th .
Please send your logo in SVG format , and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution license , or Creative Commons Zero license .
We want to make sure that everyone who wishes to participate in this project is welcome .
While at this point , the majority of hacking is being done by the people who attended this meeting , there are still opportunities to be involved .
The GNU social code will be available in the git repository and anyone is welcome to contribute as the project grows .

Essay
Anatomy of a Noob – Why your Mom Sucks at Computers
The words metaphor and intuitive are often used in UX .
They are the metrics we use to judge the quality of a solution .
But is this quality really as universal as we might like to believe ?
Let me introduce you to my mom .
( Insert random “ yo ’ momma ” joke here )
Some years ago I needed a file from my parents ’ computer sent to me .
I called my mom ( my dad was n’t home ) and asked her to send the file .
As my mom is n’t the most avid user , I knew I would have to guide her through the process .
No biggie , I thought .
The conversation went like this :
Me : OK , so you go to the desktop and open the mail client .
Mom : I am at the desk .
Me : No , not the desk , the desktop on the computer .
Mom :
Where is that ?
Me : Click on the little icon on the bottom of the screen next to where it says “ Start . ”
Mom : Internet Explorer ?
Me : No , the next one .
Mom :
Which button do I push ?
Me : The left one .
Mom : Nothing happens .
Me : What do you mean nothing happens ?
Mom :
Well , a small window pops up .
Is that the desktop ?
Me : No , you are right - clicking .
You need to click the left button .
Mom : But I am !
We go back an forth for several minutes , with me trying to convince her that she is , in fact , pushing the right ( wrong ! ) button .
Then , suddenly :
Mom : Oops !
Everything just disappeared and now there are only small icons .
What did I do wrong ?
Me : No , that ’s it !
You did it right .
That ’s the desktop .
Mom : OK , but I pressed the right button .
Me : Hmm…weird .
Well , anyway , open your mail client — that ’s the icon I showed you , and double - click the left button .
Mom : OK , but nothing happens .
That little box pops up again .
Me : Mom , I am telling you , you are clicking the right - hand button .
You need to click the left one .
Mom : But I am !
It ’s just really difficult .
Me : What do you mean difficult ?
You just double - click the left button !
Mom : I know , but this is not behaving like it used to .
Me : What do you mean ?
Mom :
When I go up , it goes down , and it ’s really difficult to double - click with my thumbs .
( Short confusion , followed by blink of light bulb flashing on . )
Me : Ahh !
Of course , now I realized what was going on .
She had the mouse upside down !
I talked to my dad later that night and found out what had happened .
Instead of the mouse cord going behind the desk and into the back of the computer , it was plugged in at the front of the desk , into the USB port on the front of the computer .
The mouse had been pulled around but she did n’t intuitively get that .
She thought that this was how it had been before , and that she just did n’t quite understand .
Mind you , she had used a computer before .
My mom is not stupid , yet she was unable to do some of the most basic tasks in navigating a computer .
She is certainly not the only one .
The latest Facebook glitch ( read the comments ) made it painfully obvious that there are many other people who might use computers but lack the holistic insights of the digital natives .
Metaphors as a tool for intuition .
In UX we often ask ourselves whether our design is intuitive , i.e. , can the user figure out how to do the things we want them to do on their own by the visual clues and design patterns we provide ?
We go to great lengths to ensure easy understanding .
We make the button look like something you can press .
We always make sure that the navigation is prominent and follows certain nomenclature .
We use desktop as a reference , windows , pull - downs , accordions , etc .
We call them metaphors , but very seldom do we question whether those metaphors are as intuitive and universally understood as we assume .
In the case of my mom , there is obviously little connection between the physical desktop and its digital counterpart .
To her , the metaphors we use are nothing more than words — words that get lost in the stress of trying to navigate through an environment she does n’t really understand .
To my mom , there is no connection between the top bars in MS Word and Outlook .
The convention of almost always having File – Edit – View – Help , wrap around the functionality of any given application is completely lost on her .
And my mom is not the only one .
There are millions of people who ca n’t find their way around a computer unless they are told specifically what to do .
The second they step off the well - known paths , they are , quite literally , lost .
This was made rather obvious when hordes of Facebook users complained about the new log - in procedure .
I have often compared the experience of the noob with dropping a geek into the wilderness of the African savanna with the wrong map .
As non-natives , we are forced to try to follow the map and instructions we are given of this strange and unknown area .
As long as the map matches the territory we are fine .
But if the map is wrong , what do we do ?
There are no metaphors from the urban jungle that we can take and apply .
The map does n’t prepare us for what we meet on our way .
The environment is completely alien and we fail to navigate it intuitively .
Not because we are stupid , mind you .
We simply lack the experience of a native .
What separates digital natives from non-natives is that the former understand computers holistically .
Whatever the digital natives encounter , they can typically quickly figure out what to do by nature of having a better understanding of the environment .
Noobs in the digital space do n’t understand things holistically .
They barely understand the basics .
They lack any cognitive surplus to provide themselves with an overview of the environment they interact with .
Which brings me to three observations :
Intuition is learned .
Something is intuitive not because it ’s universally understood but because we have learned the meaning of it from a holistic point of view .
This requires lots and lots of experience and , for that matter , trial and error .
Metaphors are only meaningful in retrospect .
Do n’t count on the physical - looking button to be intuitive just because it ’s a metaphor from real life .
Once you tell someone what a specific element means , they will most probably understand it , but not because of the metaphor itself .
There are no Bablefish in UX
Designing products and services is like speaking French .
Not everyone understands it .
Comprenez - vous ?
The noob might pick up a word here and there , but they are n’t , by any metrics , comfortable with participating in the conversation .
This all leads to the following conclusion :
Intuitive interaction is for experts , not for noobs
Understanding something intuitively really means that you understand it holistically .
If you understand it holistically , you can fill in the gaps .
This does n’t mean you should n’t make your design intuitive or improve on it — not at all .
Just understand that you are doing it for the natives , not for the noobs .
So let ’s stop obsessing over whether something is intuitive and start obsessing over whether it ’s understandable .
That is going to be the topic of my next post .
Let me know what you think .

Windows :

The folks at PenDriveLinux.com have created a Windows tool for creating what is basically a GRUB multi-OS bootloader on your USB drive , along with a nice long list of systems that work with it .
All you have to do is grab an ISO file of the system you 're adding to your drive , then drop the whole ISO file onto the drive ( occasionally with special instructions ) .
There 's all the usual Linux cohorts — Ubuntu , Fedora , openSUSE , etc. — but also some great rescue tools and utilities , like the GParted partition disc , Ophcrack password reset , and virus scanners .
You could even load a Windows 7 installation DVD onto your thumb drive , if you had the room .
I tried out PenDriveLinux with Damn Small Linux , Ubuntu , and Gparted on one USB drive , and it worked like a charm .

If I know me ( and heavens , if anyone should know me it ought be me , but I would n't trust me on that ) , then I 'd bet we 'll return to the topic of Matt Moulson 's arbitration hearing a time or two .
Truth be told , I find arbitration stuff pretty dull , but I know it 's very relevant and many fans love it , so here we go :
What will Moulson make ?
While most arbitration filings do not actually make it to a hearing -- both player and team usually have an interest in not letting that happen -- Moulson 's next contract is a pretty big deal because it needs to be handled the right way :
You might suppose that since the Islanders have plenty of cap room , Moulson 's next deal can't really hurt them .
But that is the kind of mistake that teams make and end up regretting as they get better , and all their young contracts come due , and suddenly they 're pinching pennies just to fill a 23 - man roster .
( Or in the case of Chicago , Calgary and Philadelphia , just to carry a roster over from one season to the next . )
In other words , if you overpay or over - commit to a guy based on his peak season and he happens never to live up to that season , you 're setting yourself up for a summer or trade deadline down the road where all talk about your team revolves around " but how will they fit everyone in ? " or " but which contracts can they unload ? "
So the ideal for the Isles is to secure Moulson to a short - term deal so he can establish a longer track record ( he has one full NHL season , a 30 - goal one , at age 26 ) , or to " do the Nielsen " with him and offer longer - term security in exchange for an annual rate that can't hurt them .
In arbitration , one point of evidence is comparable players .
Of course , Moulson is a unique case , so finding comparables is a bit of a wilderness exercise .
( Note : We can only hope that fan site report card polls have no bearing on the hearing , otherwise we really screwed the pooch with our fawning community grade of Moulson 's 2009 - 10 . )
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG 5 - on - 5 Rating Rank TOI PPtoi SOG PCT 2009 - 10 - Matt Moulson 82 30 18 48 -1 16 8 2nd of 14 16:38 3:01 208 14.4
NHL players just do n't often score 30 goals in their first full season at age 26 .
It 's weird territory .
It 's the kind of odd circumstances far more likely to happen to a 9th - round pick like Moulson ( i.e. , you do n't get your shot until later on ) , so it 's the kind of scenario where a guy 's value has been questioned throughout his career .
And that 's the kind of scenario that should give you pause when you 're projecting ( and paying for ) his future performance .
For the comparables game , you can search really wide or you can hone it down really narrow .
Think about all the variables that can go into locating a similar player if you 're really into this :
Beyond points there is average ice time , average PP or PK time , rank on the team 's depth chart , and of course age .
For this initial post I did a search at Hockey - Reference for players who , between the ages of 25 and 27 , had seasons of more than 23 goals ( Moulson had 30 ) and fewer than 60 points ( Moulson had 48 ) .
That 's a wide berth , but it serves to show that there are many well - compensated NHL wingers who scored 30 goals or fewer at age 26 or 27 .
Martin Havlat , Scott Hartnell , Chris Kunitz , Thomas Vanek and Alexandre Burrows are some of the names that stick out on that list -- and that represents quite the range of styles , reputation and ( as I 'll get into ) health .
Before we look at some of those , a reminder ( or introduction , if you 're like me and do n't fancy this stuff ) of what evidence is admissible at arbitration :
The player 's " overall performance " including statistics in all previous seasons .
Injuries , illnesses and the number of games played .
The player 's length of service with the team and in the NHL .
The player 's " overall contribution " to the team 's success or failure .
The player 's " special qualities of leadership or public appeal . "
The performance and salary of any player alleged to be " comparable " to the player in the dispute .
The salary cap and the state of the team 's payroll .
Evidence that is not admissible :
The salary and performance of a " comparable " player who signed a contract as an unrestricted free agent .
Testimonials , video and media reports .
The financial state of the team .
Moulson 's salary was $ 575,000 in 2009 - 10 , after the Kings let him walk and the Isles picked him up as a free agent .
What do you think it will be in 2010 - 11 as he re-signs as an RFA ?
To frame out a rough range , let 's look at a few of those wingers who had similar seasons around his age :
Chris Kunitz # 14 / Left Wing / Pittsburgh Penguins Height : 6 - 0 Weight : 193 Born : Sep 26 , 1979 Cap Hit : $ 3.725 million
Kunitz is an interesting one because he was more of a " late bloomer " like Moulson :
His age 26 season was his first full seasons and was less impresive ( 19 - 22 - 41 in 69 GP , 2005 - 06 ) than Moulson's , but his next season ( 25 - 35 - 60 in 81 GP for a Cup winner ) was perhaps a little better than the year Moulson just had .
Kunitz ultimately became a casualty of the Ducks ' cap troubles , after his next contract ( as an RFA ) bumped him up to $ 3.6 million territory .
Scott Hartnell # 19 / Left Wing / Philadelphia Flyers Height : 6 - 2 Weight : 210 Born : Apr 18 , 1982 Cap Hit : $ 4.2 million
In contrast to Kunitz , Hartnell -- who just turned 28 this spring ( and thus completed his age 27 season ) -- has been in the league since age 18 .
If you 've forgotten , he was part of Nashville 's slow expansion build and became a regular for them right away in 2000 - 01 .
Consequently , Hartnell did not hit the 30 - goal plateau until ... yep , age 26 ( 30 - 30 - 60 in 82 GP , 2008 - 09 ) , when he was already on his third contract and making the big bucks .
Hartnell was putting up 20 + goal , 40 - point range seasons before that third contract , yet was able to go from just over $ 1 million salaries to a contract with a $ 4.2 million average salary .
Despite being a high draft pick , you could also call Hartnell a late bloomer of sorts who had the financially lucrative good fortune to learn ( and make money ) on the job in the NHL .
To be clear , there is also a physical / fighting side to Hartnell 's game that is missing in Moulson's .
Alexandre Burrows # 14 / Left Wing / Vancouver Canucks Height : 6 - 1 Weight : 188 Born : Apr 11 , 1981 Cap Hit : $ 2 million
Fret not , though :
It 's not just $ 4 million guys who can be thrown into this conversation .
In fact , a closer one might be Burrows , a late bloomer whose first full season ( 2006 - 07 ) came at age 25 and produced a paltry 9 points in 82 games .
Burrows picked up after that thanks to the Performance Enhancing Situation known as " playing with the Sedins , " and he scored 28 goals and 51 points in his age 27 season , the last season on his entry level deal .
I do n't know whether " ability to dive relentlessly and whine to refs " is admissible evidence in arbitration , but in normal negotiations Burrows pulled a still healthy raise from near - league minimum to $ 2 million .
If you use the Sedins to water down Burrows ' achievements , you could use playing with friend and frequent linemate John Tavares as cause to water down Moulson's .
( Note : You 'd probably be wrong , but we wo n't tell the arbitrator that . )
Thomas Vanek # 26 / Left Wing / Buffalo Sabres Height : 6 - 2 Weight : 207 Born : Jan 19 , 1984 Cap Hit : $ 7.142 million
Before you choke , obviously Vanek has no business on Moulson 's comparable list :
He was a 5th overall pick who came into the league scoring at age 22 , and his salary is so exorbitant in part because he is one of the few examples of NHL GMs breaking " the code " and chasing other teams '
RFAs .
( The result shows that all signing an RFA offer sheet does is piss your colleagues off and inflate salaries .
Maybe that code is n't so bad after all . )
Regardless , I threw Vanek on here for grins because one of his seasons ( 2009 - 10 ) showed up on that search :
His age 26 season featured fewer goals than Moulson 's ( albeit in 11 fewer games ) and just five more points .
Looked at in that way , the Isles got a hell of a bang for about 1/12th of Vanek 's salary .
( Another point worth recalling in all contract valuations : Last year represented Vanek 's production low point since his rookie year -- while it could very conceivably be Moulson 's peak . )
Like Vanek , Havlat 's name does not belong here :
His name turned up on that primitive search because his age 25 season ( 2006 - 07 ) was similar in counting numbers ( 25 -32 - 57 ) to Moulson 's age 26 , but with one massive caveat :
The oft - injured Havlat pulled that off in only 56 games .
' What ... would you say ... you do here ?'
Again , looking at that list ( which I limited to the 25 - 27 age range ) shows how hard it will be to peg Moulson 's value and production after just one real season of NHL data .
Moulson 's AHL numbers have been good , but so many other players who score like he did at this age have been in the league longer and have even scored at that rate at younger ages .
( Take Joffrey Lupul , who had a 28 - goal , 53 - point season at age 22 and converted that into a $ 2.7 million average salary on his second contract , then a $ 4.25 million average on his next one . )
If it got to arbitration , I 'd pay to see the briefs and hear the arguments ( and hopefully , not see Salo tears ) .
Such players have also been through the RFA process multiple times with the same team without being told to walk , as opposed to Moulson who was never signed by the Penguins and allowed to walk as an RFA by the Kings .
This is n't intended to be an authoritative list -- far from it .
Rather , it 's a conversation starter and attempt to show what some guys with Moulson 's age and ( one season ) production made as RFAs .
Moulson deserves to get paid for showing he 's capable of a 30 - goal season , but the Islanders need to be careful to avoid paying him as if he 's capable of that every year .
Maybe he is , maybe he is n't , but he does n't have the track record yet .
Which is why arbitration , with the exception of the hurt feelings , could be productive :
It could produce a one - or two - year deal that allows Moulson to revisit things on the open market after his resume is longer .
But hopefully both sides find middle ground before then .
To reiterate , these cases usually do n't go to a hearing , and if they do it 's usually in late July or early August .
But in the meantime , what do you expect Moulson will earn ( whether it goes to an arbitration hearing or not ) ?
Who do you think his true comparables are ?
If you search Google , Bing , or Yahoo for information about the massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , there 's a very good chance the top result will be a BP site explaining what the company is doing to mitigate the disaster .
Coincidence ?
Hardly .
BP is essentially renting oil - related search words and phrases to make sure search engine users see their pages first .
( Watch one fan 's parody of a " BP " Google search . )
Here 's a look at what BP 's up to :
Why is BP buying search terms ?
According to BP , ensuring that its own links are at the top of Google , Bing , and Yahoo 's search results will " make it easier for people to find key links to information on filing claims , reporting oil on the beach , and signing up to volunteer , " as well as learn about BP 's efforts to fix the spill .
Though it 's hardly unprecedented to purchase search terms , some critics characterize BP 's efforts as a PR offensive to influence public opinion and help salvage the company 's besmirched image .
What terms is it buying ?
BP acknowledges paying for " oil spill , " and neutral phrases like " spill , " " gulf oil , " " offshore oil , " " Louisiana coast spill , " and " oil cleanup " all return search results with BP 's sponsored link at the very top .
BP's also apparently paying for " BP disaster , " but not " gulf disaster " or " oil disaster . "
How much is BP paying for them ?
Google sells sponsored links , which are really a form of advertising , to the highest bidder .
New York marketing analyst Scott Slatin , who specializes in search engines , estimates that BP is paying Google at least $ 7,500 a day to " own the top positions " for related search terms , plus another $ 3,000 a day to cover Bing and Yahoo .
Has anyone else done this before ?
Certainly .
Political campaigns — notably John McCain's — have paid to sponsor keywords before , and some companies have sponsored links , usually through a nonprofit or lobbying outfit , to buy influence on certain topical political issues , like health care .
But this is one of the more ambitious campaigns to combat a corporate PR nightmare — Toyota , for instance , did n't rent the phrase " Toyota brakes " earlier this year .
Is this a good idea , business - wise ?
" From BP 's perspective it's a brilliant move , " says Motivity Marketing CEO Kevin Ryan .
" If they 're not buying that link that goes back to their message , they 're kind of leaving the universe to kind of decide for itself . "
Slatin concurs that it's a " very effective " PR tactic .
How about ethically ?
" That 's another question , " says Ryan .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal ( R ) and President Obama both criticized BP for spending millions on PR that it could give to Gulf residents harmed by the oil .
And BP 's also using its deep pockets to elbow out " news and opinion sites that would normally buy at least one of these terms " — especially less - affluent nonprofits , says Jacqueline Leo in The Fiscal Times .
" Oil money , as slippery as it may be , talks louder than most . "

Sinceandcreator Blizzard announced that its official forums would phase in mandatory use of its newly announced " Real ID " system , which marks posts with their writers ' real - life names , there has been a deluge of heated discussion about the decision , and Blizzard says it is " definitely listening to player feedback . " " [ We ] will be carefully monitoring how people are using the service , " a Blizzard representative told Gamasutra this week .
" Real ID is a new and different concept for Blizzard gamers -- and for us as well -- and our goal is to create a social gaming service that players want to use .
" The Real ID system remains optional within Blizzard 's current games likeand .
Players can take advantage of it by adding friends by their Battle . net - associated email account , rather than their public user name .
The system is only planned as a requirement on the Battle .
net community forums .'s forum will begin using Real ID later this month , and 's will begin as theexpansion pack 's release approaches . "
It 's important to note that both enabling Real ID in game and posting on the official Blizzard forums are completely optional , " the Blizzard rep said .
" Players can continue to read the forums anonymously regardless of whether they choose to post in them , and their gameplay experiences will not change if they choose not to use the Real ID communication features in game .
" He also says players can enable parental controls to keep their children from using the Real ID system , or to disable their forum posting capabilities .
Players can actually register any name they wish when signing up for their Real ID -- but an account for a given game must be tied to a unique CD key for that game , and Blizzard says it plans to attempt to enforce the use of legitimate names .
" We have multiple teams here who will be monitoring the forums and looking for inappropriate names , " the rep explained .
" When the situation does arise , our community and customer service representatives will investigate and determine if any action is needed .
" In addition , our Terms of Use agreement requires that players provide us with accurate information , as certain aspects of the customer service we provide ( for example , addressing forgotten - password issues ) rely on identity verification -- if a player uses a fake name , it would ultimately impact our ability to provide him or her with timely service .

Skilling v. United States : Supreme Court Rules Against Broad Use of Honest Services Statute ; Does Not Grant New Trial on Pre-Trial Publicity Grounds
Posted by Christine Hurt
So , I 'm sure we 'll all have a lot more to say here , but the opinion in Skilling v. United States has been released .
For the corporate law folks among us , the Court seems to have narrowed the theft of honest services statute to activity such as bribery and kickbacks , and says Skilling did not violate the statute .
However , the Court did not reverse and remand on all counts , leaving to lower courts to decide whether that count unfairly colored the any or all of the other counts in his conviction .
Skilling was also hoping for a new trial on the grounds of pretrial publicity , but the court did not agree either that the venue was unfairly prejudicial or that voir dire did not ensure a non-prejudiced jury .
This is all from the quick read .
More later .
UPDATE : Forgot to link to the opinion .
I deprived you of some honest services there , but hey , it 's not a federal crime .

Motorola Droid Extreme to be the first device with froyo pre-installed
The best selling smart phone running on Android platform , Motorola Droid is all set to make it ’s comeback with Motorola Droid Extreme , previously known as Shadow .
We know you love the new name , so do we , but the surprise does not end there , DroidLife has some really cool pics coupled with a very impressive spec-sheet of the latest phone from the Droid brand .
Did I say Brand ?
Well , it really is a brand ( a big one ) considering how much Droid changed Android ’s fortunes .
So , here you go .
The Droid Extreme will be the first Motorola Android device that will comes pre-installed with the Froyo , version 2.2 of Android .
This will be the official Android release without Motoblur this time .
You really wanted it , did n’t you ?
Other details about the phone were are also known .
There is a dedicated camera button in the Droid extreme and knowing that , it would not surprise me if the camera gets massive improvement in the Droid ’s new phone .
It would be reasonable to expect at least an 8 MP camera , already found in HTC EVO and Sony Xperia X10 Android devices .
Another new feature will be available in the form of ‘ HDMI out ’ which is also a welcome addition .
Tipsters have defined the body as “ very metal ” , but the phone looks very sleek ans stylish .
It looks very slim in the pics and we are waiting to hear the dimensions .
Could outsell the iPhone again .
What do you think ?
I gotta say it .
I really thought the HTC EVO was the best Android device to date , but now it looks like it is not the only contender for the best Android phone title .
It looks like Android is making a strong buzz , of late .
As phone makers such as HTC and Motorola keep churning out such elegant phones , Android keeps gaining more momentum .
Apple ’s iPhone is starting to be overshadowed by all the great phones now shipping with Android .
I had my doubts that Android would take the smart phone industry by storm so soon , but thanks to the phone manufacturers and the growing fan base , Android seems unstoppable .

Because Medicaid regulations require states to provide nursing home care to receive federal Medicaid money , legislators often have more leeway to cut from home services .
Advocates for the elderly and the disabled worry that these cuts are just the beginning , because state ledgers tend to recover more slowly than the national economy .
“ The situation is grim , and it ’s safe to say that present trends are expected to continue , ” said JoAnn Lamphere , the director of state government relations for health and long - term care for AARP .
“ Nearly every state has proposed cuts of some sort to Medicaid .
Some might seem small , but it ’s death by a thousand slashes . ”
The cuts in Oregon have been particularly painful to people who work with the elderly , because for more than three decades the state has been a leader in rebalancing long - term care away from nursing facilities and toward the home .
The cuts here indicate how fragile these services can be against states ’ needs to reduce spending .
“ I ’m seeing in a matter of months 30 years of work go down the drain , ” said Donald Bruland , the director of senior and disability services for the Rogue Valley Council of Governments .
The state spends more than half its Medicaid long - term - care dollars on home care and has a separate $ 13 million program for people who do not qualify for Medicaid ; on average , states spend just 25 percent of their long - term - care budgets on home and community - based care .
Bruce Goldberg , director of the Oregon Department of Human Services , said the agency did not have an estimate for how many of the people losing home care would end up in assisted - living facilities or in nursing homes  or , if they did , how the state would pay for them .

The feature in question was to be a series of articles relating to the current financial crisis in Britain , each written by a foreign ‘ celebrity ’ , and Sefton Delmer – the 27 - year - old bilingual journalist – attempted to recruit Adolf Hitler .
Despite having already met Delmer on a number of occasions , the future Führer declined by way of the courteous letter seen below .

H/W. Sehr geehrter Herr Delmer !
So ehrend für mich
Ihre liebenswürdige Aufforderung ist , meine Ansichten über die derzeitige Krise in England mitzuteilen , so gross sind aber auch meine Bedenken , mich einer solchen Aufgabe zu unterziehen .
Ich fürchte , dass vielleicht ein Teil des englischen Publikums es als anmaßlich empfinden würde , wenn ich als Deutscher Auffassungen in einer englischen Zeitung vertrete , die nach meinem besten Wissen und Gewissen nichts anderes sein könnten , als eine Kritik politischer Maßnahmen und Vorgänge , die bisher leider auch von einem grossen
Teil des englischen Volkes sicherlich als richtig angesehen worden sind .
Ich hoffe ja allerdings , dass gerade aus dieser Krise heraus in England die Geneigtheit wachsen wird , aus eigenem Ermessen die letzten zwölf Jahre einer Nachprüfung zu unterziehen .
Ich würde glücklich sein , wenn sich daraus eine Überwindung jener unseligen Kriegspsychose in solchem Umfange ergeben könnte , dass die von mir und meiner Bewegung ersehnte Anbahnung eines wirklich herzlichen Verhältnisses zwischen dem englischen und deutschen Volk endlich Wirklichkeit würde .
Denn ich glaube , dass die nunmehr hereinbrechende Krise überhaupt nur durch ein engstes politisches Zusammenarbeiten jener Nationen gelöst werden kann , die in der Wiederaufrichtung eines natürlichen europäischen Gleichgewichtes die erste Voraussetzung zur Beschäftigung mit jenen grossen Weltfragen sehen , unter denen auch England heute leidet .
Ich bitte daher nochmals , von dem mich so ehrenden Ersuchen absehen zu wollen und ich verbleibe Ihr sehr ergebener ( Signed ) Herrn D. Sefton Delmer

Translated Transcript
Dear Herr Delmer !
Your kind request to publish my views on the current crisis in England was an honour for me , matched only by my reservations about undertaking such a request .
I fear that perhaps a section of the English public would consider it presumptuous if I , as a German , presented views in an English newspaper , which could , to the best of my knowledge and conscience , be nothing other than a critique of political methods and traditions , which have certainly been seen hitherto as right by a greater part of the English people .
I do certainly hope that out of this crisis the inclination will arise to view the last 12 years as a test , as in my own estimation .
I would be happy if from this an overcoming of that wretched wartime mentality could to some extent be achieved , so that the development of a warm relationship between the German and English peoples that my movement longs for would finally be a reality .
I believe that the currently occurring crisis can only be resolved through close political co-operation of those nations , which see a natural European balance as a prerequisite to giving fresh heart to the consideration of those worldwide issues , under which England suffers with the rest of us .
I again wish you to accept my declination of your honourable request and I remain Yours Faithfully ( Signed )
1. Plaintiff State of Texas ( " the State " ) sues Goldman Sachs Group , Morgan Stanley , UBS , Merrill Lynch / BOA , Citigroup , Credit Agricole , Credit Suisse , Deutsche Bank ( " the Banks " ) , Moody ’s , Standard and Poor ’s , Fitch ( “ the Ratings Agencies ” ) , AIG Insurance Company ( AIG ) and other John Doe defendants for causing financial crisis and physical harms ; recession ; unemployment ; home and wealth loss ; forced cutbacks in a wide variety of critical areas , including medical care , social services , and environmental protection .
Damages to the State include but are not limited to reduction in the value of state investments and the increased costs to governmental units , including increased insurance costs to Texas governmental units seeking to issue bonds whose reputation has been unfairly impaired .
Defendants caused budget shortfall of at least $ 18 billion to the State of Texas .
The environment , health and wellbeing of the State and its citizenry are directly harmed .
The first manifestations to children and other vulnerable citizens include hunger , disease and medical complication .
2. The U.S. Supreme Court recognizes the State 's right to sue to protect its physical and economic well being and that of its citizens and the State 's possession of Quasi Sovereign Interests in physical wellbeing and economic prosperity .
3. AIG negligently ran and ruined its own and other businesses and the economy by failing to act as a reasonable and prudent insurance company , costing over $ 180 billion for bailout .
AIG foolishly insured many hundreds of billions of dollars of loan agreements : bets as to whether borrowers would default .
In insuring these credit default swaps , AIG knew or should have known that massive defaults would occur and AIG would be left holding the bag .
AIG ’s misconduct included intentional and fraudulent acts and omissions .
AIG engaged in fraudulent misrepresentations aware of the significant risks , but claiming credit default swaps were selling insurance for “ a catastrophe that would never happen . ”
4 . The Banks negligently ran and ruined their own and other affected businesses and the economy .
Wall Street Banks created financial products such as Collateralized Debt Obligations , derived from bonds , which they marketed and sold as legitimate investments , using credit default swapping to allow investors to also bet on failure / default .
The Wall Street Banks , negligently and intentionally , allowed the ratings received on their own products to falsely portray the investments as better than in truth the investments were .
Had investors or ratings companies been properly informed , they'd have known the products were designed to fail , intentionally favoring bettors - on - default .
The Banks ’ misconduct included intentional and fraudulent acts and omissions .
5 . The rating system fostered by all defendants added to the deception including failure to disclose and eliminate banks ’ control over ratings and payments .
The ratings agencies also acted negligently , fraudulently and with gross negligence in their conduct .
Each defendant ’s private worries were not expressed publicly .
In the September 2008 Financial Crisis , Ratings Companies downgraded hundreds of billions worth of Collateralized Debt Obligations , massive dollar amounts of which remained AAA rated up to that point .
Significant amounts were not only degraded , but had filed default .
Defendants acted , individually and together , in concert , conspiracy and enterprises .
One now discovered email reflected the attitude : “ Let ’s all hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards fails . ”
6. Defendants ’ gross negligence , and intentional torts , including omissions and acts and their toxic product offerings and sales were fraudulent as well as negligent .
7 . The Defendants continue in their negligent , grossly negligent and intentional practices described , allowing their greed and egos to dominate their continued , poor decision making .
The State 's protection of its Quasi Sovereign Interest serves the public 's interest in making Wall Street accountable for its actions , past , present and future , and seeks all injunctive relief to which it is entitled , as well as damages , to compensate for harm caused and prevent further damage .
Wall Street continues its wrongful activities involving financial products .
Texas sues to remedy and prevent further physical and economic injury to its citizenry , the state generally , and its economy and budget .
The State is entitled to seek relief .
The matters complained of affect her citizens at large .
The environment and economy of Texas and the physical , economic and general welfare of its citizens have seriously suffered as a result of the toxic products and activities described .
Texas sues for its damages caused by Wall Street 's fee- churning , insider - favoring , betting - on - losers default misadventures .
8. The Texas Attorney General , on behalf of the people and State of Texas brings this suit under Texas law and the well recognized doctrine of Quasi Sovereign Interest for the following damages :
A. Money damages to the State of Texas for at least $ 18 Billion ;
B. Requirement that Defendants disgorge their economic benefits , including claw back of any and all bonuses paid since the beginning of the harmful practices outlined ;
C. The State 's attorneys fees , costs , and expenses ;
D. Punitive damages for the outrageous ruinous conduct described .
Without the massive damages such as those suffered by Plaintiff , the wrongdoers would never have been caught .
No self regulation , governmental regulation , or outside force exposed the wrongdoing .
The massive harm ( including self destruction ) provided no halt to bad business practices .
Without punitive damages , the harmful practices will continue into the future , exposing the State and its citizens to further damage .
E. Such other and further relief as to which the State may show itself justly entitled .
Everybody knows the Panthers have problems .
Lack of work ethic , under - performing players , overpaid players , a coaching and management carousel , fan frustration .
The list is long .
In an effort to fix the problems , the Panthers have hired former Chicago Blackhawks GM Dale Tallon to right the ship .
Tallon has publicly stated that no player is untouchable , though in reality some players are less likely to move than others .
He has also asked all of the players if they want to be a part of the team , ostensibly so those who are not interested can be more aggressively shopped .
The following is the opinions of one writer on the odds of each player returning to the team in the fall .
Part one covers the forwards , current roster first .
Part Two covers defensemen and goaltenders .

Bitz came to the Panthers late in the season with minor leaguer Craig Weller and a second - round pick .
Bitz is a big , but slow forward who is a decent bottom - six player .
With no real reason to send him packing and likely no inquiries , barring his being a throw - in on a trade , he 'll be back starting on the third or fourth line .
David Booth
09/10 Salary : $ 3.5
10/11 salary : $ 3.75 09/10
Stats : 28 GP 8/8/16 - 3 23PIM 0 PP 0SH 1GW
Odds : 50:1 on
Popular forward David Booth sustained two concussions last season .
Over the last two seasons , he 's been the hardest working player outside Tomas Vokoun and has become the face of the franchise as far as the fans are concerned .
He 'll stay not because of this but because the long - term effects of his injuries are not yet known .
Teams will be wary of taking Booth because of this .
Gregory Campbell
09/10 Salary : $ .800
10/11 salary : RFA
09/10 Stats : 60 GP 2/15/17 - 5 53PIM 0 PP 0SH 1GW
Odds : 5:1 on
Gregory Campbell is a solid , hard - working third - line center .
He 's a decent defensive center who wo n't be due a big raise , so will likely be re-signed and be back on the third line .
Evgeni Dadonov
09/10 Salary : $ 0.613
10/11 salary : $ 0.662
09/10 Stats : 4GP 0/0/0 - 1 0PIM 0 PP 0SH 0GW
Odds : 20:1
Dadonov , who spent last season in Rochester , recently caused a stir when he stated publicly that if he was n't guaranteed to play for the Panthers this season he would bolt for the KHL .
While he 's a talented player , he may not yet be ready and Tallon likely does n't want to play his game .
Radek Dvorak
09/10 Salary : $ 1.6
10/11 salary : $ 1.8
09/10 Stats : 76GP 14/18/32 - 7 20 PIM
1 PP 3SH 1GW
Odds : 100:1 on
Dvorak is not a flashy player , but does n't have a high paycheck and is valuable to the Panthers as a penalty - killer and energy winger .
He 's the kind of player one picks up in free agency rather than in a trade .
Unless he 's included to sweeten a deal , he 'll be back .
Michael Frolik
09/10 Salary : $ 0.850
10/11 salary : $ 0.850
09/10 Stats : 82GP 21/22/43 - 4 43PIM
5 PP 0SH 1GW
Odds : 2:1
Frolik is a talented player who should really take off this year , especially if Tallon can bring in some more talented top - six forwards , but he also may be attractive to other , cash - strapped , teams for his potential and low salary .
Nathan Horton
09/10 Salary : $ 3.5
10/11 salary : $ 4.0
09/10 Stats : 65GP 20/37/57 - 1 42PIM 7 PP 2SH 4GW
Odds : 100:1
Horton , though beginning to show on the promise of his talent , has worn out the welcome of fans with his at times lazy play .
Last season , there were times he tried to take the team on his back and win games , but he did n't have the support .
While he 's a player to build around , it may be time for a change of scenery .
Additionally , his stock is high and now is the time to trade him , probably for that big center Dale Tallon wants .
Kamil Kreps
09/10 Salary : $ .800
10/11 salary : RFA
09/10 Stats : 76GP 5/9/14 - 7 18 PIM 1 PP 0SH 1GW
Odds : 0
Kreps is the first player this off - season to leave for Europe .
It was highly likely the team was going to let him walk in the off - season , so he made the decision for them .
Steve MacIntyre
09/10 Salary : $ 0.550
10/11 salary : UFA
09/10 Stats : 22 GP 0/1/1 - 3 24PIM 0 PP 0SH 0GW
Odds : 100:1
MacIntyre is a big , bruising forward who can fight but is n't particularly skilled .
Coach Pete DeBoer has a history of assigning players like this to seats in the penalty box .
It is unlikely he will return .
Shawn Matthias
09/10 Salary : $ .785
10/11 salary : $ .765
09/10 Stats : 55GP 7/9/16 - 3 10 PIM 0 PP 0SH 2GW
Odds : 10:1 on
Matthias is a big , talented center who has had some motivation problems .
He came into camp two years ago out of shape , but last season changed his attitude .
He should have a better season this year .
He is the kind of player the Panthers need going forward and should be back to start on the third line .
He 'll start on the fourth l‌ine .
Rostislav Olesz
09/10 Salary : $ 2.3
10/11 salary : $ 3.1
09/10 Stats : 78GP 14/15/29 - 4 28 PIM 3 PP 0SH 3GW
Odds : 2:1 on
As much as it pains the fans , Olesz will likely be back to start this year .
Former GM Jacques Martin signed
Olesz to a six - year deal based on his potential , which has yet to materialize .
This contract is a millstone around the Panthers ' necks , which leaves them with only a few choices : trading for someone else 's salary nightmare , sending him to the minors , benching him in hopes he bolts for the KHL and buyout .
A buyout or assignment to the Americans are probably the best options , but ownership may balk at the price tag , so Olesz will probably be back to start , but management will look for ways to ship him off all season .
Victor Oreskovich
09/10 Salary : $.250
10/11 salary : $.625
09/10 Stats : 50 GP 2/4/6 - 8 26PIM 0 PP 0SH 0GW
Odds : 100:1 on
Last season Oreskovich played on a Panthers team starved of talent and riddled with injuries .
While energetic , he 's a bit sloppy .
Nevertheless , he 'll be back in Rochester next season .
Steven Reinprecht
09/10 Salary : $ 1.8
10/11 salary : $ 2.175
09/10 Stats : 82GP 16/22/38 - 1 18 PIM 3 PP 0SH 1GW
Odds : 20:1 on
Steven Reinprecht is a solid bottom - six center who was sold to the fans as a second - line center .
If Tallon brings in that number one center the team needs , that will leave Reinprecht a spot on the third line at wing , possibly flipping back and forth with Campbell .
He 's unlikely to be traded as his contract is not desirable .
Cory Stillman
09/10 Salary : $ 3.5
10/11 salary : $ 3.5
09/10 Stats : 58GP 15/22/37 - 3 22PIM 3 PP 0SH 4GW
Odds : 10:1
Stillman is a veteran forward with a couple of Stanley Cups on his resume .
He 's overpaid for his production and his best days are behind him , but he 's still a solid , if slow , player .
He 's good positionally , which helps compensate for his lack of speed .
He 's smart enough to look to make a pass to a faster player if he gets a breakaway .
He tied Nathan Horton in the lead for game - winning goals last season .
His leadership abilities and two Cups may make him desirable to a contender with cap space and a lot of young players .
If given the opportunity , the Panthers will trade him for a younger player .
Nick Tarnasky
09/10 Salary : $.550
10/11 salary : RFA
09/10 Stats : 31 GP 1/2/3 - 5 85PIM 0 PP 0SH 0GW
Odds : 30:1
Tarnasky has spent the last couple of seasons becoming a better pest .
As mentioned above , DeBoer has little use for players of this ilk and it looked like Nasty Nick was going to spend the last quarter of the season in the press box until Booth was reinjured and DeBoer had to play him .
Nick will get a spot on someone else 's fourth line or in the minors next season .
Stephen Weiss
09/10 Salary : $ 3.0
10/11 salary : $ 3.2
09/10 Stats : 80 GP 28/32/60 - 7 40 PIM
12 PP 0SH 2GW
Odds : 20:1 on
Weiss has long been touted as a first - line center .
The truth is that on most teams he would be on the second - line .
That said , Weiss is a solid second - line center who can play on the power play and the penalty kill .
He 's a good " tough minutes " player that would fit on a lot of teams .
His only problems here have been lack of support and an expectation that he could play above his ability .
He 'll likely return because the Panthers need him , but there 's a chance he could be traded because other teams are interested .
If traded , it will likely be for a couple of players : a roster player and prospects .
Down on the Farm
Kenndal McArdle
09/10 Salary : $. 850
10/11 salary : RFA
09/10 Stats : 19 GP 1/2/3 - 4 29PIM 0 PP 0SH 0GW
Odds : 10:1 on
McArdle had a promising early part of the season as an energy line player before sitting out the rest of the season with a shoulder injury .
The shoulder is apparently completely healed now , but he needs to stop fighting and play if he wants to have a long career in this league .
The Panthers will qualify him and if he does n't attempt to demand too much money , he 'll be back to start on the third or fourth line .
Michal Repik
09/10 Salary : $ 0.688
10/11 salary : $ 0.600
09/10 Stats : 19 GP 3/2/5 1 6PIM 0 PP 0SH 0GW
Odds : 50:1 on
Repik is a promising player who has yet to break through to the big team , but will be back at camp to compete for a spot .
He will probably start the season in Rochester and be first call - up .
Jeff Taffe
09/10 Salary : $ 0.500
10/11 salary : $ 0.600
09/10 Stats : 21 GP 1/1/2 - 1 4PIM 0 PP 0SH 0GW
Odds : 100:1 on
No matter how his signing was sold to the fans last summer , Taffe was signed to be a veteran player in Rochester and an experienced call - up when needed .
he will repeat the role this year .

He 'll be qualified and re-signed to play in Rochester .
Craig Weller
09/10 Salary : $ 0.625
10/11 salary : UFA
09/10 Stats : 0GP
Odds : 20:1
Weller is a career minor - league player with stints in Phoenix and Minnesota .
He was traded with Bitz and a second - round pick from the Bruins .
He was one veteran too many in Rochester late last season and had to be loaned to another team .
He 'll likely not be back .

I 'm writing a game in Haskell , and my current pass at the UI involves a lot of procedural generation of geometry .
I am currently focused on identifying performance of one particular operation ( C-ish pseudocode ) :
Vec4f multiplier , addend ; Vec4f vecList [ ] ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < count ; i++) vecList [ i ] = vecList [ i ] * multiplier + addend ;
That is , a bog - standard multiply - add of four floats , the kind of thing ripe for SIMD optimization .
The result is going to an OpenGL vertex buffer , so it has to get dumped into a flat C array eventually .
For the same reason , the calculations should probably be done on C ' float ' types .
I 've looked for either a library or a native idiomatic solution to do this sort of thing quickly in Haskell , but every solution I 've come up with seems to hover around 2 % of the performance ( that is , 50 x slower ) compared to C from GCC with the right flags .
Granted , I started with Haskell a couple weeks ago , so my experience is limited — which is why I 'm coming to you guys .
Can any of you offer suggestions for a faster Haskell implementation , or pointers to documentation on how to write high - performance Haskell code ?
First , the most recent Haskell solution ( clocks about 12 seconds ) .
I tried the bang - patterns stuff from this SO post , but it did n't make a difference AFAICT .
Replacing ' multAdd ' with '( \i v -> v * 4 ) ' brought execution time down to 1.9 seconds , so the bitwise stuff ( and consequent challenges to automatic optimization ) does n't seem to be too much at fault .

asciiTeX
Options
-v Print out the version of the asciiTeX executable and exit .
-h Print out the version of the asciiTeX executable and exit .
-f file
This option specifies the equation should be read from a file ( per default asciiTeX expects the equation on the command line ) .
- ll line - length
With this option asciiTeX attempts to format the equation within the specified line width , i.e. , asciiTeX will insert line breaks in order to format long equations over several lines .
The default is line - length 80 characters .
With a specified line width of 0 asciiTeX will not insert line breaks .
equation
If the -f option is not specified the equation is read from the command line .
Syntax
\ frac{a}{b} A fraction of a and b. a^{b} A superscript .
One can also omit the braces .
In this case the first character following ^ will be superscripted .
a_{b} A subscript .
Works just like the superscript ( well , not exactly of course ) .
\ sqrt[n ] {a}
A n-th root of a , the argument [ n ] is optional .
Without it it produces the square root of a. \sum Expands to a sigma .
\prod Expands to the product mark ( pi ) . \int Expands to the integral mark .
\oint A closed path integral .
\ left ( , \right )
Expands to braces which adept to the height of their content .
Available left braces are : ( [ {|
The corresponding right braces are : ) ] } |
All brace types can be opened by \left .
or closed by \right . , producing a single right or left brace , receptively .
\leadsto Expands to an arrow ( ~> ) ( may look ugly in some fonts ) .
\ to Expands to an arrow ( -> ). \limit{x} Expands to a limit , i.e. \limit{x \ to 0} .
\overline {X} Draws a line above expression X \underline {X} Draws a line under expression X \lceil Left ceiling symbol \rceil Right ceiling symbol \lfloor Left floor symbol \rfloor Right floor symbol \\ Insert a line break .
\ begin{array} [ pos ] {column alignments}
a00 & a01 & ... a0n \\
a10 & a11 & ... a 1n \\
... & ... & ... ... \\
am0 & am1 & ... amn
\end{array} Makes an array .
The optional argument pos sets the alignment of the array to t( op ) , b( ottom ) or c( enter ) .
The column alignments consist of one character per column , l( eft ) , c( enter ) , or r( ight ) .
Currently asciiTeX does not support vertical or horizontal lines , e.g. the column alignment specification " {|c|} " will lead to errors .
Note , that the string \begin{array} must not contain spaces .
The cells inside an array may contain mathematical formulas and sub-arrays .
\a Escapes the character a .
Useful for inserting characters like ^ , and _ in your equation .

NEW YORK — Starbucks ’ coffee drinks have become synonymous with the high costs consumers are cutting back on these days , but at least the Wi-Fi connections in its stores will no longer require a credit card .
Free Wi-Fi is in my mind just the price of admission .
Starting July 1 , Starbucks will let anyone connect to its WiFi network for free .
This fall , the company will add a content network called Starbucks Digital Network , in partnership with Yahoo and other sites , which will include local content you wo n’t be able to read anywhere else .
Both offerings will be free .
“ Free Wi-Fi is in my mind just the price of admission — we want to create … new sources of content that you can only get at Starbucks , ” chairman and president and CEO Howard Schulz told the Wired Business Conference .
“ This is a thing that does n’t exist in any other consumer marketplace in America . ”
Starbucks hopes to make money from these initiatives indirectly , by “ enhanc[ing ] the experience ” and making the content “ so compelling that it drives incremental traffic , ” said Schulz as he announced the new initiative at Wired ’s Disruptive by Design conference on Monday .
McDonalds has free Wi-Fi too , of course , as does just about every other coffee place in the country other than Starbucks .
Schulz admitted that both of those stratas have been competing with Starbucks on coffee as well as internet service , with McDonalds stealing bargain - oriented customers and boutique independent coffee shops in urban areas grabbing some of its loyal epicures .
However , none of Starbucks ’ direct competitors have their own localized content networks on the level of what Schulz described .
In some communities , Starbucks functions as a sort of community center — a “ third place ” between home and the office , in Schulz ’s words — and this infusion of local news and information , along with a free way to get it , could enhance that effect .
Each customer must log in to Wi-Fi and the Starbucks Digital Network with a unique identifier , so Starbucks wo n’t only know where you are , but who you are , potentially allowing for targeted messaging to offset cost further .
Focus groups have been quite receptive to the free Wi-Fi and local content customers will get in return , says the CEO .
So , where will all of this content come from ?
Especially , when Starbucks wants it to be updated multiple times a day , so people always see something new .
In addition to the inked partnership with Yahoo , Starbucks is talking to AOL ’s Patch.com content - creation division about having it create customized content for the network .
In addition , the network will include free online access to the Wall Street Journal , with a percentage of subscription revenue generated when coffee drinkers decide they want to access those articles elsewhere , too .

Paul McCartney knows you can't buy him love , but some are suggesting he should try to buy himself a little class after he took a cheap shot at former President George W. Bush following a performance at the White House this week .
The 67 - year - old former Beatle attacked Bush 's intelligence after receiving the Gershwin Prize from the Library of Congress on Wednesday .
All together now . . .
" It 's a fantastic honor ( for ) the Gershwin family to give me this incredible award and for me to be awarded it by the Library of Congress .
And in fact , after the last eight years , it 's great to have a president who knows what a library is , " McCartney said , drawing cheers from the audience .
But former Bush administration officials gave Sir Paul a thumbs - down , saying the headline on the story should be " Fool on the Hill Visits the White House , " and that the ex-Beatle should get back to where he once belonged .
" It was completely ungracious and undignified , " said Fox News contributor Dana Perino , who was Bush 's final White House press secretary .
" And it showed how shallow people can be , and it was sad to me someone of Paul McCartney 's stature can in one moment erase years of goodwill that he built up with so many people in America , " she said .
But Perino added that maybe she was n't amazed .
" To be honest , given all of the nasty and ridiculous things that many in the world of entertainment have said about President Bush over the years , I 'm not surprised , " she said .
Marc Thiessen , a former speechwriter for Bush , called the comment " crass " and " rude . "
" One , it shows no class .
Two , it 's ignorant , " Thiessen told FoxNews.com , noting that Bush 's wife , Laura , is a librarian .
" They made literacy an issue during his presidency and he is probably , as Karl Rove has pointed out , one of the best read presidents in recent history , " he said .
Thiessen likened the comments to him making fun of the plastic surgery McCartney has had and how silly he looked accepting the award .
" But I would never do that , " he said .
He did , however , call McCartney a " sad left winger " who is among those who still have not gotten over their " Bush Derangement Syndrome . "
Thiessen said that while he considers himself more of a Rolling Stones guy than a Beatles fan , he has learned to " separate the music from the people . "
The Gershwin prize is named for the songwriting brothers George and Ira Gershwin .
Previous recipients have been Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon .

How to Do a Psoas Release
Image via WikipediaOne of the other main causes of lower back pain is a tight psoas muscle .
It is the deepest muscle in the body .
It attaches to the inside of the spine on the vertebrae of the lower back .
It comes together as it moves through the belly towards the hip points on either side .
Then , it moves along the inside of the hip point , and around to the inside of the upper thigh .
Finding the psoas is difficult , but there ’s a trick I show you in the video .
It is best to have someone do the release on you , but it is possible to do it yourself .
You need to lie flat , if you bend the knee the psoas wo n’t be pulled long and you probably wo n’t find it .

It came a week after Israel raided a Gaza - bound flotilla carrying humanitarian supplies and hundreds of activists protesting the closure of the Hamas - ruled Palestinian territory .
Israeli soldiers killed nine activists in a clash on one of the flotilla boats , bringing fierce international condemnation and new pressure to ease the blockade .
Vice President Joe Biden said Monday the U.S. is closely consulting with Egypt and other allies to find new ways to " address the humanitarian , economic , security , and political aspects of the situation in Gaza . "
He spoke in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El - Sheikh after meeting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .
The closure has been in place since 2007 , when the Islamic militant Hamas seized the territory and it has kept out all but basic humanitarian goods .
Israel and the West consider Hamas a terror group responsible for firing thousands of rockets at Israel and carrying out hundreds of attacks , including suicide bombings .
Hamas does not recognize Israel 's right to exist .
Israel hoped the blockade would weaken Hamas , prevent the entry of weapons and bring pressure for the release of an Israeli soldier captured in 2006 , but those objectives have yet to be achieved .
The latest clash took place early Monday .
The Israeli military said a naval force spotted the Palestinians in the waters off Gaza and opened fire .
It claimed the forces had prevented an attack on Israeli targets .
The Palestinian militant group Al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades said the four killed were members of its marine unit who were training in Gaza 's waters .
Al - Aqsa , a violent offshoot of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ' Fatah faction , made the claim in a text message sent to reporters in Gaza .
Four bodies were retrieved and taken to a hospital in central Gaza , said Moawiya Hassanain , a Palestinian health official .
The Palestinian naval police said two people were still missing .
" The bloody escalation today is a desperate attempt by the occupation government to divert the world attention away from the massacre committed against the flotilla , " Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told reporters in Gaza .
The flotilla clash has brought renewed international focus on Israel 's blockade of Gaza , which Egypt has also enforced along its border with the impoverished coastal strip .
The killings seriously damaged Israel 's relations with Turkey , which had been its closest ally in the Muslim world .
Turkey unofficially supported the flotilla and eight of the nine activists killed were Turkish citizens .
One held dual Turkish - American citizenship .
Turkey has said it will reduce military and trade ties with Israel and shelved discussions of energy projects .
It has also threatened to break ties unless Israel apologizes .
In Istanbul , a 20 - member Asian security group kicked off a summit with Turkey seeking to condemn Israel for the raid .
In a reflection of Israel 's growing isolation , Vietnam asked Israeli President Shimon Peres to put off a scheduled working visit this week , given the current atmosphere .
His office said he would go ahead with a planned visit to South Korea .
Israel 's government has been frantically trying to counter the wave of harsh international condemnation that has left the Jewish state isolated and at odds with some of its closest allies .
Israel has sought to portray the nine activists killed as militants , saying they prepared for the fight before boarding the flotilla .
The military Monday released the names of five of the activists it said have long ties to terror organizations .
The army also said that Gaza 's Hamas rulers were preventing the transfer of clothing , blankets and medical equipment from the flotilla that Israel was trying to provide .
Israel has also come under heavy pressure to agree to an international investigation of the raid on the Turkish - flagged Mavi Marmara , the lead ship in the flotilla .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected a proposal by U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon for an international commission to investigate the raid , but officials said Netanyahu was open to a probe that would look into the actions of the activists as well .
Late Sunday , Netanyahu 's office released a statement saying he discussed the international criticism with world leaders , including Vice President Joe Biden , the president of France and the premier of Canada .
Netanyahu told them any country would act in self defense if it were targeted by thousands of rockets as Israel has been by Gaza militants .
Videos released by the military have shown a crowd of men attacking several naval commandos as they landed on a ship from a helicopter , beating the soldiers with clubs and other objects and hurling one soldier overboard .
Also Monday , Palestinian officials said Israel fired a missile at militants near the Gaza border , wounding one .
The military said it targeted a group of militants preparing to fire rockets at Israel .
The military said 10 rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza in the past three weeks .
Private employers added a smaller - than - expected 83,000 jobs in June , but the unemployment rate edged down to 9.5 % as many workers dropped out of a labor market that remains very sluggish .
The Labor Department reported Friday that total payroll employment , including government workers , was down 125,000 in June , reflecting the loss of 225,000 census workers who finished their assignments .
The decrease in Census Bureau staffing was expected , but most analysts were looking for stronger job growth in the private sector , which has yet to generate momentum and looms as a major threat to the overall economic recovery .
In May , private employers added just 33,000 jobs .
What ’s more , the average hours worked in manufacturing and other industries in June declined , as did average hourly earnings .
Job gains last month were largely in low - paying industries -- leisure and hospitality , and the temporary - help industry .
Manufacturing payrolls grew by 9,000 , but that was much smaller than the average of 25,400 in the prior five months .
And the construction industry shed another 22,000 jobs in June .
Although the jobless rate in June fell from 9.7 % in May , that reflected a big drop of 652,000 people in the labor force over the month .
The labor force is made up of workers and those actively looking for jobs .
With the economic recovery weakening and many employers reluctant to hire , many more unemployed people may have quit looking for work , which would push down the jobless rate .
In fact , the percentage of the overall working - age population that is in the labor force fell last month to 64.7 % -- near a 25 - year low .

Israel 's security cabinet today approved changes to the Gaza blockade that will potentially allow a range of food and building materials in for the first time in three years .
But Israel will continue strict security checks at crossings into the Gaza Strip to prevent weapons from reaching militants .
The shift could mark a victory for the pro-Palestinian Gaza aid flotilla that challenged Israel 's naval blockade on May 31 , sparking violence that left nine Turks dead and a diplomatic uproar for Israel .
An easing of the Gaza siege might spur business activity in the blighted territory of 1.5 million Palestinians , say analysts , giving Hamas an economic and political lifeline after Israel 's blockade failed to turn ordinary Gazans against their Islamist government .
IN PICTURES : The Gaza flotilla and the aftermath of the Israeli naval raid
But Hamas dismissed the Israeli move as a public relations gambit .
The cabinet decision " is nonsense and useless , '' says Ahmed Yousef , the deputy foreign minister in the Hamas government in Gaza . " [ Israel ] wants to deceive the world and say that it is easing the siege .
We are not in need of ketchup or mayonnaise .
We need construction and industry raw materials to be let in . "
An Israeli statement on the decision was short on details on exactly what will be allowed in .
The statement said that the ministers agreed to " liberalize ' ' rules for entry of goods into Gaza and " expand ' ' imports of materials for civilian projects under international supervision .
The cabinet will meet again " in the coming days " to discuss steps for implementing the changes .
" It ’s a clear direction of policy .
We have no problem with civilian goods for civilian purposes , '' says an Israeli official who requests anonymity .
The official adds that building materials , such as concrete , would be allowed into Gaza provided they are handled by international groups that have given Israel " assurances " they wo n't be used for military purposes .
For the last three years , Israel has prevented a range of items – including cilantro , fresh meat , margarine and children 's toys – from entering the Gaza Strip .
The limited food and medicine items cleared for passage were aimed at bolstering Israeli arguments that Gazans were not threatened with a humanitarian crisis .
Building infrastructure items like concrete were banned for fear it would help Hamas build bunkers .
United Nations officials have accused Israel of hampering the rebuilding of the Gaza after last year 's war with Hamas .
This past week , Israel announced it would allow more food products – such as soda , cookies , and potato chips – into Gaza .
Today 's decision would reduce the restrictions further .
Earlier , Egypt opened the Rafah border crossing to allow some Palestinians to leave Gaza , and allow more goods to be brought in .
Children 's toys no longer banned
Raed Fatouh , a Palestinian liaison who coordinates the entry of goods into Gaza , says that Israel allowed 4,000 different items into Gaza before the blockade , and now that number is 150 .
He says that the Palestinians were informed by Israel that next week more goods would be allowed in .
" Israel plans to allow stationary , kitchen tools , towels , beds , mattresses , kids toys , and the entire range of food products , " he says .
Shortly after pulling out of Gaza in 2005 , Israel began severely restricting exports and import of goods at its land crossings into the territory .
The takeover of Gaza by Hamas prompted Israel to shut the crossings almost completely except for basic foods and medicines – an attempt to isolate Hamas and undermine support by laying waste to the economy .
According to the UN , Gaza suffers from 44 percent unemployment .
Despite that , the economic pressure is considered a failure even in Israel .
The uproar over the May 31 flotilla raid emboldened critics of the blockade among Israel 's main allies in the US and Europe .
Palestinian Authority says easing insufficient
A spokesman for the US - backed Palestinian Authority , led by staunch Hamas rival Mahmoud Abbas , called the decision to ease the blockade " insufficient . ''
Secular Arab governments , such as the PA , have been accused of quietly supporting the Israeli siege to pressure Hamas .
Egypt , which closed its civilian crossing with Gaza , has been accused of collaborating on the closure as well .
" We wish for a total lifting of the siege , '' says Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat .
" Are we talking about thousands of items ?
Most of Gazas supplies come from Israel and Israel should provide for them .
This is n't against Hamas , its harming the civilian population of Gaza . ''
That sentiment was echoed by Gisha , an Israeli non-profit that has pushed for free movement of goods and people across the border .
" We do n't need cosmetic changes , '' said a statement from the group .
" We need a policy that recognizes the rights of Palestinian residents of Gaza not just to consume but also to produce and to travel . ''

White House , Rahm Emanuel Dismiss Departure Reports As “ Ludicrous ” And “ B.S. ”
The White House and Rahm Emanuel were quick to deny the reports that he has a plan to leave the White House .
Doug Mataconis · · 1 comment
It did n’t take long for a response to be issued to the London Telegraph report about Rahm Emanuel ’s departure from the White House which I wrote about this morning .
First , the White House dismissed the report as “ ludicrous ” :
The White House Monday dismissed as “ ludicrous ” a report that Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel plans to leave his post after becoming frustrated with the Obama administration .
Citing Washington insiders , British newspaper
The Daily Telegraph said Emanuel was fed up with the “ idealism ” of President Barack Obama ’s closest advisers and was concerned about burning out and losing touch with his three children due to the pressure of the job .
In response to the report , a senior White House official told Fox News the “ ludicrous ” story was “ not worth looking into . ”
Not surprisingly , Rahm Emanuel was a little more colorful in his response :
Emanuel , known for his use of colorful language , e-mailed a response to CBS News chief White House Correspondent Chip Reid : “ As I would say this is bs or as the english like to say baseless . ”
So , that ’s their response .
Take it for what you will .
Obviously , if Rahm does have a plan to leave the White House anytime in the next year or so , he ’s not going to admit it now .
To be honest , though , I ’m not sure that we can rely really on a British newspaper for insights about the internal workings of the White House staff .
If there report were to appear in the Washington Post or New York Times , it arguably should be taken more seriously , but the Telegraph ?
Not quite so much .
That said , I agree with Steven Taylor that it would not be at all surprising to see Emanuel leave at some point after the November elections whether it ’s because of political ambitions or simple burnout .
It ’s also worth noting that Emanuel ’s family still lives in Chicago and has still not permanently , or even semi-permanently , re-located to Washington , D.C.
That alone is probably an indication that Emanuel never intended to be Chief of Staff for the entirety of Obama ’s first term from the time he took the job .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - French striker Thierry Henry ’s recent move to Major League Soccer generated publicity for the North American league , but it is a lesser - known Frenchman who has been winning the plaudits in MLS this season .
A hardly - noticed defender with Lorient in his homeland , Sebastien Le Toux ’s road to American attention followed a very different route than Henry .
Le Toux worked his way up from the U.S. second division to become an MLS All Star who will face Manchester United on Wednesday .
“ It was a new start for me to come to the ( United ) States , I was not planning to come here to America but I love my new life , I like everything here , ” the 26 - year - old told Reuters .
While Henry ’s big -money move earlier this month came near the end of a career full of success with Arsenal in England , Barcelona in Spain and the French national team , Le Toux ’s arrival was largely accidental .
The Frenchman failed to impress in a trial with MLS team FC Dallas , but a chance meeting in France with Seattle Sounders General Manager Adrian Hanauer got him another shot .
A switch to a striker role led to an impressive 24 goals in 54 games in the second tier and when the Sounders were handed a spot in MLS , they made sure to sign Le Toux to their team .
Although he played in front of the league ’s biggest crowds -- the Sounders averaged over 30,000 -- Le Toux ’s story could easily have fizzled on the Pacific coast .
Despite being popular with supporters , he was moved off the front line and given a largely supporting role to Swedish forward Freddie Ljungberg and Colombian talent Fredy Montero .
ANOTHER CHANCE
When the league ’s latest expansion team , the Philadelphia Union , began to assess their options in the expansion draft , their coach Peter Nowak noticed Le Toux was available .
“ I looked past that one season and saw a player from the seasons before who knew how to score goals and is very useful in every position in the frontline , ” Nowak told Reuters .
The Polish - born coach decided he wanted Le Toux to join his new team and to give him another chance at forward .
“ He called me and told me he really wanted me for his team and that he saw me as a forward rather than a midfielder , it was great to hear , ” said Le Toux , who responded with seven goals in 12 starts .
“ He has given me confidence . ”
Nowak quickly realized the forward from the Northern French town of Mont - Saint - Aignan was much more than a target man .
“ We have tried to give him more freedom to pop up at the back , to be the playmaker in certain situations , to go up front and be unpredictable , also from the second line because of his speed and his killer instinct - he gets into the right place at the right time , ” said Nowak .
The former U.S. national team assistant coach believes Le Toux now has the talent to make it back home .
“ By developing his game in the right direction , with the imagination and creativity , I think he is intelligent enough to embrace Europe or the French league and if there is the chance for him , I will not stand in his way , ” he said .
ROLE MODEL
Le Toux says such a prospect is not on his agenda even though his surge in goals and the arrival of Henry has brought him some attention .
“ At the beginning no one ( in France ) really knew that I was here , it is only in the past few months that people have begun to notice me , ” he said .
“ Now with Thierry Henry coming it has been nice , lots of people are surprised that someone who was a defender in France is now an attacking midfielder or a forward here . ”
Le Toux is also surprised to find himself a role model for other players in Europe thinking of making a move Stateside .
“ I receive lots of mail from people wanting to come here , ” he said .
“ I ’m not an agent , but I tell them ‘ come over , do I like I did , pay your plane ticket and give it a go .
It ’s a nice thing to do . ’ ”
( CNN ) --
As many as nine Americans may have been aboard the Gaza relief flotilla attacked by the Israeli military , and are now being held by Israeli authorities , a State Department official said Monday .
The official , who had no details about their identities , conditions or whereabouts , said U.S. consular officials were expecting to interview the Americans on Tuesday .
Separately , Jonathan Slevin , a spokesman for the activist group Free Palestine Movement , said a group of five Americans participated in the flotilla , including former U.S. Ambassador Edward Peck .
Slevin said the Americans boarded a ship called the Sfendoni in Athens , Greece .
He said there had been no communication with the Americans since the flotilla was intercepted by the Israelis .
Masharpe1 said : " What a great experience !
Everything you could possibly want at great prices !
I did a lot of looking around and this is by far the most user friendly website out there for your ammo needs .
Inventory is " real time " so there 's no guesswork as to when it will ship .
Shipping is fast and the more you buy , the better the overall value !
It 's a better deal than those " box stores " like Academy , Wal - Mart or Bass Pro AND they have it in stock !
I am very happy to have found Lucky Gunner and will continue to tell everyone about it .
These guys obviously take pride in what they do and THIS is what customer service should be like .
Others could learn something from their model .
Thanks again . "
Rivash said : " I was very pleased on my recent purchase and Lucky Gunner customer service was excellent ! "
BurlMeister said : " The Lucky Gunner is the place I 'll be buying my ammo from now on .
It was my first time experience at buying ammo on line , so I was a little concerned .
They were easy to find and navigate their web page .
The selection was out standing and great prices .
The thing that stood out the most was there customer service .
You know all about your puchase and where it is until it reaches your front door , then they e-mail to make sure you recieved it .
They are a company that knows customer service is what can make a company in difficult economic times . "
Behind the postcard beauty of Vanuatu lie tales of police brutality , human rights abuses – and witchcraft .
And when a New Zealand judge turned a harsh light on some of the nation 's dark secrets , he set in train a series of events that some say could end in another Pacific coup .
THERE'S
A cruise ship in town , and in central Port Vila , the Australians are shopping for duty free .
Icy air - conditioning chills the sweat on their big sunburnt faces as they throng around rows of Absolut vodka and towers of cigarettes .
At the nearby food market the locals – ni-Vanuatu – are buying and selling too : grotesque deep - fried fish - heads and white starchy slabs of laplap .
Or they 're queuing to buy calltime for their Digicel mobile phones ( pidgin ad slogan : " Yu likem toktok ? " ) .
Maximum security prisoners in the hastily built ' container city ' .
Just another Wednesday in Vanuatu 's dusty capital on the island of Efate – the hub of a tourist - based economy that offers the lava - spitting volcano of Tanna , the wreck dives of Espiritu Santo , stunning beaches on any of the nation 's 80 - odd smaller islands , and a thrillingly fresh history of cannibalism and black magic .
But in bland concrete buildings scattered around this tiny town – a lawyer 's office , a government ministry , the police and army HQs – other dark tales are unfolding .
And New Zealand , through its often - thwarted attempts to help out a developing Pacific neighbour with a $ 20 million aid programme , is in deep .
This nation of 250,000 people , which achieved independence from joint French and English colonial masters only in 1980 , is wrestling with crises in its jails , its police and its army – crises that the most pessimistic commentators say could lead to a coup .
Others believe it could never go that far – but what is certain is that when the camouflage - clad paramilitaries of the Vanuatu Mobile Force ( VMF ) recaptured a prison escapee called John Bule on March 29 last year , they started something that will reverberate through Vanuatu for years .
Joshua Bong ( left ) and Moana Carcasses .
It was no great surprise that Bule – a convicted rapist who had been on the run for a month – ended up with broken limbs , snapped fingers and a shattered kneecap during an " interrogation " at the VMF 's Port Vila barracks after his re-arrest .
Beatings of escapees were routine , and heartily endorsed by ni-Vanuatu and expatriates fed up with repeat breakouts .
( As one Australian - born resident put it , many were happy to see the VMF " kill the f --- ing lot of them " . )
Even the fact that Bule died need n't have caused a huge fuss : an ineffectual police inquiry took just a week to sweep the entire nasty affair under the carpet , without any of Bule 's interrogators even being interviewed .
But then Vanuatu's Chief Justice , Vincent Lunabek , put in place something Vanuatu has almost never seen before : a full coronial inquiry .
Crucially , he gave the role of coroner to New Zealander Nevin Dawson – a straight - talking Palmerston North district court judge serving a two - year appointment to Vanuatu 's Supreme Court .
( New Zealand has also been working to professionalise the prison system , which has long been in a woeful state – see below . )
Dawson 's coronial report – an unflinching account of a brutal killing by VMF officers – was released in March , and described breaches of law , of human rights , and of the country 's constitution .
As one Port Vila resident told the Sunday Star - Times , this was " the first time that someone 's stood up and said , `look , you just can't beat the shit out of people " ' .
The report did n't just call for a criminal investigation into Bule 's death .
It also revealed that senior officials , including Vanuatu 's top policeman , Joshua Bong , had tried to derail the coroner 's inquest , and it described attempts by VMF members to intimidate those involved in the inquiry , including a death threat against Dawson .
Dawson 's report – and this is the bit that is now proving so tricky – also called into question the very existence of the 230 - strong VMF .
The paramilitary organisation , replete with French - made Famas semi-automatic weapons , has a record of law - breaking and unwarranted violence , and has little or no government oversight .
This , Dawson wrote bluntly , is a " recipe for political instability " .
He was talking , in other words , about the possibility of a coup .
FOR ANYONE unfamiliar with Vanuatu , Justice Dawson 's report into the death of John Bule was startling not just for what it said about brutality and shaky institutions .
Almost as a footnote to a section on VMF lies , bluster and threats , Dawson wrote :
" ... some person or persons attempted to use `black magic ' to influence the outcome of the Inquest by laying a `magic stone ' outside the Inquest , apparently with the intention of making the Coroner forget the evidence he heard during the Inquest . "
Magic , Dawson was learning , is very much alive in Vanuatu .
Four - fifths of ni-Vanuatu live in villages outside the nation 's two towns , following traditional customs .
Any sickness or premature death , a run of good or bad luck , is attributed to witchcraft .
Even amid the modernity of Port Vila , it is hard to find a ni-Vanuatu who does n't believe at least a little bit in witchcraft .
Edgar Hinte , a guide at Port Vila 's Cultural Centre , says if you want magic done you go to a spirit doctor ( or " kleva man " in Vanuatu 's easily translated pidgin Bislama ) .
" If you want to marry a woman , go to a kleva .
He 'll give you a herb to rub on your mouth , and that will make the woman faithful to you . "
The most powerful witchcraft , though , uses " magic stones " like the one that failed to make Dawson forget evidence .
Hinte says they tend to be black and unusual in shape ; many of the best stones come from the island of Ambrym , where the active volcano imbues them with greater potency .
You 'll know a magic stone when you see one , says Hinte .
" They have a strong effect .
If you hold one in your hand , your hand will start to go numb . "
The stones work at a distance : if you have score to settle , you might pay a kleva with a pig or some kava root , and he 'll place some food on a magic stone .
Soon enough , your enemy will be poisoned .
The cure , naturally , is to go to another kleva .
( Or , as a sceptical Port Vila resident who once visited a kleva for the hell of it , puts it : " You go and see a kleva who 'll f--- around , charge you a fortune and spit something out on the floor " ) .
A steady stream of cases involving witchcraft comes in front of the courts .
Recently , a 14 - year - old girl was beaten to death with rocks by family members trying to drive out a malign spirit .
Two men from the island of Maewo were accused of witchcraft and reportedly chopped to pieces on the beach with an axe .
There is a political dimension , too .
French - born lawyer Marie - Noelle Patterson , a naturalised ni-Vanuatu who was ombudsman in the 1990s and now leads the local chapter of human rights watchdog Transparency International , says widespread fear of witchcraft can " diminish the courage of a nation " , chilling public debate about issues such as VMF brutality , or the character of a police commissioner .
" People are raised believing that if I am in my office here and you are [ somewhere else ] , you can do something to harm me , or my children .
If I believed that when I was ombudsman , I never would have done anything .
I would have been too scared for my kids .
That 's why sometimes it 's good that people like me or Dawson can utter the words that everyone thinks . "
DAWSON COULD ignore the stone outside his courtroom ; less easily brushed aside were the death threats .
According to the coronial report , a senior VMF officer " loudly and aggressively [ said ] words to the effect that `we will kill the coroner " ' before the inquiry began .
Some observers say Dawson was never in any serious danger , and the threat was just the idle outburst of a hothead .
But whatever the real danger , the New Zealand and Vanuatu governments responded in earnest , strengthening security at the home of Dawson and his wife Jill .
Rumours of a fresh threat in April led the couple to leave the country for several days while the New Zealand government completed a new security analysis .
Both governments say there are no current concerns about the Dawsons ' safety , and Justice Dawson is expected to remain in Vanuatu till his contract ends later this year .
Dawson has consistently declined interviews , but he certainly looked relaxed on a recent sunny Monday morning when the Star - Times spotted him in downtown Port Vila , boarding a boat laden with scuba gear and divers .
A colleague says Dawson also likes to play golf and tennis .
Recreations aside , Dawson is seen as an extremely efficient judge , managing a demanding caseload and bringing some much - needed rigour to an often slipshod system .
One ni-Vanuatu defendant who appeared before Dawson said the judge gave lawyers for both parties a hard time , pushing them to " pull their socks up ... be on time , present arguments properly , talk properly , stand properly – a school - teachery kind of person " .
The same scolding tone permeated Dawson 's coronial report , but so far the government has n't really pulled its socks up .
Minister of Internal Affairs Moana Carcasses , a slick - haired and charming populist who is strumming a guitar in his ministry office when the Star - Times pays a visit , is slowly putting together a commission of inquiry into Bule 's death and the role of the VMF .
Recommendations will be made .
Action may eventually be taken .
It sounds awfully like a whitewash and a cop-out , but according to one observer , this is the Melanesian way – moving slowly to find a consensus without rocking the boat too much .
More pragmatically , a commission of inquiry will protect the government from criticism that it is simply responding to a white foreigner .
Faced with the spectre of Police Commissioner Joshua Bong , and the well - armed , under - regulated VMF , Carcasses does n't want to spark a security crisis by moving too fast ( see sidebar , left ) .
So softly - softly is how it 's going to be , as a young Pacific country tries to find its own way of holding itself together .
" You know , when this nation became independent , there were maybe 15 graduates , " says Carcasses .
" Now we have much more .
We are learning . "
Vanuatu has made plenty of mistakes , says Carcasses , who is remarkably candid about that fact that police violence has long been condoned by government , and that intimidation of court witnesses is still commonplace .
But a young country , and its people , will make mistakes , and you need to give people second chances , says Carcasses , who then chooses a turn of phrase that under the circumstances seems in pretty poor taste .
Human rights activists might argue that every official who does something wrong should end up in jail , says Carcasses , " but there is not enough room in jail " .
Who is Joshua Bong – and could he lead a coup ?
If Vanuatu has a man who might conceivably take the role filled in Fiji by Frank Bainimarama , it would have to be Joshua Bong .
Bong is currently police commissioner , and has strong links to the paramilitary Vanuatu Mobile Force ( VMF ) that he once led .
He was accused of perjury in Kiwi judge Nevin Dawson 's report into the fatal beating of prisoner John Bule , but no action has yet been taken against him .
Many believe this is because the government fears Bong 's reaction if threatened .
For all their guns , it is unlikely the 230 - strong VMF would have the popular support to mount a simple military coup , but one observer says if the force felt itself under serious threat , it could well attempt to take a dozen key people , lock them up somewhere and put in place others more likely to serve their interests .
Ralph Regenvanu , an independent MP within the governing coalition , says Bong is " a thug .
And we do n't need the commissioner of police to be a thug who disregards the law " .
In early 2009 , Bong was acting director of Vanuatu 's Correctional Services when prisoners burnt down a jail in protest over their mistreatment .
He was suspended from that job as a result .
Bong has shrugged off calls for him to resign , blaming Bule 's death on the governments of Vanuatu and New Zealand for taking too long to build a new prison in Port Vila .
According to a Radio New Zealand report , Bong said the governments were meant to have put proper prison facilities in place , and if this had been done there would have been no escapes , no death and no inquiry .
As one outraged insider said , it was a case of " avoid the issues and blame an aid donor .
NZ
Aid have had to crawl over broken glass to have the privilege of building a new prison for them , and now it is their fault for not doing it sooner " .
Minister of Internal Affairs Moana Carcasses admits his government is responding to the coronial report extremely cautiously , because " stability is a concern " , and a security crisis would have a damaging effect on Vanuatu 's tourism - dependent economy .
How NZ got caught up in Vanuatu 's prison - escape drama
- 2004 Historic concerns over ill - treatment of prisoners and escapes from Port Vila 's colonial prisons ( " ex- British " and the " ex - French " ) lead NZ to focus aid assistance on developing new civilian Correctional Service to replace police .
NZ also pledges to build a new prison .
- 2005 -2008 Wrangles over land ownership stall prison construction , but Correctional Services formed regardless .
Escapes continue apace .
- Early 2008
Two high - profile murders of expatriates stoke public perception that Port Vila is awash with dangerous criminals ( even though neither killer was an escapee ) .
Vanuatu government asks VMF to work alongside Corrections : result is an even more chaotic system that leaves NZ advisers despairing , and a return to brutal treatment of prisoners .
- December 2008 Prisoners at ex-French prison vow to burn it down unless conditions improve .
Acting Corrections head Joshua Bong blocks attempts by two MPs ( Ralph Regenvanu and Moana Carcasses ) to broker negotiations .
- December 19 , 2008 Ex - French prison burnt to the ground .
All inmates escape .
The two MPs persuade escapees to turn themselves in , but are arrested and charged , ludicrously , with aiding their escape .
( Charges are later thrown out by Justice Dawson . )
Bong suspended from Corrections role ( but soon reappointed as police commissioner ) .
- January 2009
All prisoners are crammed into the remaining ex - British prison .
- February - March 2009
Twenty prisoners , including rapist John Bule , escape .
VMF launches " Operation Klinap " to recapture them .
All but one prisoner is recaptured , but many are brutally assaulted and left with broken bones .

Monday ’s decision in McDonald vs. City of Chicago is a major victory for civil rights .
Yes , it was 5 - 4 and the ruling was weaker than it could have been , but the basic holding that the Second Amendment is incorporated against states and all lower levels of government can be a powerful tool for positive change if we wield it correctly .
The legal climate for full restoration of firearms rights in the U.S. is now better than it ’s been since the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968 .
Much remains to be done , however .
The Heller ruling in 2008 , while affirming that firearms ownership is a fundamental individual right , allowed “ reasonable regulation ” and failed to specify a standard of scrutiny for what is “ reasonable ” ; the McDonald decision does not specify this either .
The constitutionally correct position , of course , is that laws infringing on Second Amendment liberties should have to meet the same strictest - scrutiny standard applied where the First Amendment is concerned — but the City of Chicago has already made plain its intent to nullify the Heller and MacDonald rulings by equating “ reasonable ” with “ prohibitive ” .
The next major round of litigation will almost certainly be over the scrutiny standard .
The tactical question for gun-rights advocates , though , is which kind of state and local regulations to attack , and in what order .
Of course outright gun bans like Chicago ’s need to be first on the target list ; but after that , what ?
It seems to me that the next logical target is concealed - carry bans and permit requirements for handguns .
This is an issue that affects more Americans than restrictions on long arms or registration requirements , so popular pressure should be easiest to muster here .
Two states ( Wisconsin and Illinois ) forbid concealed carry altogether ; three others ( Alaska , Vermont , and Arizona ) do not have any permit requirement .
Comparing crime and violence rates per capita it ’s pretty clear which arrangement wins .
If I were a pro-Second - Amendment lawyer , I would argue thusly : ( 1 ) the applicable standard is “ strict scrutiny ” , e.g. the law must serve a compelling purpose which cannot be served by less stringent regulation , and ( 2 ) the example of Alaska and Vermont shows that these regulations do not serve a compelling purpose at all .
It will be interesting to see if any civil - rights group is brave enough to try this .

If you spend a lot of time barefoot at public pools , or public showers , you ’re at risk for getting a fungal infection .
The fungal infection of the skin that results in flaking , scaling , and itching of the feet , is called athlete ’s foot .
You do n’t have to be an athlete to get athlete ’s foot .
The name is due to the fact that swimming pools and public showers ( like in a gym locker room ) are great breeding grounds for this fungus .
These areas are warm and damp , making it ideal for the fungus to gather and spread .
Another good breeding ground is a pair of sneakers that are used during exercise .
If you do end up getting athlete ’s foot , there ’s no need to worry .
There are several products on the market designed to clear up this annoying foot problem .
These products could be somewhat expensive , but there is another solution .
Vinegar .
Is it possible to use vinegar as a treatment for athlete ’s foot ?
What makes the vinegar helpful in treating athlete ’s foot is the malic acid .
This component of the vinegar makes it very efficient at getting rid of the fungus .
Vinegar also helps to alleviate the itching of athlete ’s foot .
You want to make sure you get the right kind of vinegar .
You want to buy apple cider vinegar that is cloudy and brown in color .
If the vinegar is clear and you can see through it , it wo n’t be as effective .
The cloudy vinegar includes many beneficial nutrients that have healing properties .
Make a mixture of one part apple cider vinegar to two or three parts warm water .
Put your feet into the vinegar bath for about 20 minutes .
The acidity of the vinegar will make it very difficult for the fungus to survive .
If the solution stings too much , try adding more water to dilute the acidity of the vinegar .
As the athlete ’s foot clears up over time , you can use less water .
After the foot bath , rinse your feet off , and dry them completely .
You can use this foot bath twice a day .
If you have a less severe case of athlete ’s foot , you can apply the apple cider vinegar and water mixture to your feet using a cotton ball or a wash cloth .
This is a good option if you have a child who does n’t like to sit still for long periods of time .
You can apply the solution with a wash cloth or cotton ball several times a day .
It ’s a good idea to apply it right before getting into bed , so the mixture is n’t wiped off as you walk .
Athlete ’s foot can burrow in between the toes , and can be very difficult to get rid of .
The cracking , redness , and itching associated with this foot problem can be uncomfortable and painful .
Some ways you can avoid getting athlete ’s foot , include :
Wash the feet at least once every day .
Change your socks right after you finish a workout .
Wear “ pool socks ” when you go to a public pool or use the shower in the locker room .
Wear “ breathable ” sneakers to allow for more air flow .
Reduce the amount of perspiration of your feet by using talcum powder .
Because the foot fungus can keep coming back , it ’s cheaper to use vinegar as a treatment for athlete ’s foot .
It can get expensive when you have to buy products that are specially made for athlete ’s foot .
Another thing to consider is that one product that works for one person , might not work for someone else .
So , you can end up spending money of a product that does n’t help your problem .
There ’s no need to spend a ton of money when relief can be found in your kitchen cabinet .

TRENTON
— The month - long controversy over Gov. Chris Christie ’s decision to replace Supreme Court Justice John Wallace took a new turn today .
Christie , who has faced a series of rebukes from critics who say the move jeopardizes the independence of the Judiciary , lost the services of a state advisory panel today after its members resigned in protest .
Previous coverage :
• Justice Wallace grateful for colleague support as term ends
• Ousted N.J. Supreme Court Justice John Wallace thanks colleagues for support
• N.J. lawyers group honors ousted state Supreme Court Justice John Wallace Jr .
• N.J. attorneys voice concern over Gov. Christie 's decision to oust Justice Wallace as term expires
• Friends , colleagues say both Wallace and Patterson are qualified for N.J. Supreme Court
In a letter to Christie , the resigning members of the Judicial Advisory Panel , which reviews nominees to the Superior Court , said the governor ’s views are " inconsistent with an independent judiciary . "
" You have expressed publicly a profoundly different view of the governor ’s appointive responsibilities , " they wrote .
" This was exemplified by your actions and remarks in refusing to reappoint Justice John Wallace to the Supreme Court , a jurist who indisputably exemplified all of the qualifications for honorable judicial service . "
Four of the Judicial Advisory Panel ’s seven members are former Supreme Court justices : James Coleman , Alan Handler , Stewart Pollock and Deborah Poritz .
When reached for comment , Coleman and Pollock declined to elaborate on the letter .
" The letter is self explanatory , " Pollock said .
" The panel and the governor have differing views of judicial independence . "
Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak thanked the resigning panel members for their service and said they will be replaced " in short order . "
Also on the panel were Kean University Professor Susan Lederman , Goya Foods General Counsel Carlos Ortiz , and former state appellate judge Harold Wells .
Former Gov. Jon Corzine created the Judicial Advisory Panel with an executive order in 2006 to help vet Superior Court nominees , then appointed all the members who resigned today .
" The members who resigned are entitled to their opinions , but not everyone shares their views , including others in the judiciary and legal community who recognize the governor ’s constitutional prerogative and authority in this regard , " Drewniak said .
Christie is the first New Jersey governor who has not renominated a sitting Supreme Court justice since the state revamped its constitution six decades ago .
Christie has said the court overstepped its bounds with rulings affecting tax and social policies , saying Wallace had to go because he contributed to the court ’s judicial activism .
Democrats protested the decision , and Chief Justice Stuart Rabner criticized the governor in a rare public statement .
Last month Christie nominated Morristown lawyer Anne Patterson to replace Wallace , but Senate Democrats have pledged to block any confirmation hearings for the next 22 months , when Wallace would have been eligible for mandatory retirement at age 70 .
Once on a flight I ate a cheeseburger - in - a - bag .
It was a wonderfully microwaved beefy dough ball of cheesy - type goo .
It tasted amazing !
Of course , it ’s designed to taste amazing .
Mission so accomplished .
The sandwich had the right amount of fat and salt to appeal to my ancient binge - to - survive - winter DNA .
It was laced with artificial scents , laboratory flavors and synthetic colors .
It had the proper “ mouth feel . ”
The right size .
The perfect temperature .
My cheeseburger - in - a - bag was like a friend who had been paid to be nice to me : comforting , as long as you do n’t think about it too much .
In short :
The meal was manipulated by years of food science and marketing research to manipulate me .
The “ taste to actual health benefits ratio ” was way off .
It was more appealing than life sustaining .
It was the definition of junk .
Which is an apt metaphor for the state of cable news in America .
Watch your average for - profit 24 - hour station for one hour .
Your pulse will start racing .
Something horrible is going down !
Something that will kill you and your family and everyone you care about is close and imminent !
You MUST stay tuned !
There ’s something outrageous !
That ’s why people are yelling at each other !
Cable news starts with a story , removes the grain and nuance then mainlines the fury .
It ’s all high - fructose hyperbole all the time .
Originally there was one 24 - hour cable news channel , CNN .
Then there were three .
Now the three have spin - offs and there are by my count nine ( CNN , HLN , CNN International , CNN en Espanol , MSNBC , CNBC , Fox News Channel , Fox Business Network and Bloomberg ) all vying for attention .
That ’s 216 hours of programming to fill with the news of just one day .
It used to be the formula of Fox News to be a parody of Howard Beale in The Network , “ I ’m mad as hell , and I ’m not going to take it anymore ! ”
Now all the channels are guilty of the same schtick – doing whatever they can to fling themselves to the top of the heap to make their respective Faye Dunaways happy .
In short :
The shows are manipulated by years of psychology and marketing research to manipulate us .
The “ entertainment to information ratio ” is way off .
It ’s more appealing than illuminating … which also makes it junk .
The literal translation of what locals in Somalia call the man on the BBC who reads the news is “ He Who Scares Old People . ”
For the higher - on - the - dial news shows this moniker is a selling point , if not a requirement .
Because if you ’re not afraid , you ’re not watching .
Just as an experiment – instead of cable news watch PBS or listen to NPR .
Try it .
It ’s like going from Oreos to oat bran .
There ’s a sudden withdrawal .
You keep expecting someone to yell , shake their fists and proclaim “ We ’re doomed ! ” but it does n’t happen .
It seems as if the world might go on – that we have some problems , here they are and here is the context for said problems .
No one calls anyone a Nazi…unless they actually served in the SS .
It ’s very novel and foreign when you ’re accustomed to “ loud equals accurate . ”
A study released at the beginning of the year by Shawn Powers at USC and Mohammed el - Nawawy at Queens University found that the more their subjects in the study watched Al - Jazeera English , the less dogmatic they were in their thinking .
Participants retained their opinions but were more open to the views of others .
It ’s like all the studies that find a diet of real food consisting of vegetables and fiber makes you feel better in every way .
It ’s interesting …and ignored .
We have too much over - processed junk food available round the clock , and we are fat .
We have too much over - sensationalized news available around the clock , and we are miserable .
More importantly a giant chunk of us are incredibly ignorant .
Just as obese people are often malnourished , there are people who watch the “ news ” constantly and are horribly uninformed .
It ’s overconsumption of junk .
What ’s the result of an uninformed , frightened and hysterical populace ?
As the saying goes , we get the government we deserve : shortsighted , petty and trend - obsessed .
Which in fairness … is great for ratings .

On Wednesday criticized Israel 's recent demolition of Palestinian houses in East Jerusalem , saying that it was precisely " the kind of unilateral action that undermines trust . "

" It is the very kind of action that poses a potential obstacle to direct negotiations , " Crowley added , referring to U.S. aims to bring Israel and the Palestinians to the negotiation table to iron out a peace deal .
He added that the future direct negotiations would be " the only route to addressing the final - status issues , whether it's the status of Jerusalem , borders of a viable Palestinian state , security for the people of Israel , and resolution of refugees in these territories and throughout the region . "
" Any steps that the Israelis , Palestinians or other parties take that change the facts on the ground , we think are unhelpful , " Crowley went on to say .
When asked whether the U.S. administration is worried about Egyptian President Hosni Mubaraks state of health , which has been rumored to be badly deteriorating , he declined to comment .
That would be something for the Egyptian government to comment on , he said .
We continue to value the contribution that President Mubarak has made to peace and security in the region .
We always wish him good health .
But as to his current status , I 'll defer to the Egyptian government . "
A scheduled meeting between the Egyptian president and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , which has been postponed multiple times , was once again delayed on Wednesday sparking concern over Mubarak 's health .
However , Egypt issued a statement on Wednesday citing Israel 's demolitions of Palestinian structures in East Jerusalem as the reason for the delay .
The demolition of three houses on Tuesday was the first such Israeli action in the span of nine months .
Recently , the director of the Jerusalem Municipality Yair Ma'ayan admitted that the city was refraining from demolishing the illegally built structures in the Eastern part of the city because the Prime Minister 's Office was not sanctioning such action , creating a de-facto freeze .
This despite the fact that active demolition orders exist against thousands of Palestinian houses in East Jerusalem .

Defense contracting officers have a new set of marching orders : before bundling up small contracts to make a larger one , notice has to be posted on FedBizOpps.gov .
The idea is too address concerns of small businesses who say the bigger contracts make it impossible for them to compete .
The interim rule may be easier said than done .
Roger Waldron , Counsel at the law firm Mayer Brown told Federal News Radio the request for comments to the change on the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation ( FAR ) demonstrates two fundamental competing interests that the government has .
Number one , obviously , there ’s the interest in openness , transparency , making this information available to the public .
You balance that against the government ’s goal , and interest in , obtaining competition for requirements , and one of the key aspects of getting firms to be able to compete for government requirements is confidence on the part of industry that their sensitive or proprietary commercial financial information is going to be protected from disclosure to their competitors or to other customers .
Waldron said that really what the FAR council is doing is asking the public for ideas for efficiency , transparency and how to protect information at the same time .
He pointed out there are “ already ( transparency ) processes in place so the question is what would be the value added here and I ’m not so sure that ultimately there ’s a huge value added . ”
In the end , said Waldron , it ’s as though the government is being forced to walk a tightrope balance between transparency and transparency for transparency ’s sake
This rule ’s almost like a nexus where people …
I think should step back now , get these comments , take a look and say “ Okay , what ’s the right balance ?
What are we trying to accomplish ? ”
Ultimately what is the additional benefit to the public to creating the system versus the cost of creating some sort of process to do this for both industry and government .
I believe in openness and transparency , but there ’s got to be a balance to it , because I also believe , fundamentally , in competition for government requirements .
And I think , to the extent there ’s this big push that threatens the ability of contractors , and I ’m not saying it does but if there ’s any perception or apprehension on the part of contractors that their information is going to be disclosed , it ’s going to make them think twice about competing for requirements .
The interim rule is open for comment until September 13 , 2010 .
Last Saturday the Million Marijuana March took place in Warsaw , Poland .
A few people were caught in possesion of drugs during the demonstration and taken to the nearby police station .
After the March some protesters went to the station , asking the police to release their friends .
This is what happened next ...
If you have a bone to pick with regards to the designing of the Hydra Piano , you better fight Lady Gaga then .
Apostol Tnokovski was enjoying one of her performances on the telly , when he realized that the old , boxy piano was a misfit on her stage !
Aghast , he took to the drawing board and came up with this unique , some - what flowing concept that looks stunning in pure glossy white or black .
To make matters complicated , the inspiration also comes from the mythological sea monster “ Hydra ” .
Wonder who would perform better on stage shows … monster Hydra Lady Gaga or the piano !

INTRODUCTION
Outside the new testament writings , the earliest Christian document we possess is an anonymous letter of the church of Rome to the church of Corinth .
It was written about A.D. 96 , and was so highly esteemed in Christian antiquity that for a while it was even reckoned as part of the canon in Egypt and Syria.99 Clement of Alexandria cites it as Scripture , and it is found in Syriac and Coptic codices of the N.T. as well as being appended to the Codex Alexandrinus .
Very ancient tradition ascribes the letter to a certain Clement who , according to the early episcopal lists , was the third bishop of Rome .
The style of the document is simple and clear , though it is marked by some rhetorical devices , notably a fondness for synonyms .
The importance of the letter lies in the picture it gives us of early Roman Christianity .
Here we see a version of the gospel which , while reflecting Paulinism , is more strongly influenced by Hellenistic Judaism , and which , in several ways , foreshadows the leading emphases of later Roman Catholicism .
DATE
Some references in the letter itself indicate that it stems from the period of the second generation of Christians .
The Neronian persecution of A.D. 64 is already past ( chs. 5 ; 6 ) : the Corinthians are viewed as an " ancient church " ( ch. 47:6 ) , and there are in Rome those who from youth to old age have lived irreproachable Christian lives ( ch. 63:3 ) .
Yet Peter and Paul can be described as heroes belonging to " our own generation " ( ch. 5:1 ) ; and while the apostles have passed away , there still 34 survive some whom they appointed as presbyters ( ch. 44 ) .
Certain calamities have again befallen the church ( chs. 1:1 ; 7:1 ) .
These are distinguished from the Neronian persecution ( ch. 7:1 ) , and are generally taken to refer to Domitian 's capricious attacks on Christians .
While we are not well informed about these , there is sufficient evidence to credit them .
1010
The relevant passages will be found in J. B. Lightfoot , The Apostolic Fathers , Part I , Vol. I , pp. 104 ff .
A further indication that the letter belongs to the first century is the lack of a knowledge of the canonical Gospels .
All in all , there can be little doubt that A.D. 96 or 97 ( the end of Domitian 's reign or the beginning of Nerva 's ) is the correct date .
THE OCCASION OF THE LETTER
The occasion of the letter was a schism in the Corinthian church .
The same factious spirit that Paul had encountered there had once again provoked serious dissension .
It appears that some young men had been the ringleaders of a revolt which had succeeded in deposing the ruling presbyters ( chs. 3:3 ; 44:6 ) .
Exactly what lay behind this action is not altogether clear .
It may be that these youths , restless under the rule of clergy considerably older than themselves and who held office for life , sought to introduce a more flexible system into the ministry .
Following the custom of the cults , they may have wished for annual elections and for a constant change of officers .
It is probable , however , that an even deeper issue was involved .
There are hints in the letter that the rebels claimed to have particular spiritual gifts which ( in their judgment ) were not receiving adequate recognition .
They were ascetics observing continence ( ch. 38:2 ) .
They boasted of " gnosis " — secret knowledge of the faith , that is , revealed only to the elite ( ch. 48:5 ) .
Perhaps , too , they spoke with tongues , though the references are equally open to the interpretation that they were persuasive and powerful speakers ( chs. 21:5 ; 57:2 ) .
These slight indications might lead us to suppose that the strife was between charismatics and the regular ministry .
In the course of the Church 's history those with special spiritual gifts have not seldom felt slighted if they received insufficient recognition or failed to be elected to office .
This is the reverse of the situation reflected in the Didache , where the visiting prophet is held in high esteem and it is the claims of the local ministry that have to be pressed ( chs. 11:3 ff. ; 13 ; 15:1 , 2 ) .
News of the dissension seems to have reached Rome through hearsay ( ch. 47:7 ) .
It is possible that some traveling Romans had not been accorded the usual welcome , as visitors , by the rebellious faction , and on returning home had spread the report .
This would account for the emphasis on hospitality ( chs. 1:2 ; 11 ; 12 ) .
In any case there is no evidence that Corinth applied to Rome for a judgment in the matter .
Rome 's intervention is to be explained from other factors .
It was nothing extraordinary for leaders of one church to send a letter of advice and warning to another congregation .
The apostolic prerogative exercised by Paul had set a wide precedent which was followed by the author of the seven letters in the Revelation , by Ignatius , by Polycarp , by Dionysius of Corinth , 1111 Eusebius , Hist. eccl. , IV , ch. 23 . by Serapion , 1212Ibid. , V , ch. 19 ; VI , 12:3 –6 .
and by many others .
Each Christian community seems to have felt a sufficient sense of responsibility for the others so that its leaders could admonish them with solicitude .
In some instances , of course , the authors claimed a special right to speak .
The seer of the Revelation and the martyr Ignatius are examples .
But the point to bear in mind is that the local churches did not conceive of themselves as isolated and autonomous units .
They were part of the wider Church , and were not unconcerned with what happened in other congregations .
This is most forcibly brought home to us by the style of our document .
For it is not written in the name of an individual , but of a congregation .
It is very far from a papal decree , though it was doubtless written by one of the leaders of the Roman church .
It makes no claim to superior authority , but , basing itself on the authority of Scripture , it tries to persuade an errant congregation to return to the right way .
Furthermore , that Rome should intervene in the internal affairs of the Corinthian church is partly to be explained by the close relations between the two cities .
Refounded as a Roman colony in the middle of the first century , Corinth had built up a peculiarly intimate connection in trade and culture with the mother city .
Indeed , excavations have made clear how exactly Corinth tried to mimic Rome — in its sculpture , architecture , organization , and even its names .
Neither the church at Rome nor that at Corinth was , it is true , Latin in race or language .
The predominant element in both congregations was doubtless converted Hellenistic Jews .
Yet these affinities between the two cities help to explain even the 36 Christian connections .
Corinth , moreover , by being a natural halt on the route between Rome and the East would be in constant touch with the imperial capital .
Yet it can not be denied that these two explanations do not fully account for the tone of the letter .
Rome very definitely regards it as her duty to intervene ( ch. 63 ) and sends envoys to see that matters are put right ( ch. 65 ) .
Something of her unique place as the church of the imperial city , and the church of Peter and Paul ( ch. 5 ) , must surely have been in the writer 's mind .
Among the Roman clergy ( as we learn from Hermas , Vis. , II , ch. 4 ) there seems to have been one who acted as a sort of " foreign secretary " for the church , sending abroad various advices and exhortations as well as gifts of charity .
1313 The far - flung charity of the Roman church is noted by Ignatius , Rom. 1:2. Cf. Dionysius of Corinth apud Eusebius , Hist. eccl. IV .
23:10 .
This implies more than a casual relation with other churches ; and while this should not be pressed to vindicate much later papal claims , it does indicate that the Roman community took most seriously its responsibility as a sister church for the welfare of other congregations .
Here , in germ , is that exercise of authority which was to become the papal primacy .
THE AUTHOR
While the letter was written in the name of the church of Rome and its subscription did not originally mention Clement , there can be little doubt that he was the author .
The Greek manuscripts attribute it to him , and , as early as A.D. 170 , Dionysius of Corinth ascribes it to him .
He speaks of it as the letter " which was previously written to us through Clement , " and he mentions the fact it was still read publicly in the Corinthian church on Sundays ( Eusebius , Hist. eccl. IV . 23:11 ) .
Precisely who Clement was is not altogether clear .
The earliest episcopal lists , those of Irenaeus and Hegesippus , make him the third bishop of Rome .
This tradition , however , implies that the monepiscopate was very early established in that city , and doubtless reads back a later situation into the more primitive period .
Certainly the terms " bishop " and " presbyter " were not yet clearly distinguished in Clement 's time , for he uses them as synonyms or at any rate to refer to the same class of persons , the church rulers ( cf. chs .
42:4 ; 44:4 , 5 ; 47:6 ; 57:1 ) .
Exactly what the situation was in those early years we do not know .
The only hint we derive is from the Roman prophet 37 Hermas , who in the course of his visions relates rather epigrammatically that he is bidden to write " two little books and [ to ] send one to Clement and one to Grapte .
Clement must then send it to the cities abroad , for that is his duty , and Grapte shall exhort the widows and orphans " ( Hermas , Vis. II . 4:3 ) .
The date of this vision is the late first century , and it doubtless refers to our Clement , among whose duties was that of acting as a kind of foreign secretary for the church .
That he had some of the functions later vested in the episcopate may well be true ; but that he was exactly a " bishop " in the later sense is open to doubt .
It must suffice to call him a leading — perhaps the leading — presbyter - bishop of the Roman church .
More than that we do not know of Clement .
The attempts to identify him with the Clement mentioned in Paul 's Philippians ( ch. 4:3 ) , 1414 Origen , Com. in John 6:36 and Eusebius , Hist . eccl. , III , ch. 15 . or with the family of the consul Titus Flavius Clemens , are only conjectures .
The name is a very frequent one in this period , especially in military circles .
Yet it must be conceded that the hypothesis that has been elaborated by J. B. Lightfoot , that Clement was a freedman of the Flavian family , is attractive and not entirely lacking in substance .
The consul Titus Flavius Clemens was a cousin of Domitian , and according to Dion Cassius he was executed by the emperor on the charge of atheism .
This may possibly mean that he was a Christian , since the accusation of atheism was frequently brought against the new faith .
Furthermore , his wife Domitilla was exiled ; and it appears that one of the oldest Roman catacombs , the Coemeterium Domitillae , was situated on an estate belonging to her .
Slight as these indications are , they do lend support to the theory that the consul and his wife were Christians .
By virtue of his position he certainly could never have been a church official ; but it is not altogether unlikely that someone connected with his household and bearing his name was the author of our letter .
CLEMENT’S CHRISTIANITY
The most striking feature of Clement 's letter is its blending of Old Testament and Christian themes with Hellenistic ideas and expressions .
Its author is saturated in the Old Testament , citing the Septuagint with frequency and finding in the heroes of Israel the patterns of Christian conduct .
He is familiar with Pauline writings , especially with I Corinthians , which he uses 38 as a model for his own letter , imitating its hymn on love ( chs. 49 ; 50 ) and enlarging on its teachings regarding the resurrection ( ch. 24 ) and schism ( ch. 47 ) .
But these Jewish and Christian elements often take on a Stoic dress ( e.g. , chs. 20 ; 21 ) ; and while sometimes Clement speaks in the very tones of Paul , as for instance on justification by faith ( ch. 32:4 ) , his leading convictions are somewhat different .
There is a strain of moralism in his religion , which links him on the one hand with Hellenistic Judaism and on the other with Stoicism .
Where , for Paul , Abraham was the hero whose faith alone made him right with God , for Clement , he is the pattern of obedience , of hospitality , of humility , and of righteousness ( chs. 10:1 , 7 ; 17:2 ; 31:2 ) .
Again , while our author is aware of the grave issue raised by the doctrine of justification by faith , viz. , that men might continue to sin that grace should abound , the answer he gives to this dilemma is very different from Paul's .
Where the latter in Rom. , ch. 6 , emphasizes the mystical dying of the Christian to sin , Clement stresses the moral imitation by the Christian of the Creator 's good works ( ch. 33 ) .
Once again , in defending the doctrine of the resurrection , Clement , like Paul , can base his case on a natural theology ( ch. 24 . ; cf. I Cor. 15:36 ) , and is well aware that Christ is the first fruits of those that slept ( ch. 24:1 ; cf. I Cor. 15:20 ) .
Yet his crowning argument is not the victory won by Christ over sin and the law , but the incredible tale of the phoenix ( ch. 25 ) !
Finally , where Paul reaches to the very heart of the issue of schism by asking the incisive question , " Is Christ divided ? "
Clement expatiates on the orderliness of nature ( ch. 20 ) and the consequences of envy and rivalry ( chs. 4 to 6 ) .
These instances must suffice to indicate the extent to which Clement has moved away from the Pauline gospel into an atmosphere more concerned with the moral life , and in particular with the virtues of humility and order .
Where ethical injunctions are secondary to Paul 's letters , they are primary in Clement .
We observe , too , a tendency , very evident in chs. 20 ; 24 to 25 , to emphasize natural theology .
All these are marks of that later Romanism to which Clement 's Letter points .
It is , however , in the treatment of church order that Clement most clearly foreshadows later Catholicism .
The deposition of the local Corinthian rulers leads him to set forth a hierarchical view of the ministry and to stress the need of submission to the duly elected clergy .
It is claimed ( chs. 42 to 44 ) that the apostles appointed their first converts as presbyter - bishops 39 and provided for a future ministry should these eventually die .
It is not entirely clear how the new clergy were to be installed , save that the congregation was to elect them .
It is possible that they were to be ordained by the remaining presbyter - bishops , though it is more likely that Clement intends something different , viz. , that they were to be ordained by a special class of ministers who succeeded to the apostolic prerogatives ( see note on ch. 44 ) .
Here we have in essence the doctrine of apostolic succession .
Emphasis , moreover , is laid upon the liturgical functions of these presbyter - bishops who stand in the apostolic line .
It is they who lead worship and have the right to " offer the gifts " ( ch. 44:4 ) , just as the duly appointed priests of the Old Testament performed the various sacrifices ( chs. 42 to 44 ) .
The sacrificial understanding of the Lord 's Supper here comes to the fore and is clearly connected with the theme of apostolic succession .
It has been already observed that Clement still uses the terms " presbyter " and " bishop " for the same class of persons , the church rulers , and we are not therefore to suppose that the monepiscopate has been fully established .
The local church seems to be governed by a board of presbyter - bishops , though one of its number may have had special powers and privileges .
What , however , is important to note is that the main lines of the later development are so plainly prefigured .
CONCLUSION
To summarize : Clement 's Letter reflects the movement away from the Pauline faith to a type of Christianity in which ethical interests and concern for law and order predominate .
This does not , however , exclude both acquaintance with , and some grasp of , the Pauline gospel .
The cleavage is not so sharp as is sometimes made out .
Nor do the Stoic expressions to be found in Clement or his interest in , and familiarity with , the pagan world ( note chs. 37 and 55:1 ) , indicate that he has capitulated to an alien culture .
Rather must we say that Roman Christianity is giving evidence of its background in Hellenistic Judaism , and adapting itself to the imperial capital .
We have already mentioned food myths on a variety of lists – but until now we have not made a food - specific misconceptions list .
This list explores some of the most common myths we have about food and ( no - doubt controversially ) debunks them .
In the case of the more controversial topics , I have included sources .
10 Fat Free – Lose Weight
The Myth : Fat free food is calorie free
This is a very common myth – so common that food manufacturers market to it .
The misconception that fat free is better is the reason that so many products are labelled “ fat free , ” “ low in fat , ” “ fat reduced , ” etc .
So many people who want to lose weight will chow down on all of these “ low fat ” foods thinking they are going to lose weight – even worse , they often tend to eat more of the low fat food than they would have if it were full fat .
What really matters when trying to reduce weight is calories – eat fewer calories than you burn and you will lose weight .
When fat is removed from food a lot of the flavor is removed as well – consequently extra sugars and chemicals are often added to give back the flavor – fat free food can therefore be far worse and fattening for you than regular full fat food .
9 Eat The Salad
The Myth : Fast food salads are the “ healthy option ”
A 2005 report by the Independent said : “ [ a ] n investigation of the food sold by the “ big four ” – McDonald ’s , Burger King , KFC and Pizza Hut – found that [ … ] five out of eight of the salads used as “ evidence ” of their embrace of healthy eating had “ high ” salt or fat content . ”
1
It is all too common to see dieters who crave a little something naughty , ordering salads or other “ healthy choices ” from fast food joints – but what they usually do n’t realize is that the salads can be as bad as the regular food and they would be more content if they just ate a Big Mac .
For the sake of comparison , I looked it up : 1 Big Mac has 540 calories and 1,040 mg of salt ; 1 premium southwest salad with crispy chicken and dressing has 530 calories and 1,260 mg of salt .
The Mac is healthier .
8 Protein Power
The Myth : When trying to gain muscle , you should eat copious amounts of protein
According to the Mayo Clinic , 10 – 35 % of your daily dietary intake should be protein – whether trying to gain weight , lose weight , or maintain weight .
Most of this comes from our regular food and we seldom need to take protein supplements .
Even more damning for this myth are two recent studies by independent sport medicine journals in which various people ( including bodybuilders ) were given varying extra quantities of protein each day ; summing one study up , Dr Richard Krieder from the University of Memphis said : “ Although it is important for athletes to get an adequate amount of protein . . . consuming additional amounts of protein does not appear to promote muscle growth . ”
7 Fresh Fruit Is Best
The Myth : Fresh fruit is better than dried fruit
This myth is true in only one regard : if you are looking for vitamin ‘ c ’ , then fresh fruit is best , but other than that , dried fruit contains just as many nutrients and sugar for energy as fresh fruit .
If you subscribe to the notion that you should eat 5 fruits a day , then you only need one tablespoon of dried fruit per portion – so five tablespoons of dried fruit fulfills your daily need .
The same is true of canned or frozen fruit .
Fruit juice is also able to be used as a daily fruit portion but only one per day should be made up of juice only .
6 Six Mini Meals Are Better Than Three
The Myth :
It is better to eat six small meals during the day instead of three larger meals
First off , this can be okay – but only if you are extremely good at controlling your portion sizes ; it is all too easy to turn six small meals into six large meals .
This myth again comes down to the whole “ calories per day ” rule .
If your three large meals contain as many calories as your six small meals , there is no difference at all .
For the majority of people it is easier to put the time aside for three meals – so this is still the best choice for most .
As we have discussed on a previous list ( item 1 ) , the time of day that you eat does not have a bearing on weight gain or loss .
5 Celery = Negative Calories
The Myth :
It takes more calories to eat a stick of celery than are contained in the celery itself – making it a negative calorie food
This one is so popular that even Snopes believes it – and it is rare for Snopes to be wrong .
But the problem is , the numbers do n’t add up .
One stick of celery contains around six calories2 .
A female weighing 150 pounds , aged 35 , and 65 inches tall , burns 30 calories per hour3 eating whilst sitting .
In the interests of science I ate a stick of celery ( which is no mean feat considering I hate raw celery ) to see how long it would take : 2 minutes and 14 seconds .
If the female described above takes as long as I do , that means she can eat just under 30 sticks of celery in one hour – totaling 180 calories .
That leaves an excess of 150 calories still not burned .
Granted , there is some calorie burning involved in the digestive process as well , but there is no way these numbers allow for negative calories ; on average you burn 62 calories an hour just existing4 ( this includes digestion ) – that still leaves an excess calorie count of 88 .
No matter which way you look at it – celery does not result in negative calories .
4 Decaf Has No Caffeine
The Myth : Decaffeinated coffee contains no caffeine
International standards require decaf to be 97 % caffeine free ( EU standards are a little stricter at 99.9 % ) .
The process of removing caffeine is a long one and it also means that many other chemicals ( up to 400 in fact ) that are essential the taste of coffee are lost .
If you have an allergy to caffeine , you should probably keep away from all forms of coffee – decaf included .
But for those who can cope with caffeine – unless you really can’t stand the slight “ high ” produced by it , you will have a nicer tasting drink if you just opt for regular coffee .
And if that has n’t convinced you – the chemical often used in decaffeinating coffee beans ( dichloromethane ) is also used as a paint stripper .
3 Stark Craving Madness
The Myth : Craving is your body telling you it needs something
When we get a craving for certain foods – such as fruit juice , we often think it is because of a lack in our body of a certain nutrient .
Interestingly , scientists who put this to the test found out that it was n’t true at all .
In the study , a person who craved chocolate , was given a cocktail of chemicals that contained all of the essential components ( minus taste ) of chocolate , and another cocktail containing chocolate flavor but no components of chocolate .
The craving was satisfied when they took the chocolate flavored cocktail – but not the essentially flavorless chocolate .
This strongly suggests that cravings are simply emotional .
We crave certain foods because of the memories and emotions relating to that food in our lives .
2 Salt Increases Blood Pressure
The Myth : Excess salt increases your blood pressure
This is a myth that originated in the 1940s when a professor used salt - reduction to treat people with high blood pressure .
Science has since found out that there is no reason for a person with normal blood pressure to restrict their salt intake .
However , if you already have high blood pressure , you may become salt - sensitive in which case you should reduce salt or increase your potassium intake as it is the balance of the two that really matters .
Furthermore , people who suffer from hypertension should be careful with salt as it can have an impact there .
Ultimately , eating more potassium is probably more important than reducing salt .
Potassium rich foods are spinach , broccoli , bananas , white potatoes and most types of beans .
1 Fast Food is Bad
The Myth : Fast food is bad for you
A very wise man once said : “ all things in moderation ” .
This ancient phrase applies to most things in life – including fast food .
A moderate amount of fast food is no worse for you than a moderate amount of home - cooked meat and vegetables .
A constant diet of nothing but fast food may not be the healthiest choice you can make , but then again , eating macaroni and cheese every night is not very healthy either .
Variety and moderation are the key to good eating and health .
If you feel like a cheeseburger , eat one .

When you 're forking out several hundred dollars for a cell phone , the thought of spending even more money to keep it scratch - free seems a no - brainer .
But I 'm cheap .
And I do n't like spending a few bucks on a piece of clear tape when , well , a free piece of clear tape will do .
Or in this case , almost free .
The DIY screen protector is great for so many frugal folks like myself .
First , it 's ( almost ) free .
Most of us have a roll of clear packing tape lying around , and you usually get about 55 yards for around $ 5 .
And that equates to less than one cent for a piece of tape big enough to cover your average smart phone .
But hold on , do n't just go sticking it to your phone and calling it a day .
There 's a method to this , which you will see in the
Howcast video below .
Great stuff , and way cheaper than those screen protectors you 'll find in your local cell phone store .
But why stop there ?
I did some hunting around for other great cell phone hacks , tips , and tricks to save you some money that you can put towards your enormous phone bill .
In no particular order , here are five more excellent phone hacks worth checking out .
It 's a bit rough and ready , but hey , it 's almost free as well .
Maybe it will catch on and become cool to have , at which point you 'll be able to buy a pre-made Duct Tape case at Target for $ 19.99 .
If you 're tired of having your cell phone just lying around taking up space on the counter , or worse , the floor , this is a handy little gadget made from an old shampoo bottle .
Can you say free ?
Nice .
The video is without sound ( it 's not needed by the way ) and it shows you in about 30 seconds how to turn an old CD into a nifty holder for your car .
Another super cheap option .
You 'll need a $ 2 part from a local Radio Shack , and some soldering experience .
But it does create a handy and portable charger for very little money .
No kidding .
If you have a bluetooth - enabled cell phone , this is possible .
But only useful if you 've lost track of your mouse , or have a laptop and do n't have your mouse with you .

New polling sheds some light both on where the public stand in terms of different power options , and on the impact of arguments that make nuclear seem more attractive .
The polls are useful for understanding public attitudes towards nuclear power in two ways : they indicate how people regard nuclear at the moment , and they also help show the impact of arguments for nuclear power .
At a basic level , nuclear power is currently pretty much the least popular form of power generation in the UK .
1 . When asked favourability towards different sources , it comes in at the bottom of the pile – around the same place as both coal and gas .
2 . There is strong local opposition to the construction of new nuclear power stations .
While three in four claim they would support wind farms being built within five miles of their home , only a quarter say the same about a new nuclear station .
However , the polls also show that this opposition is relatively soft .
The arguments for nuclear power can change these attitudes quite strongly .
The lesson appears to be that nuclear is seen as a source of energy production that does n’t contribute to climate change – and this is a strength , so nuclear does better relative to other sources when this is raised as an issue .
3 . The other part of the argument is around energy security : this is just as effective in making the case for nuclear as climate change is .
So , nuclear starts is initially pretty unpopular , but has the potential to become much more accepted if the case is made based on tackling climate change and improving energy security .
4 . But to be clear , this does n’t overcome all doubts .
Both of these arguments are challenged when nuclear is put directly in comparison with renewable sources , which remain far more popular until the case has been made convincingly that all other options have been exhausted .
So the results appear to show that there is a case ( tackling climate change and improving energy security ) that makes nuclear more accepted than other non-renewables ( of course , I have n’t explored the impact of the pro-coal and pro-gas arguments … ) .
But nuclear would still only be grudgingly tolerated , not embraced like renewables , and there will be a powerful local resistance to any new plants .
This poll was carried out by Understanding Risk / MORI , and shows some similar results to one by EDF Energy / YouGov a few months ago , which appeared to show that resistance to new nuclear power stations has decreased .
As we can see , support for nuclear power still pales in comparison to more renewable sources .

During the flight to Ingushetia from Moscow , Mr. Yevloyev and Mr. Zyazikov had found themselves in close quarters for the first time in years .
A few weeks later , Mr. Zyazikov told a reporter from Ren TV , a Russian television channel , that he did not even know that Mr. Yevloyev was on the plane with him that day and had no idea who killed him .
But Yakhya ’s lawyers said their history raised the question of whether the men had a confrontation , and whether the president made the call that set the detention in motion .
Yakhya’s team also had a stroke of luck : a police investigator came forward to say he had been ordered to falsify testimony .
Jambulat K. Shankhoyev had authorized police officers to bring Magomed in for questioning that day  but , Mr. Shankhoyev acknowledged , he later discovered that he had been asked to do so after Mr. Yevloyev was already in the police car .
“ I understood I had been set up , ” the investigator wrote in a statement to Ingushetia ’s president and prosecutor .
When the investigator confronted his superiors about this , he wrote , he was told to keep quiet .
Nevertheless , investigators rejected motions filed by Yakhya ’s lawyers one after another .
They offered circular logic :
If the preliminary investigation pointed to an accident , what legal basis was there for gathering evidence for a murder case ?
So there would be no deposition of Mr. Zyazikov , or of passengers on the airplane who might have seen the two men interact , or of Mr. Shankhoyev , the investigator charging a cover-up .
Police phone records would not be subpoenaed to trace the officers ’ conversations with officials before and after the killing .
Yakhya’s lawyers would not be allowed to be present during a crime scene re-enactment , leaving them powerless to point out its weaknesses .
Yuri N. Turygin , the regional prosecutor in Ingushetia , said he prayed Magomed Yevloyev would survive the gunshot wound , aware of the turmoil that would result if he died .
Yet he suggested that Mr. Yevloyev , with his history of defiance , probably provoked his captors as he was being driven to police headquarters , knowing that some of his supporters were in pursuit .
“ In my view , what caused his behavior was his character , ” Mr. Turygin said in an interview .
“ He is a former prosecutor , he enjoyed some authority , and that dictated his behavior .
It was probably within the framework of the law , but it was on the edge of an insult .
He could humiliate a police officer  he could say , ‘ They are running after you , and when they catch up with you , they will show you . ’ ”
It was Mr. Turygin ’s office that initially opened an investigation into negligent homicide .
The case was taken out of his hands a day later , when it was transferred to the federal investigative committee , based in Moscow .
In any case , Mr. Turygin said that if Yakhya Yevloyev had a compelling argument that a murder charge should have been pursued , the judges had leeway to send the case back to the prosecutor .
The Clem7 toll has been slashed to $ 2 in an attempt to attract drivers to the troubled tunnel .
The new price takes effect on Thursday and will run until the end of September .
It is more than 50 per cent below the price of $ 4.28 advertised before the tunnel opened in March .
Last month an average of 23,746 vehicles used the tunnel on weekdays , while an average of 21,424 used it on a seven - day average .
RiverCity Motorway originally predicted 60,000 vehicles a day would pay to use the tunnel after a settlement period .
A clearly disappointed RiverCity Motorway CEO Flan Cleary today said he hoped the new reduced toll would attract 30,000 vehicles a day by the end of September .
Baghdad , Iraq ( CNN ) --
At least 13 people were killed and 26 were wounded Wednesday in a bombing at an outdoor market in a predominantly Shiite town in Iraq 's Diyala province .
Among the victims were women and children , said police in Baquba , about 25 kilometers ( about 15 miles ) from Abu Sayda , where the bombing occurred .
The bomb was in a parked car and exploded at the market , which includes a clinic and a Shiite mosque .
Overall violence in Iraq has dropped drastically over the past two years , compared with the height of the sectarian war in 2006 and 2007 , but bombing attacks have continued .

What is really striking about the Malaysian people is the enormous feeling of community and a sense of belonging to a huge , unique family .
For two years , I have been working and living with the Bajau Laut , former sea gypsies , who originated in the Philippines and have now settled in Malaysia .

POLICE struck a crushing blow to hoon drivers yesterday , flattening an impounded car and warning that more than 40 others are earmarked for the same fate .
A Holden Commodore belonging to a serial hoon was squashed beyond use at a Dandenong wrecker 's yard .
The crushing may make a lead - footed Porsche driver , who opened up his sports car on the West Gate Freeway to 215 km / h in a 100 km / h zone , somewhat nervous .
The 39 - year - old St Kilda man had his car impounded for 48 hours after the early morning burst on June 25 .
He will be charged on summons .
Two years ago , the White House and the Pentagon launched a massive , secretive $ 17 billion effort to shore up the nation 's defenses , and assigned Darpa a crucial role : build a replica Internet – a " National Cyber Range " – that could not only be used to test out information attacks , but could " emulate human behavior on all nodes , " as well .
The project , personally guided by then - director Tony Tether , was supposed to be one of the most important in Darpa 's history , on par with the agency 's missions at the dawn of the space race .
" Congress has given Darpa a direct order ; that ’s only happened once before — with the Sputnik program in the ’ 50s , " one defense official told Danger Room .
The New York Times went even further , breathlessly proclaiming that " the Cyber Range is to the digital age what the Bikini Atoll — the islands the Army vaporized in the 1950s to measure the power of the hydrogen bomb — was to the nuclear age . "
But now , some in the armed services are grumbling that Darpa is n't working quickly enough on this all - important , $ 130 million mission .
A few agencies are even looking to build their own ranges , Aviation Week reports .
" The services did n’t want to wait around for Darpa , ” a senior official tells the magazine .
“ Everybody wanted a range , but Darpa ’s program was a 6 - to - 7 - year effort to put a national cyber range in place .
That ’s why support eroded .
Everybody wanted it quicker . ”
The Navy , the National Security Agency , and the Air Force are all pursuing ersatz Internet programs , according to AvWeek .
I 've pinged Darpa for a response .
But I 'm guessing that program manager Michael Van Putte would argue that his program is a lot more far - reaching than giving government hackers a new network playground .
Today 's ranges take months to set up a single test , with each machine manually configured .
Van Putte wants to conduct multiple tests at once , and then rejigger the network topology with a few mouse clicks .
Plus , he wants all those emulated people running around on the network .
“ You will have automated ‘ bots ’ that are trying to get work done while you ’re trying to test the security .
So you ’ll be able to quantitatively measure their effectiveness at work and at the same time , your effectiveness at keeping the bad guys out of your network , ” VanPutte tells * Signal * magazine .
" Over the ages , scientific progress has been held back by the ability to make measurements at the level of the environment for which the scientific research was being done : Telescopes , microscopes , particle accelerators , etc. , " he noted in a recent presentation .
" The National Cyber Range is the measurement capability for cyber research in both classified and unclassified environments .
Without it , research will be done in darkness and only stumble accidentally into the light . "
That is , if it ever gets finished .

As of June 9 , 2010 , if all the oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico had been used for fuel , it could have powered 38,000 cars , and 3,400 trucks , and 1,800 ships for a full year , according to University of Delaware Prof.
James J. Corbett .
That 's based on the estimated spill rate of 19,000 barrels of oil per day .
Corbett , a professor of marine policy in UD's College of Earth , Ocean , and Environment , works on energy and environmental solutions for transportation .
He has launched a website that reports the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in terms of lost uses of the lost fuel on a daily basis .
( See : http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/getinvolved/oilSpill.aspx)
Visitors to the website can choose the spill rate they believe is most accurate from a range of reported estimates , and the website will automatically calculate how many cars , trucks , and ships could have been powered for a year , based on Bureau of Transportation Statistics .
Here are just a few of Corbett 's findings :
By May 5 ( 15 days after the spill ) , the oil lost could have fueled 470 container ships serving New York and New Jersey ports for a year .
By May 25 ( 35 days after the spill ) , energy from the spilled oil could have provided a year 's gasoline for all registered automobiles ( about 26,000 cars ) in Newark , Del. , where UD 's main campus is located .
By May 31 ( 41 days after the spill ) , the lost energy could have fueled one freight truck on 17 trips across all 4 million miles of U.S. highway .
Corbett says he developed the website to help put the oil spill in a perspective to which everyday users of petroleum , including most Americans , can relate .
Transportation activities consume about two - thirds of all petroleum in the United States -- more than 20 billion barrels per day , according to Corbett .
Gasoline for automobiles accounts for about two - thirds of U.S. total transportation energy , diesel fuels power most of our goods movement , and most international containerized cargoes are delivered by ships -- the largest vehicles ever built .
" Energy resources offshore are being explored because each of us petroleum consumers is demanding more , " Corbett says .
The website also may help us decide how to reduce risks of future oil spills .
" Drilling this exploratory well by the Deepwater Horizon was an extremely high - risk proposition , " Corbett says .
" At $ 75 per barrel of crude oil , the oil spilled would have been worth about $ 90 million in terms of spill oil value if extracted for refining .
Some experts are now estimating damages from the spill to exceed $ 10 billion .
That 's a potential 100 to 1 loss , given the spill damage - to - value ratio . "
Corbett 's research collaborations focus on ways to improve the energy performance of transportation systems using ships , trucks , trains , and other vehicles .
There are ways to reduce the need for offshore oil drilling , Corbett says :
If we improve automobile fuel economy to 35.5 miles per gallon ( mpg ) , as proposed by the current administration , we would offset demand equivalent to the gasoline energy lost by 199 years of Deepwater Horizon daily releases .
If we add only 2 mpg to the fuel economy for trucks , as proposed by the Union of Concerned Scientists , we would offset diesel - driven energy demand equivalent to 12 years of Deepwater Horizon daily releases .
Rebalancing how we transport goods would achieve substantial energy savings .
A shift from truck to rail for specific commodities / routes would require about 20 percent of the energy per ton - mile compared to trucking .
Achieving this would require an investment in infrastructure and green logistics to facilitate intermodal combinations of trucking and rail rather than treating the modes as competitors .
Shifting passengers from single - occupant cars to car - sharing / carpooling and better transit also would produce important reductions .
" The wise use of petroleum and other energy resources is an opportunity for each of us , " Corbett says .
" We can reduce the need to drill deeper into environmental risk .
Within a few miles of our communities , we can do a lot to reduce energy demand . "
Man Tells How He Saved His Life by Amputating Own Arm With Saw Eighteen hours after trapped in furnace , Jonathan Metz had ' major problem '
June 15 , 2010  --
After being trapped for 12 hours , it took Jonathan Metz , a Connecticut man whose arm became stuck inside the furnace he was repairing , an additional six hours to " psych " himself up enough to amputate his own arm using a the blade of a power saw .
Describing his ordeal publicly for the first time since paramedics found him in the basement of his suburban Connecticut home on June 10 , Metz called the experience " surreal . "
Speaking to reporters at St. Francis Hospital , where he underwent surgery Friday to receive a muscle graft on his left shoulder to be fitted for a prosthesis , Metz said he felt " blessed and more than fortunate to be here today . "
Metz 's arm had become caught between heating cores inside the boiler on Monday .
Within hours , Metz , 31 , could smell the flesh of his crushed arm beginning to rot , the telltale sign of life - threatening infection .
" Very quickly it became apparent to me I had a major problem , " he said .
Eighteen hours into the ordeal , he fashioned a makeshift tourniquet and , using the blade from a power saw , began by hand to sever his left arm .
" As luck would have it I had the blades I would use with some of my power tools , " he said .
He floated in and out consciousness , drinking water leaked from the furnace .
He said he used a bloody flip - flop to scoop up the water .
Doctors said the decision he made saved his life .
Metz began cutting into his bicep , about halfway between his elbow and shoulder .
" The cut was going well about halfway through , " but then an alarming amount of blood started gushing , the tourniquet became ineffective and he had to stop cutting .
When paramedics found him , they pried the furnace open , using a spreader typically used to remove injured people from car wrecks , and completed the amputation .
" People wonder how someone could go to that extent and remove his own extremity .
But he saved his life by removing the non-viable part of the extremity .
The wound released toxins that were circulating through the body .
Cutting away that dead tissue saved his life , " said Dr. Scott Ellner , the surgeon who operated on him Friday .
Metz , who said he is engaged and has a wedding date set , said thinking about his fiancee and family helped get him through the ordeal .
" What got me through this whole thing was thinking about family , friends my dog .
I had a lot of living to do , " he said .
Metz , who lived alone , was rescued Wednesday after a friend , Luca DiGregorio , grew worried when he did not show up for work and missed a Tuesday night softball game .
Metz did not answer the doorbell when DiGregorio stopped at his home Wednesday , but he said he saw Metz 's beagle " yipping at the back door . "
DiGregorio called police , who found Metz in the basement .
" I was a little worried , especially when the first cop showed up , " DiGregorio told reporters .
" Then more showed up , and then the ambulance showed up , so it got a little nerve - racking . "
Paramedics had to cut open the furnace and fully sever Metz 's arm to free him from the furnace .
" We used the spreader normally used to tear a car apart .
It was a pretty old boiler and this particular unit was very strong .
We had to cut a support rod inside the boiler and spread apart the two halves , breaking the cast iron in order to extricate the arm from the unit , " said Battalion Chief Matthew Stuart of the West Hartford Fire Department .
Doctors said Metz was recovering well .
For anyone wishing to help Jonathan pay for a prosthetic arm and therapy , his family and friends have established an email and bank account to accept donations .

What are the new north - east lockdown rules and how long

Venice , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
Crews cleaning up the oil in one Louisiana parish have trampled the nests and eggs of birds including the brown pelican , which came off the endangered species list last year , the head of the parish said Wednesday .
Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said the parish does n't want to turn away contractors , but he called for more care when crews work in the sensitive wetlands .
He said officials recently found broken eggs and crushed chicks on Queen Bess Island , near Grand Isle .
Plastic bags containing snare boom were " recklessly placed " around the island without consideration for wildlife .
In one picture released by the parish , a plastic bag was on top of a nest containing broken speckled eggs .
Dozens of people , including experienced veterinarians , have been going to the area from all over the country to help with the affected wildlife , the parish said .
Nungesser met with the Humane Society of the United States and asked it to work with contractors who are cleaning the birds to come up with a better way to enlist the help of volunteers , the parish said .
" We want to improve our comfort level of knowing someone is out there looking for these birds and other animals -- doing all they can to save them , " Nungesser said on the parish website .
" The people BP sent out to clean up oil trampled the nesting grounds of brown pelicans and other birds , " he said .
" Pelicans just came off the endangered species list in November of last year .
They already have the oil affecting their population during their reproduction time , now we have the so - called clean up crews stomping eggs .
" The lack of urgency and general disregard for Louisiana 's wetlands and wildlife is enough to make you sick , " he said .
I do not have five thumbs , but if I did , it would be all thumbs up for Plunder !
How Public Employee Unions are Raiding Treasuries , Controlling Our Lives and Bankrupting the Nation by Steven Greenhut .
Plunder !
takes a look at the perverse incentives that bring together corrupt politicians and public unions to rape taxpayers .
From the ever - growing $ 100,000 pension club , to the realities of unbelievable pay and benefits , to dispelling myths propagated by the unions , to public union scare tactics , overtime abuse , and pensions far beyond the taxpayer 's ability to pay , Steven Greenhut covers it all , in painful detail .
I say , " painful " because Plunder ! is meticulously researched , extremely well documented , and after reading the book you will see how public unions are robbing ordinary taxpayers , including you , unless of course you are part of the union mob .
Plunder ! is a book you need to read , because until you do , you cannot possibly fathom how you are being played for suckers by greedy unions and politicians in bed with those unions .
Greenhut 's conclusion is that " It 's Time For More Than Outrage " .
I certainly agree , and that is why it is critical to back candidates willing to stand up for pension and pay reform .
Please do yourself a favor and order a copy of Plunder !
today , so you know exactly what is going on and why , how public unions are bankrupting the nation , and what you can do to help .

Nevertheless ,
Google is promoting its e-book plan as a fundamentally different and more “ open ” alternative to its rivals ’ stores .
Though it will act as a retailer and sell books from its own site , it will also behave like a wholesaler and allow independent bookstores and other partners to sell its e-books on their own sites .
People who buy Google e-books will not be locked into any particular reading devices or book formats , the company said .
Books bought from Apple ’s iBookstore , by contrast , can be read only on Apple devices .
“ I do n’t think anyone who has bought an e-reader in the last several years has really intended to only buy their digital books from one provider for life , ” said Tom Turvey , Google ’s director of strategic partnerships , who heads the Google Editions project .
Mr. Turvey said that customers would be able to get access their books , or buy new ones , from anywhere in the world by entering their Google credentials .
And he said Google would introduce the service with a broad selection of hundreds of thousands of books , including trade fiction , nonfiction and professional , scholarly and academic titles , including textbooks .
Google already has two million books that publishers have made available as part of its Partner Program , which allows Web users to sample lengthy previews of books on Google ’s site and other sites .
A separate project to scan millions of out of print or hard - to - find library books has been tied up in litigation since 2005 .
As a wholesaler , Google will play a role similar to that of offline distributors like Ingram Book and Baker & Taylor , which buy books from publishers and resell them to bookstores .
Those companies generally keep a single - digit percentage of each sale , and Mr. Turvey said Google would operate along similar lines .
Independent bookstores seem to believe that Google is more interested in working through them than being a direct retailer .
In fact , they are banking on it .
Australia 's energy grid could run entirely on renewables such as wind and solar power within 10 years , according to a report to be released tomorrow .
The report outlines a 10 - year road map which the authors say is affordable and achievable .
Its recommendations have been endorsed by the International Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
It is known as the Zero Carbon Australia 2020 report and it outlines a plan which its authors say can replace fossil fuel electricity with 100 per cent renewable energy within 10 years .
The report 's authors say it only refers to technologies that are proven and commercially available .
Matthew Wright from Beyond Zero Emissions is one of the authors of the report .
He says 40 to 60 per cent of the energy mix would be run by wind power and solar thermal .
" Earlier examples are in the Mojave Desert in the United States .
Now they did n't have significant storage , " he said .
" But since 2007 a large number of plants have been built in Spain , and in Spain a number of 24x7 solar thermal plants are already operating .
Many are under construction , in fact 60 are under construction and it's a $ 20 billion build - out . "
One of the concerns often voiced about renewable energy sources is whether they can provide reliable baseload power .
But Mr Wright says solar thermal power addresses that problem by trapping and storing heat in molten salts .
" Our plan uses the energy security you get from the molten salt storage solar power towers .
They can hold their heat pack for days .
They only lose less heat per day in their big tanks , " he said .
" The tanks act like giant thermos flasks .
At any time day or night when you need power , water can run past them and it can produce steam . "
' Overcome the inertia '
Malcolm Roberts from the National Generators Forum represents the major power generators .
" I 'll be very interested in seeing the report to see how they 've analysed the state of the technology here , whether it's in any way likely to become commercially viable in that 10 - year period , " he said .
" I think we need to put it up against the range of reports that have been done by government , by industry , looking at how our generation mix will shift over the next 10 or 20 years .
And this is an extremely sudden change compared to all the modelling and analysis that 's been done by those other parties .
" As I said that includes government modelling , and you could expect the government modelling to be fairly pragmatic about what the technology choices are . "
David Crossley from Energy Futures Australia provides policy advice for evolving energy markets .
He says moving beyond current modes of thinking in the electricity industry poses more of a challenge than any technology shortcomings .
" I think the greatest challenge would be to overcome the inertia that already exists in the electricity and energy industry in Australia which is organised along particular traditional lines , " he said .
" It would require a very large change in the way the industry is organised . "
Mr Crossley is more optimistic about the report 's target .
" It is very ambitious .
But when you look at the actual detailed figures it is actually very persuasive .
I mean for example it says that it would require a total investment of $ 370 billion over the period 2011 to 2020 , " he said .
" But that is achievable in that time frame because our annual GDP for instance is $ 1.2 trillion and the investment that this plan requires is only 3 per cent of GDP over that 10 - year period . "
In the passages selected here , a super - sensitive giant of the imagination projects a uniquely poignant vision of the plight of man and the power of God .
If it makes you weep and worship , you will be the better for it .
If it does not , that will show that you have not yet seen what you are looking at , and you will be wise to read the book again .

My parents house is off of Lynn Road and they got in around 1984 ... they said just before that Lynn was a dirt road !
They said Lynn and Spring Forest roads were n't even connected !
It was all woods and farmland from the Sixforks intersection to Falls of Neuse !
Maybe thats how it was from Wake Forest and Falls of Neuse Rd too ?
Remember when there was no mid-town ?
I still consider N. Hills and Crabtree N. Raleigh b/c it is North of the beltline hehe .

Same with Creedmoor Road and Strickland and all points North .. that 's where you went to learn how to drive .
Neighborhoods like Wood Valley , Springdale Gardens and Estates .. very isolated .
Beautiful lots , mature trees - before the days of national builders and clear cutting .
We know people who moved " out to Stonehenge " b/ c they could n't afford anything else .
They paid $ 75,000 for a home that is easily now worth $ 350,000 .. maybe more ..

Let 's say a relative gave you an imported Omega watch over the holidays .
It 's a nice piece , but it 's not exactly your style , so after agonizing over the issue for the appropriate number of months , you decide to sell it over eBay .
Not so fast .
Thanks to a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , that might not be so easy .
In fact , the store that sold it , Costco , should n't have sold it in the first place , the court recently ruled , because the doctrine of " First Sale " has limits .
Section 109 of the Copyright
Act says that a copyright owner of a product has the sole initial right to distribute it .
Then the subsequent buyers have the right to " to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy " — in other words , sell it again .
But now the Ninth Circuit says this does n't necessarily apply to items in which a company 's copyrighted logo was inscribed on a product made abroad , as in this case .
The Public Knowledge advocacy group calls this decision " a terrible idea , " and has filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court , which is reviewing the case .
" What happens to Netflix , Amazon and eBay , " PK's Anjali Bhat worries , " if they have to find out where each item was made , whether it has a copyrighted logo made outside the US ( if the item itself is n't a copyrighted work ) , and then buy licensing rights from the copyright owner if the item was made abroad ?
That 's an enormous economic burden to put on businesses who follow that model . "
Quality King
Costco did n't directly buy these logoed watches from Omega .
Instead , it purchased them at a bargain price via the so - called " gray market " — from distribution companies authorized to sell the items overseas .
A company called ENE Limited bought them up and sold them to Costco , which put them up for sale at its stores in California .
When Omega found out about this activity , it sued Costco for infringement .
Standing in the way of the company 's complaint was the Supreme Court 's 1998 Quality King Distributors decision , which put limits on this sort of litigation .
In that case , California hair care product maker L'anza sued Quality King for illegal distribution of L'anza products .
These US - made items came to Quality King via a similarly circuitous route .
The company bought them extra cheap from a distributor in Malta , which had purchased them with affixed copyrighted labels from L'anza 's United Kingdom wholesale outlet .
L'anza charged that because King bought its products outside the US , Section 109 protections did n't apply .
Those protections were said to be overruled by Section 602 , which prohibits unauthorized importation of copyrighted works acquired outside of the country .
But the High Court saw it otherwise , contending that the First Sale principle " is applicable to imported copies . "
602's " literal text is simply inapplicable to both domestic and foreign owners of L'anza 's products who decide to import and resell them here , " the Supremes declared at the time .
Lawfully made
So Omega ran a new line of argument past the Ninth Circuit in this latest dispute .
Even though the Omega Globe Design logo is a US copyright , " the watches bearing the design were manufactured and first sold overseas . "
That makes this case different , the company 's lawyers contended .
The Ninth concurred .
" We hold that Quality King did not invalidate our general rule that § 109 ( a ) can provide a defense against " unlawful importation claims " only insofar as the claims involve domestically made copies of US - copyrighted works . "
Thus , the First Sale doctrine does n't apply in this instance .
What 's the precise logic here ?
Let 's go back to the exact language of Section 109 .
We 've added italics to the key phrase :
" The owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title , or any person authorized by such owner , is entitled , without the authority of the copyright owner , to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord . "
The Ninth interprets the " lawfully made under this title " phrase to mean , " legally made and sold in the United States . "
An interconnected world
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , which joined the amicus brief , calls this logic " outrageous " and a " bogus copyright theory , " as does Public Knowledge .
" There is no textual support for this interpretation of ' lawfully made under this title ' , " writes PK's Bhat .
" ' Under this title ' usually is n't synonymous with ' in this country ' . "
As the brief argues , if Congress had actually wanted the statute to apply to works made " within the United States , " why did n't it explicitly say so , as it has in thousands of other instances within United States code ?
And does this mean that now all a company has to do is manufacture its products abroad , stamp them with a copyrighted image logo that costs less than $ 50 to register , and the company can suddenly dictate the terms of redistribution long after the products are first sold ?
" Under the Ninth Circuit 's ruling , a manufacturer would obtain the right to control its product even after the first sale , " the groups warn , " and would maintain this right until it authorizes the product 's sale within the United States .
Buyers , in contrast , are left without the first sale doctrine to protect their subsequent disposition of the good . "
The implications of this decision are huge , creating potential liabilities for anyone who distributes anything en masse : libraries , booksellers , or your local DVD or video game rental store .
" In an increasingly interconnected world , " the amicus brief concludes , " where the manufacturing of tangible products and knowledge goods can be distributed easily and widely , consumers should be confident that they retain the same rights to their belongings regardless of where those goods or their labeling were produced . "
The town of Grand Bayou , Louisiana , has no streets and no cars , just water and boats .
And now the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico threatens the very existence of the Atakapa - Ishak Indians who live there .
" We 're facing the potential for cultural genocide , " says one tribe member .

UNEDITED TRANSCRIPT
In the town of Grand Bayou , Lousiana , the main thoroughfare is the water .
There are no streets , no cars .
Everyone gets around by boat .
Just recovered from Hurricane Katrina , the oil from the BP Deepwater Horizon well now threatens this community .
SOUNDBITE : Rosina Philippe , Atakapa - Ishak Tribe
“ Well this is the Grand Bayou Village and we are a subsistence community .
We have been here for centuries .
And we live here .
We make our living from the harvest of the waterways and this is also where we get our food that we eat . ”
Rosina Philippe is Atakapa - Ishak , a Native American tribe .
Like others , it is not recognized by the federal government .
For decades , the Atakapa and other native groups here have adapted to the loss of wetlands , the encroachment of the oil and gas industry , and hurricanes .
But the latest spill could be the final straw .
Fishing and shrimping is at a standstill , and the oil keeps creeping into the marshes .
SOUNDBITE : Maurice Phillips , Atakapa - Ishak Tribe
“ I ca n’t even think about leaving it .
And the way the economy is , where are you going to go and live ? ”
The largest oil spill in U.S. history is killing wildlife , contaminating beaches and marshes , closing fishing waters and … threatening an entire way of life .
Tens of millions of gallons of crude have spewed into the Gulf of Mexico since the BP oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later .
Coastal Louisiana is closest to ground zero .
Its fragile wetlands and beaches are oiled and wildlife faces possible mass die - offs .
But on top of the ecological disaster , unique cultures of the people living in Louisiana ’s bayous could also vanish .
SOUNDBITE : Rosina Philippe , Atakapa - Ishak Tribe
“ The oil spill has the potential to imperil all of us .
We ’re facing the potential for cultural genocide . “
Shrimp is a way of life here .
Shrimp boats line the canals .
Locals lower nets and scoop up the shrimp carried by the current .
SOUNDBITE : Maurice Phillips , Atakapa - Ishak Tribe
“ I ’ve been a shrimper all my life , and trapping .
That ’s all I ever did .
We live off the land .
We get all our wildlife , seafood , and everything off the land . ”
Maurice Phillips has seen the ground vanish beneath his feet .
Canals dug for oil and gas exploration decades ago let in saltwater that kills the marsh grasses – hurricanes wash away the soil left behind .
And levees keep the nearby Mississippi River from replenishing the soil .
A University of New Orleans map graphic shows how wide open water now fills areas once rich with freshwater marshes and wildlife .
Scientists say the Mississippi delta is vanishing at an alarming pace .
Matt Bethel leads a program to combine satellite and other data with the traditional ecological knowledge of Grand Bayou ’s residents to try and find a way to restore some land .
SOUNDBITE : Matt Bethel , Environmental Scientist , Univ. of New Orleans
“ What they are facing especially in the context of today with the oil spill and everything , they are facing their way of life being changed forever and not being able to keep doing what they love to do , which is shrimping , fishing , trapping . ”
The Atakapa recently hosted visitors from Alaska .
And while they are distinctive culturally , individuals at this gathering found much in common .
It might seem like they are from worlds apart , but Eskimos and the natives from Louisiana found much in common .
SOUNDBITE : Stanley Tom , Yup ’ik Eskimo
“ The people here are subsistence here just like in Alaska .
The climate is a little warmer , but the landscape is just like my hometown .
It ’s just like tundra .
And when we went boat riding it reminded me of my home . ”
Tom and the other visitors from Alaska were attending a conference in New Orleans to focus on climate change and other threats to native communities around the world .
The oil spill brought back memories of the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident .
They offered emotional support and advice to their hosts – who are used to a hard life , but fear the spill could be too much to overcome .
SOUNDBITE : Ruby Ancar , Atakapa - Ishak Tribe
“ Nature , you ca n’t control .

Nigel De Jong Vs Xabi Alonso Kung Fu Fighting ( GIF )
It is a great feeling for any soccer player to be playing in the finals of a World Cup , unless you are Spain ’s Xabi Alonso , who was on the receiving end of this devastating kick from the Netherlands ’ Nigel De Jong .
It was the type of kick that is capable of breaking ribs and collapsing lungs .
Thankfully , it did neither to the Spanish midfielder , who stayed the game .
Reminiscent of Charlie Murphy ’s front kick , which sent Rick James soaring several feet through the air ?
I ’d say so !

Image caption Activists have said they would not resist Israeli forces
Israel says its troops will board an Irish - owned aid ship attempting to break the blockade of Gaza if it does not change course .
The MV Rachel Corrie has defied instructions to dock at the Israeli port of Ashdod , Israel says .
" If they do n't comply , we will have to board the ship , " Lt - Col Avital Liebovich told the BBC .
It comes days after Israeli commandos stormed a Gaza - bound aid flotilla .
Clashes on board left nine people dead .
That raid brought strong condemnation of Israel , especially from Turkey , from where most of the victims came .
The Rachel Corrie was 28 nautical miles ( 52 km ) off the Israeli coast , the Israel Defence Forces said at 0745 GMT .
MV RACHEL CORRIE Irish - owned , 1,200 - tonne cargo ship
On board : Five Irish and six Malaysian activists , plus crew
Carrying aid , including wheelchairs , paper , medical supplies and cement
Israel says it has radioed the aid ship several times but received no response .
" We have contacted the boat , and we 've asked them politely to change course to Ashdod port .
If they will choose to do so , we promise them we wo n't board the ship , " said Lt - Col Liebovich .
" If they do n't do it willingly - if they do n't comply - we will have to board the ship , " she said .
The activists had earlier said they would not resist any Israeli attempts to stop the ship .
The Rachel Corrie is named after a US college student who was crushed to death by an Israeli army bulldozer as she protested over house demolitions in Gaza in 2003 .
Condemnation
Israel has said if the ship docks at Ashdod , the aid will be delivered to Gaza by road after the cargo has been inspected for banned items .
Israel has blockaded Gaza since 2007 , when the Islamist Hamas movement seized control of the territory .
There are five Irish and six Malaysian activists , plus several crew , on board the Rachel Corrie .
It had been a part of the previous flotilla , but was delayed by technical problems .
The Rachel Corrie is carrying hundreds of tonnes of aid , including wheelchairs , medical supplies and cement .
Construction materials are banned from entering Gaza by Israel , which says they could be used for military purposes by Hamas .
The sea - borne mission has been organised by the Cyprus - based Free Gaza Movement , a coalition of pro-Palestinian groups and human rights organisations .
Israel has faced a storm of international criticism after its troops shot dead nine people during a violent confrontation on the Turkish Mavi Marmara in the early hours of Monday .
Accounts as to what happened when Israeli soldiers rappelled from helicopters on to the ship differ .
Israel says its commandos were attacked with weapons , including knives , and opened fire in self - defence .
Pro-Palestinian activists on board say troops shot at them without provocation .

Softwarepatent vom Bundesgerichtshof zugelassen
Der Bundesgerichtshof hat ein Softwarepatent des Siemens - Konzerns nach achtjährigem Rechtsstreit zugelassen und damit die Urteile der Vorinstanzen aufgehoben .
Wie Florian Müller , Aktivist gegen Softwarepatente , in seinem Blog schreibt , könnte das Urteil Software in Deutschland unbegrenzt patentierbar machen .
Die Richter folgten in dem Urteil , das als PDF - Datei abrufbar ist , weitgehend den Siemens - Anwälten , die sich auf den Standpunkt stellten , die bisherige Rechtsprechung und die Europäische Patentübereinkunft , die Software » als solche « für nicht patentierbar erklärt , seien obsolet .
Das fragliche Patent von Siemens besteht aus zehn einzelnen Ansprüchen .
Der erste davon beschreibt in komplizierten Worten eine Serie von Transformationen , von denen jede trivial ist , da letztlich jede Software eine Transformation von Daten durchführt .
Müller beschreibt den Anspruch als Client - Server - Software zur automatischen Erzeugung von strukturierten Dokumenten ( z.B. XML oder HTML ) .
Aus diesem Grund lehnte das deutsche Patentamt das Patent ( Nummer DE 10232674 ) im Jahr 2002 ab .
Siemens klagte dagegen und wurde auch vom Bundespatentgericht abgewiesen .
Danach zogen die Anwälte vor den Bundesgerichtshof , der nun die Urteile aufhob und den Fall an das Bundespatentgericht zurückgab .
Müller hält das Verfahren für das deutsche Äquivalent zum Fall Bilski , der demnächst zur Entscheidung ansteht .
Da das Verfahren damit noch nicht zu Ende ist , bleibt abzuwarten , ob die Befürchtungen Müllers eintreten .
Die Softwarepatentgegner , die schon 2005 erfolgreich die Legalisierung von Softwarepatenten durch die Europäische Kommission abwehren konnten , halten das Urteil jedenfalls für ein falsches Signal .
Zudem hat auch die Europäische Kommission weitere Initiativen gestartet , Softwarepatente doch noch einzuführen .
Diese können jederzeit wieder akut werden .
International observers are calling for restraint and dialogue between Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , after Venezuela cut off diplomatic ties with its neighbor Thursday .
The latest spat between the fierce foes comes after Colombia presented evidence alleging that Venezuela is giving shelter to leftist rebels , a charge Venezuela denies .
It comes as Colombia inaugurates its new president , Juan Manuel Santos , Aug. 7 , and highlights the incoming administration 's challenge of smoothing over a decade of diplomatic difficulties with Venezuela .
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for restraint .
“ The Secretary - General hopes that the differences between Colombia and Venezuela will be worked out through dialogue , ” according to a UN statement issued Thursday night .
Latin American leaders reiterated calls for dialogue , some even offering to step in as mediators .
With none able thus far to prevent the two leaders from sparring , this latest fight might seem to create an insurmountable obstacle to improved relations .
But Michael Shifter , president of the Inter - American Dialogue in Washington , says pragmatics and voter sentiment will drive the relationship in the coming years , and that calmer seas are ahead – despite this most recent spat .
“ This is vintage Chávez , and vintage Uribe , playing out their last act together as presidents at each other for eight years , ” says Mr. Shifter .
“ But I think when Santos takes over , things are going to calm down .
I think there is a lot at stake for both countries . ”
On Thursday , the Colombian ambassador to the Organization of American States ( OAS ) presented evidence to back up charges that Chávez is protecting Marxist guerrillas , including aerial photos and videos .
He demanded that Venezuela allow international teams to inspect sites where Colombia alleges some 1,500 rebels are hiding .
" We have the right to demand that Venezuela does n't hide those wanted by Colombia , " Luis Alfonso Hoyos said .
His Venezuelan counterpart , Roy Chaderton , called the evidence suspect .
Chávez has long denied Colombian accusations against him .
On Friday , however , the US State Department said the allegations should be taken " very seriously . "
Hopes for improved relations
Chávez and Uribe , a staunch US ally , have squabbled for years – over Colombia 's claim that Venezuela supports the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , and over Venezuela 's claim that Colombia 's close relationship with the US could destabilize the region .
At times the prospect of a military conflict has flared , such as when a Colombia raided on a FARC base on Ecuadorian soil in 2008 .
Chavez also suspended trade last year to protest plans for a US military base in Colombia .
Yet the two share a long border and both stand to gain economically by improved bilateral relations .
According to a new report by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) in Santiago , Chile , Colombia is expected to grow by 3.7 percent , slower than many of its neighbors , while Venezuela 's growth estimates are negative 3 percent , the worst in Latin America , excluding the Caribbean .
President - elect Santos has indicated a willingness to forge a warmer relationship with Chávez , but this latest rift will set back those aspirations , says Carlos Romero , a political analyst at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas .
“ The real loser here is Santos , ” he says .
Mr. Romero agrees with Shifter that with Uribe out of office , there is hope of a stronger relationship .
Even Chávez on Thursday indicated some willingness to put tensions behind .
" Hopefully [ Santos will ] understand that leftist and right - wing governments can live together , " Chávez was quoted saying .
“ Colombia and Venezuela have different allies , but they are neighbors , ” Mr. Romero says .
“ Unfortunately , Santos faces more obstacles now . ”

A lot of new rich people have moved into the best houses in town — those big ones up on the hill that overlook the lake .
What with the depression , some of those houses have been on the market for a long time .
They ’d gotten pretty run down , but the new people all seem to have plenty of money and fixed them up right away .
Added docks and decks and tall fences .
It was our fathers , mine included , who did all the work for them .
I asked my dad what their houses were like and he said , “ Just like ours only richer . ”
As far as we know , none of those people have jobs .
It ’s as if all the families are independently wealthy .
Those people look like us only not exactly .
They ’re taller and skinnier and they ’re all blonds .
They do n’t talk like us either .
English does seem to be their native language , but it ’s an odd English .
Their kids keep saying , “ Shoe dad , ” and , “ Bite the boot . ”
They shout to each other to , “ Evolve ! ”
At first their clothes were funny , too — the men had weird jackets with tight waists and their pants were too short .
The girls and women actually wore longish wide skirts .
They do n’t have those anymore .
They must have seen right away how funny they looked compared to us , and gone to Penny ’s and got some normal clothes like ours .
They kept their odd shoes , though , like they could n’t bear not to have them .
( They look really soft , they ’re kind of square and the big toe is separate . )
And they had to wait for their hair to grow out some before they could get haircuts like ours .
This year our boys have longer hair than the girls , so their boys were all wrong .
Every single one of those new people , first thing , put two flamingos out on their front lawns , but then , a few days later , they wised up and took them away .
It was n’t long before every single one of them had either a dog or a cat .
When Sunday came , they all went to the Unitarian church and the women wore the most ridiculous hats , but took them off as soon as they saw none of us wore any .
They wore their best clothes , too , but only a few of us do .
Even though they come to church , Mom says I should n’t make friends with their kids until we know more about them and I especially should n’t visit any of their houses .
She says the whole town does n’t trust them even though everybody has made money on them one way or another .
Their kids have a funny way of walking .
Not that funny , actually , but as if they do n’t want anybody to talk to them , and as if they ’re better than we are — maybe just because they ’re taller .
But we do n’t look that different .
It seems as if they ’re pretending we ’re not here .
Or maybe that they ’re not here .
In school they eat lunch together at the very farthest table and bring their own food , like our cafeteria food is n’t good enough .
They obviously — all of them — do n’t want to be here .
I ’ve got one of the new people in my class .
I feel sorry for her .
Marietta … Smith ?
( I ’ll bet .
All those new people are Smiths and Joneses and Browns and Blacks . )
She ’s tall and skinny like they all are .
She ’s by herself in my class ; usually there ’s two or three of them in each class .
She ’s really scared .
I tried to help her the first days — I thought she needed a girl friend really badly — but she did n’t even smile back when I smiled straight at her .
The boys are all wondering if those new boys would be on the basketball team , but so far they do n’t even answer when they ’re asked .
Jerry asked Huxley Jones , and Huxley said , under his breath , “ Evolve , why do n’t you ? ”
Trouble is , my name is Smith , too , but it ’s really Smith .
I ’ve always wanted to change it to something more complicated .
I ’d rather be Karpinsky or Jesperson or Minnifee like some of the kids in my class .
I kind of understand those new kids .
I have to eat a special diet , and I ’m too tall , too .
I tower over most of the town boys .
And I ’m an only child and I ’m not at all popular .
I do n’t care what Mom says , I do n’t see what harm there can be in helping Marietta and I ’m curious .
I like her odd accent .
I try saying things as she does and I say , “ Shoe Dad , ” to my dad even though I do n’t know what those kids mean by it .
Maybe it ’s really Shoo Dad .
One of these days I ’m going to sneak into her house and see what I can find out .
But I do n’t have a lot of time for finding out things because I have to practice the violin so much .
Funny though , when I took my violin to school because I had my lesson that afternoon , Marietta looked at the case as if she could n’t imagine what was in it .
I said , “ violin , ” even though she had n’t asked .
And then she looked as if she wanted to ask , “ What ’s a violin ? ”
Those kids are all so dumb about ordinary things .
Every single one of them has been kept back a grade .
I do n’t know how they can walk around looking so snooty .
It ’s as if they think being dumb is better .
Marietta is awful in school , too .
The teacher asked her who was the vice president and she did n’t know .
So the teacher asked who was president and she did n’t know that either .
That gave me the courage to ask her if she wanted help .
But then she said her mother does n’t want her to be friends with any of us and I said my mother says the exact same thing .
Finally she laughs , we both do , and she says , “ Shoe Dad , if we can keep it secret . ”
( Those kids never say “ Okay . ” )
She says , “ But I should n’t be too smart either .
We do n’t want anybody to notice us . ”
So far I do n’t think she has anything to worry about in that direction .
I do n’t say that , though .
What I say is , “ You ’re getting noticed for the opposite reason .
You need my help . ”
I ’m really curious about her house , but she would n’t dare invite me and I would n’t dare go there .
And she ca n’t come to my house because Mom would be horrified .
Too bad they look a little bit different otherwise Mom would never know .
So we mostly meet in the woods by the railroad tracks where the bums used to hide out back when there were bums .
Mom does n’t like me to go there either .
She thinks maybe there might still be bums around .
Marietta and I always scope out the place first , not for bums , but because boys sometimes go there to smoke .
I discovered Marietta was so bad at math because she was used to writing out the problems in an entirely different way .
Once I got that straightened out she got a lot better .
But she said Huxley told her there was no need for her ever to know who was president here now .
I said , “ Why not ? ”
She started to say it was n’t important but she stopped in the middle .
Then she said , it was just that there were some things she was n’t going to bother knowing .
She tells me she really likes Judson Jesperson , but she says she ’s not supposed to go outside her own group .
And me , I like Huxley Jones , but Marietta says he can’t go outside their group either .
She ’s supposed to like Huxley and I ’m supposed to like Judd .
I asked her if this was some sort of religious thing ?
I did n’t dare say racial but Judson has very dark hair and eyes though his skin is just like hers .
She said , no , it was something entirely different and she was n’t supposed to talk about it .
She said it would be very dangerous for any of her group to marry outsiders .
She said , “ Who knows who would be president in a couple a hundred years if Judd and I got married ? ”
So anyway , we ’re unhappy together and I can tell her all about Judson ’s family but she can’t tell me anything about Huxley .
#
A dozen more families of the tall people move into town .
They ca n’t take the best houses because they ’re already gone , but when they get through with the second best houses , they turn out be almost as good except for not being on top of a hill and next to the lake .
The first group of kids is getting a little friendlier .
Huxley even let himself get talked into being on the basketball team but he did n’t know how to play and had to be taught from scratch .
Judd says they ’re sorry now .
All he has going for him is being tall .
I do n’t care , I like him .
I like his stooped over posture .
As if he does n’t want to be that tall .
I like his kind of scholarly face .
I like his pixie grin .
At first he was always frowning at all of us , but pretty soon he was n’t and especially not at me .
The first thing I said to him was , “ I like your name , ” and he actually did smile .
By now everybody is saying Shoe Dad .
#
Then we have the first snow and a snow day .
It ’s so beautiful .
I want to see Marietta right away , but no school so I start out towards her house .
I ’m not going to disobey Mom .
Besides , that ’s our only good hill for sledding .
Everybody will be up there .
And there everybody is , with sleds and garbage can lids and folded up cardboard boxes .
Some kids even have skis .
The new kids are even more excited about the snow than we are .
They act as though they ’ve never made snowmen and never thrown snow balls .
They ’re like little kids .
Well , actually we all are .
Those new kids have skis and fancy boots .
But not a single one knows how to ski .
Marietta ’s there .
I knew she would be .
She says first off , “ Look … these great boots … . ”
She has the fancy kind you ca n’t walk around in .
They ’re white with dozens of black buckles .
I admit they ’re beautiful .
I say , “ Shoe Dad . ”
“ … and they only cost five hundred dollars . ”
She ’s always saying things like that .
Everything is cheap to her .
I wish something was cheap to me .
I ’d like to say , “ Evolve ! ” but I do n’t want to make her feel bad .
I say , “ Bite the…oh yeah , bite the ski boot . ”

We do n’t hear about it till lunch time , but that night in the middle of the storm , odd things disappeared .
Half the fish at the fish hatchery , and that very same night , a big pile of lumber from the lumber mill disappeared .
The night watchman swears he made his rounds every hour .
Sometime between his two o’clock and three o’clock a whole section of lumber was gone and not a sound .
The fish people are there early and late .
They went to feed the fish at eight and found half the tanks empty .
Some of us say the new people are getting blamed just because they ’re richer than we are and just because they ’re new , though nobody can figure out how they could have done it .
Even so , I ’m suspicious , too .
Dad says the town is going to have a meeting about them .
Then we hear that exactly the same night , north of us , in Washington State they also lost a lot of lumber .
And another place in Nevada lost half their grass - fed beef .
Funny though , Huxley said all this was our fault .
Even that they ’re here in the first place is our fault .
He said we should have stopped cutting down trees .
He wo n’t say anything more about it .
That shows how odd these new kids are .
But I guess that ’s fair , we blame them for everything and they blame us .
Except for Marietta , those kids still do n’t like it here at all , but Marietta says she ’s getting to like it , partly because of being friends with me — where she was before she never had such a good friend as I am — and she also likes it because she always did like camping out and making do with what ’s at hand .
That makes me wonder all the more where she came from .
#
The new people often have meetings in one of the larger houses up on the hill .
They ca n’t hide that because all the best cars in town are parked outside .
After the fish and lumber disappear , the next time those cars gather , a whole batch of the town ’s people storm the house .
It is n’t fair , but the cops are on our side ; they ’re just like all the town ’s people , they do n’t trust those new people either .
And it is n’t as if the new people had any higher up connections in the town that would help them .
So the cops arrest them instead of us , even though we ’re the ones that broke into their meeting .
Did a lot of damage , too , and not only to the furniture .
Six of the new people are in the hospital .
That leaves a lot of those kids with nobody looking after them .
The school principal asks the town parents if they ’ll take in some of the children temporarily until their parents can get themselves straightened out with the police .
I get my folks to take in Marietta .
Mom does n’t mind it under these circumstances .
In fact she acts nice .
She even bakes cookies .
Marietta can’t believe Mom made these right here at home .
She ’s so fascinated she forgets to feel worried for a while .
As usual I have to practice the violin .
Marietta tries it out .
All she makes is squeaks .
She ca n’t believe how hard it is .
She ’s only played computer instruments .
“ Aided , ” she says , so you do n’t have to know anything .
But you can have any sound you want and you sound good right at the beginning .
I have twin beds in my room so we get to be right in together .
At first Marietta seems to like it as much as I do .
We talk until Mom comes in and tells us we have to stop because of school tomorrow .
But a little bit after I turn out the light , I ’m pretty sure Marietta is crying .
I ask if there ’s anything I can do .
She says , “ I wish I could go home . ”
I say , “ It wo n’t be long before your parents come back . ”
“ I mean I want to go back where we used to live .
My real home . ”
“ Where is it ? ”
“ We ’re not supposed to say . ”
“ Was it so much better there ? ”
“ Sort of …some ways … except it ’s nice being so rich for a change .
Of course there ’s lots you do n’t have … .
Oh well . ”
“ I ’m glad you ’re here . ”
“ Well , I ’m glad for having you . ”
“ Can I go up and see your house now that there ’s nobody there ? ”
“ It ’s just like yours only richer .
That ’s because everything is so cheap here otherwise we could n’t afford stuff .
It ’s supposed to be just like yours .
Our parents made it special to be like that . ”
“ Can we go anyway ?
I like rich stuff and I hardly ever get to see rich things except on TV .
Besides , do n’t you need to go get more clothes ? ”
#
So we do that — skip school and go up .
She ’s right .
There ’s nothing odd about it …except there is .
There ’s a fancy barbeque thing in the backyard , but obviously never used .
There ’s a picnic table beside it but no chairs .
The two flamingos are in a corner , lying on their sides .
Inside it ’s awfully — I do n’t know how to describe it — cold and stiff , and kind of empty .
It ’s as if nobody lives there .
There ’s a National Geographic on one side of the coffee table and a Consumers Report on the other , and that ’s all .
No clutter .
Mom would like it .
Upstairs , her room has all the right stuff .
There ’s a brand new teddy bear on the pillow and a small bookcase with brand new books , all very girlie .
They do n’t look read either .
There ’s not a single Tarzan or John Carter .
I ask , and she never even heard of Tarzan .
I tell her I ’ll lend her some .
Even though we ’re too old for those , she ’ll like them .
She has one whole drawer with nothing but fancy sweaters and blouses .
We gather some up to bring back and she says I can have half of them .
On the way out , I open the hall closet and there ’s a tangle of wires and silvery things along them like Christmas tree lights .
At first Marietta tries to keep the door shut as if she does n’t want me to see them , but then she says she trusts me as much as anybody she ever knew so she says , “ Take a good look . ”
I say , “ I do n’t know what it is , anyway . ”
She says , “ Time machine , ” and starts laughing hysterically .
And then we both laugh so hard we fall on the floor and I do n’t know what ’s the truth and what is n’t , except maybe I do .
I ’m glad we went there .
I do n’t need to feel jealous after all .
Even though Mom would probably like living like that , I would n’t .
#
The police hang on to those new people to see if any of them are guilty of anything at all and also as a sort of punishment , I suppose for being rich and taking up all the best places .
That means Marietta and I have even more time together .
The lumber mill now has three night watchmen .
They ’re sitting right next to the biggest piles of lumber .
The fish hatchery has people practically in with the fish .
But then — again in the middle of the night — all the new people disappear .
The grown - ups , that is .
So then we know who did the fish and lumber .
But now there ’s nobody to blame but their children .
Some townspeople are so angry they want to put them in jail , too .
Most of the townspeople do n’t go that far , though .
My parents and lots of others say they wo n’t let that happen .
Besides , now that they know Marietta they like her .
But it ’s not safe for the new kids to walk the streets anymore — two kids got beat up by a gang of boys and they were n’t even the new kids , they were just blond and tall and skinny .
Mom dyes Marietta ’s hair black so she ’ll be safer .
Some of the other new kids do that too .
Marietta looks good with dark hair .
That does n’t cheer her up , though .
All those kids feel terrible .
Naturally .
But it ’s odd , they keep saying they ’re not surprised , they just wondered when it would happen .
We talk a lot in bed at night and Mom does n’t tell us to shut up until it gets really late .
“ How can your parents leave you like this ? ”
“ We ’re not allowed to say , but it ’s for our own good . ”
“ Parents always say that . ”
#
I try to cheer up Marietta .
We go to lots of movies .
She does like the Tarzan and John Carter books and there are lots of those to go through yet .
Mom gives her valerian and chamomile tea almost every night .
At first Marietta did n’t want hugs from my mom , but now she does .
I go around wearing her expensive sweaters and I wear her white jacket when she wears her shiny black one .
That turns out to be a big mistake because I get taken for one of them .
I ’m as tall and skinny as they are .
And here I am , wearing fancy clothes like they always do .
And here we are , Marietta and me , one of us with dyed black hair and me , a darker blond than they are but that does n’t matter to this bunch .
They ’re not high school boys .
I do n’t know who they are but they ’re grown men — waiting for us after the movie .
They do n’t think Marietta is one of the new people — they think I am .
She ’s wearing my faded blue jeans and my sweatshirt and I ’m in her cashmere sweater and that white jacket .
They push her aside — so hard they knock her down — and come after me .
They yank at Marietta ’s jacket so hard the zipper breaks , and then pull the sweater up over my face so I do n’t see what happens next .
All I know is they suddenly stop and Marietta is pulling the sweater down so I can see .
She yells , “ Run , ” and we do .
When I look back I see all three of them collapsed on the ground .
“ Do n’t stop . ” Marietta grabs my arm and pulls me along with her .
“ What did you do ? ”
“ I ’m not allowed to say . ”
We run all the way home and collapse in our front hall .
That white jacket is lost and ruined out there somewhere and the sweater is all pulled out of shape .
Marietta right away says , “ Do n’t tell . ”
“ How did you do that ? ”
“ I thought you had those here .
Tazers .
Do n’t you ?
This is just a different form . ”
“ Where is your tazer ? ”
“ I ’m not supposed to say .
See , where I come from it ’s not safe anymore since the revolt of … .
My drones — I mean my parents — they wanted me to be able to defend myself .
Besides , they thought everybody here had guns . ”
“ Where is it ?
You can tell me . ”
“ Here . ” She points to her earlobe .
( There ’s not even a mark that I can see . )
“ I have some control over the direction . ”
She twists her earlobe .
“ I can even point it back . ”
I touch it , but I do n’t feel anything .
“ They left us here , my drones .
They said they would if anything happened .
And things did happen .
I guess it is better here .
I mean the air and water and space to move around in … .
And the food … it is n’t what we ’re used to , and it ’s awfully primitive , everything is , but it ’s better some ways and we ’re rich .
I have a million dollars in the bank in my name . ”
She ’s about to tell me more but Mom comes in right then and finds us sitting on the floor , and me , all bedraggled and the sweater ruined .
She gets really upset when she hears about it .
( We do n’t tell her the tazer part . )
She insists that she ’s going to dye my hair that very night no matter how long it takes , and I have to stop wearing Marietta ’s nice clothes .
For once I agree with her .
I let her do all that , even though I know the kids at school will tease me .
I wonder if those men are going to tell what happened to them ?
Maybe not , though , because they were breaking the law .
I ’m going to stick close to Marietta from now on .
I feel safe with her .
Most of those new kids are physically awkward — like Huxley trying to be on the basketball team — but Marietta is n’t so bad .
She says it ’s because her parents did n’t believe in the education boxes most kids had .
She says those were like being inside a TV set .
But she kept calling hers “ Mommy ” by mistake and that upset her mother so much she actually had her playing outside even though the air was n’t that good anymore and even when it was too hot .
She ’s been telling me everything , even about the air - conditioned sweater her mom got her .
She says , “ Even so , it was getting worse and worse .
Food riots sometimes .
I know this is best for us .
But we have to be so careful and not change anything .
Nobody knows what would happen if we upset things .
Shoe Dad , I might not even exist .
I ’d go poof !
Just like that . ”

And then Huxley gets in trouble and that changes everything .
He did n’t dye his hair like the others did .
It might not have worked anyway .
Three men attack him ; maybe the same three that came after us .
( You ’d think they ’d learn . )
Marietta and I have to guess what happened : that he not only used his tazer , but tied up the men when they were down .
Dragged them into the woods .
Then he walked all the way home with bruises all over .
Nobody found out about the men out in the woods till two days later .
It rained all the next day and one of the men suffocated with his head in the mud .
Marietta and I know Huxley did n’t use his tazer until he was practically all beat up .
He was trying so hard not to cause any changes in the people living here but then he caused more of a problem .
The townspeople are blaming him .
Of course they are .
Besides , who knows what story those men told ?
So the police come to arrest him , but he takes off .
They even shoot at him , but he gets away .
We do n’t know if he got shot or not .
All the new kids are even scareder than they already were .
About going “ poof . ”
They keep saying , “ It ’s gotta be even worse than that butterfly back in the Jurassic era . ”
I do n’t know what they mean by that .
They stand there staring at nothing , as if thinking :
Any minute and I never existed .
They stop in mid sentence as if :
Is it right now that I disappear ?
On the other hand , they could disappear by going back home .
We ’d never know which it was .
Marietta hangs on to me whenever she can .
It ’s as if she thinks as long as she has a good grip on my arm , she wo n’t disappear .
It ’s a bother but I let her .
#
I know where Huxley is n’t .
He ’s not at that place where the bums used to go and where the boys go to smoke .
That ’s too easy .
But I do know where he could be .
I do n’t even tell Marietta .
I get up real early before anybody is up .
I make a couple of peanut butter sandwiches and take some nuts and apples and go .
Good that Huxley and I never got together or the cops would be watching me .
So I head out into the woods .
It ’s a good place to get lost since there are so many crisscrossing paths and there ’s a lot of undergrowth for hiding .
I think Huxley is somewhere in there but I ’ll have a hard time finding him .
I whistle .
I sing .
I make a lot of noise and wander all over .
I think I ’m going to get lost myself .
But what if he ’s disappeared already ?
What if he ’s never been at all ?
Then I hear a bird chirping above me , I look up and there he is and he ’s not been shot .
I climb up and give him the sandwiches .
He ’s changed a lot from when he first came .
I do n’t think he ’d have been able to climb a tree .
He looks kind of wild and haunted and dirty .
That makes me like him all the more .
I ’m always embarrassed , being so close to a boy I like so much , and now even more so .
I do n’t ask anything I really want to .
I ’m too nervous .
He gobbles up both sandwiches and apples and nuts all in about five minutes .
When everything is gone he thinks maybe one of the sandwiches might have been for me and apologizes .
But I say none of it was for me and I ’ll bring more tomorrow .
He admires my new black hair , but I think he ’s just trying to be nice .
I move up closer to the branch he ’s on .
Turns out I do n’t have to ask anything .
He tells me he always did like me but did n’t dare show it .
Now he does dare .
He thinks everything is all messed up anyway so he might as well like me and he wants me to know it .
Then we hear the swishing of underbrush and voices of people coming closer .
We shut up .
He moves higher and I move lower .
In a few minutes the woods are packed with people walking all over the place looking for him .
Some of them are cops in uniform .
Lots are just townspeople .
Mostly men but a few women .
I jump down and move away from his tree .
I shout , “ Let ’s look over by the little cave next to the stream . ”
So I and a group of others including one cop , head over there .
The cop says , “ Are n’t you supposed to be in school ? ”
“ Yeah , but is n’t this important ? ”
“ You ’re lucky I ’m not a truant officer . ”
“ What will you do when you find him ? ”
He pulls his cuffs out of his back pocket and rattles them .
Says , “ He ’s dangerous . ”
#
I know this whole woods better than a lot of them do .
I lead them around to all sorts of good hiding places .
I talk loud and make a lot of noise .
I do n’t ever look up .
It ’s a tiring day for everybody .
I had no idea I was going to get caught up in the search and get home so late .
My folks and Marietta have been worried about me .
I did n’t tell Mom where I ’d been , but I tell Marietta .
She feels bad that I did n’t ask her to come along , but I convinced her it was safer for Huxley if it ’s just me .
#
Next day I do n’t think I should keep on skipping school so I just skip my last class .
This time I make four peanut butter sandwiches .
It ’s late so I bring a flashlight .
I head for that same tree first , but he ’s not there .
As before , I sing .
I whistle .
I keep looking up and chirping .
I go to all the good spots .
It gets dark and I ’m worried about using the flashlight .
There ’s only a little moon so I stumble around tripping on things .
Pretty soon I know I ’d better go home .
I leave the sandwiches up in the tree where I first found Huxley .
I leave the flashlight for him , too , and try to find my way out without it .
But I can’t .
I thought if I just came to one of the streams and followed it , I ’d be okay , but it ’s muddy and slippery near the stream and I keep falling down .
I decide it ’s best to just wait till dawn .
I huddle down against a tree .
I wish I ’d kept one of those sandwiches for myself .
In the morning I go back to the tree where I left the sandwiches .
Something got into them and ate most of them and scattered what was left all over .
#
When I get back my folks are so worried and the police are all over looking for me .
Thing is , Marietta disappeared , too , and first they thought we were off somewhere together .
Then they thought that I got disappeared with all the others .
It turns out they ’re all gone .
I ’ll never know if Marietta got to go home or if she never existed in the first place or maybe they decided it was a bad and dangerous idea to leave their kids here .
Or maybe things got better so it was okay to go home .
Or maybe they found better stuff from other times .
Like way , way back before there were other people to get in their way .
She left a lot of her clothes in my room .
Funny though , my old Tarzan and John Carter books — the ones she was in the middle of reading — are gone .
That makes me feel that she did n’t disappear completely like she was afraid would happen .
She ’s still someplace , I ’m sure of it , reading my books .
I wonder if I could write her a letter .
I ’ll bet there is a way , like sealed up in stainless steel .
I wish we ’d talked about that before she left .
I wish I knew how long my letter would have to last to get to her .
Maybe I ’ll have to carve it in stone .

Earlier this month , Oracle released a new version of Java , 1.6.0_21 ( also called 6u21 ) .
Unfortunately as Eclipse users quickly discovered , it was incompatible with Eclipse and Eclipse Rich Client Platform ( RCP ) programs .
Bug 319514 in the Eclipse bug database has all the gory details , but in a nutshell , Oracle changed the company name property on java .
exe from " Sun Microsystems , Inc " to " Oracle " .
The change was not announced or documented in the release notes .
Ironically , Eclipse has been using this value since 2007 to work around another Java problem where Sun 's default for the " MaxPermSize " option was too small for Eclipse to run .
When it changed , the workaround no longer worked , and many people encountered " PermGen " errors when they started Eclipse .
Oracle responded by respinning 6u21 on Monday to restore the value , but warned that it will be changed for good in JDK 7 .
A company developer wrote :
As part of Oracle 's rebranding of Sun 's products , the Company Name property of the java .
exe file , the executable file containing Oracle 's JRE for Windows , was updated from " Sun Microsystems " to " Oracle " in Java SE 6u21 .
After the updated JRE was posted on java.sun.com , it was reported that the change affected Eclipse users on Windows by causing it to hang when starting Eclipse after updating to the rebranded JRE .
A workaround was quickly identified and posted on Eclipse 's website , but a wide distribution of the rebranded JRE executable could negatively impact many Eclipse users .
In consideration to Eclipse and other potentially affected users , Oracle has restored the Windows Company Name property value to " Sun Microsystems " .
This value will be changed to " Oracle " in JDK 7 .
The change affected only the Windows version of the JRE , not the versions for Solaris and Linux .
To accommodate this update the Windows build version will increase from 6u21 - b06 to 6u21 - b07 .
Solaris and Linux distributions will continue to ship build 6u21 - b06 .
An engineering side note :
The " Java " property values for java.vendor and java.vm.vendor were never changed in the jdk6 releases and will remain " Sun Microsystems , Inc. " .
It was understood that changing the vendor property values could impact applications and we purposely did not disturb these vendor properties .
The Windows specific exe / dll file " COMPANY " value is what is at issue here , not the Java properties .
It came as a surprise to us that anyone would be inspecting or depending on the value of this very platform specific field .
Regardless , we will restore the COMPANY field in the jdk6 releases .
Note that the jdk7 releases will eventually be changing to Oracle , including the java.vendor and java.vm.vendor properties .
This morning I verified that the official Oracle download site has been updated with the correct version and that it works with Eclipse .
Here 's what it prints when I run java -version :
C:\> java - version java version " 1.6.0_21 " Java( TM ) SE Runtime Environment ( build 1.6.0_21-b07 ) Java HotSpot ( TM ) 64 - Bit Server VM ( build 17.0 - b17 , mixed mode )
If you downloaded Java for Windows 32 - bit or 64 - bit recently , be sure you have the 1.6.0_21 - b07 version and not b06 .
Is there an art - world equivalent of crying wolf ?
If so , Banksy has probably done it .
Banksy , the pseudonymous British street artist , has built his reputation on stunts  like inserting his own work among the masters ’ in museums  that taunted the market in which his pieces sold for millions .
But with his latest project , the documentary “ Exit Through the Gift Shop , ” he is laboring to convince audiences that he ’s playing it straight .
The film , which opens on Friday in New York and California , follows Thierry Guetta , an amiable Frenchman who lives in Los Angeles and videotapes everything  or so we ’re told .
When Mr. Guetta and camera eventually tunnel into the world of street art  he was introduced to the scene through a cousin , the Parisian artist Space Invader  his enthusiastic recording melds nicely with the artists ’ desire to have their otherwise ephemeral work documented .
He captures that scene ’s luminaries , like Shepard Fairey and Swoon working on rooftops and in alleys under cover of night .
It seems to be a natural fit for a documentary .
But Mr. Guetta ’s nonstop footage turns out to be unwatched ( he has boxes and boxes of unlabeled tapes ) and even when he cobbles something together after years of shooting , largely unwatchable .
“ He was maybe just somebody with mental problems who happened to have a camera , ” Banksy says in the film .
So Banksy decides to take control of the material himself  or so we ’re told .
Robbed of his camera and prodded by Banksy , Mr. Guetta , meanwhile , morphs into a street artist , inventing an alter ego called Mr. Brainwash and staging an opening exhibition in Los Angeles that turns him into an overnight sensation , all of which is captured in “ Exit Through the Gift Shop . ”
Prince has taken his war against the internet one step further by shutting down his official website .

WASHINGTON — An unprecedented RCMP probe into the Arar torture affair has gone global , with the possibility the Mounties will lay charges against U.S. and Syrian government officials involved in the case .
Lawyers for Maher Arar confirm their client has been co-operating closely as a team of RCMP investigators turns its gaze abroad to focus on foreign officials allegedly complicit in the Syrian - born Canadian ’s year - long detention in an underground cell in Damascus , where he underwent torture .
Code - named “ Project Prism , ” the four - member RCMP probe was first disclosed by the Toronto Star last December .
It was thought then to be focused mainly on the actions of Canadian government officials in the Arar rendition saga .
But Arar ’s lawyers now say the Mounties are looking foremost to Syria and the United States for the missing pieces to the Arar puzzle , which already was the subject of an exhaustive Canadian inquiry that ended in full exoneration for Arar , including a public apology from Ottawa and $ 10 million in damages .
“ The RCMP team did interview a lot of Canadians .
But the primary focus has been on Syrian officials and , secondarily , U.S. officials , ” said Arar ’s Canadian lawyer , Paul Champ .
“ They have made numerous international trips , interviewed a number of people abroad .
And to some extent , then have been able collect information from the other governments in question . ”
Arar revealed his participation in the Mountie probe Monday , immediately following the ultimate setback in his quest for American justice — the U.S. Supreme Court ’s decision to end judicial review of the events that saw him plucked at JFK Airport as a suspected Al Qaeda operative and sent to his native Syria eight years ago .
In a prepared statement , Arar said the U.S. high court decision “ eliminates my last bit of hope in the judicial system of the United States .
“ When it comes to ‘ national security ’ matters the judicial system has willingly abandoned its sacred role of ensuring that no one is above the law , ” Arar said .
In the wake of the high court decision , the U.S. - based Center for Constitutional Rights called on President Barack Obama and U.S. Congress to follow Ottawa ’s lead in issuing an apology and compensation to Arar .
“ The courts have regrettably refused to right the egregious wrong done to Maher Arar .
But the courts have never questioned that a wrong was done .
They have simply said that it is up to the political branches to fashion a remedy , ” said CCR attorney David Cole .
“ But this decision only underscores the moral responsibility of those to whom the courts deferred — President Obama and Congress — to do the right thing and redress Arar ’s injuries . ”
Champ said Arar ’s co-operation with the RCMP ’s Project Prism criminal probe began nearly four years ago and has included “ a couple of recorded interviews each year , ” including one in 2010 .
“ Mr. Arar would not be co-operating to this extent if there was n’t the expectation that this could lead to criminal charges at the end of the process , ” Champ said .
RCMP officials in Ottawa on Monday refused to confirm or deny the existence of the probe , citing privacy laws .
But its existence is hardly a well - kept secret .
The decision to shift the investigation overseas , however , takes the RCMP down a legal road not widely traveled .
Human rights activists note that only the governments of Spain and Italy have pursued terror - related criminal investigations beyond their borders involving American officials .
“ It takes some amount of courage to stand up to the U.S. government and I give the RCMP full credit for that , ” said CCR Senior Attorney Maria LaHood .
“ It underscores the fact that Canada has done the right thing in this case and continues to press the American government to do the right thing . ”

Champ said that while an outcome of criminal charges against foreign officials is far from assured , any such decision by the RCMP would set in motion a precise legal sequence .
“ Charges would be followed by the issuing of warrants , which go then to Interpol .
And if the individuals named enter any country that respects those warrants – and that is most countries – they would be arrested , ” he said .
“ The trend in international law over the past 10 or 15 years has been moving in this direction , the time for impunity is coming to an end .
So this is not over .
Mr. Arar ’s quest for accountability and justice has not come to an end . ”

I have noted before that every president since Nixon has talked about the need to get the United States off of foreign oil and moving toward energy independence .
Jon Stewart recently captured this theme in a very funny , but troubling segment :
An Energy - Independent Future
The Challenge
While Jon does a good job of demonstrating that this idea of reducing our dependence on foreign oil has been unsuccessfully pursued by eight consecutive presidential administrations , the question he asked but did not answer was why this has been such a challenge .
So I will pick up where Jon left off and explain why we could n’t get it done and what it would take to get it done .
The technical issue is n’t really all that difficult , but the political challenge is enormous .
Production Peaks , Demand Increases
U.S. oil production peaked in 1970 at 9.6 million barrels per day , and today stands at 5.3 million bpd ( Source ) .
The average rate of decline since 1970 of U.S. oil production has been about 1.5 % ( an impressively low decline rate ) .
But by the time U.S. oil production peaked , our oil consumption was already over 15 million bpd , and today stands at 18.7 million bpd ( off from the high in 2005 of 20.8 million bpd ) .
An increase in demand at the same time U.S. production has been falling is not a recipe for energy independence .
It is immediately obvious that if we use 18.7 million bpd and produce only 5.3 million bpd , we have to find a way to either
Cut petroleum consumption by 13.4 million bpd ( a drop of 72 % from current rates ) ;
Raise petroleum production by that amount ;
Some combination of the two .
Economic Difficulty and Standard of Living
Since oil production in the U.S. only ever achieved about half of our current consumption rate and has fallen for 40 years , I think Option 2 is out of the question .
In fact , I would go so far as to say the U.S. ca n’t raise production rates much beyond current rates , and with the public souring on offshore drilling we may find it very difficult to maintain current rates .
So that leaves us the option of reducing current petroleum consumption by 72 % from current rates .
This is of course why energy independence has eluded the U.S.
For all of the talk of getting off of foreign oil , who is willing to cut their oil consumption down to about a third of what you currently use ?
I am not saying it ca n’t be done , but I am saying it ca n’t be done painlessly and without making some major adjustments .
And that is ultimately why our political leaders have not managed to get it done .
They are selling a sacrifice - free pipe dream .
The Game of Politics
In the clip above , presidents mention many different options for reducing our oil dependence .
The problem is that they are all more expensive than oil , are n’t fungible with oil , and / or are themselves dependent upon oil .
So politicians ultimately only pay lip service to the idea of energy independence ( very popular ) but do n’t take tough measures ( very unpopular ) to actually achieve the goal .
But if energy independence is something that is very important to us , there is good news .
We can probably do it by trimming away a lot of fat .
Here is the speech that President Obama needs to make in order to explain how it is going to get done :
My fellow Americans .
It has not escaped my attention that we use a lot of oil .
Further , I have noticed that we consume over three times what we produce .
This is a trend that has worsened over the past eight presidential administrations , but I am here to reverse the trend .
Today , I am announcing a program that will move the U.S. on a path to energy independence by rationing petroleum beginning in 2011 .
Over the next five years we will reduce the amount of petroleum that Americans can use by 17 % per year .
This of course means that you need to start arranging your life in such a way that a 70 % reduction in your petroleum usage over 5 years is manageable .
Details of the execution of the program will soon be announced .
I recognize that this calls for sacrifice .
If it were easy , energy independence would have already been achieved .
But I sense that the public is ready to sacrifice some of their personal comforts for the benefit of an energy independent United States .
It is possible that new domestic oil discoveries , renewable energy , nuclear power , and other alternatives are able to reduce the need for the full 70 % cut in usage , but these sorts of promises have thus far not moved us very far along the path to energy independence .
They have to date merely served as a nice delusion that energy independence can be achieved without sacrifice from most citizens by merely innovating our way out of this problem .
Based on the trends for the past 40 years I think that is rooted more in hope than in reality , so we are going to try something a little different this time .
This time , Plan A calls for sacrifice , and our former Plan A for the past 40 years – innovating our way out of this problem – will now become our hopeful Plan B .
Conclusion : Reality
So there is the path to energy independence for the U.S. in a nutshell .
Based on today ’s production / consumption figures , this would require a 70 % across the board cut in our energy consumption down to per capita levels of countries like Russia , Jordan , Mexico , and Malaysia ( potentially adjusted based on decline rates , new discoveries , and alternative energy ) .
We would still use more oil per capita than Hungary , Chile , Thailand , Brazil , and South Africa , but we would need to come in at significantly less than the consumption of the E.U .
( Per capita consumption levels for many different countries on a bbl / person / day level can be found at NationMaster.com ) .
That is realistically what I believe it would take to achieve energy independence .
If you ca n’t imagine a U.S. president taking those steps , then you can well imagine why our foreign oil consumption has increased over those eight consecutive administrations .
What we can expect to happen as we proceed down the path we are going is that eventually the market will force those reductions anyway by simply driving prices so high that we have to voluntarily slash consumption .
Until then , if you enjoy the level of mobility you have today , you can thank the oil exporting countries for making that possible .
x June 2010 Greetings , I 've done Complex , I 've done Religious , I 've done Precious ....................
Now let 's try Intimidating !
Introducing the INTIMIDATOR Puzzle Sculpture .
This design is by far my most complex metal sculpture and it's both mentally and physically intimidating , thus the name .
For those challenged by Micro - Conundrum , I suggest giving this sculpture a wide berth .
This design expands the limits of what is considered possible for a puzzle ; it 's a puzzle with an intimidating function .
In June 2009 , starting with a few extra parts from my Labyrinth sculpture , I began working night and day creating this sculpture .
It grew to eight inches tall , four inches deep and five inches wide ; there 's a lot of volume to fill with interlocking parts and assembly of this puzzle is extremely difficult ; you 'll need a lot of time on your hands .
Physically , it tips the scale at over 40 pounds .
It sports a familiar look : The INTIMIDATOR
The INTIMIDATOR , 8 " Tall x 5 " Wide x 4 " Deep .
Six different metals are used to create this colorful desktop sculpture .
And to discourage unauthorized access , the sculpture requires a special key to begin disassembly of the puzzle sculpture .

Israel has enforced a strict naval blockade of Gaza , saying it is essential to stop weapons smuggling by Hamas , the Islamic militant group controlling the territory .
There are frequent clashes along the Israel - Gaza border , where militants from various groups try to lay bombs and fire rockets into southern Israel .
Israel has also accused Hamas of building a series of tunnels close to the border , designed to facilitate infiltrations .
But infiltration attempts by sea have been rare .
Monday ’s shootings came amid heightened tensions after the Israeli commando raid at sea , which turned violent and left nine activists dead .
The events aboard the Turkish ship , the Mavi Marmara , caused a crisis in Israel ’s relations with its once close ally , Turkey , and spread concern far beyond the region , prompting calls for an international inquiry and a lifting of the blockade .
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Monday that the United States was “ consulting closely with Egypt , as well as our other partners , on new ways to address the humanitarian , economic , security and political aspects of the situation in Gaza , ” according to news reports .
He issued the statement after meeting President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik .
Egypt and Israel have enforced the land and sea blockade of Gaza since Hamas took full control there in 2007 .
Responding to public outrage over the Israeli raid , Egypt opened its border crossing with Gaza , at Rafah , allowing passengers to flow through until further notice .
Any goods coming to Gaza from Egypt still have to pass through an Israeli - controlled land crossing at Kerem Shalom .
Image Palestinians inspected the boat of four Palestinian militants who were killed by Israeli forces off the central Gaza strip on Monday .

On Sunday , the French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , suggested a European Union role in checking cargo on board ships heading to Gaza in return for the lifting of the blockade .
Once the darling of the games industry , it 's a been a tough few years for Lara Croft .
While Tomb Raider : Underworld and Legend were seen as returns to form in many quarters , you can't help but see her as yesterday 's girl .
Nevertheless , she remains a potent brand , and this latest adventure from developers Crystal Dynamics is a laudable attempt to maximise use of a valuable licence without resorting to rushing out a subpar franchise instalment that devalues the series .
This is , you see , anything but a Tomb Raider game - with the clue being in the title .
For starters , the game is played entirely from an isometric viewpoint ( think Diablo ) and takes the format of a dungeon - crawling shooter - cum - puzzler .
Available only as a download , Guardian of Light is intended to be short but sweet , and a relatively cheap slice ( about £ 10 ) of disposable action fun .
As if it was n't already enough of a departure from the hallmarks of its progenitors , Guardian of Light is also designed to be played co-operatively , on or offline .
Lara is accompanied in her travails by an ancient Mayan warrior called Totec , and you 'll need to use both characters ' differing attributes and special abilities to progress .
Find a wall that 's just too high to jump over ?
Simple , Totec can throw his spear into the wall , and Lara can jump on it .
Then , using a neat grappling - hook system , Lara can pull Totec up after her .
Still can't get up ?
Totec can also hold his shield above his head for Lara to stand on .
If he jumps , then she jumps at just the right time , you 'll effectively double - jump - but the timing is critical .
These nifty mechanics are worked into a variety of puzzles and traps , and make working together all the more enjoyable .
Commendably , the developers have included the option to play through a slightly modified version of the game just with Lara if you can't find any willing participants - eliminating the need for a frustrating AI teammate - though Guardian of Light is clearly enjoyed most when playing with friends .
The plot is predictably hokey fare - retrieving an ancient artefact to save the world .
But plot is n't really something to worry about too much here - the game prioritises fun above all else .
There 's an arcadey feel as players compete to get high scores and retrieve power - ups , and the presentations and graphics are admirable for what is in essence a second - tier release .
Little touches like high - quality cutscenes and decent voice - acting all play their part in what feels like a surprisingly polished experience .
One puzzle I was shown was particularly impressive , with Lara forced to run through a floor of spike - laden pressure pads without touching any pad twice - it 's clear a lot of thought has gone into both the simple and cerebral elements of the game .
The controls , though not immediately intuitive , are simple enough ( though the erratic aim control will hopefully be smoothed out before release ) and the action , though punctuated by the odd platform section or puzzle , is pretty relentless .
In the hour I played through at Square Enix 's offices in Wimbledon I was impressed by the variety on offer , both in the enemies you encounter - from giant spiders to horned demons - and the landscapes you traverse .
There 's a decent array of weapons available too , from Lara 's iconic dual - pistols , to meatier fare like assault rifles and grenade launchers .
It 's not often at preview events I 'm sad to be forced to stop playing the game , but I felt that way about Guardian of Light .
While it probably wo n't provide much more than a week 's worth of entertainment , it 's shaping up to be a real breath of fresh air for the series , and may prove a highly satisfying snack - size treat for a gamer looking for something different between this summer 's heavyweight titles .
• Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light will be released this summer on XBLA , PSN and PC
As you may know ,
Intel has enjoyed a resurgence in its server and workstation processor business over the past several years , due in no small part to regular and effective refinements to its core CPU technology .
The introduction of the “ Nehalem ” quad - core Xeons last year was the biggest step forward the firm has taken in many years , with a whole new system architecture nicely complementing a revamped processor microarchitecture .
The results were major gains in scalability , performance , and power efficiency compared to the prior generation of Xeonsalong with renewed strength for Intel ’s competitive standing versus its main rival , AMD .
By contrast , this year ’s revision of the Xeon is comparatively simple , even modest .
The new 32 - nm Xeons , code - named Westmere - EP , raise the on-chip core count by two to a total of six cores per chipwhile fitting into the same socket and cooling infrastructure as the Nehalem Xeons before them .
The Westmere Xeons ’ clock frequencies are largely similar , as is the per-clock performance of each core .
A change like that is easy to grasp , but it ’s also easy to underestimate .
In the thread - rich realm of server - class applications , with a robust system architecture like this one , adding two more cores can boost performance by nearly 50 % .
From another angle , that boost could translate into a similarly large increase in energy efficiency , because half again as much work is being accomplished for each watt - hour the system consumes .
If talk like that does n’t float your boat , you ’re probably not a system administrator responsible for a room full of servers .
I ’d wager most folks in such roles would happily accept a 50 % gain in power - efficient performance each year , if they could get it .
The question is whether the Westmere - EP Xeons really deliver on their advertised promise .
We ’ve had a number of systems cranking away in Damage Labs for the last little while in order to find out , and , without giving away the game entirely , the news is even better than you might think .
Since our last look at workstation / server - class processors , the state of the art in such systems has changed on multiple fronts , from the growing prevalence of platforms tailored for power efficiency to the proliferation of solid - state disks .
Our revised suite of test systems provides a nice overview of the landscape .
Read on to see how it all fits together .
Westmere - EP : both less and more
Intel ’s 32 - nm chip fabrication process is what makes Westmere possible .
This relatively new fabrication technology allows substantially more gates and thus transistors , logic , and ultimately cores to fit into a given amount of chip area than the 45 - nm processes used formerly by Intel and still today by AMD .
In this generation of process tech , Intel has carried over its high k + metal gate transistors , first used at 45 nm , and moved to immersion lithography in which a liquid medium is used to better focus light for the first time .
By now , Intel is well into ramping its 32 - nm production , with the dual - core Clarkdale and six - core Gulftown processors making up a large proportion of its consumer mobile and desktop CPU lineups .
In fact , our review of these Xeon processors is rather late ; the Westmere - based Xeon 5600 series has been shipping to customers for a number of months , as well .

The remarkable thing about the Westmere - EP Xeons , as illustrated in the table above , is that they incorporate two more cores and 50 % more cache  L3 size is up from 8MB in Nehalem to 12 MB here yet they are actually smaller chips than their predecessors .
A close - up of a Westmere - EP wafer .
Source : Intel .
AMD has n’t made a process transition lately , and GlobalFoundries currently lags behind Intel by roughly a year , if not more .
Thus , Westmere ’s competition is a much larger chip , at 346 mm² , with the same core count .
In fact , the most direct competition for the Westmere Xeons is arguably the Opteron 6000 series , which is based on two of those larger chips packaged together in each socket .
The contrasts here are stark enough to incite me to use italics twice in two paragraphs , so we ’re not talking small potatoes .
Smaller chips , of course , are generally more desirable for a number of reasons , including lower manufacturing costs and typically lower power draw with tamer thermals .
By and large , Westmere - EP is essentially a Nehalem Xeon that ’s been ported over to the new 32 - nm process , but it has received a host of notable tweaks along the way , not least of which is the aforementioned addition of 50 % more cores and cache .
Thanks to Intel ’s version of simultaneous multithreading , known as Hyper - Threading , a six - core Xeon can track and execute 12 hardware threads .
Two Westmere Xeons in a 2P system present an imposing total of 24 threads to the OS .
The other modifications in Westmere - EP are minor but numerous .
Some of them boost performance in various ways .
A suite of seven new instructions , collectively dubbed AES - NI , can accelerate cryptography .
The chip ’s integrated memory controller now supports two DIMMs per channel at 1333M Hz , raising the limit from 1066MHz in Nehalem .
Also , the number of memory buffers has risen from 64 to 88 , offering the potential for higher peak bandwidth at a given memory frequency .
And , as is almost customary these days , certain latencies have been reduced in the CPU ’s virtualization hardware , potentially enhancing performance for consolidated servers .
Another set of changes in this new silicon focuses on advancing power efficiency .
The Nehalem Xeons introduced a gate capable of shutting off power to idle cores ;
Westmere adds a power gate for the “ uncore ” portion of the chip capable of reducing the voltage to the memory controller , L3 cache , and QuickPath interconnect when both sockets in a 2P system are idle .
Another potential heavy hitter for server installations will be the memory controller ’s ability to support low - voltage DDR3 memory , which has become available in recent months .
The chip ’s APIC timer now continues running when the CPU goes into a deep sleep state , too .
A pair of Xeon X5670 processors
From this Westmere - EP silicon , Intel has spun an entire range of new Xeons dubbed the 5600 series .
We detailed the various models here when those products were first introduced .
The 5600 lineup and its pricing appear to have remained largely static since then .
What ’s on the bench
The Xeons we have for review represent the best of the 5600 series on one axis or another , and we ’ve tested them in different types of systems as appropriate .
The most extreme of the bunch is the Xeon X5680 , which has a base clock speed of 3.33GHz and can raise its frequency as high as 3.6GHz via Turbo Boost when the thread count and thermal headroom permit .
The X5680 ’s max power and thermal rating , or thermal design power ( TDP ) , is 130W , which puts it on the high end of the power spectrum .
As Intel ’s fastest 2P processor , this model commands a hefty price premium , too .
A single X5680 will set you back $ 1663 .
Our test platform for this beast is a relatively large , floor - standing workstation enclosure with a SuperMicro X8DA3 motherboard and a 700W power supply .
That combination is comfortably up to the task of cooling and powering a system with a pair of 130W processors .
We should note that , although 5600 - series Xeons are billed as drop - in replacements for the 5500 - series Xeons before them , at Intel ’s recommendation , we upgraded the motherboard in this test system rather than using the older version of the X8DA3 used in our Xeon 5500 review .
That older X8D3A was pre-production hardware from the early days of Nehalem , so the change was needed for optimal operation .
However , Intel tells us many Xeon 5500 - based systems should allow for seamless drop - in upgrades to Westmere Xeons .
As is usually the case in these scenarios , you ’ll want to check with your motherboard or system vendor for compatibility information .
Asus ’ RS700 - E6 1U server
The X5680 ’s 130W TDP will probably rule it out of most server installations .
Xeons in the 95W power band are more common , and the X5670 is Intel ’s fastest offering at that TDP .
The X5670 runs only slightly slower than the X5680 , with a 2.93GHz base clock and a 3.33 GHz Turbo peak .
Stepping down to the X5670 will give you a nice break on max power ratings , but at $ 1440 , it ’s not much less expensive .
We ’ve tested the X5670 in an Asus 1U server system , pictured above .
We also dropped a pair of Xeon X5570 processors into this system the prior - gen Nehalem offering at the same frequency and TDP to see how the two generations of Xeons compare .
The low - power Willbrook server
To many folks , the Xeon L5640 may be the sexiest of these new CPUs .
Its six cores run at 2.26GHz and can spool up to 2.8GHz via Turbo Boost , yet this Xeon ’s TDP rating is a calm and collected 60W .
Naturally , that fact makes the L5640 a fantastic candidate for a power - efficient server .
You will pay a premium for this sort of power efficiency , though : the L5640 lists at $ 996 per chip .
Our test system matches a pair of L5640s with a custom motherboard from Intel officially known as the S5500WB and unofficially code - named Willowbrook .
Although this Willowbrook board is based on the same Tylersburg excuse me , I mean “ Intel 5500 series ” chipset as our other Xeon systems , Intel has specifically optimized this board for reduced power consumption .
Those optimizations include a carefully tuned voltage regulator design and more widely spaced components intended to permit airflow and reduce the energy required by cooling fans .
The firm claims a 32W savings at idle and a 42W savings under load versus its own S5520 UR motherboard .
To that potent mix of power - efficient components , we ’ve added six DIMMs of low - power Samsung DDR3 memory .
These DIMMs operate at only 1.35V , and Samsung happily touts them as a greener alternative to traditional DDR3 modules .
As you may be gathering by now , this entire platform ought to be quite nicely tailored for low - power operation .
To give us a sense of how the enhancements in the Westmere Xeons alone contribute to this system ’s efficiency and performance , we ’ve tested a couple of quad - core Xeon L5520 processors in this same system .
The L5520 has the same 2.26GHz base clock at 60W TDP as the L5640 , but its 2.53 GHz Turbo max is lower , and its memory speed tops out at 1066MHz .
A competitive imbroglio
As our regular readers will attest , we usually try to test products against their closest competition whenever possible .
For the Xeon 5600 series , that competition would most definitely be the latest Opterons from AMD .
In order to keep pace with Intel ’s formidable performance gains in recent years , AMD has elected to double up on the number of chips it delivers in a single package .
The resulting processors , code - named Magny - Cours , were formally announced in late March as the Opteron 6100 series .
With 12 cores and four channels of DDR3 memory per socket , these new Opterons promise substantial gains over the six - core Istanbul chips introduced a year ago , even though the basic building block is essentially the same hunk of silicon .
Doubling up on chips per socket can be a savvy strategy in the server market , one that Intel itself validated with its Harpertown Xeons back in 2007 .
Seeking to upgrade performance by raising clock speeds is a tricky endeavor , because it requires increases in chip voltage that can raise power draw exponentially .
By keeping clock speeds low , and thus voltages in check , AMD has made room for multiple chips per socket while staying within its traditional power bands .
For widely threaded workloads , this approach could pay solid performance dividends .
Several of the Opteron 6100 models look like good matches for the CPUs we ’re testing .
The Opteron 6176 SE with 12 cores , a 2.3GHz core clock , and a 105W ACP rating looks like a plausible rival to the Xeons X5680 and X5670 we have on hand .
The 6176 SE ’s $ 1386 price tag makes it a close competitor , too .
Meanwhile , the Opteron 6164 HE at $ 744 might well be the closest competition for the Xeon L5640 .
With 12 cores at 1.7GHz and a 65W ACP , the 6164 HE could make things interesting , at least .
More recently , AMD has announced the Opteron 4100 series , code named Lisbon during its development .
These CPU use only a single chip but add DDR3 support like Magny - Cours .
The 4100 - series Opterons are aimed primarily at compact , high - density server installations , and a bit of mystery surrounds the potential customers for these products .
AMD expects the 4100 series to appeal to big web companies that buy large numbers of servers through custom design groups at major OEMs , but it has said not to expect sales figures from that business to become public .
Whether such talk foreshadows stealthy success or silent - but - abysmal failure , we do not know .
We do know the 4100 series is n’t positioned directly against the Westmere Xeons , by and large .
The fastest Lisbon chip is the Opteron 4184 , with six cores at 2.8GHz and a 75W ACP , and it lists for $ 316 .
At that price , the 4184 competes against the quad - core Xeon X5500 processors that remain in Intel ’s product portfolio .
Unfortunately , we do n’t have any of these newer Opterons to test .
We have worked with both AMD and Intel for years to make these reviews possible , and both companies have supplied us ( and other publications ) with samples of their latest products .
Initially , this product cycle was no different .
We even made a two - day visit to AMD ’s server group in Texas to talk about the new Opterons a couple of months back , yet we ’re still awaiting word on review samples .
That is , frankly , one reason this review is a little late to publication ; we had sincerely hoped to include a head - to - head comparison of the latest CPUs .
Of course , some of the blame for the absence of newer Opterons here lies with us .
We should have seen the writing on the wall and pursued other avenues for getting hold of a system sooner , either by working with a server maker or just buying the stuff ourselves .
We ’re still hoping to put the new Opterons through their paces , but we could n’t delay publication of this review any longer .
For the time being , we ’ve tested the latest Xeons against the products they replace and against the older generation of Opterons .
That ’s not our favored outcome , but we should be able to get a good sense of the Westmere Xeons ’ relative performance , regardless .
Fortunately , we do have an Opteron platform you may not have seen tested in the wild just yet .
Tyan was kind enough to supply us with its S8212 motherboard , which is based on AMD ’s SR5690 chipset , better known as the Fiorano platform .
Fiorano is AMD ’s first attempt to produce its own server platform in quite a few years , and it adds a few critical features to the Opteron ’s quiver .
Among them : support for the HyperTransport 3 and PCI Express 2.0 interconnects , both with higher throughput than the older versions of those standards .
Although our Fiorano system does n’t make use of DDR3 memory , it is otherwise comprised of basically the same components as any newer Opteron 4100 system , with the same SR5690 chipset and six - core , 45 - nm processors .
In this case , we ’ve used Opteron 2435 CPUs clocked at 2.6GHz with a 75W power envelope .
The analogous model in the 4100 series would be the Opteron 4180 , which shares the same clock frequency and max power draw rating .
For what it ’s worth , we built our Fiorano test rig using the same type of floor - standing enclosure and power supply as our Xeon X5680 box , so comparisons between those two should be reasonably direct , if something of a mismatch .
We have a power - optimized representative from the Opteron fold , as well , in the form of a 1U server with an efficient 650W PSU and a pair of Opteron 2425 HE processors .
The Opteron 2425 HE is a six - core , 2.1GHz part with a 55W ACP .
This system is based on an older SuperMicro H8DMU + motherboard with an Nvidia chipset .
Although it lacks a few new features , I believe this board is more power - efficient overall than most existing Fiorano - based mobos , which is why we chose to test the Opteron HEs on it .
Test notes
All of our test systems benefited greatly in terms of power consumption and performance from the addition of solid - state drives for fast , local storage .
The folks at OCZ helped equip our test systems with enterprise - class Vertex EX SSDs .
The single - level - cell flash memory in these drives can endure more write - erase cycles than the multi - level - cell flash used in consumer drives , so it ’s better suited for server applications .
SLC memory writes data substantially faster than MLC flash , as well .
The only catch is that SLC flash is quite a bit pricier , as are the drives based on it .
For the right application , though , a drive like the Vertex EX can be very much worth it .
Heck , we even noticed the effects of these drives during our test sessions .
Boot times were ridiculously low for all of the systems , and program start - up times were practically instantaneous .
We ’ve also beefed up our lab equipment by stepping up to a Yokogawa WT210 power meter .
The Extech unit we ’ve used in the past would occasionally return an obviously erroneous value , and for that reason , the Extech has n’t been sanctioned for use with SPECpower_ssj when the results are to be published via SPEC .
The WT210 is a much more accurate meter that meets with SPEC ’s approval and integrates seamlessly with the SPECpower_ssj power measurement components .
Our testing methods
As ever , we did our best to deliver clean benchmark numbers .
We typically run each test three times and report the median result .
In the case of the SPEC benchmarks , though , we ’ve reported the results from the single best run achieved .

We used the following versions of our test applications :
The tests and methods we employ are usually publicly available and reproducible .
If you have questions about our methods , hit our forums to talk with us about them .
Memory subsystem performance
This synthetic test gives us a quick , visual map of the cache hierarchies of these processors .
As you can see , the six L1 and L2 caches of the Westmere Xeons deliver considerable cumulative throughputover a terabyte per second at peak in our 2P Xeon X5680 system .
The Xeon X5670 is over 50 % faster than the X5570 at the 256KB and 512KB data points , most likely due to the increased coverage offered by two more L1 and L2 caches .
Because those caches are inclusive ( that is , the L2 caches replicate the contents of the L1s ) , the total effective size of the X5670 ’s L1 and L2 caches is 192KB , while the X5570 ’s add up to 128KB .
Unfortunately , this program ’s sample points are too coarsely distributed to show us the impact of Westmere - EP ’s larger L3 cache .
The impact of the added buffering in Westmere - EP ’s memory controller is n’t hard to spot .
The Xeon X5670 transfers a couple of gigabytes per second more data than the X5570 , given the same core and memory frequencies .
The L5640 ’s lower performance with the scale and copy patterns initially puzzled us , but we expect this processor ’s throughput is limited by its lower ( 2.13GHz ) memory controller clock .
The X5570 , X5670 , and X5680 have a faster 2.66GHz memory controller .
The L5520 shares the same 2.13GHz memory controller frequency , and its performance with those patterns is nearly identical to the L5640 ’s , even though its DIMMs operate at 1066MHz .
Incidentally , we ’ve modified our Stream testing method from last time out .
We ’ve found that we get the best throughput on the Xeons by assigning one thread to each physical core in the system .
That ’s why our results are slightly better than you may have seen before .
Memory access latencies have n’t changed much from Nehalem to Westmere , despite the growth of the L3 cache from 8 MB to 12 MB .
In fact , we had to move our sample point for this graph to 32 MB because the larger cache was masking any latency it adds at 16MB .
We can get a closer look at access latencies throughout the memory hierarchy with the 3D graphs below .
I ’ve colored the block sizes that correspond to different cache levels , with yellow being L1 data cache and brown representing main memory .
The effect is impossible to see in the charts above , but our utility reports that L3 cache latency has grown from 32 cycles on the X5570 to 39 cycles on the X5670 .
( The L1 and L2 caches on the two chips have identical latencies . )
Thinking in terms of cycles is tricky , though , because the results are reported in core cycles and the L3 cache is clocked independently .
In this case , the comparison works because the two CPU models share the same core and uncore frequencies .
SPECjbb2005
SPECjbb 2005 simulates the role a server would play executing the “ business logic ” in the middle of a three - tier system with clients at the front - end and a database server at the back - end .
The logic executed by the test is written in Java and runs in a JVM .
This benchmark tests scaling with one to many threads , although its main score is largely a measure of peak throughput .
As you may know , system vendors spend tremendous effort attempting to achieve peak scores in benchmarks like this one , which they then publish via SPEC .
We have used a relatively fast JVM , the 64 - bit version of Oracle ’s JRockIt JRE , and we ’ve tuned each system reasonably well .
Still , it was not our intention to match the best published scores , a feat we probably could n’t accomplish without access to the IBM JVM , which looks to be the fastest option at present .
Similarly , although we ’ve worked to be compliant with the SPEC run rules for this benchmark , we have not done the necessary work to prepare these results for publication via SPEC , nor do we intend to do so .
Thus , these scores should be considered experimental , research - mode results only .
As always , please , no wagering .
We used the following command line options :
Xeons 12 core / 24 thread / 24GB/6 instances : start / AFFINITY [ F00000 , 0F0000 , 00F000 , 000F00 , 0000F0 , 00000 F ] java - Xms3900 m - Xmx3900 m - Xns3260 m - XXaggressive - Xlargepages:exitOnFailure=true - Xgc:genpar - XXgcthreads :4 -XXcallprofiling - XXtlasize : min=4k , preferred=1024k Xeons 12 core / 24 thread / 12GB/6 instances : start / AFFINITY [ F00000 , 0F0000 , 00F000 , 000F00 , 0000F0 , 00000 F ] java - Xms2800 m - Xmx2800 m - Xns2500 m - XXaggressive - Xlargepages:exitOnFailure=true - Xgc:genpar - XXgcthreads :4 -XXcallprofiling - XXtlasize : min=4k , preferred=1024k Xeons 8 core /16 thread / 24GB/2 instances : start / AFFINITY [ FF00 , 00 FF ] java - Xms3900 m - Xmx3900 m - Xns3260 m - XXaggressive - Xlargepages:exitOnFailure=true - Xgc:genpar - XXgcthreads :8 -XXcallprofiling - XXtlasize : min=4k , preferred=1024k Xeons 8 core /16 thread / 12 GB/2 instances : start / AFFINITY [ FF00 , 00 FF ] java - Xms2800 m - Xmx2800 m - Xns2500 m - XXaggressive - Xlargepages:exitOnFailure=true - Xgc:genpar - XXgcthreads :8 -XXcallprofiling - XXtlasize : min=4k , preferred=1024k Opterons 12 core / 16GB /2 instances : start / AFFINITY [ FC0 , 03 F ] java - Xms3900 m - Xmx3900 m - Xns3260 m - XXaggressive - Xlargepages:exitOnFailure=true - Xgc:genpar - XXgcthreads :6 -XXcallprofiling - XXtlasize : min=4k , preferred=1024k
In keeping with the SPECjbb run rules , we tested at up to twice the optimal number of warehouses per system , with the optimal count being the total number of hardware threads .
In all cases , Windows Server ’s “ lock pages in memory ” setting was enabled for the benchmark user .
In the Xeon systems ’ BIOSes , we disabled the “ hardware prefetch ” and “ adjacent cache line prefetch ” options .
The X5670 is n’t quite 50 % faster than the Xeon X5570 here , but this is a healthy performance gain within the same infrastructure and power envelope , regardless .
The low - power Xeon L5640 posts a similar gain over the L5520 , which is sufficient to put the L5640 ahead of the X5570 and that feels like noteworthy progress .
The picture will no doubt come into sharper focus when we add the question of power efficiency to the mix .
SPECpower_ssj2008
Like SPECjbb2005 , this benchmark is based on multithreaded Java workloads and uses similar tuning parameters , but its workloads are somewhat different .
SPECpower is also distinctive in that it measures power use at different load levels , stepping up from active idle to 100 % utilization in 10 % increments .
The benchmark then reports power - performance ratios at each load level .
SPEC ’s run rules for this benchmark require the collection of ambient temperature , humidity , and altitude data , as well as power and performance , in order to prevent the gaming of the test .
Per SPEC ’s recommendations , we used a separate system to act as the data collector .
Attached to it were a Digi WatchPort / H temperature and humidity sensor and our Yokogawa WT210 power meter .
Although our new power meter might well pass muster with SPEC , what we said about our SPECjbb results being “ research mode only ” applies here , too .
We used the same basic performance tuning and system setup parameters here that we did with SPECjbb2005 .
SPECpower_ssj results are a little more complicated to interpret than your average benchmark .
We ’ve plotted the output in several ways into order to help us understand it .
Although the plot above looks like some sort of odd coral formation , this may well be the most intuitive way of presenting these data .
Each of the load levels in the benchmark is represented by a point on the plot , and the two axes are straightforward enough .
The higher the point is on the plot , the higher the performance .
The further to the right it is , the more power was consumed at that load level .
Immediately , we can divine that the Xeon X5680 has the highest overall performance and the highest power consumption .
The Xeon X5670 represents a substantial reduction in power draw versus the X5680 with only a minor drop in operations per second .
Meanwhile , the Xeon X5570 draws nearly as much power as the X5670 at the upper load levels but does n’t deliver nearly as much throughput .
The Opteron 2435 ’s power draw is also quite similar , but its performance is lower still .
The Willowbrook system with the low - power Xeons is in a class of its own .
Inside that system , the Xeon L5640 achieves roughly 200K more ops per second than the L5520 with only marginally higher power draw .
Indeed , the L5640 appears to be the undisputed champ here , peaking higher than the Xeon X5570 while consuming over 100 fewer watts .
We can confirm the L5640 ’s standing with a look at the performance - to - power ratios and the summarized overall standings .
Yep , the Willowbrook / L5640 combination takes the top spot .
Furthermore , the power efficiency progress from Nehalem to Westmere is illustrated vividly in both the 95W and 60W Xeons .
The 95W Xeon X5670 even turns out to be more efficient than the 60W Xeon L5520 at all but the highest load levels , giving it a modest lead in the overall score .
Cinebench rendering
We can take another look at power consumption and energy - efficient performance by using a test whose time to completion varies with performance .
In this case , we ’re using Cinebench , a 3D rendering benchmark based on Maxon ’s Cinema 4D rendering engine .
The six - core Xeons dominate the performance results , more or less as expected .
We ’ll pause to note the architectural efficiency of the current Xeons .
Even at a lower clock frequency , the six - core , 2.26 GHz Xeon L5640 outperforms the six - core , 2.6GHz Opteron 2435 .
Still , single - threaded performance essentially has n’t advanced from the past generation to this one , as Amdahl ’s Law stubbornly refuses to give way to Moore’s .
The one exception is the Xeon L5460 , whose unusally high Turbo frequency leeway of 533MHz allows it basically to match the Xeon X5670 in the single - threaded test .
As the multithreaded version of this test ran , we measured power draw at the wall socket for each of our test systems across a set time period .
A quick look at the data tells us much of what we need to know .
Still , we can quantify these things with more precision .
We ’ll start with a look at idle power , taken from the trailing edge of our test period , after all CPUs have completed the render .
The 5600 - series Xeons bring a slight but measurable increase in power draw at idle , but they ’re clearly within the same range as their predecessors .
The most remarkable numbers here come from the Willowbrook system .
In case this has n’t sunk in yet , with low - power Xeons aboard , it ’s idling at around 65W .
Next , we can look at peak power draw by taking an average from the ten - second span from 10 to 20 seconds into our test period , during which the processors were rendering .
Peak power draw is also up somewhat in the 5600 - series Xeons , but not enough to create any real concern .
One way to gauge power efficiency is to look at total energy use over our time span .
This method takes into account power use both during the render and during the idle time .
We can express the result in terms of watt - seconds , also known as joules .
The Willowbrook system ’s minimal power draw at idle at makes this one a rout .
We can quantify efficiency even better by considering specifically the amount of energy used to render the scene .
Since the different systems completed the render at different speeds , we ’ve isolated the render period for each system .
We ’ve then computed the amount of energy used by each system to render the scene .
This method should account for both power use and , to some degree , performance , because shorter render times may lead to less energy consumption .
Once again , the Westmere Xeons are measurably more efficient than the prior generation of Xeonsand Opterons , for what it ’s worth .
Even the X5680 looks pretty good here , aided by the fact that it finishes rendering and thus ends our measurement in such short order .
MyriMatch proteomics
Our benchmarks sometimes come from unexpected places , and such is the case with this one .
David Tabb is a friend of mine from high school and a long - time TR reader .
He has provided us with an intriguing benchmark based on an application he ’s developed for use in his research work .
The application is called MyriMatch , and it ’s intended for use in proteomics , or the large - scale study of proteins .
I ’ll stop right here and let him explain what MyriMatch does :
In shotgun proteomics , researchers digest complex mixtures of proteins into peptides , separate them by liquid chromatography , and analyze them by tandem mass spectrometers .
This creates data sets containing tens of thousands of spectra that can be identified to peptide sequences drawn from the known genomes for most lab organisms .
The first software for this purpose was Sequest , created by John Yates and Jimmy Eng at the University of Washington .
Recently , David Tabb and Matthew Chambers at Vanderbilt University developed MyriMatch , an algorithm that can exploit multiple cores and multiple computers for this matching .
Source code and binaries of MyriMatch are publicly available .
In this test , 5555 tandem mass spectra from a Thermo LTQ mass spectrometer are identified to peptides generated from the 6714 proteins of S. cerevisiae ( baker ’s yeast ) .
The data set was provided by Andy Link at Vanderbilt University .
The FASTA protein sequence database was provided by the Saccharomyces Genome Database .
MyriMatch uses threading to accelerate the handling of protein sequences .
The database ( read into memory ) is separated into a number of jobs , typically the number of threads multiplied by 10 .
If four threads are used in the above database , for example , each job consists of 168 protein sequences ( 1/40th of the database ) .
When a thread finishes handling all proteins in the current job , it accepts another job from the queue .
This technique is intended to minimize synchronization overhead between threads and minimize CPU idle time .
The most important news for us is that MyriMatch is a widely multithreaded real - world application that we can use with a relevant data set .
MyriMatch also offers control over the number of threads used .
I should mention that performance scaling in MyriMatch tends to be limited by several factors , including memory bandwidth , as David explains :
Inefficiencies in scaling occur from a variety of sources .
First , each thread is comparing to a common collection of tandem mass spectra in memory .
Although most peptides will be compared to different spectra within the collection , sometimes multiple threads attempt to compare to the same spectra simultaneously , necessitating a mutex mechanism for each spectrum .
Second , the number of spectra in memory far exceeds the capacity of processor caches , and so the memory controller gets a fair workout during execution .
Here ’s how the processors performed .
In this ostensibly memory - bound test , the X5670 shaves 11 secondsor nearly 30 % off of the shortest execution time posted by the processor it succeeds .
STARS Euler3d computational fluid dynamics
Charles O’Neill works in the Computational Aeroservoelasticity Laboratory at Oklahoma State University , and he contacted us to suggest we try the computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) benchmark based on the STARS Euler3D structural analysis routines developed at CASELab .
This benchmark has been available to the public for some time in single - threaded form , but Charles was kind enough to put together a multithreaded version of the benchmark for us with a larger data set .
He has also put a web page online with a downloadable version of the multithreaded benchmark , a description , and some results here .
In this test , the application is basically doing analysis of airflow over an aircraft wing .
I will step out of the way and let Charles explain the rest :
The benchmark testcase is the AGARD 445.6 aeroelastic test wing .
The wing uses a NACA 65A004 airfoil section and has a panel aspect ratio of 1.65 , taper ratio of 0.66 , and a quarter - chord sweep angle of 45 º .
This AGARD wing was tested at the NASA Langley Research Center in the 16 - foot Transonic Dynamics Tunnel and is a standard aeroelastic test case used for validation of unsteady , compressible CFD codes .
The CFD grid contains 1.23 million tetrahedral elements and 223 thousand nodes . . . .
The benchmark executable advances the Mach 0.50 AGARD flow solution .
A benchmark score is reported as a CFD cycle frequency in Hertz .
So the higher the score , the faster the computer .
Charles tells me these CFD solvers are very floating - point intensive , but oftentimes limited primarily by memory bandwidth .
He has modified the benchmark for us in order to enable control over the number of threads used .
Here ’s how our contenders handled the test with different thread counts .
As you ’ll note , we ’re seeing some pretty broad variance in the results of this test at lower thread counts , which suggests it may be stumbling over these systems ’ non-uniform memory architectures .
In an attempt to circumvent that problem , I decided to try running two instances of this benchmark concurrently , with each one affinitized to a socket , and adding the results into an aggregate compute rate .
Doing so offers a nice performance boost .
The Xeon X5670 betters the X5570 ’s simulation rate by about 25 % , again in a workload where memory bandwidth has traditionally been a constraint .
POV - Ray ray tracing
We ’ve been using POV - Ray as a benchmark for a very , very long time , and we ’re not going to stop now .
The latest version is multithreaded and makes good use of all of the cores and hardware threads available to it .
As we saw in Cinebench , highly parallel , compute - intensive graphics workloads lend themselves well to increased core counts , so the new Xeons fulfill much of their potential .
x264 HD video encoding
This benchmark tests performance with one of the most popular H.264 video encoders , the open - source x264 .
The results come in two parts , for the two passes the encoder makes through the video file .
I ’ve chosen to report them separately , since that ’s typically how the results are reported in the public database of results for this benchmark .
I have to say , I sure hope they get a few Westmere Xeons inside the YouTube data center .
If you ’ve ever uploaded an HD video there , you ’ll know what I mean .
7 - Zip file compression
This final entry in our test suite more or less confirms what we already know about the Westmere Xeons .
They ’re quite adept at file compression , as well as many other things .

On June 3 , 1979 , the 2 mile deep exploratory well , IXTOC I , blew out in the Bahia de Campeche , 600 miles south of Texas in the Gulf of Mexico .
The water depth at the wellhead site was about 50 m ( 164 feet ) .
The IXTOC I was being drilled by the SEDCO 135 ( Sedco has since been acquired by Transocean , owner of the Deepwater Horizon ) , a semi-submersible platform on lease to Petroleos Mexicanos ( PEMEX ) .
The blowout was caused to the a phenomenon called “ swabbing ” .
Essentially , while pulling drillpipe out of the wellbore , a process called “ tripping ” , the drillpipe in the open hole acted like a syringe , which decreased the pressure inside the wellbore .
This decrease in pressure led to an influx of hydrocarbons , including natural gas , that went undetected .
This influx is called a “ kick ” .
As the kick migrated up the wellbore , it expanded exponentially and violently in a blowout , which subsequently ignited and caused the platform to catch fire .
The burning platform collapsed into the wellhead area hindering any immediate attempts to control the blowout .
PEMEX hired blowout control experts and other spill control experts including Red Adair , Martech International of Houston , and the Mexican diving company , Daivaz .
The Martech response included 50 personnel on site , the remotely operated vehicle TREC , and the submersible Pioneer I . The TREC attempted to find a safe approach to the Blowout Preventer ( BOP ) .
The approach was complicated by poor visibility and debris on the seafloor including derrick wreckage and 3000 meters of drillpipe .
Divers were eventually able to reach and activate the BOP , but the pressure of the oil and gas caused the valves to rupture .
The BOP was then reopened to prevent destroying it .
Over the next 9 months , with uncontrolled oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico , two relief wells were drilled to relieve pressure from the well to allow response personnel to cap it .
The IXTOC I well leaked oil at a rate of 10,000 – 30,000 barrels per day until it was finally capped on March 23 , 1980 .
IXTOC Incident Documents

Last week a group of Toyota supporters and anti-attorney advocates celebrated when the Wall Street Journal reported that early findings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that many of the unintended acceleration claims against the Japanese auto giant were the fault of driver error , not vehicle electronics .
At the time , we warned that celebration might be premature , since the report was based from an anonymous source and the NHTSA has said it is not close to making conclusions about the cause of unintended acceleration accidents .
This week , Toyota is already wrapped up in a set of new scandals indicating that the company is n’t nearly in the clear when it comes to accident liability .
First , Toyota faces a set of new lawsuits claiming that the Prius , the company ’s popular brand of hybrid vehicle , was prone to braking problems on rough or wet road surfaces .
When Toyota recalled 150,000 in February to investigate the problem , the NHTSA announced it would probe further .
“ While the manufacturer of the vehicle is Toyota , the defect alleged in this case is different than the defect alleged in your unintended acceleration cases , ” said Paul Kiesel , a California attorney who represents Prius owners .
The NHTSA has confirmed more than 120 Prius brake complaints and more than a dozen Prius drivers nationwide have already sued .
On July 29 , the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation will hear oral arguments on whether the lawsuits should be combined as an MDL .
If the case proceeds , it means more trouble for Toyota in the courts , and in public opinion .
In another blow to Toyota ’s supposed escape from liability , a “ delayed discovery ” motion is picking up steam in Los Angeles that would validate dozens of lawsuits that were once considered expired .
The complaint argues that Toyota executives knew about cases of unintended acceleration in 2002 , but did not disclose their knowledge until earlier this year before Congress .
If proven , this would mean the statute of limitations of two years for filing lawsuits would be moot , and drivers involved in accidents now suspected to be caused by unintended acceleration could file new lawsuits .
“ It seems to be against civil concepts of justice that somebody can benefit legally from concealing vital safety information from the American public , ” said John Kristensen , the attorney representing Barbara Shepard , who filed the complaint .
It ’s still too early to predict the result of these lawsuits .
But this week ’s developments are fodder to those who hope the company will be on the hook for more than a slap on the wrist .

Toronto FC announced Tuesday that Spanish forward Miguel Angel Ferrer Martinez “ Mista ” has signed with the club .
Mista ’s contract will run through to the end of the 2010 MLS season .
As per team and league rules financial details were not released .
“ Mista adds a wealth of experience to our team , ” said manager , director of soccer Mo Johnston .
“ He ’s played at Real Madrid , Valencia CF , and Deportivo La Coruna which are all world class clubs .
Mista is a different type of player from what we have and we are excited to get him in the lineup after July 15 . ”
Mista , 31 , joins Toronto FC after spending his entire career in Spain playing almost entirely in The Primera Division ( La Liga ) .
The forward spent the 2008 - 2010 seasons with Deportivo La Coruna , where he was a teammate of current Toronto FC midfielder Julian de Guzman .
Mista ’s most successful seasons in La Liga came while he was a member of Valencia from 2001 - 2006 when he made 142 appearances , scoring 40 goals .
He won two Spanish league titles ( 2001 - 02 , 2003 - 04 ) during that time and was a member of the 2004 UEFA Cup winning squad where he scored the second goal in a 2 - 0 victory over Olympique de Marseille of France .
By winning that title Valencia went on to compete in the UEFA Super Cup where Valencia CF defeated FC Porto of Portugal 2- 0 .
Mista began his career under current Inter Milan boss and former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez at Real Madrid where he spent three seasons before moving on to Tenerife where he helped that club gain promotion into the first division .
Internationally , he made his debut for the Spain on March 26 , 2005 in a 3 - 0 friendly win over China and has two caps with the senior squad .
He also was a member of the Spanish U17 , U18 and U21 sides .
Due to International Transfer Rules , Mista will not be available for selection until after the July 15 transfer window opens .

Sometimes it is hard to know where politics ends and metaphysics begins : when , that is , the stakes of a political dispute concern not simply a clash of competing ideas and values but a clash about what is real and what is not , what can be said to exist on its own and what owes its existence to an other .
The seething anger that seems to be an indigenous aspect of the Tea Party movement arises , I think , at the very place where politics and metaphysics meet , where metaphysical sentiment becomes political belief .
More than their political ideas , it is the anger of Tea Party members that is already reshaping our political landscape .
As Jeff Zeleny reported last Monday in The Times , the vast majority of House Democrats are now avoiding holding town - hall - style forums — just as you might sidestep an enraged , jilted lover on a subway platform — out of fear of confronting the incubus of Tea Party rage that routed last summer ’s meetings .
This fear - driven avoidance is , Zeleny stated , bringing the time - honored tradition of the political meeting to the brink of extinction .
It would be comforting if a clear political diagnosis of the Tea Party movement were available — if we knew precisely what political events had inspired the fierce anger that pervades its meetings and rallies , what policy proposals its backers advocate , and , most obviously , what political ideals and values are orienting its members .
Of course , some things can be said , and have been said by commentators , under each of these headings .
The bailout of Wall Street , the provision of government assistance to homeowners who cannot afford to pay their mortgages , the pursuit of health care reform and , as a cumulative sign of untoward government expansion , the mounting budget deficit are all routinely cited as precipitating events .
I leave aside the election of a — “ foreign - born ” — African - American to the presidency .
When it comes to the Tea Party ’s concrete policy proposals , things get fuzzier and more contradictory : keep the government out of health care , but leave Medicare alone ; balance the budget , but do n’t raise taxes ; let individuals take care of themselves , but leave Social Security alone ; and , of course , the paradoxical demand not to support Wall Street , to let the hard - working producers of wealth get on with it without regulation and government stimulus , but also to make sure the banks can lend to small businesses and responsible homeowners in a stable but growing economy .
Erin Schell
There is a fierce logic to these views , as I will explain .
But first , a word about political ideals .
In a bracing and astringent essay in The New York Review of Books , pointedly titled “ The Tea Party Jacobins , ” Mark Lilla argued that the hodge - podge list of animosities Tea party supporters mention fail to cohere into a body of political grievances in the conventional sense : they lack the connecting thread of achieving political power .
It is not for the sake of acquiring political power that Tea Party activists demonstrate , rally and organize ; rather , Lilla argues , the appeal is to “ individual opinion , individual autonomy , and individual choice , all in the service of neutralizing , not using , political power . ”
He calls Tea Party activists a “ libertarian mob ” since they proclaim the belief “ that they can do everything themselves if they are only left alone . ”
Lilla cites as examples the growth in home schooling , and , amidst a mounting distrust in doctors and conventional medicine , growing numbers of parents refusing to have their children vaccinated , not to mention our resurgent passion for self - diagnosis , self - medication and home therapies .
The events precipitating the Tea Party movement demonstrated the depths of the absolute dependence of us all on government action .
What Lilla cannot account for , and what no other commentator I have read can explain , is the passionate anger of the Tea Party movement , or , the flip - side of that anger , the ease with which it succumbs to the most egregious of fear - mongering falsehoods .
What has gripped everyone ’s attention is the exorbitant character of the anger Tea Party members express .
Where do such anger and such passionate attachment to wildly fantastic beliefs come from ?
My hypothesis is that what all the events precipitating the Tea Party movement share is that they demonstrated , emphatically and unconditionally , the depths of the absolute dependence of us all on government action , and in so doing they undermined the deeply held fiction of individual autonomy and self - sufficiency that are intrinsic parts of Americans ’ collective self - understanding .
The implicit bargain that many Americans struck with the state institutions supporting modern life is that they would be politically acceptable only to the degree to which they remained invisible , and that for all intents and purposes each citizen could continue to believe that she was sovereign over her life ; she would , of course , pay taxes , use the roads and schools , receive Medicare and Social Security , but only so long as these could be perceived not as radical dependencies , but simply as the conditions for leading an autonomous and self - sufficient life .
Recent events have left that bargain in tatters .
But even this way of expressing the issue of dependence is too weak , too merely political ; after all , although recent events have revealed the breadth and depths of our dependencies on institutions and practices over which we have little or no control , not all of us have responded with such galvanizing anger and rage .
Tea Party anger is , at bottom , metaphysical , not political : what has been undone by the economic crisis is the belief that each individual is metaphysically self - sufficient , that one ’s very standing and being as a rational agent owes nothing to other individuals or institutions .
The opposing metaphysical claim , the one I take to be true , is that the very idea of the autonomous subject is an institution , an artifact created by the practices of modern life : the intimate family , the market economy , the liberal state .
Each of these social arrangements articulate and express the value and the authority of the individual ; they give to the individual a standing she would not have without them .
Rather than participating in arranged marriages , as modern subjects we follow our hearts , choose our beloved , decide for ourselves who may or may not have access to our bodies , and freely take vows promising fidelity and loyalty until death ( or divorce ) do us part .
There are lots of ways property can be held and distributed — as hysterical Tea Party incriminations of creeping socialism and communism remind us ; we moderns have opted for a system of private ownership in which we can acquire , use and dispose of property as we see fit , and even workers are presumed to be self - owning , selling their labor time and labor power to whom they wish ( when they can ) .
And as modern citizens we presume the government is answerable to us , governs only with our consent , our dependence on it a matter of detached , reflective endorsement ; and further , that we intrinsically possess a battery of moral rights that say we can be bound to no institution unless we possess the rights of “ voice and exit . ”
The great and inspiring metaphysical fantasy of independence and freedom is simply a fantasy of destruction .
If stated in enough detail , all these institutions and practices should be seen as together manufacturing , and even inventing , the idea of a sovereign individual who becomes , through them and by virtue of them , the ultimate source of authority .
The American version of these practices has , from the earliest days of the republic , made individuality autochthonous while suppressing to the point of disappearance the manifold ways that individuality is beholden to a complex and uniquely modern form of life .
Of course , if you are a libertarian or even a certain kind of liberal , you will object that these practices do not manufacture anything ; they simply give individuality its due .
The issue here is a central one in modern philosophy : is individual autonomy an irreducible metaphysical given or a social creation ?
Descartes famously argued that self or subject , the “ I think , ” was metaphysically basic , while Hegel argued that we only become self - determining agents through being recognized as such by others who we recognize in turn .
It is by recognizing one another as autonomous subjects through the institutions of family , civil society and the state that we become such subjects ; those practices are how we recognize and so bestow on one another the title and powers of being free individuals .
All the heavy lifting in Hegel ’s account turns on revealing how human subjectivity only emerges through intersubjective relations , and hence how practices of independence , of freedom and autonomy , are held in place and made possible by complementary structures of dependence .
At one point in his “ Philosophy of Right , ” Hegel suggests love or friendship as models of freedom through recognition .
In love I regard you as of such value and importance that I spontaneously set aside my egoistic desires and interests and align them with yours : your ends are my desires , I desire that you flourish , and when you flourish I do , too .
In love , I experience you not as a limit or restriction on my freedom , but as what makes it possible : I can only be truly free and so truly independent in being harmoniously joined with you ; we each recognize the other as endowing our life with meaning and value , with living freedom .
Hegel ’s phrase for this felicitous state is “ to be with oneself in the other . ”
Hegel ’s thesis is that all social life is structurally akin to the conditions of love and friendship ; we are all bound to one another as firmly as lovers are , with the terrible reminder that the ways of love are harsh , unpredictable and changeable .
And here is the source of the great anger : because you are the source of my being , when our love goes bad I am suddenly , absolutely dependent on someone for whom I no longer count and who I no longer know how to count ; I am exposed , vulnerable , needy , unanchored and without resource .
In fury , I lash out , I deny that you are my end and my satisfaction , in rage I claim that I can manage without you , that I can be a full person , free and self - moving , without you .
I am everything and you are nothing .
This is the rage and anger I hear in the Tea Party movement ; it is the sound of jilted lovers furious that the other — the anonymous blob called simply “ government ” — has suddenly let them down , suddenly made clear that they are dependent and limited beings , suddenly revealed them as vulnerable .
And just as in love , the one - sided reminder of dependence is experienced as an injury .
All the rhetoric of self - sufficiency , all the grand talk of wanting to be left alone is just the hollow insistence of the bereft lover that she can and will survive without her beloved .
However , in political life , unlike love , there are no second marriages ; we have only the one partner , and although we can rework our relationship , nothing can remove the actuality of dependence .
That is permanent .
In politics , the idea of divorce is the idea of revolution .
The Tea Party rhetoric of taking back the country is no accident : since they repudiate the conditions of dependency that have made their and our lives possible , they can only imagine freedom as a new beginning , starting from scratch .
About this imaginary , Mark Lilla was right : it corresponds to no political vision , no political reality .
The great and inspiring metaphysical fantasy of independence and freedom is simply a fantasy of destruction .
In truth , there is nothing that the Tea Party movement wants ; terrifyingly , it wants nothing .
Lilla calls the Tea Party “ Jacobins ” ; I would urge that they are nihilists .
To date , the Tea Party has committed only the minor , almost atmospheric violences of propagating falsehoods , calumny and the disruption of the occasions for political speech — the last already to great and distorting effect .
But if their nihilistic rage is deprived of interrupting political meetings as an outlet , where might it now go ?
With such rage driving the Tea Party , might we anticipate this atmospheric violence becoming actual violence , becoming what Hegel called , referring to the original Jacobins ’ fantasy of total freedom , “ a fury of destruction ” ?
There is indeed something not just disturbing , but frightening , in the anger of the Tea Party .

Here he warns us about the limitations of desire , while encouraging us to pay attention to what lasts and what benefits us longterm .
Greed is the foremost cause of a suffering - filled rebirth .
[ 1 ]
Giving is foremost among the six good practices .
[ 2 ]
Stinginess and greed prevent you from attaining the true path , while compassion and giving help protect you from falling into evil ways .
If a poor person comes to you begging for help , you should not be reluctant , even if you are in hard circumstances yourself .
You came into this world with nothing and you will leave it with nothing .
You should not cling to even your own possessions , so how can you think about other ’s belongings ?
When this body dies , what will you take with you ?
The only thing that will follow you is the karma that you have made .
If you cultivate your mind for three days , it can become a treasure that lasts for a thousand years .
However , the accumulated possessions of a hundred years of desire will all be reduced to dust in the span of a few hours .
Where does the suffering of the three evil rebirths come from ?
From greed and desire accumulated over many lifetimes .
Contenting myself with the Buddha ’s robe and bowl ,

Few members of the Tea Party have endorsed Rand Paul ’s misgivings about the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 , but a surprising number are calling for the repeal of an older piece of transformative legislation : the 17th Amendment .
If you do n’t have the Constitution on your smartphone , that ’s the one adopted in 1913 that provides for direct popular election of United States senators .
Allowing Americans to choose their own senators seems so obvious that it is hard to remember that the nation ’s founders did n’t really trust voters with the job .
The people were given the right to elect House members .
But senators were supposed to be a check on popular rowdiness and factionalism .
They were appointed by state legislatures , filled with men of property and stature .
A modern appreciation of democracy  not to mention a clear - eyed appraisal of today ’s dysfunctional state legislatures  should make the idea unthinkable .
But many Tea Party members and their political candidates are thinking it anyway , convinced that returning to the pre-17th Amendment system would reduce the power of the federal government and enhance state rights .
Senate candidates have to raise so much money to run that they become beholden to special interests , party members say .
They argue that state legislators would not be as compromised and would choose senators who truly put their state ’s needs first .
The piping plovers already are flying toward peril .
The endangered birds are among the first of millions that will migrate this fall to the Gulf of Mexico — and the oil leak that could kill them .
Some birds , including the common loon and lesser scaup , spend winters along the Gulf Coast .
Others , such as the blue - winged teal , use the Gulf as a staging area where they stock up on food before flying to Latin America .
" There are millions of birds at risk , " says Ken Rosenberg , conservation science director at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology .
" It 's safe to say thousands will die . "
He fears the BP oil spill , which began April 20 , " could erupt into a much bigger disaster as oil continues to come to the surface . "
Hundreds of birds have died , and some drawn to the Gulf by migratory instincts will be affected starting this month , says Paul Schmidt , assistant director for migratory birds at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
He says the agency 's " biggest concern is the long - term degradation of the habitat . "
Oil can kill plants and other food sources on beaches and in tidal and marshy areas , making them inhospitable for years , Schmidt says .
Migrating birds , like those that live year - round near the Gulf of Mexico , can introduce oil into their systems by preening oil - soaked feathers , says Greg Butcher , bird conservation director for the National Audubon Society .
" If they get oil on their feathers , they lose their ability to regulate their temperature .
If they swallow oil , they 're going to get sick . "
Some birds that ingest oil might lose their ability to reproduce .
Scientists say hundreds of species could be affected by the spill : •
The sparrow - size piping plover , an endangered species , will show up on Gulf Coast beaches this month .
They breed on the Atlantic Coast , the Northern Great Plains and the Great Lakes , and they winter in the Gulf of Mexico , Cuba and the Bahamas .
•
Water birds such as terns and black skimmers are affected , and more will arrive this fall .
They feed in open water , putting them at risk of eating fish contaminated with oil .
•
Blue - winged teal , gadwall , northern pintails and other " dabbling " ducks will arrive in September and October .
Most use marshes as habitats , so there are untouched areas for them — unless a hurricane stirs up the oil and pushes it into those areas .
•
Diving ducks such as redheads eat submerged vegetation that might be inundated with oil , and scaup eat surf clams that are easily contaminated with oil .
•
Shorebirds such as red knot — an endangered species candidate — live on beaches and will be affected by oil washing ashore .
Other species that feed on tidal flats , including the short - billed dowitcher , could be harmed if oil moves inland .
• Songbirds , including the Baltimore oriole , might gather in oiled vegetation along the coast .
It 's almost impossible to steer migrating birds away from instinctive destinations .
" Birds are pretty hard - wired to their habitat , " Schmidt says .
If there 's a lot of human activity in their traditional locations — boats , helicopters or airplanes — they will seek quieter areas nearby , he says , but oiled water or vegetation wo n't prevent them from landing .
Scaring birds away with loud noises and using tarp to prevent them from landing in oily areas would n't be effective because the spill affects such a large swath of the coast , Schmidt says .
Even so , conservationists are doing what they can to save birds .
The Natural Resources Conservation Service , part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture , is paying landowners in eight states $ 20 million to idle farmland and restore wetland to create habitats for migrating birds .
Butcher says talks underway about creating barrier islands and marshes are key to restoring bird populations .
The Aubudon Society is training volunteers to monitor bird populations and habitat conditions .
Its Christmas bird count will provide an early warning about what species are in trouble because of the spill .
The most effective way to protect birds is to clean affected beaches , Butcher says .
" They 're putting out a tremendous effort , but you can't keep all the beaches clean all the time . "
Tom Moorman , director of conservation planning for Ducks Unlimited 's southern region , says 9.2 million ducks and geese winter in Louisiana .
Most settle in marshes where salt and fresh water merge , and those areas are protected from oil for now by beaches and salt water , he says .
He 's worried about the fates of shorebirds that use beach habitats , and he 's concerned about what might happen next .
If the leak is n't shut off , Moorman says , 1 million diving ducks in the open waters of the Gulf could get hit by an oil slick , leading to " a pretty big mortality event . "
If BP does n't contain the spill soon , Rosenberg says , the outlook for birds could worsen .
If the oil moves into the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream , he says , " a number of other endangered seabirds could be affected . "
And if oil expands along the Texas coast , he says , whooping cranes that arrive there in late September " could be threatened . "
Butcher says the spill 's effects on birds will be felt for years .
It is changing the food supply at the bottom of the Gulf in ways scientists do n't understand yet , he says , and could result in smaller bird populations and , eventually , changes in migratory patterns .
" Oil and life , " he says , " do n't mix . "

Dr. Jeanne Stolzer
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , commonly known as “ ADHD , ” has become widely - accepted as a serious mental disorder — mostly afflicting young males .
At the very least , the experts say , ADHD disrupts the learning processes , and at worst , produces violent and anti-social behavior .
However , is ADHD , indeed , the serious malady it is said to be , requiring equally serious and extensive drug therapy ?
Or , as questions Dr. Jeanne Stolzer , associate professor of family studies , is it more likely merely a manifestation of male patterned hominid evolution .
Challenging widely held assumptions is an important part of what investigators do , especially on important topics like childhood development .
Dr. Stolzer , a member of the advisory board for the International Center for the Study of Psychiatry and Psychology , has published her work on three continents .
She is also the sole author of the ADHD entry in The Encyclopedia of the Life Course and Human Development ( 2009 ) .
Most recently , she has questioned conclusions of previous research on ADHD in an article titled “ Boys and the American Education System : A Biocultural review of the Literature , ” ( Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry ; An International Journal of Critical Inquiry , November 2008 ) .
Here , as well as in her previous presentations , Dr. Stolzer challenges her professional colleagues , and even the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) , on the reliability and validity of their findings and official statements about ADHD .
Dr. Stolzer maintains that in the 1950s , ADHD did not exist .
( “ The ADHD Epidemic In America , ” Human Psychology and Psychiatry , Volume 9 , Number 2 , 2007 ) .
In 1970 , 2,000 American children were diagnosed as “ hyperactive , ” and the standard method of treatment was behavior modification .
By 2003 , six million American children had been diagnosed with a “ brain disorder ” called ADHD , and the vast majority of these children have been prescribed psychotropic medications in order to control their disruptive behavior ( Stolzer 2005 , p. 37 ) .
Subsequently , she ’s asking the medical field and society at large : “ Do millions of American children actually suffer from unprecedented brain disorders ?
And , if so , what could have altered the developing brains of our children to such an extent that millions of American children are diagnosed with “ disorders of the brain ” when only a generation ago this epidemic was unheard of ?
Moreover , how have we successfully convinced academicians , physicians , teachers and parents across this country that what was once considered typical , normal and desirable boy behavior is now the result of an atypical brain ?
According to Dr. Stolzer , after a decade of research on the issue , the answers to these inquiries are partly based on the phenomenon of macrosystemic functioning — that which consists of overarching patterns found in a given culture , like ideologies , world views and belief systems .
Dr. Stolzer says that America ’s macrosystem , on the subject of ADHD , has been greatly altered over the last generation .
“ What were once regarded as normal - range child behaviors are now defined as ‘ disorders of the brain , ’ ” she said .
She remembers laughing , nearly 30 years ago , at how the little boys in her preschool class climbed fences , yelled at the top of their lungs and battled out mock wars on the merry - go - round , while across the playground , most of the little girls were dialoguing , conducting interpersonal communication and acting out dramatic play .
She said that she took joy in observing the freedom of kids being kids while at the same time asking herself , “ What would be the motivating force behind our trying to make our children into passive , sedentary robots ? ”
During this time of Dr. Stolzer ’s foundational observations , the era of the SuperMom was also building .
“ Our country ’s children were going to day - care from six - weeks - old , attending overcrowded classrooms and waiting at home for their tired parents to get home from work , ” she said .
“ Working moms were , understandably , physically , emotionally and psychologically , drained , and , thus , vulnerable and much more likely to accept labels about their child to justify their exasperation with their child ’s energetic behavior . ”
Now , as we as a society begin to acknowledge these histories and changes , Dr. Stolzer wholeheartedly suggests that “ instead of it being the “ disordered child ” we medicate with a chemical that changes the neurological structure of the brain , perhaps we need to look at the disordered world we have created for our children in 21st century America . ”
In “ ADHD in America : A Bioecological Analysis , ” ( Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry , Volume 7 , Number 1 , Spring 2005 ) , Dr. Stolzer suggests that perhaps relationship changes occurring within the microsystem — defined as a pattern of activities , roles and interpersonal relationships experienced by the developing person in a given face - to - face setting with particular physical and material features — have made parents more willing to accept the “ myth ” of ADHD .
As a mother , Dr. Stolzer entertained the premises of ADHD for a time , too .
Like so many parents , she remembered the experiment where child psychologists observed a random group of boys and girls in a room full of all kinds of toys , from trucks to baby dolls .
With no outside influence , the majority of boys , if not all , went straight to the wooden guns and plastic battalions of soldier figures , while the girls proceeded to plan parties with the tea sets and Barbie dolls .
“ When I tried to ‘ socialize ’ my son , in a similar manner as this famous experiment , ” Dr. Stolzer said , “ he still insisted on being a boy . ”
If Dr. Stolzer offered her son a doll to play with , for instance , he was enthusiastic - enough about the idea ; it ’s just that he was inspired to play with it by wielding it around like a sword in aggressive , combative - like play .
For Dr. Stolzer , the kicker in this discovery was her realization that what she means by “ insisting on being a boy ” seemed to parallel the behavior the APA ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , DSM - IV ) , lists as the symptoms of the still - relatively - new disorder , ADHD .
“ These are not symptoms , ” Dr. Stolzer said .
“ These are behaviors — normal behaviors that have been recorded in young males across cultures , across time and across mammalian species .
“ The prefrontal lobes are n’t fully developed until the early 20s in males .
Testosterone during puberty increases 18 - fold .
Couple these facts with an underdeveloped brain and the surge of hormones , and what you have is lack of impulsivity control , a high activity level and defiant behavior .
Furthermore , ” she said , “ behaviors are behaviors , not a disease .
This ‘ affliction ’ is called boyhood . ” ( Stolzer 2005 , p. 78 )
Dr. Stolzer argues that although many American medical professionals insist that ADHD is neurologically induced , the fact of the matter is that there are no physiological , cognitive or metabolic markers that would indicate the presence of ADHD .
Rather , “ ADHD is diagnosed using a checklist of behaviors indicated on a questionnaire , usually filled out by teachers or parents . ”
( Stolzer , 2007 , p. 39 )
Eighty percent of the Ritalin prescriptions issued to the 8 - to - 10 million American children diagnosed with ADHD are given to American boys .
Dr. Stolzer writes :
“ It has been hypothesized that the behavior of boys has remained relatively constant over evolutionary time ; what appears to have changed is a ) America ’s perception of those unique and historically valued evolutionary behaviors and b) Americans ’ willingness to unconditionally accept the newly formed disordered brain hypothesis . ”
( Stolzer , 2007 , p. 42 )
“ Interestingly , ” Dr. Stolzer said , “ ADHD rates in child populations vary considerably from school to school ; private schools that , incidentally , do not benefit economically from labeling students tend to have much lower rates of ADHD in their populations . ” ( Stolzer 2005 , p. 70 ) .
Well - aware of the polemic tone in her experiential research , Dr. Stolzer said she fears that because of the financial incentive involved , ADHD diagnoses will continue to skyrocket in the U.S .
Once the ADHD label is affixed , Dr. Stolzer said , children are no longer viewed as normal .
“ And labels do n’t go away , ” she said , observing that “ all school shooters have been therapeutic users of psychotropic medications .
The manufacturer clearly states that psychotropic drugs can cause homicidal and suicidal ideation and violent psychotic episodes . ”
The fact of the matter , Dr. Stolzer maintains , is that professionals have no idea of the long term outcome of taking substances like Ritalin for a condition like ADHD .
The ADHD model , she said , does not take into account the complexities associated with growing up in modern - day America , nor does it address America ’s unique and bioevolutionary heritage .
“ Hypothetically speaking , ” she said , “ it is a possibility that millions of American boys suffer from a neurological condition known as ADHD .
Scientifically speaking , it is much more rational to assume that ADHD - type behavior is evolutionarily adaptive , has been perfected over millions of years , and has ensured the survival of the human species . ”
( Stolzer 2007 , pp. 42 - 43 )
She concludes , “ Simply put ?
I do n’t think ADHD is anything that ca n’t be ‘ cured ’ by a loving hand , logical consequences , time and attention , large amounts of rigorous outdoor play and the understanding that boys do not now , nor have they ever , followed the script set forth by their female cohorts . ”
Dr. Stolzer is now looking for possible alternatives to Ritalin that American ’s , as a society , might consider .
She is also analyzing the implications of restructuring some of the societal approaches .
For instance , she encourages more homeschooling and advocates testing for the possibility of ADHD in candidates from a neurological perspective rather than a behavioral one .
And , finally , she promotes continuing education of the public about evolutionarily - based gender differences .
“ We must demand that unbiased empirical scientific data are guiding us .
After all , ” she said , “ what is research if it is not to change something that you care about , for the better ?
Is n’t that why we are all here on a campus — the arena for free and boundless thought ? ”
Dr. Stolzer said that authentic research–which , by her definition is , among other things , research not funded by pharmaceutical companies –must be the goal .
( Stolzer 2007 , pp. 40 - 41 and Stolzer 2005 , p. 72 )
If there ever is a time when she doubts the worth of her scholarship , she reminds herself of the volumes taught to her one day in church by a wise old lady .
A little boy in the next pew was growing restless , after sitting quietly for a long span .
“ The dear old lady leaned into me and whispered , ‘ Honey , that little one has ants in his pants .
He needs to get out and play ! ’ ”
“ Ah yes , ” Dr. Stolzer thought , “ boys will be boys . ”
Ethnic violence kills more than 100 in Kyrgyzstan Reuters
Thousands of Uzbeks fleeing southern Kyrgyzstan massed at the border today , as the deadliest ethnic violence in decades left entire city blocks razed to the ground and scores of people dead .
The official death toll from the clashes that began last week reached 117 , with 1,500 injured , the health ministry of the beleaguered former Soviet country , which hosts US and Russian military bases , announced .
However , an Uzbek leader claimed that 200 Uzbeks have already been buried , and the International Committee of the Red Cross has said its delegates witnessed about 100 bodies being buried in just one cemetery .
Jallahitdin Jalilatdinov , who heads the Uzbek National Centre , said that at least 100,000 had fled for the border and were awaiting entry into Uzbekistan .
An Associated Press reporter saw at least hundreds of Uzbek refugees stuck at a border crossing near Jalal - Abad in a no-man 's land between the boundaries .
The interim government , which took over after Kurmanbek Bakiyev was ousted by a public revolt in April , has been unable to stop the violence and accused Bakiyev 's family of instigating it .
Uzbeks have backed the interim government , while many Kyrgyz in the south have supported the toppled president .
New fires raged today across
Osh , the second - largest city , which is on the border with Uzbekistan .
There was no gas or electricity and food and water in the city was becoming scarce as armed looters smashed stores , stealing anything from televisions to food .
No police could be seen on the streets , though authorities insisted some of the improvised checkpoints dotted around the city of 250,000 were controlled .
Cars stolen from ethnic
Uzbeks raced around the city , most crowded with young Kyrgyz people wielding sharpened sticks , axes and metal rods .
In some parts of Osh , Kyrgyz residents protected homes housing both Kyrgyz and Uzbek people .
In Jalal - Abad , about 25 miles away , armed Kyrgyz people massed in the city 's central square .
Their stated goal was to travel to the nearby Uzbek settlement of Suzak in search of an Uzbek community leader they blame for starting the trouble .
The US , Russia and the head of the United Nations all expressed alarm over the scale of the violence and discussed how to help the refugees .
Uzbeks make up 15 % of Kyrgyzstan 's 5 million people , but in the south their numbers rival ethnic Kyrgyz .
" Gunfire on the streets is continuing , " Jalil Saparov , a journalist in Jalal - Abad , told the news website 24.kg .
" There are no patrols , no government forces , just continuous shooting .
" It 's clear those forces and means at the disposal of the regional authorities are completely inadequate . "
Much of Osh has been destroyed , with entire Uzbek neighbourhoods razed .
Triumphant crowds of Kyrgyz men took to the streets , while the few remaining Uzbeks barricaded themselves in their homes .
Witnesses said bodies lay among the rubble , and were starting to smell .
Most of the victims appeared to be Uzbek .
At least one Pakistani student in Osh was killed during the rioting , and 15 others taken hostage , Pakistan 's foreign ministry said .
There are fears among other central Asian nations that the ethnic slaughter could spread .
It will also concern the US , which operates a military base near the capital , Bishkek , supplying troops in Afghanistan .
The US embassy in Kyrgyzstan deplored the ongoing violence and called for the " immediate restoration of order and a respect for rule of law " .
On Saturday , Interim President Roza Otunbayeva appealed to the Kremlin to send troops to restore order .
Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , refused , saying the rioting was an " internal conflict " , though he did send a battalion of paratroopers with the sole responsibility of reinforcing security at Russia 's airbase in Kant , in the north of the country .
Some of the tax breaks date back nearly a century , when they were intended to encourage exploration in an era of rudimentary technology , when costly investments frequently produced only dry holes .
Because of one lingering provision from the Tariff Act of 1913 , many small and midsize oil companies based in the United States can claim deductions for the lost value of tapped oil fields far beyond the amount the companies actually paid for the oil rights .
Other tax breaks were born of international politics .
In an attempt to deter Soviet influence in the Middle East in the 1950s , the State Department backed a Saudi Arabian accounting maneuver that reclassified the royalties charged by foreign governments to American oil drillers .
Saudi Arabia and others began to treat some of the royalties as taxes , which entitled the companies to subtract those payments from their American tax bills .
Despite repeated attempts to forbid this accounting practice , companies continue to deduct the payments .
The Treasury Department estimates that it will cost $ 8.2 billion over the next decade .
Over the last 10 years , oil companies have also been aggressive in using foreign tax havens .
Many rigs , like Deepwater Horizon , are registered in Panama or in the Marshall Islands , where they are subject to lower taxes and less stringent safety and staff regulations .
American producers have also aggressively exploited the tax code by opening small offices in low - tax countries .
A recent study by Martin A. Sullivan , an economist for the trade publication Tax Analysts , found that the five oil drilling companies that had undergone these “ corporate inversions ” had saved themselves a total of $ 4 billion in taxes since 1999 .
Transocean  which has approximately 18,000 employees worldwide , including 1,300 in Houston and about a dozen in Zug , Switzerland  has saved $ 1.8 billion in taxes since moving overseas in 1999 , the study found .
Transocean said it had paid more than $ 300 million in taxes so far for 2009 , and that its move reflected its global scope , with only 15 of its 139 rigs located in the United States .
“ Transocean is truly a global company , ” it said in a statement .
Despite the public anger at the gulf spill , it is far from certain that Congress will eliminate the tax breaks .
As recently as 2005 , when windfall profits for energy companies prompted even President George W. Bush  a former Texas oilman himself  to publicly call for an end to incentives , the energy bill he and Congress enacted still included $ 2.6 billion in oil subsidies .
In 2007 , after Democrats took control of Congress , a move to end the tax breaks failed .
Mr. Menendez said he believed the Gulf spill was devastating enough to spur Congress into action .
But one notable omission in his bill shows the vast economic reach of the industry .
While the legislation would cut many incentives over the next decade , it would not touch the tax breaks for oil refineries , many of which have operations and employees in his home state , New Jersey .
Mr. Menendez ’s aides said the senator thought it was legitimate to allow refineries to continue claiming a manufacturing tax credit that he wants to eliminate for drillers because refining is a manufacturing business and because refineries do not benefit from high oil prices .
Mr. Menendez did not consult with New Jersey refineries when writing the bill , his aides said .

On the MyDroidWorld forums , site founder p3droid has recently shared some new and disheartening information about the Droid X .
While we reported that the Droid X is locked down with an encrypted bootloader , it now seems Motorola has taken an extra step to ensure no one starts tinkering under the hood .
In the event that the bootloader , kernel , or ROM are noticeably compromised , your Droid X will try to brick itself .
How does it work ?
While p3droid ’s technical explanation will be far more informative than my brief summary , the technology at work here is known as eFuse .
It has a simple purpose : to check the version of the bootloader , kernel , and ROM of your phone against those which eFuse is programmed to look for .
If the check fails , eFuse corrupts your bootloader , rendering your phone completely useless ( well , it might make a good paperweight ) .
To fix it , you must take your phone to a Verizon store , and presumably they would have to ship it to a Motorola facility where the necessary hardware exists to resuscitate your device .
This has major ramifications for those who would attempt to find a way to unlock the Droid X ; one wrong move could destroy hours , days , or weeks of effort .
It would also be likely that Verizon ( or Motorola ) would also charge for this “ service , ” since you are likely aware that trying to unlock the phone will void your warranty .
Below , Motorola ’s statement about the Droid X’s security “ features ” :
“ Securing the software on our handsets , thereby preventing a non-Motorola ROM image from being loaded , has been our common practice for many years .
This practice is driven by a number of different business factors .
When we do deviate from our normal practice , such as we did with the DROID , there is a specific business reason for doing so .
We understand this can result in some confusion , and apologize for any frustration . ”

“ Flawless ” does n’t sound like something that fits into the definition of “ real ” anything .
Dove is clearly looking for women who are beautiful ( the campaign is called Real Beauty , after all ) , but the campaign would seem exempt from this kind of casting process .
It ’s great that they want to shoot women who are n’t stick figures , but it ’s not quite so thrilling that they ’re sending a negative message about scars , which most people can’t help having anyway .
“ Real Beauty ” previously came under scrutiny when expert retoucher Pascal Dangin told The New Yorker in 2008 that he extensively retouched the campaign .
He later took back the statement , clarifying that he was referring to Dove ’s “ Pro - Age ” campaign .
Unilever said that the retouching Dangin did on the “ Real Beauty ” ads did not include any alterations to the non-models ’ figures , but only color correction and dust removal , declining to get into details about what exactly that process entails .
So after Dove casts the best version of real they can find , the new campaign images may be retouched , but perhaps not extensively enough to remove scars and blemishes and other real things real people have .
Craigslist Ad Hints That Dove Wants “ Real Women ” , But Only If They ’re Flawless [ Jezebel ]
Image caption Stephen Fry praised US television
Broadcaster Stephen Fry has said it is " shocking " how " infantilised " adult programmes have become on British TV .
" I 'm not saying TV should be pompous and academic , but it should surprise and astonish , " he said .
The QI host said BBC shows Merlin and Doctor Who were " wonderfully written " but " not for adults " .
Doctor
Who writer Steven Moffat defended the show , saying it was " very high quality " and aimed at a family audience of both adults and children .
Fry , who is both a comedian and a writer , made his comments at the annual Bafta Television Lecture in London on Tuesday night .
He said : " The only drama the BBC will boast about are Merlin and Doctor Who , which are fine but they 're children 's programmes .
They 're not for adults .
" And they 're very good children 's programmes , do n't get me wrong , they 're wonderfully written ... but they are not for adults .
" They are like a chicken nugget .
Every now and again we all like it .
Every now and again . "
He added : " If you are an adult you want something surprising , savoury , sharp , unusual , cosmopolitan , alien , challenging , complex , ambiguous , possibly even slightly disturbing and wrong , " he said .
It 's a sad indictment when arguably the most grown - up programme being shown mid-evening is The Simpsons teedoff , Have Your Say Send us your comments
" You want to try those things , because that 's what being adult means .
" It 's children 's television , it 's entirely infantilised .
It 's not grown up . "
Asked about Fry 's comments , Moffat said Fry was a big Doctor Who fan and joked he was trying to sound " grown up " .
He said of Doctor Who : " It was designed specifically to be a family programme , that 's what it 's for .
" It 's the junction between the children 's programmes and the adults ' programmes .
" It 's the one that everybody sits and watches .
So it is for adults , it is for children , it 's a rather brilliant idea - why do n't we make a television programme that everybody wants to watch , very , very specifically . "
Referring to Fry 's mention of chicken nuggets , Moffat said : " This is very , very high end , a very high quality show .
There is absolutely no comparison to junk food at all and he knows it .
" That 's Twitter he 's thinking about . "
Moffat , speaking on Wednesday at a screening of the first part of the grand finale of this series of Doctor Who , said : " I love Stephen and Stephen loves Doctor Who . "
In his speech , Fry praised US TV , which he said provided " surprise and shock and adulthood " .
He also said BBC 's comedy shows such as Gavin and Stacey and Little Britain were " very successful " , also " unbelievably Balkanised " .
" They are set into a particular demographic .
This is what I mean by television not being the nation 's fireplace .
It 's just all parcelled and I do n't know that there 's a solution to it , " he added .
“ Why Did You Leave Your Last Job ? ” “ Why did you leave your last job ? ”
That question comes up during almost every interview , and on most job applications .
Explaining why you left your last job – or for that matter , pretty much every job listed on your résumé – is something that certainly requires some thought .
The answer you give must be both truthful and somehow palatable .
It should ideally be easily understood and logical , and yet at the same time not cast you in a negative light to your potential future employer .
If you do not provide an explanation for why you left a job ( particularly if it was a short stint ) the person screening it could read it as a negative : you might be a job - hopping flight risk … you seemingly can’t hold down a job … perhaps you do n’t get along with others well … there may have been performance issues that got you fired – the imagination creates all kinds of possible scenarios !
There may be perfectly acceptable reasons for why you left each job on your resume .
I would advise briefly listing those reasons right next to the dates on your résumé to avoid this obvious red flag .
The idea here is to be pro-active , and answer questions about why you left each job before those questions are even asked .
It ’s a simple thing , and yet very few people do it .
You do n’t need to go into long - winded or detailed explanations .
All you need is a brief phrase , in parenthesis , following the dates of each short - lived position .
For example : “ Laid Off Due to Economic Circumstances ” … or “ Position Eliminated Due to Company Restructuring ” … or “ Company Went Out of Business , ” etc .
What this does is provide the screener with a perfectly valid explanation for why you left each job , and eliminates the possibility that they will imagine something much worse – i.e. , that you were fired “ for cause ” ( meaning your actions caused you to be fired ) or poor performance , etc .
Of course , if you actually were fired “ for cause ” … well , that ’s another story !
Naturally , if it was your decision to leave a company and move on to another job elsewhere – it ’s usually pretty easy to say something like : “ Left for a better opportunity . ”
The problem arises when leaving was not your idea .
If you were let go “ for cause ” it ’s the most difficult scenario to explain going forward .
You need to tread carefully .
On the other hand , if you lost a job due to circumstances beyond your control ( e.g. company - wide layoffs , poor economic conditions , etc. ) then using the right euphemism can often satisfy an interviewer ’s questions and explain why you left , and why there may be gaps between jobs .
Below is a list of miscellaneous terms and phrases I ’ve heard over the years that one might use to explain why you left a job .
Many of these phrases can be used in combination with each other .
They are ordered from the most commonly used and professional - sounding , down to the most ridiculous , ill - advised and just plain funny .
( Warning :
Use the ones near the bottom of this list at your own risk ! )

What Recruiters Say vs. What Job -Seekers
Hear I recently came across an interesting InfoGraphic published by an organization called MedReps — a job site geared towards Medical Sales jobs .
While that site focuses on a specific industry niche , the InfoGraphic is quite universal in its message to job - seekers of all types .
Basically , it uses a number of well documented statistics ( annotated at the bottom ) to illustrate the typical gap between what recruiters say to job - seekers , and how those things are often misinterpreted by job - seekers who “ hear what they want to hear . ”
Many of the messages shown in this InfoGraphic are great pieces of solid advice on how to best work with recruiters .
[ Read “ The Real Truth About Working with Recruiters ” for more info on this topic . ]
Among the many messages contained in this InfoGraphic that I think are especially important for all job - seekers :
► Constantly continue your personal networking activities in addition to working with recruiters .
► Only apply to jobs that you are truly qualified for — do n’t try to stretch your qualifications or mislead recruiters with exaggerated information .
► Try to clarify the hiring timetables for any positions you discuss , and the expectations for follow - up communications with recruiters you speak with .
► Keep in touch with any recruiters you are working with , but do n’t over do it .
Remember : recruiters do n’t find Jobs for People … they find People for Jobs — a very different concept !
So here it is .

The Dirty Truth About Misleading Unemployment Statistics ( This article was updated in December 2018 ) It seems like everywhere you look these days , there are headlines screaming with unemployment numbers .
Statistics purporting to show how many people are working or not working are thought to be an indicator of the general health of our economy .
Now we all know that news organizations have a natural tendency to sensationalize things to gain ratings .
They tout numbers designed to show us that things are either getting better or getting worse , depending on what flavor of news you choose to follow .
Viewers of FOX
News will likely get a very different picture of things than viewers of CNBC or CNN .
Lately I ’ve been seeing headlines with statements like “ Unemployment Rates Dropping , ” and “ Applications for Jobless Benefits Falling ” and “ Employers Adding New Jobs . ”
The government loves to brag about their wonderful accomplishments .
Presidents love to claim that things are better than they used to be , and take credit for improving our lives during their time in office .
But are those statements and statistics meaningful and accurate ?
Do they tell the whole story ?
Statistics are an interesting thing .
It ’s been said that you can prove or disprove just about anything with statistics depending on what your sample is , how you count things , and how you interpret the results .
At the height of the most recent recession — around the end of 2009 — the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the national unemployment rate to be around 10 % .
Today , that number is around 3.7 % .
That sure sounds like things have gotten better , right ?
But here ’s the dirty truth about those numbers : they are only counting a small percentage of the actual potential workforce population .
They are NOT counting people who are “ underemployed ” — i.e. people who have taken low - paying jobs well below their experience level just to pay their bills .
They are NOT counting people who have taken part - time jobs — in some cases just a few hours a week , and usually without any benefits .
And most importantly , they are NOT counting people who have been out of work for so long that they ’ve become discouraged and have “ given up ” looking for a job altogether .
For anyone in those last categories , these government statistics are a cruel joke , indeed !
Check out this 2 - minute video cartoon that explains how the government arrives at their unemployment statistics .
It ’s both hilarious and depressing at the same time :
So , what is the “ truth ” about the current unemployment picture ?
Again , it depends on how you count things … but here ’s an interesting tidbit I came across : According to the Gallup organization , 30 million Americans are either out of work or severely underemployed .
Gallup defines a “ good job ” as one that is at least 30 hours or more per week with a company that provides a regular paycheck .
Using that definition , they ’ve recently determined that in the U.S. , only 44 % of adults age 18 and over have “ good jobs . ”
They go on to say that in order to restore America ’s middle class , the target for this should be at least 50 % , with 10 million new good jobs .
Elsewhere , AP reported that U.S. employers added 223,000 jobs , but despite widespread job growth , overall there is a shrinking workforce .
As as recruiter , I can certainly attest to the fact that in almost every specialized job category , there are more job openings than there are qualified candidates !
I keep hearing the term “ Talent War . ”
Among my peers in the staffing industry , there is a widespread feeling that qualified talent is getting harder and harder to find in almost every category .
One of the most obvious explanations for this growing talent shortage is simple demographics .
In 2011 , the oldest of the Baby Boomers ( people born between 1946 and 1964 ) started turning 65 — the traditional retirement age .
Of course more and more people now expect to keep working past the age of 65 … but sooner or later just about everyone reaches an age where full - time work is no longer a desirable option .
We are now seeing the beginning of a mass retirement movement unprecedented in American history – a radical demographic shift in the makeup of our work force .
All told , there are about 76 million people in that Boomer generation who will , over the next couple of decades , drop out of the work force .
By contrast , there are only about 51 million “ Generation X’ers ” ( people born between 1965 and 1976 ) who could potentially step into all those higher level jobs that the Boomers are retiring from .
That leaves a huge talent deficit : at least 25 million fewer potential experienced workers !!!
OK — so what does this all mean to the average job - seeker ?
Honestly , not much .
It ’s really mostly just background noise .
For anyone in job - seeking mode , my advice is to take most of what you see and hear in the news with a grain of salt and just concentrate on the basics of job - seeking strategies as expounded in the numerous articles here in Recruiter Musings .
Work on your résumé , work on your elevator pitch , work on your interview presentation , and most importantly , concentrate on the activities that will get you in front of actual decision - makers at your target companies : “ Networking , Networking , Networking ! ”

The Truth About Lying On Résumés
When I was just starting my career as a recruiter , a well - known trainer at my firm would often utter a phrase that used to bother me a lot .
He ’d say : “ All candidates lie on their résumés . ”
( It reminded me of Hugh Laurie on the TV show House M.D. and his famous pronouncement : “ Everybody lies … the only variable is about what . ” )
Maybe I ’m just naive — or perhaps I ’m just a trusting person by nature — but I ’d like to believe that most people are honest and ethical , and would not intentionally lie or deceive me with false information on their résumés .
Still , I know that sometimes people exaggerate , omit things , or stretch the truth here and there to inflate their profiles .
Over the years I ’ve worked with a multitude of job - seekers on how to improve their résumés .
While I would NEVER encourage anyone to lie or fabricate anything , I do often tell people that unlike a job application , a résumé is not a legal document and there is no requirement that it must contain a complete history of everything you ’ve ever done .
It should be truthful … but it ’s up to each person to decide what to include or not include .
For example , I sometimes tell people to not include the months in the dates listed next to each job – instead , showing them only as a range of years .
That can often avoid the red flag of seeing brief periods of unemployment between jobs .
( See example . )
I ’ve also advised people that it ’s OK to leave off jobs in their work history ( especially if they were short - lived ) that were unrelated to their main industry or niche .
But those omissions are very different than outright lying , or making claims about positions you ’ve held or degrees you ’ve earned that are simply not true .
The following is a fascinating InfoGraphic I found called “ The Truth About Lying on Résumés . ”
The statistics quoted below were compiled from surveys conducted in 2012 by Accu - Screen ( a background checking company , ) ADP ( a Payroll Services company ) and The Society of Human Resource Managers .
I have no way of knowing if this is a truly accurate picture of today ’s truthfulness ( or lack thereof ) of the multitudes of résumés I review every week … but I can only hope that the ones I see are more honest than this suggests …
( You can click on the image below to open a full - sized version in a new window .
Then click it again in the second window that opens to zoom in . )
Now one would think that in today ’s Social Media - saturated world , and especially with the advent of Linked In , false claims on résumés would be a rare occurrence .
After all , everyone ’s past employers and co-workers can now easily view everyone else ’s profiles .
If someone was less than truthful about their work history , they would be immediately exposed … right ?
Well , perhaps not .
Unless someone is called as a reference , or has a particular axe to grind , most people probably would n’t take the time to blow the whistle on someone else even if they see blatantly false information on their online profiles .
Of course , anyone in a highly public position is much more vulnerable than the average worker .
Certainly , there have been many examples over the years of famous people who have been caught lying on their résumés in order to get jobs .
Famous Résumé Liars : ► Vice President Joe Biden first ran for president in 1988 , but during that campaign it was discovered that he lied about attending law school on a full scholarship ( he had only a partial scholarship ) and about graduating in the top half of his class ( he was 76th out of 85 . )
When the truth came out , Biden had to abandon his presidential bid .
Apparently voters in 2008 and 2012 had either not heard of that earlier history of lying — or did n’t care ! ►
In 2012 , Scott Thompson , CEO of Yahoo ! , was fired after only 5 months on the job when it was discovered that he had lied on his résumé .
He had stated that he earned degrees in both Accounting AND Computer Science , when in fact he never received the latter .
►
In 2007 , Marilee Jones , the Dean of Admissions at Massachusetts Institute of Technology resigned after 28 celebrated years at M.I.T. when it became know that she had fabricated her own educational credentials .
She claimed to have earned degrees from 3 different colleges : Albany Medical College , Union College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .
In fact , she had no degrees at all !
Rensselaer said she only attended as a part - time student during one school year .
The other two colleges said they had no record of her .
►
In 2006 , Dave Edmondson , the CEO of RadioShack , was fired after 11 years with the company when it was revealed that he had lied on his résumé .
He had claimed he held degrees in Psychology and Theology from Pacific Coast Baptist College in California .
In fact , he never graduated .
The school ’s records showed Edmondson completed only two semesters , and that the school never even offered degrees in Psychology ! ►
In 2005 , Michael Brown , Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , resigned after his mishandling of the response to Hurricane Katrina .
To get that job , Brown had claimed he oversaw emergency services for the City of Edmund , Oklahoma and that he ’d worked at the University of Central Oklahoma as a political science professor .
In fact , it was later revealed that Brown had only been an assistant to the city manager , which is more like an intern .
And school officials at the University of Central Oklahoma said Brown was never a member of their faculty .
►
In 2001 , George O’Leary was fired from the Head Coaching job at Notre Dame College after only 5 days on the job .
O’Leary had claimed to have a Master ’s Degree in Education from New York University and had lettered in college football at the University of New Hampshire .
O’Leary attended NYU but did not receive a degree .
In fact , he had taken only two courses at SUNY – Stony Brook , and never graduated !
And he never earned a letter playing football in New Hampshire and never even played in a game there .
Of course , the above examples are only some of the most well know liars who had the misfortune of getting caught in very public positions .
It kind of makes you wonder how many other résumé liars fly under the radar , and never get caught !

Let the Jobs Find You : Making Yourself More “ Searchable ”
If you are an active job - seeking candidate , then I think it ’s safe to say that you are in pursuit mode , right ?
You are probably spending the majority of your time searching for and pursuing target companies , networking contacts and decision - makers within those companies , HR people , recruiters and any job opportunities you hear about that match your background and experience .
All in all , these can be very time consuming and often frustrating activities .
Would n’t it be great if the reverse were true : if jobs would find you , instead of the other way around ?
Would n’t you like to be the one who was being pursued instead of you always trying to chase others down ?
Would n’t it be fantastic if hiring managers from companies , HR people and recruiters would search for and then contact you about jobs they thought you matched ???
First of all , we need to start with the assumption that you possess all the necessary skills and experiences that truly match a particular job ’s requirements .
If that is true ( and that ’s a huge assumption ) then connecting you as a candidate with a specific job opportunity is the name of this game !
In my world as a recruiter , there are basically two types of candidates that are considered targets for us to pursue : Passive and Active .
The difference between these two types of candidates is fairly easy to describe : Passive Candidates are people who are currently working and not really looking for a new job at all .
However ( and this is a key point ) they might be open to new opportunities , depending on how they are approached .
Companies with jobs to fill rarely solicit passive candidates directly .
Instead , they will engage Executive Search Firms and recruiters who specialize in placing people in permanent , full - time positions and who usually target passive candidates on behalf of those client companies .
Passive candidates are highly sought after by so - called “ Head - Hunters , ” whose goal it is to get someone to leave one job and go to another .
[ Read “ The Real Truth About Working with Recruiters ” for more on how “ Head Hunters ” differ from other types of recruiters . ]
For a variety of reasons ( not all of which are logical ) candidates who are currently working are perceived in a better light than unemployed job - seekers by most potential new employers .
This is especially true if someone is working for a client company ’s competitor !
Recruiting passive candidates is not an easy process … but can actually be a lot of fun and quite a challenge for many recruiters .
It involves a lot of networking , cold - calling and old fashioned sleuthing .
It boils down to pure consultative sales techniques .
Once a passive candidate is identified and contacted , the recruiter has to establish trust and rapport with that person , find out what their career goals and desires are , and then convince them to consider interviewing for a job with their client — something they were not looking for , or really even thinking about before that initial call .
There needs to be a compelling story to be told by that recruiter which explains why moving from company A to company B would be in that candidate ’s best interest .
That usually comes down to one of three things : higher compensation , opportunities for career growth / advancement , or a better company culture — or some combination of all three .
Active Candidates on the other hand , are people who are actively looking for jobs .
These are candidates who are either “ in transition ” ( i.e. not currently working full - time ) or are actually employed somewhere but unhappy and seriously looking to make a change from their current job .
Companies with temporary or permanent jobs to fill , as well as staffing firms and recruiters who specialize in contract - consulting jobs tend to target active candidates since they are generally available immediately .
Unlike passive candidates , active candidates typically post their résumés on job boards and respond to job postings .
For recruiters , active candidates are not as difficult to find as passive candidates — or at least they should n’t be !
If you are an active job - seeker , it is obviously in your best interest to maximize your online visibility as well as your “ searchability ” in order to be “ found ” by recruiters and HR people at companies searching for candidates with specific matching skill sets .
LinkedIn Frustrations
It ’s no secret that LinkedIn has now eclipsed all the standard job boards as the number one go - to place for recruiters to find candidates .
LinkedIn has radically changed the way potential employers and recruiters find candidates , and companies search for and uncover details about potential employees .
Many companies are now actually dropping their Monster and CareerBuilder accounts and relying on LinkedIn as their main source for talent acquisition .
Creating an effective online profile on LinkedIn is one of the most important things a job - seeker can do right now .
From a recruiter ’s point of view , one of the most frustrating aspects of LinkedIn is that it is not always easy to figure out if a person is an active job - seeker or not .
Many people portray themselves on LinkedIn as working full - time , when they may actually be active job - seekers who simply do n’t want to reveal their true status .
They might think ( as per the reasoning explained above for passive candidates ) that they will appear more desirable if they are not unemployed .
The trouble with that reasoning is that if I , as a recruiter , am looking for active candidates — I might not contact someone who appears to be working full - time !
Another LinkedIn frustration is that even active job - seekers who say they are looking for new opportunities usually fail to provide any direct way to contact them ( i.e. an email address or a phone number . )
If you are not a first - degree connection , the limitations of LinkedIn ’s messaging system will be a big road - block to anyone trying to contact you with a job opportunity .
Making Yourself More “ Searchable ”
If you are an Active Job -Seeking Candidate with marketable skills and experiences , there are several things you can do to increase your chances of being seen and pursued by those jobs instead of you being the one doing all the chasing .
Following are some tips on how to maximize your chances of being “ found ” by either a company or a recruiter : Keywords
Keyword searches are usually the first method used to find résumés and Linked In profiles with specific skills that match job descriptions .
If the right words or phrases are not present in your résumé or profile , you simply wo n’t come up in a search done by a recruiter or an HR person .
You should make sure that your résumé uses the language and commonly used buzzwords or phrases that appear in the typical job descriptions within your industry niche .
Study those job descriptions and copy those buzzwords and phrases into your résumé and profile .
Also look up other people who do what you do , and see what keywords appear in their profiles for more ideas .
Try using a free keyword search tool like “ WordStream ” , or any number of other keyword generating tools that you can easily find online .
When someone searches for keyword matches on Linked In , the results are ordered first by how closely connected you are to them , and then by how often those keywords appear in your profile .
Test your own profile ’s effectiveness by using LinkedIn ’s Advanced Search function : pretend that you are a recruiter and search for people who do what you do in your own geographical area .
Try copying and pasting some key phrases from a job description you think fits your background into the keyword search field , or a job title you are seeking into the title search field .
Does your profile come up anywhere near the top of the search results ?
If not , look at who does and try to figure out why : what do their profiles have that yours does n’t ?
What keywords do they have that you do n’t — and how frequently do those keywords appear ?
Now add those things to your own profile ( if they truly apply to you ) and try the search again !
Frequently Refresh your Online Résumés
In addition to Linked In , you should also have your keyword - optimized résumé posted on all the major job boards ( Monster , CareerBuilder , etc. )
Companies , Staffing Firms and recruiters pay lots of money to subscribe to and be able to search in those job - board résumé banks .
Did you know that when someone searches the job board ’s résumé banks , the results are often displayed in the order of who is the most recently updated ?
Anyone who has ever done a basic
Google search already knows how that process works … you click through the results on the first two or three pages , and most people rarely go any further .
Does anyone actually look to see what ’s been found on the hundreds of pages that follow those first few ?
If your résumé does n’t appear on those first few pages of a keyword search , your chances of being found drop off dramatically .
How can you fix that ?
Easy : edit and then re-post / refresh your résumé posts at least once or twice a week .
Change something / anything on your résumé or profile to refresh / re-post it online .
It can be something as small as one word !
Refreshing / Re-Posting it will bring it back closer to the top of the search results .
If You Are an Active Candidate , SAY SO !
Make sure you clearly declare the fact that you are seeking new opportunities in such a way that it is crystal clear to anyone who views your résumé or Linked In profile online .
Put it in your headline .
Put it in the Summary section .
List it in your professional goals .
Use phrases like : “ Seeking New Opportunities ” or “ Available for Projects . ”
( Recruiters actually use the words “ Seeking ” and “ Available ” in their keyword searches for active candidates ! )
Add Contact Information to Your LinkedIn Profile !
As explained above , failing to include basic contact information ( email address or phone number ) somewhere in your LinkedIn Profile will make it much more difficult for anyone who finds you to contact you … unless you are already a first degree connection .
Relying on LinkedIn ’s internal communication tool is much too limiting .
Add your contact information in such a way that anyone who views your public profile can see it and email or call you .
Include a Photo on Your LinkedIn Profile
Speaking strictly from personal experience as a recruiter , I am much more inclined to reach out to people on Linked In who have photos than those who do not .
I always prefer LinkedIn profiles with photos , as long as they look professional and not goofy .
I tend to spend more time reviewing the photo profiles … they seem more honest and inviting .
Plus , it helps me remember people I ’ve met , puts names and faces together , and makes me feel I am more connected to people .
Profiles without photos seem more generic , incomplete and anonymous .
I always suspect that they are hiding something !
The goal of all of these steps is quite simple : make it easier for recruiters and potential employers to find and then contact you .
Instead of you doing all the chasing , you want to make yourself more “ Searchable ” which will increase the odds that the perfect job will find you !

Cool InfoGraphic : “ What You Wish You ’d Known Before Your Job Interview ” Recently , while surfing around on LinkedIn and exploring articles that seemed to be of interest to job - seekers , I came across a cool InfoGraphic called “ What You Wish You ’d Known Before Your Job Interview . ”
It ’s filled with various statistics and lists that may be helpful to anyone going out on job interviews .
The original source of this InfoGraphic was apparently a website called “ Classes and Careers ” aimed at students who are picking colleges and / or courses .
The website ’s stated purpose is to match students with schools and programs .
I tried to poke around and investigate how they came up with these statistics and numbers … but alas , I could not even find this InfoGraphic anywhere on their website , much less any information on how they arrived at these statistics .
The actual InfoGraphic was simply re-published on multiple unrelated sites while the original research information supporting it somehow got lost in the viral re-shuffling on the web .
Nevertheless , my gut feeling in studying this InfoGraphic is that it has the ring of truth to it .
I ca n’t swear that the numbers are accurate … but based on my own experience as a recruiter who has coached thousands of candidates through interviews and then debriefed countless interviewers , the overall content shown seems pretty right on .
The items contained here that I think are especially apropos are :
► A third of the interviewers surveyed made up their minds about whether or not to hire someone within the first 90 seconds of the interview starting .
► Over half of the first impressions were created NOT by what was said , but rather how the person dressed , walked through the door and acted .
► Almost half of the failed interviews were caused by candidates not knowing enough about the company they were meeting with .
► Over two thirds of the failed interviews were caused by candidates not making eye contact .
► The number one reason for not hiring someone was that they did n’t ask for the job !
Now there ’s nothing new or earth - shattering about any of this .
I ’ve actually written about most of this stuff elsewhere in other articles here on Recruiter Musings .
[ Check the Index for more specific interviewing advice , tips and tricks . ]
Still , seeing it all in this graphical format is very entertaining and enlightening .
( Oh and yes , the retro sixties - style caricature of the job - seeker is kind of goofy , but I like it anyway !
It kind of reminds me of the TV show Mad Men . )
I would even say , it ’s worth blowing this up , printing it out , and pinning it to a wall near your work desk as a refresher before each interview you have coming up .
So here it is !

“ So , Do You Have Any Questions ? ” Nailing the Interview Closer Anyone who has ever been interviewed for a job of any kind has most likely heard some variation of this line : “ So , do you have any questions ? ”
It ’s the standard way that most interviewers wrap things up , and signal that the interview is coming to a close .
It ’s a query posed near the end of practically every type of interview : Phone Interviews , Face - to - Face Interviews , Skype Interviews , etc .
It sounds like a rather innocent question , and could easily be dismissed by a job - seeker as a mere formality — not worthy of a thoughtful response .
Well , do n’t make that mistake !
The truth is , how that question is answered can often make or break someone ’s chances of landing a job .
Candidates are judged by the quality of the questions they ask during an interview .
Candidates who have no questions at all might be perceived as having no interest in the position .
Even worse than that , inappropriate or off - track questions can be viewed as a huge red flag by any interviewer .
Asking the wrong questions can easily sink an otherwise successful interview .
There are literally thousands of possible variations of typical questions that could be used as interview closers .
I certainly do n’t intend to list them all here .
And obviously , the specifics of each interview ( the nature of the position , the type of company , the level of the person conducting the interview , etc. ) will often determine what questions make the most sense to ask .
Rather , I hope to list some general do ’s and don’ts , and suggest some specific examples of successful questions that are likely to score points and head the conversation in the right direction .
What NOT to ask during an interview :
Let ’s start with obvious no - no ’s that will most likely get you eliminated from consideration by any interviewer :
► Do n’t ask what the company does , what products they produce , or other basic questions that anyone could find the answers to by simply reading the company ’s website .
( Do your homework , and do n’t sound like an idiot ! )
► Do n’t ask about compensation , vacation , or benefits .
Those are clearly things that fall under the category of “ what ’s in it for me ” — but certainly wo n’t show what ’s in it for the interviewer !
On the other hand , if the interviewer brings up the salary issue first , be prepared to address it head on .
[ Read “ Answering the Dreaded Salary Question ” for suggested strategies on how to deal with this controversial issue . ]
► Do n’t ask about anything sensitive or negative that you might have read or heard about the company — e.g. recent layoffs , poor financial performance , bad press reports , lawsuits , complaints or any other negative issues you are aware of .
Most interviewers would rather keep the discussion focused on the positive aspects of their company , and will be very uncomfortable if those types of issues are brought up by a candidate .
► Do n’t ask generic , standard questions that sound as though you found them on a website ( like this blog ! ) and are reciting them from a script .
Most savvy interviewers will be able to spot those types of canned questions a mile away , and easily distinguish them from more thoughtful , insightful questions that pertain specifically to their company or the exact position you are interviewing for .
► Do n’t ask personal questions about the interviewer ’s family , marital status , children , hobbies , political opinions , religious affiliation , etc .
Unless you have a prior history with the person , issues like that are totally inappropriate for an interview with someone you just met .
( On the other hand , if they bring those things up first then simply follow their lead … but tread carefully with these topics and do n’t offer up too much personal information of your own .
Try to stay focused on the business at hand . )
► Do n’t ask point blank if you are going to get the job .
That tends to put the interviewer on the spot , and makes people feel very uncomfortable .
What you SHOULD ask :
Here are some general categories that you can use as a guide to formulating winning interviewee questions :
► Ask open - ended questions , as opposed to yes - no questions .
“ Can you tell me more about … ” “ What is your opinion of … ” The idea is to get the interviewer to talk more — to reveal more information about the company , about the position , about themself and about their expectations .
Ideally , you can then use that information to say things that will demonstrate that you truly fit whatever it is they seem to be looking for .
► Take something you learned beforehand about the company , and probe further .
Show that you ’ve done your homework about the company .
Ask specific questions about those things that you learned .
Start out with something like “ During my research , I read that … I was wondering … ” Demonstrating that you ’ve read up on the company , and that you are curious and interested can be very impressive !
► Take something discussed during the interview , and probe further .
Expand on topics already covered , and ask for more details .
This shows that you ’ve been paying attention , and that you are curious , interested and eager to learn more .
► Ask about the company ’s culture and work environment .
Those are issues that tend to be rather abstract , and less likely to be explained on their website .
Therefore , they are good topics to ask the interviewer about .
► Ask about what qualities they look for in a successful employee .
How can someone succeed and grow within the company ?

What are the next steps in the interview process ? ”
Do n’t leave without determining what the expectations are for the next steps , and how and when YOU should follow - up .
Ask what their timetable is for hiring , and how their hiring process works .
Also make sure you get a business card with the email address and phone number of your interviewer , and send them a thank - you email that same day .
If you met with more than one person , get everyone ’s cards and do the same with them .
Then immediately make a note on your calendar of when your pro-active follow - up call will be if you do n’t hear back from them first .
If you really want this job , do n’t just sit back wait for them to make the next move .
You have to go after it !

CHICAGO ( WOMENSENEWS )
–Two funerals this month find women ordained as Catholic priests buried outside the church they were striving to change from within .
Mary Styne , 70 , of Milwaukee , died May 12 .
She was ordained in 2009 by Roman Catholic Womenpriests , an organization that has been ordaining women to the priesthood in contravention of church law since 2002 .
Janine Denomme , 45 , of Chicago , died May 17 , just weeks after her ordination by the same group ; her funeral was May 22 .
The women , both of whom died of cancer , are the first members of Roman Catholic Womenpriests to pass away .
The group now has more than 100 bishops , priests and deacons worldwide , mostly in the United States .
Women presided over both funerals .
While Styne ’s death and funeral were quiet , Denomme ’s drew renewed media attention to the battle lines running through the Catholic Church over women ’s ordination .
While Styne knew the Catholic hierarchy would never allow her funeral in a church and arranged for services at a nonsectarian chapel , Denomme ’s survivors asked to hold her funeral at St. Gertrude , the local parish she loved .
‘ Sign of Repentance ’
The Chicago Archdiocese refused .
" Those who willingly separate themselves from the church cannot be granted a church funeral unless they gave some sign of repentance before death , " it said in a statement .
The Chicago Archdiocese said Denomme ’s excommunication resulted automatically from her participation in a " simulation " of ordination on April 10 , five weeks before her death .
The church ’s decision to refuse burial upset many members of the progressive North Side parish , as did the fact that many of the conservative Catholic websites and blogs covering the story dwelt on how Denomme was a lesbian .
Some of the parishioners will meet Tuesday to discuss how or whether to formally respond .
" She followed her conscience , " said Barbara Zeman , a Roman Catholic female priest in Chicago .
" They threw her , and us , away . "
Denomme expected to have her funeral at St. Gertrude , Zeman said .
She went into the hospital almost immediately after her ordination , so she never had the experience of being excluded from the life of the parish that other female priests know .
Denomme was ordained to the deaconate in July 2009 , a few months after being diagnosed with colon cancer .
Over the next year , she chronicled her disease in a blog , which she saw as her ministry .
The site attracted more than 23,000 visitors .
Bishop Joan Houk , of Roman Catholic Womenpriests ’
Great Lakes region , recalled that Denomme was so ill at her priestly ordination in April that she needed to lie in an upstairs chamber , rather than in the main sanctuary with the other candidate for ordination .
Houk shuttled back and forth between the two rooms to administer the sacrament .
Houk said the priests in her region thought the archdiocese ’s refusal to bury Denomme was senseless but unsurprising .
‘ Constant Denial to the Women ’
" I see the constant denial to the women , " Houk said in an interview at the wake .
" Denial of community , denial of ministries such as lecturing or Eucharistic minister .
They deny us the opportunity to pray on Catholic property . "
Denomme ’s funeral was held at First United Methodist Church in a northern Chicago suburb , or " St. Gertrude ’s North , " as a speaker at her wake irreverently dubbed it , to cheers and applause .
Styne ’s funeral was held in the Chapel of the Chimes at Wisconsin Memorial Park and she was buried by the funeral home Church and Chapel .
In Denomme ’s case , some parishioners said the archdiocese had told Rev. Dominic Grassi , pastor at St. Gertrude , that if he celebrated the funeral Mass at the parish it would be the last he ’d ever say .
Grassi declined to speak publicly about his conversation with Bishop Francis Kane .
" There was no way that our pastor could just go forward with a funeral , " said Valency Hastings , a parishioner at St. Gertrude for eight years .
" He would have been punished . "
The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , the Vatican ’s watchdog committee for doctrinal matters , declared in 1976 that women could never be priests because Jesus and his apostles were all male , and canon law codifies that stricture .
Pope John Paul II , predecessor to the current pope , decreed an end to the ordination debate in 1994 in an apostolic letter .
Denomme ’s path to the priesthood began in her hometown of Detroit , where she played Mass with her three brothers , pretending to consecrate Chex cereal .
She came to Chicago in 1987 as a member of the Jesuit Volunteer Corps and worked with homeless women .
Most recently Denomme worked as youth program director at Center on Halsted , a community center serving gays , lesbians and transgendered people .
‘ Ruined for Life ’
" I remember her wearing a T - shirt : ‘ JVC – Ruined for life , ’ " said her friend Rosie Gianforte in the eulogy .
" She would say that her life was ‘ ruined ’ because she understood in a whole new way the inequalities and injustices in the world and once her consciousness had been raised , she was never the same again . "
Friends and fellow parishioners at St. Gertrude described her as " gentle , " " a peacemaker " and possessing the gifts of mediating disagreements and drawing out the talents of others .
She was heavily involved at St. Gertrude : singing at Mass , volunteering as a spiritual director and religious teacher and preaching in the church ’s lay preaching program .
" She was really well - liked in the parish , " Grassi said .
" Loved . "
Parishioners and female priests reacted to the archdiocese ’s decision with a mix of anger , sadness and forgiveness .
The day Denomme ’s partner , Nancy Katz , broke the news about the funeral on Denomme ’s blog , Susan Lersch resigned from St. Gertrude .
Lersch , a parishioner for eight years , voluntarily brought communion to the sick at a local long - term care facility ; as such , she was officially representing the parish to the secular world .
But after the parish chose not to bury Denomme , she did n’t feel she could go on as the church ’s representative .
" I did not feel comfortable representing that decision , " she said .
" It was time to go .
A line had been crossed . "
Other parishioners said they struggled to extend forgiveness .
Ruth Giles - Ott , a parishioner for 15 years , said she attended a faith - sharing meeting on May 10 where the group members discussed the archdiocese ’s decision .
Christians are called to " radical love , " she said , and that includes Cardinal Francis George .
Hastings said the parish has moved past anger into reconciliation , which is what Denomme would have wanted .
At the same time , " Cardinal George has to face these tough questions about the lack of compassion to someone who dedicated her whole life to the church and the hypocrisy we see in not carrying out the basic act of buying the dead , " she said .

I just visited Yahoo Research which has several fundamental learning problems near to ( or beyond ) the set of problems we know how to solve well .
Here are 3 of them .
Ranking
This is the canonical problem of all search engines .
It is made extra difficult for several reasons .
There is relatively little “ good ” supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal ( such as click through rates ) .
The learning must occur in a partially adversarial environment .
Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top of
rankings .
It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as ‘ ranking ’ or as ‘ regression ’ which is then used to produce a
ranking .
Collaborative filtering Yahoo has a large number of recommendation systems for music , movies , etc …
In these sorts of systems , users specify how they liked a set of things , and then the system can ( hopefully ) find some more examples of things they might like
by reasoning across multiple such sets .
Exploration with Generalization
The cash cow of
search engines is displaying advertisements which are relevant to search along with search results .
Better targeting these advertisements makes money ( a small improvement might be worth $ millions ) and improves the value of the search engine for the user .
It is natural to predict the set of advertisements which maximize the advertising payoff .
This natural idea is stymied by both the extreme
multiplicity of advertisements under contract ( think millions ) and a lack of ability to measure hypotheticals like “ What would have
happened if we had displayed a different set of advertisements for this ( query , user ) pair instead ? ”
This is a combined exploration and
generalization problem .
Good solutions to any of these problems would be extremely useful ( and not just at Yahoo ) .
Even further small improvements on the existing solutions may be very useful .
For those interested , Yahoo ( as an organization ) knows these are learning problems and is very actively interested in solving them .
Yahoo Research is committed to a relatively open method of solving these problems .
Dennis DeCoste is one contact point for machine learning research at Yahoo Research .
