Normally I use this space for extended diatribes on everything from how much I hate Jim Carrey to how awesome I think Wendy ’s comically unhealthy sandwiches are .
While that ’s all well and good , today I want to do something a little bit more useful by talking about how to setup a personal web server that you can take with you wherever you go .
It might not seem terribly useful , but if you ’re like me and carry your work around on a thumb drive , it can be tremendously useful .
I ’m sure a lot of you are asking , “ Dave , what the hell am I going to use a web server for anyway ? ”
Well , using your own web server , you can build and test pages with server - side elements and databases without having to go through the trouble of uploading them to the internet .
I ’ve been trying to teach myself PHP for the last month or so , and using a personal web server has saved me a hell of a lot of time and frustration .
Well , this web server is n’t going to set itself up , so let ’s have at it .
The only thing you ’re going to need for this tutorial is a computer , a thumb drive , an internet connection , and a little spare time .
This should be quick and relatively painless .
Now we could do things the difficult way by setting up a bunch of different programs ( Apache , PHP , MySQL , etc ) separately , but that could take years and cost thousands of lives .
We ’re not going to do that , though .
We ’re going to take the easy way out and use an all - in - one solution called Xampp .
Xampp has versions for Linux , Windows , OS X , and Solaris .
I ’m using Windows , so that ’s the path I ’m going to take .
If you ’re using something else , you should still be able to follow along with this tutorial .
Just make sure you select the appropriate operating system .
From Xampp ’s homepage ( http://www.apachefriends.org/), click on the “ Xampp for Windows ” link .
Scroll down to the download section , and click the link to download the Zip file to your desktop .
It ’s a fairly large file , at 78 MB , so allow it some time to download .
Alternatively , you could download the smaller version , called Xampp Lite , which is only 47 MB , but does n’t have all the bells and whistles .
Once Xampp is downloaded , we can install it .
The program comes with an installer , but it ’s not necessary .
We will simply copy the contents of the Zip over to our thumb drive .
Again , this is a fairly large file , so allow a couple of minutes .
Once everything has been copied over , browse to the newly created Xampp folder on your thumb drive .
Since we did n’t install this in the default directory , we ’ll need to update a few paths .
To do so , run setup_xampp.bat .
It will take a couple of seconds to run , and then give you the following confirmation message :
Now everything is configured , and we can start our server .
Double click the file called xampp - control.exe , which will launch the Xampp Control Panel .
From here you can load the different programs ( Apache , MySQL , FileZilla , and Mercury Mail ) by clicking on the “ Start ” button next to their name .
Once the service starts running , “ Start ” becomes “ Stop ” , and clicking that button will turn it off .
Pretty easy , right ?
You ’ll want to start , at very least , Apache , as that is the web server program .
If you ’re working with databases , you ’re going to need to run MySQL as well .
Once Apache has been started , you can browse to http://localhost to see your web server ’s splash page .
Clicking your language will bring you into the control panel .
From here you can make a variety of changes , from updating security to setting up new databases in MySQL .
To get your own files hosted , simply copy them over to the “ htdocs ” directory in the Xampp folder .
To see them in your browser , simply append that file ’s path to the end of http://localhost ( e.g . http://localhost/test.htm , http://localhost/forum/index.php ) .
That ’s about it , you ’re ready to enjoy your new portable server .
Keep in mind that , by default , there is n’t much in the way of security measures , so you may want to setup some passwords .
Also , do n’t forget to stop the services before disconnecting your thumb drive .
This has been Dave sayin ’ : “ I used to dream about being an astronaut .
I just never had the grades .
Or the physical endurance .
Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me . ”
Well folks , it 's that time to announce a new stable Slackware release again .
So , without further ado , announcing Slackware version 12.1 !
Since we 've moved to supporting the 2.6 kernel series exclusively ( and fine - tuned the system to get the most out of it ) , we feel that Slackware 12.1 has many improvements over our last release ( Slackware 12.0 ) and is a must - have upgrade for any Slackware user .
This first Slackware edition of the year combines Slackware 's legendary simplicity ( and close tracking of original sources ) , stability , and security with some of the latest advances in Linux technology .
Expect no less than the best Slackware yet .
Among the many program updates and distribution enhancements , you 'll find two of the most advanced desktop environments available today : Xfce 4.4.2 , a fast and lightweight but visually appealing and easy to use desktop environment , and KDE 3.5.9 , the latest version of the award - winning K Desktop Environment .
We have added to Slackware support for HAL ( the Hardware Abstraction Layer ) which allows the system administrator to add users to the cdrom and plugdev groups .
Then they will be able to use items such as USB flash sticks , USB cameras that appear like USB storage , portable hard drives , CD and DVD media , MP3 players , and more , all without requiring sudo , the mount or umount command .
Just plug and play .
Properly set up , Slackware 's desktop should be suitable for any level of Linux experience .
Slackware uses the 2.6.24.5 kernel bringing you advanced performance features such as journaling filesystems , SCSI and ATA RAID volume support , SATA support , Software RAID , LVM ( the Logical Volume Manager , and encrypted filesystems .
Kernel support for X DRI ( the Direct Rendering Interface ) brings high - speed hardware accelerated 3D graphics to Linux .
We have switched from the older one - piece X11 Window System to the newest modular X11 from X. Org , which should be simpler to maintain and will likely speed up development of new features for X ( such as translucent windows and a few other things that are on the horizon ) .
There are two kinds of kernels in Slackware -- the huge kernels , which contain support for just about every driver in the Linux kernel .
These are primarily intended to be used for installation , but there 's no real reason that you could n't continue to run them after you have installed .
The other type of kernel is the generic kernel , in which nearly every driver is built as a module .
To use a generic kernel you 'll need to build an initrd to load your filesystem module and possibly your drive controller or other drivers needed at boot time , configure LILO to load the initrd at boot , and reinstall LILO .
See the docs in / boot after installing for more information .
Slackware 's Linux kernels come in both SMP and non-SMP types now .
The SMP kernel supports multiple processors , multi-core CPUs , HyperThreading , and about every other optimization available .
In our own testing this kernel has proven to be fast , stable , and reliable .
We recommend using the SMP kernel even on single processor machines if it will run on them .
From the beginning , Slackware has offered a stable and secure Linux distribution for UNIX veterans as well as an easy - to - use system for beginners .
Slackware includes everything you 'll need to run a powerful server or workstation .
Each Slackware package follows the setup and installation instructions from its author(s ) as closely as possible , offering you the most stable and easily expandable setup .
Here are some of the advanced features of Slackware 12.1 : - Runs the 2.6.24.5 version of the Linux kernel from ftp.kernel.org .
Also included is a kernel patched with Speakup to support speech synthesizers providing access to Linux for the visually impaired community .
The 2.6.x kernel series has matured into a stable kernel , and provides reliable performance for your desktop or your production server .
- System binaries are linked with the GNU C Library , version 2.7 .
This version of glibc also has excellent compatibility with existing binaries .
- X11 7.3.0 +.
This is the X. Org Foundation 's modular X Window System .
There 's been much activity in the X development world , and the improvements here in terms of performance and hardware support are too numerous to mention them all here .
- Installs gcc -4.2.3 as the default C , C++ , Objective - C , Fortran - 77/95 , and Ada 95 compiler .
- Support for fully encrypted network connections with OpenSSL , OpenSSH , OpenVPN , and GnuPG . - Apache ( httpd ) 2.2.8 web server with Dynamic Shared Object support , SSL , and PHP 5.2.5 . - PCMCIA , CardBus , USB , IEE1394 ( FireWire ) and ACPI support .
This makes Slackware a great operating system for your laptop .
-
The udev dynamic device management system for Linux 2.6.x .
This locates and configures most hardware automatically as it is added ( or removed ) from the system , and creates the access nodes in / dev .
It also loads the kernel modules required by sound cards and other hardware at boot time .
- New development tools , including Perl 5.8.8 , Python 2.5.2 , Ruby 1.8.6- p114 , Subversion 1.4.6 , git -1.5.5 , mercurial - 1.0 , graphical tools like Qt designer and KDevelop , and much more .
- Updated versions of the Slackware package management tools make it easy to add , remove , upgrade , and make your own Slackware packages .
Package tracking makes it easy to upgrade from Slackware 12.0 to Slackware 12.1 ( see CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT ) .
The slackpkg tool in / extra can also help update from an older version of Slackware to a newer one , and keep your Slackware system up to date .
In addition , the slacktrack utility ( in extra / ) will help you build and maintain your own packages .
- Web browsers galore !
Includes KDE's Konqueror 3.5.9 , SeaMonkey 1.1.9 ( this is the replacement for the Mozilla Suite ) , and the immensely popular Firefox 2.0.0.14 , as well as the Thunderbird 2.0.0.12 email and news client with advanced junk mail filtering .
-
The complete K Desktop Environment ( KDE ) version 3.5.9 , including the KOffice productivity suite , networking tools , GUI development with KDevelop , multimedia tools ( including the amazing Amarok music player and K3B disc burning software ) , the Konqueror web browser and file manager , dozens of games and utilities , international language support , and more . - A collection of GTK + based applications including pidgin- 2.4.1 , gimp - 2.4.5 , gkrellm - 2.3.1 , gxine - 0.5.11 , xchat - 2.8.4 , xsane - 0.994 , and pan -0.132 . - Large repository of extra software packages compiled and ready to run .
This includes various window managers , the Java ( TM ) 2 Software Development Kit Standard Edition , libsafe ( buffer overflow protection for additional security ) , and much more ( see the / extra directory ) .
-
Many more improved and upgraded packages than we can list here .

The ambitions of today 's Russians are equally bold – while the planting of the titanium flag was a largely symbolic gesture , it signalled Russia 's intention to claim a vast of territory underneath the icecap that amouts to half the Arctic Ocean 's seabed .
If they have their way they will tame one of the last true frontiers , making Moscow the master of much of the Earth 's remaining energy supplies .
The risk , however , is of lurching into confrontation with the other polar powers , who are only now waking up to what is at stake .
The great prize is the 25 per cent of the Earth 's remaining oil and gas which the Arctic is thought to contain .

David L. Knellinger will go to trial this month in Virginia because the government says his computer 's hard drive contains pornographic pictures of children .
There are two basic defenses to that incendiary charge .
One is to raise questions about how the pictures got there .
The other is to argue that what appear to be real children are actually just images generated by computers .
Proving either defense requires a thorough analysis of the computer 's hard drive by forensic experts .
But a new law makes it much harder for those experts to do their work .
In Mr. Knellinger 's case , prosecutors initially agreed to provide his defense team with a copy of his hard drive so they could prepare for trial .
That was on July 26 , 2006 .
The next day , President Bush signed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act , named after the murdered son of John Walsh , the host of '' America 's Most Wanted . ''
The law contains an extraordinary provision .
It says that child pornography is so toxic it must be kept in a secure government facility .
Defense experts may examine it there , the law says , but they can not make copies .
Child pornography is contraband , the law says , like guns or drugs .
Because '' every instance of viewing images of child pornography represents a renewed violation of the privacy of the victims and a repetition of their abuse , '' Congress found , the images '' should not be distributed to , or copied by , child pornography defendants or their attorneys . ''
Citing the new law , the prosecutors in Mr. Knellinger 's case withdrew their proposal to turn over the evidence against him .
They offered instead to allow Mr. Knellinger 's defense team to inspect his computer 's hard drive at the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's offices in Richmond , Va .
In cases around the country , defendants have attacked the law , saying it violates their rights to due process and a fair trial .
They also say that it does not , even on its own terms , make much sense .
'' If you were to follow the logic of it , '' said Ian N. Friedman , one of Mr. Knellinger 's lawyers , '' you should not be able to present the evidence to 12 jurors . ''
In September , Judge Linda R. Reade of Federal District Court in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , upheld the restrictions in the law .
'' Congress adopted a reasonable measure to ensure that the child pornography used in criminal trials does not escape into the public domain , '' Judge Reade wrote .
Her decision was brief and tentative , though , and it did not seriously engage some of the main objections to the law .
The law creates , for starters , an uneven playing field .
The prosecution has unlimited access to the evidence .
The defense must make an appointment .
The law also prejudges the crucial question in the case .
The images are presumed to be child pornography before any court has said they are .
For a defense lawyer , having to work at the F.B.I. office is cumbersome and impractical , and it may endanger the lawyer - client privilege and leave a road map to defense strategies .
It certainly makes the task of examining the hard drive much more expensive .
One forensic expert in the Knellinger cases said his fee would rise to $ 540,000 from $ 135,000 because it is so much more difficult to work away from his office .
The cost of transporting his machinery , which fills a truck and takes three people a week to move , would be extra .
In January , the judge in the Knellinger case , Robert E. Payne of Federal District Court in Richmond , stopped just short of striking down the law .
Instead , using a little legal jujitsu , he turned it inside out .
The law requires prosecutors to provide the defense team with an '' ample opportunity for inspection , viewing and examination at a government facility . ''
But Judge Payne ruled that the burden of working at a government facility itself deprived Mr. Knellinger 's lawyers and experts of an ample opportunity to prepare his defense .
The only solution , he said , was to order the government to turn over a copy of the hard drive .
Mr. Knellinger 's experts have now examined it , though Mr. Friedman would not say what their analysis yielded or what defenses his client would rely on at trial .
Judge Payne 's order added , perhaps in response to Judge Reade 's concern that allowing defendants ready access to the evidence against them might allow child pornography to '' escape into the public domain , '' that only Mr. Knellinger 's lawyers and experts could have access to the copied hard drive .
He said he would punish any unauthorized distribution or publication .
Mr. Knellinger faces a maximum sentence of 140 years , which is not bad when you consider an Arizona man named Morton R. Berger .
In February , the United States Supreme Court let stand Mr. Berger 's 200 - year sentence for possessing 20 pornographic images of children .
Mr. Berger was a married 52 - year - old high school teacher with no criminal record when he was arrested .
Child pornography is , of course , unspeakably disturbing and repulsive .
But if the stakes in combating it are to include three - digit prison sentences , there is reason to be skeptical about laws that revise the usual procedures and presumptions .
Indeed , one way society can show that it is deadly serious about a crime is to allow those accused of it the best defense possible .
Drawing ( Drawing by Harry Campbell )
Radley Balko points out another video of the New York Police Department assaulting people and then charging them with crimes , lying in their depositions .
Not small discrepancies , understandable errors of recollection , but plain lies boldly contradicting the video footage .
What the footage shows is cops assaulting people .
You can thank us " activist bikers " later for being in the vanguard of resistance to the police state .
( Yes , I 'm one of these types , though not in New York . )
It 's not often people expose the ugly center of police work .
One of my inner circle was once charged with a crime , and at the deposition that we attended we heard the officer testify under oath to things which we knew to be plainly false .
We prodded the lawyer to object , and he said it was n't even worth the time : police lie all the time , and they 're going to be believed in court .
Well , that lying bastard was believed in court .
I 'm sure he was right back on the street , harassing people and lying about it later .
This happens all the time .
This happens everywhere .
JERUSALEM , Aug. 29 ( UPI ) --
Israel wo n't stand by and watch Iran develop its nuclear program despite the stance of the rest of the international community , a security source says .
The unidentified source said while international superpowers such as the United States are focusing their antinuclear efforts on diplomacy , Israel wo n't accept that Iran is capable of developing nuclear weaponry , IsraelNN.com reported Friday .

" The Americans have accepted the fact that Iran will be a nuclear power and are trying to get us to accept it , too , " the source said .
Former Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim
Sneh has proposed an embargo be placed on any supplies for the Iranian oil industry in an attempt to force Tehran into ceasing nuclear development .
The Jerusalem Post said that members of the Israeli government are moving forward with precautionary plans including the purchase of advanced warplanes and receiving permission to use U.S. - controlled Iraqi airspace .
The newspaper said such aggressive actions come after the Israeli government has made it abundantly clear it does n't support a tentative approach to the Iranian nuclear situation .

I 'm an ex-Marine who 's lived here for 50 years , so why must I pay £ 750 to prove I'm British ?
Years of service : Keri Hardie , 55 , shows the medal he won in Northern Ireland
A former Royal Marine who served three terms in Northern Ireland has been told he must pay £ 750 and undergo a ‘ citizenship test ’ if he wants a British passport .
Both of Keir Hardie ’s parents were British and he has lived in this country since the age of three .
He has been decorated for his service in the Marines and has also worked as a policeman and for the fire brigade , served as a town councillor and is now an NHS mental health nurse .
His two ex-wives and his current partner , Lindsey , are all British , as is his 17 - year - old daughter , Amy .
But when he returned from holiday in Turkey last month , 55 - year - old Mr Hardie , who was named after the founder of the Labour Party , was threatened with deportation – because he was born in Canada and has never been issued with British papers .
Now , the UK Identity and Passport Service is insisting he goes through the process of applying for indefinite leave to remain in this country at a cost of £ 750 , which includes having to take the Life in the UK test , devised for new immigrants .
But he is refusing to pay the fee on principle and is looking for lawyers to fight his case .
Mr Hardie , whose three brothers and sister were all born in Britain and have British passports , said : ‘ I have earned my passport through service with the Royal Marines , the NHS , the fire brigade and the police .
‘ I have worked solidly since 1967 and paid my taxes .
I ’ve never been on the dole .
I ’m a Brit and I should be allowed a passport just like any other Brit . ’
His grandfather , John Hunter Hardie , served in the Cameron Highlanders in India and his father , John Chisholm Hardie , was a highly decorated chief petty officer in the Royal Navy .
But , as his father was born in India , the passport authorities are insisting he also tracks down his grandfather ’s birth and wedding certificates – both of which have been lost since their issue around a century ago .
Mr Hardie , from Forres , near Inverness , said : ‘ When I was in the Marines in 1973 , aged 21 , they applied for a passport for me but could n’t get one .
That did n’t stop me from being sent off to wherever in the world they wanted , though .
I did n’t take it seriously back then and evidently neither did they .
‘ I eventually got a Canadian passport just because it was easier , as I was born there and I wanted to have holidays abroad .
Now , I still want to go on holidays abroad but I can’t .
‘ Why should n’t I be allowed to nip over to Paris or get some good weather in Spain once in a while , like any other normal British person ? ’
Immigration officials have insisted that his current documents will not entitle him to re-enter the country should he go abroad again and have even threatened to deport him to Turkey .
They have also pointed out that despite his job with the NHS , he may not legally be allowed to work in Britain .
He said : ‘ The problem is that immigration is now full of scared little jobsworths who are n’t allowed to use common sense and discretion .
‘ They ’ve even admitted at the passport office how ridiculous it is to be asking for my grandparents ’ records .
But they still demand them .
‘ If they do n’t give me a passport , I ’ll not stop plugging .
If need be , I ’ll have to pay thousands to immigration solicitors but I ’m not going to pay a penny more than the £ 72 any British person has to pay to get a new passport .
This just should n’t be happening . ’
A spokesman for the Identity and Passport Service said : ‘ We do not comment on individual cases .
However , a passport will not be issued until an applicant ’s identity and nationality has been satisfactorily confirmed .
This is clearly stated in all our guidance . ’
The Russian military has warned that the withdrawal process will be slow Nato foreign ministers have said they " cannot continue business as usual " with Russia , and demanded that Moscow pull troops from Georgia immediately .
The declaration followed talks in Brussels about the conflict between Moscow and Tbilisi over Georgia 's breakaway region of South Ossetia .
Russia accused Nato of bias and of trying to save a " criminal regime " .
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a withdrawal was possible within three or four days - if Georgia did likewise .
" The withdrawal will be determined by how effectively Georgia returns its forces to their permanent bases [ held before the conflict ] , " Mr Lavrov said .
Some Russian troops have been seen leaving Gori , the largest Georgian town close to the South Ossetia border .
But BBC correspondents on the ground say there are still Russian artillery positions in place .
In addition , there are Russian checkpoints about 35 km ( 22 miles ) from the capital , Tbilisi .
See map of the region Georgia dismissed the move as a " show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal " .
The conflict broke out on 7 August when Georgia launched an assault to wrest back control of the Moscow - backed breakaway region of South Ossetia , triggering a counter - offensive by Russian troops who advanced beyond South Ossetia into Georgia 's heartland .
A ceasefire was signed at the weekend , with Moscow pledging to begin pulling back its troops on Monday , but correspondents say there has so far been little sign of any large - scale withdrawal .
Both sides have accused the other of violating the EU - brokered peace plan .
Buffer zone Following the crisis talks in Brussels , the 26 foreign ministers said in a joint statement that they could not have normal relations with Russia as long as Moscow had troops in Georgia .
PEACE PLAN
No more use of force Stop all military actions for good Free access to humanitarian aid Georgian troops return to their places of permanent deployment Russian troops to return to pre-conflict positions International talks about security in South Ossetia and Abkhazia
Nato 's Russia dilemma Day - by - day : Georgia - Russia crisis Georgia left reeling Georgia conflict : Key statements
" The Alliance is considering seriously the implications of Russia 's actions for the Nato - Russia relationship , " the statement said , read out by Nato Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer .
" We have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual . "
Mr de Hoop Scheffer added that he could not see how the Nato - Russia Council - set up in 2002 as a framework for dialogue - could convene at this time .
But he said lines of communication would not be abandoned .
" The future of our relations with Russia will depend on the concrete actions Russia will take to abide by the words of President Dmitry Medvedev [ regarding the peace plan ] , which is not happening at the moment , " Mr de Hoop Scheffer said .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
He also said that the member states had agreed to set up a Nato - Georgia commission to strengthen ties with Tbilisi , but stopped short of giving a timetable for Georgia 's accession to Nato .
The Russian military has warned that the withdrawal process will be slow until the weekend at least , and that troops will remain in an undefined buffer zone around South Ossetia .
It says such a move is permitted under the ceasefire deal which allows Russia to take additional security measures until international peacekeepers are deployed .
But Georgia says Moscow is going much further and that Russian troops have seized control of a key commercial port in Poti in an attempt to cripple the Georgian economy .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The sight of GWB [ US President George Bush ] complaining about Russia 's " disproportionate use of force " is hilarious Max , London Earlier , in an apparent goodwill gesture Russia exchanged 15 Georgian prisoners for five of its own troops at a Russian checkpoint in Igoeti , about 30 km ( 18 miles ) from Georgia 's capital .
Georgian officials told the BBC's Helen Fawkes , who was at the scene , that two of the Russian prisoners were airmen who had been shot down by Georgian forces about two weeks ago .
Meanwhile , the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) said Russia and Georgia had agreed to allow 20 extra military observers to be deployed in and around South Ossetia .
In total , the OSCE said it would send up to 100 additional monitors to join the handful it already has in Georgia .
The OSCE has had a presence in South Ossetia since the end of a civil war there in the early 1990s , which resulted in de facto independence for the region .
It also supports a UN - led peace process in Georgia 's other separatist region of Abkhazia .

An outspoken soldier who wrote one of the most brutally honest blogs ever to come out of Iraq has been forced to shut down his site , after criticizing his superior officers one time too often .
In Iraq since December , 2007 , the pseudonymous " LT [ Lieutenant ] G , " described firefights and combat patrols and tribal meetings and the banality of life on base with equal measures of sarcasm , aggression , introspection , and attention to detail .
Within months , his site , Kaboom : A Soldier 's War Journal , became one of the military 's blogosphere 's best - loved voices from the war .
Some of that popularity came from LT G's taste for the absurd .
He described his platoon 's predilections for Lynyrd Skynyrd and the * Aladdin * soundtrack ; a local shiekh 's love of Suzanne Sommers workout videos ; and his moment of absent - mindedness , when he had to be reminded to put on pants before he headed out to the warzone .
But* Kaboom's * mile - a- second monologues could be as searing as they were funny .
And LT G himself was often the target :
I
had given the order to kill .
Haughty enough to condemn two individuals to The End because they had been stupid enough to be fucking seen in a war of shadows .
Somewhere in the time - space continuum , the boy who cried after my first fistfight - not because I was hurt , but because I thought I had done something to upset the instigator and still did n't understand the concept of bullying - hung himself with a calendar rope .
LT G also showed an unusual , almost - reckless disregard for military decorum , openly questioning his superior officers on - line .
A May 1st entry described how his captain 's slow - moving plan to nab a Shi'ite militia leader ultimately let the the extremist slip away .
In a post from April 1st , LT G vented about a mission that never seems to end , " because higher said so .
And no , it does n’t matter that they said so from an air - conditioned TOC [ tactical operations center ] ten klicks away on an eight - hour shift while we sweat through hour 16 of this clusterfuck . "
But in a posting on May 28 , LT G later acknowledged , he went too far .
His superior officers asked him to become the company XO , or executive officer .
LT G demurred .
The response : " an illogical backlash from higher , acting like a spurned teenage blonde whose dreamboat crush tells her point - blank that he prefers brunettes . "
Fine , I ’m not going to make you do it .
( Even though I spent three days trying to do so . )
But you are now on my shit - list , and I want to fuck you over for daring to defy and defying to dare .
A bullshit tasking will eventually come down the pipeline , and I got a rubber stamp with your name on it .
And yes , I know your performance has been outstanding , and we have consistently rated you above your peers , at the top echelon .
Does n’t matter now .
A month later , on June 27th , LT G announced to his audience that " due to a rash posting on my part , and decisions made above my pay - grade , I have been ordered to stop posting on Kaboom , effective immediately ... it was too much unfiltered truth .
I ’m a soldier first , and orders are orders .
So it is . "
A day later , his fiancee wrote that LT G had been ordered to " delete his blog .
I guess no longer posting was n't good enough . "
In the spring of 2007 , the Army passed new regulations about what soldiers could and could not say on - line .
G.I.s were ordered to " consult with their immediate supervisor ... prior to publishing or posting information in a public forum . "
The purpose of these reviews , ostensibly , was to make sure that the soldiers did n't breach operational security , or OPSEC .
But some observers worried that the rules could be used to clamp down on G.I. dissidents , as well – that " weak leaders would use it to shut down strong , but perhaps stubborn , subordinates , " as blogger , retired officer , and Army contractor John Donovan later put it .
Like most military bloggers , Kaboom 's young officer scrupulously observed the Army 's OPSEC rules .
Patrols were described after the fact , and without identifying details .
Officers , towns , and local shiekhs were all given pseudonyms .
He did n't even use his fellow soldiers ' nicknames , making up new ones for the blog , instead .
And so LT G's many admirers smelled the work of a " weak leader , " when his blog was extinguished .
" Too much reality about the bureaucracy and games played .
You are out there getting shot at , and they 're worried about having their mindgames and egos exposed , " one howled .
" Major suck .
Major foul , " cried another .
But some , like * Villainous Company's* " Cassandra , " thought LT G had it coming .
He admits that he broke the rules … .
And yet , many of you are defending an example of an officer who knowingly broke the rules , openly displayed contempt for his senior officers , and then , when the rule he broke was enforced , did n't have the good grace to take his lumps silently but rubbed their noses in it PUBLICLY .
If I had been the field grade in question , the easiest and least embarrassing course of action for me personally would have been to counsel the young man quietly and deal with the post LATER .
However , allowing an officer to deliberately defy regulations and deliberately do what he did is not really an option a responsible senior ought to contemplate .
Donovan , a Kaboom fan , says she has a point .
He wrote , " LT G should have saved the details of that post for his memoir . "

Ah , good old Duck Hunt .
If you owned a Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) , odds are you owned it … as the Super Mario Brothers / Duck Hunt cartridge is the most unbelievably common game released for the NES .
Odds are you also played the game and inevitably missed a few ducks only to have your “ trusty ” dog laugh at you … jerk .
Well , I was going through some of my sketches and found a picture I did of the dog laughing from Duck Hunt and I thought I could use that in a strip .
I wanted to avoid the typical joke of shooting the dog , so I went in a different direction … if the dog ’s going to laugh at its owner in one situation , he ’s going to do that in other situations too .
So I did .
Fragments of Columbia were laid out on a vast concrete floor like broken bones on an autopsy table .
Seared shards , wet with pine needles and caked with mud , were barely recognizable as fuselage , wings , tail and flaps .
Once - sleek contours were crusted with charcoal - colored stove canker .
Wing parts had been honed to a razor ’s edge by superheated gases .
For weeks , wreckage poured into the isolated hangar at Florida ’s Kennedy Space Center -- 27 tractor - trailer loads in all delivered by Lone Star Trucking .
The 50,000 - square - foot hangar sat on a dry hillock in the tidal marsh near the space shuttle landing strip , edged by cattails and pepper trees .
Advertisement
Two shifts a day , six days a week , 150 NASA technicians in white suits , goggles and safety gloves laid out the remains .
They sorted pieces by thickness and arranged parts by serial number when one could be found .
Otherwise , they relied on rivet patterns , burn marks , soot streaks and fracture lines -- anything that would allow them to match one part with the next .
The wreckage had a story to tell , but at first it could barely be heard amid the clamor of so public an inquest .
When the independent Columbia Accident Investigation Board arrived at the hangar , NASA had already arranged the wreckage to suit itself and launched its own forensic analysis .
Advertisement
The rivalry was immediate .
Distrustful of board investigators , NASA technicians withheld information .
They were suspicious of the investigators , who seemed too anxious to publicize discoveries before they had been fully analyzed and too eager to experiment with exotic , expensive techniques .
For their part , board members argued that openness was crucial to maintaining public faith in the investigation .
Findings were to be disclosed as quickly as possible .
NASA had the manpower and the engineering resources .
It controlled access to the site .
Advertisement
But the Columbia board -- led by an uncompromising retired admiral , Hal Gehman -- had impounded the wreckage .
No one could test it without obtaining the board ’s permission .
The board was impatient at NASA ’s overly methodical approach and its resistance to new ideas , said Gregory Kovacs , a Stanford University biomedical engineer who supervised debris analysis for the board .
Suspicions about possible damage to the left wing were so strong , Kovacs said , that it seemed more sensible to devote extra effort to studying its fragments , rather than slowly analyzing all of the debris .
On occasion , board investigators and NASA experts found themselves in shouting matches over the best way to proceed .
Advertisement
It was implicitly an argument over how history would judge what happened .
Slowly , the work moved forward .
Technicians examined 83,900 pieces of the shuttle .
They eventually identified almost 44,000 of them .
“ It was the only physical evidence we had , ” Kovacs said .
“ It was the only ground truth . ”

A key to interpreting the debris in the hangar was Columbia ’s flight data recorder .
The battered recorder had been found in the East Texas pines by a contract firefighter named Chauncy Birdtail .
It was flown to a Minnesota lab for analysis .
The tape was tangled and pinched .
The force of the breakup had jammed the tape reels together .
Solder on the circuit boards had melted .
A large wooden splinter speared the circuits .
Advertisement
It had been more than 30 years since anyone at the lab had routinely worked on 1 - inch tape .
Technicians stretched out the 9,200 feet of tape on a table 30 feet at a time .
They washed it in deionized water , analyzed its 28 recording tracks and then gingerly rewound it by hand .
Board investigator Bruce Darling , 45 , and his colleagues then read the second - by - second testimony of Columbia ’s short circuits and burning wires .
They found that 620 sensors had actually recorded reliable data .
Fortuitously , there were more working sensors on the left wing than anywhere else on the vehicle .
Advertisement
They matched the timing of interruptions in the sensor readings with the physical locations of wires that fed data to the recorder .
By reconstructing the sequence of burning wires , they could follow the heat through the left wing .
The new data established the timing of the accident and , by inference , narrowed the location of the initial wing damage .
Wing sensor V07P8074A -- one of the first to fail during reentry -- also had recorded an unusual spike in pressure 16 days earlier , only 81.9 seconds after liftoff , just about the moment a spinning block of foam hit the leading edge .

Finally the debris , too , pointed to the left wing .
Searchers found 827 pieces of the wing .
Looking for the sense in so much slag , technicians in the reconstruction hangar used a computer database to match fragments against the locations where they were found .
The resulting map revealed that the left wing had disintegrated first , falling to Earth west of Nacogdoches in East Texas .
Advertisement
Metallurgists supervised by board investigator Mark Tanner peeled back layers of slag that coated pieces of the wing to determine which parts of the craft ’s internal frame melted first .
The most thickly coated pieces of debris all came from the left wing .
The investigators also scraped away brown scum from heat - damaged tiles and discovered more quantities of iron and nickel , left no doubt by the melting spar fittings that held insulating panels in place .
With an X - ray scanner , investigators detected tiny globs of metallic spittle embedded in the left side of the fuselage .
Under analysis , the spheres turned out to be sprays of shrapnel from vaporized debris .
Advertisement
By tracing the shrapnel ’s path , they could pinpoint its source : the damaged wing .
No such traces of molten metal were found on the fuselage ’s right side .
In half a dozen ways , the technical evidence converged on the leading edge of the left wing , covered by a series of reinforced carbon - carbon panels , seals and fittings .
There were 22 of these U - shaped panels along each wing .
After heated arguments about the $ 130,000 cost , NASA technicians mounted the fragments of the left wing ’s leading edge on a Lucite frame , like paleontologists reconstructing the skeleton of a dinosaur .
The left wing apparently had been breached along the sharp bend of the delta - shaped span where it angled away from the fuselage .
The pattern of heat damage pointed to wing panels No. 8 and 9 , the largest and most complex of the wing ’s protective leading - edge fittings .
Advertisement
The pattern of circumstantial evidence suggested that the left wing eventually broke off at that midpoint -- a spot where the highest heat of reentry converged with two brutal shock waves generated by aerodynamic forces .
The shock waves , the heat and the falling debris at launch all appeared to center on the same spot along wing panel No. 8 .

Few remember why the shuttle had a delta wing in the first place , but Max Faget does .
Advertisement
At his Houston home , Faget , 82 , sat at his kitchen table with a small poodle named Cleo asleep in his lap -- a shy , wizened man with sky - blue eyes , a narrow chin , a broad , furrowed forehead and ears like lapels .
He nursed a glass of white wine and replayed the story of the shuttle ’s design the way a man who has outlived his wife , his work and his fame will relish the memory of younger , more energetic days .
Like the manned spaceflight program he helped found , Faget had an intuitive flair for engineering and an unshakable self - confidence .
A former college gymnast , he was known to perform handstands on the conference table without missing a beat in his technical presentations .
Advertisement
As a leading architect of human spaceflight , Faget left his stamp on virtually every U.S. manned spacecraft .
He led the team that designed the blunt - bodied Mercury and Gemini space capsules .
He collaborated on the design of the Apollo moon capsule .
His name is on patent documents for the space shuttle system .
By 1969 , NASA had 13 different concepts for a fully reusable shuttle on its drawing boards .
Faget was the chief engineer at NASA ’s Manned Spacecraft Center .
Advertisement
For a space shuttle , Faget had in mind a two - stage reusable rocket plane with enough cargo capacity to resupply a space station .
His design featured short , straight wings like those of a DC - 3 cargo plane and a true tail so the shuttle could maneuver under its own power like an airplane , instead of gliding heavily to the ground like Columbia .
In those plans , Faget proposed that the shuttle minimize the fierce heat of reentry by descending with its nose pointed up at a much steeper angle than the spacecraft that NASA would eventually build .
The craft ’s belly would act like the blunt body of the Mercury and Apollo capsules he designed , spreading the heat more evenly across the broad underside of the spacecraft , rather than concentrating it along the leading edges of the wings .
Advertisement
In 1971 , the purity of the shuttle ’s design collided with the reality of politics .
President Richard M. Nixon informed the space agency that there would be no Mars missions , no space station , no nuclear rocket engines .
The remaining moon missions were canceled not long after .
Unless NASA officials could win the support of the Air Force , there would be no space shuttle either .
That meant NASA had to make more room in the cargo bay for big spy satellites .
It meant NASA had to build a broad delta wing for the craft to carry out maneuvers required for military missions .
All that extra weight meant an even heavier heat - shield system .
Among other things , the extra pounds made it harder to accommodate the weight of crew escape pods or a stronger , more heat - resistant crew compartment .
Advertisement
“ The delta wing was really the price of the space shuttle , ” Faget said .
So enthusiastic was the Air Force about projecting its power into space that it spent $ 3.3 billion to build a shuttle launch facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base north of Los Angeles , as well as a classified mission control complex in Colorado .
No shuttle was ever launched from the facility .
In 1986 , when the Challenger disaster grounded the entire shuttle fleet , the Air Force quickly canceled its manned spaceflight project .
Advertisement
Workers dismantling the discarded launch site by the sea called it “ Abandon - berg . ”
Faget apologized for being slow to remember details .
He had reached a time in his life when the right words no longer came so readily .
“ I can see them , but I ca n’t speak them , ” he said .
Like the space agency he once served , he had slowed and his memory was fading .

At NASA , the men and women who tended the space shuttles were no longer its inventors and innovators .
They were by necessity curators of an operational museum piece .
At least a quarter of NASA ’s scientists and engineers were expected to retire within five years .
Already the people over 60 outnumbered those under 30 by nearly 3 to 1 .
“ People talk about the learning curve , ” said physicist Paul Dimotakis of Caltech .
“ Nobody talks about the forgetting curve . ”
Advertisement
When it came to Columbia , time had made a mockery of NASA ’s institutional memory .
The space agency had millions of technical documents meant to capture the expertise of the thousands of engineers who had designed and built the space shuttle fleet .
Over the years , there had been so many design changes and so little money to document them that thousands of shuttle blueprints appeared to describe a vehicle that no longer existed .
When accident investigators sought out a report documenting details of the shuttle ’s design or performance , they often found only PowerPoint presentations .
Advertisement
Without the knowledgeable voice of the engineers who had originally presented them , the slides were meaningless .
The board ’s investigators soon coined a phrase for this new institutional amnesia .
“ Death by PowerPoint . ”

The Iranian Intelligence Ministry busted a CIA - backed terror group that was planning to bomb scientific , educational , and religious centers , and carry out assassinations , according to a report in the Tehran Times .
The arrests come weeks after Ret. Gen. Thomas McInerney urged the U.S. to carry out terror bombings in Iran .
" The Intelligence Ministry on Saturday released details of the detection and dismantling of a terrorist network affiliated to the United States , " reports the newspaper .
" The United States Central Intelligence Agency comprehensively supported the terrorist group by arming it , training its members , and sponsoring its inhumane activities in Iran , the Intelligence Ministry stated . "
The attack on a religious center in Shiraz last month which killed thirteen people and wounded 190 was blamed on the same group and according to the report , " it also had plans to carry out similar attacks on the Tehran International Book Fair , the Russian Consulate in Gilan Province , oil pipelines in southern Iran , and other targets . "
While it ’s obviously naive to take a report out of Iranian state - controlled media at face value , top Neo -Cons have been calling for the US to back terror groups in Iran and other reports clearly indicate that this program has already been in place for years .
On Friday we reported on the comments of Ret. Gen. Thomas McInerney , who in a Fox News appearance publicly called for the U.S. government to support groups like MEK ( Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization ) , which is listed by the State Department as a terrorist organization , and carry out deadly bombings in Iran .
" Here ’s what I would suggest to you .
Number one , we take the National Council for Resistance to Iran off the terrorist list that the Clinton Administration put them on as well as the Mujahedin-e Khalq at the Camp Ashraf in Iraq , " said McInerney .
" Then I would start a tit - for - tat strategy which I wrote up in the Wall Street Journal a year ago :
For every EFP that goes off and kills Americans , two go off in Iran .
No questions asked .
People do n’t have to know how it was done .
It ’s a covert action .
They become the most unlucky country in the world , " he added .
Last November , Fox and Friends host Brian Kilmeade openly called for US support for acts of terrorism , such as car bombings , in Tehran .
Colonel David Hunt , who has over 29 years of military experience including extensive operational experience in Special Operations , Counter Terrorism and Intelligence Operations , agreed with Kilmeade , stating " absolutely " in response to Kilmead ’s question about whether cars should start blowing up in Tehran .
The U.S. government is already funding MEK and the group has been linked with numerous bombings inside Iran over the course of the last few years .
The organization has also killed U.S. troops and civilians since the 70’s .
According to Global Security.org , " In the early 1970s , angered by U.S. support for the pro-Western shah , MEK members killed several U.S. soldiers and civilians working on defense projects in Iran .
MEK members also supported the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran , in which 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days . "
In addition – British SAS have been caught training insurgents in Iraq to carry out hi-tech bombings that are later blamed on Iran .
Another Iranian - based terror group that the Bush administration is already funding as a means of regime change in Iran is Jundullah – a Sunni Al - Qaeda terrorist group formerly headed by the alleged mastermind of 9/11 , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
" The CIA is giving arms - length support , supplying money and weapons , to an Iranian militant group , Jundullah , which has conducted raids into Iran from bases in Pakistan , " the London Telegraph reported last year .
The group has been blamed for a number of bombings inside Iran aimed at destabilizing Ahmadinejad ’s government and is also active in Pakistan , having been fingered for its involvement in attacks on police stations and car bombings at the Pakistan - US Cultural Center in 2004 .
As award - winning journalist Seymour Hersh reported back in 2004 , U.S. intelligence and Israel ’s Mossad are busy at work stirring up trouble in Iran in preparation for an attack on that country .
In early 2005 , the Guardian reported that “ American special forces have been on the ground inside Iran scouting for US air strike targets for suspected nuclear weapons sites . "

The mystery of what killed off the Neanderthals about 30,000 years ago comes a step closer to being solved with a study suggesting that they formed a tiny population that had been teetering on the brink of extinction .
Neanderthals first appeared in Europe at least 300,000 years ago but they disappeared after the arrival of anatomically modern humans , Homo sapiens , who first arrived in Europe 50,000 years ago .
This has led to speculation about whether the Neanderthals interbred with the new arrivals to form a hybrid population that became submerged in the human gene pool , or were instead wiped out by them , either through competition for resources or by violence .
The latest evidence , an analysis of DNA recovered from a 38,000 - year - old fossilised thigh bone , suggests the Neanderthals did not interbreed with modern humans but were eradicated by them .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
DNA extracted from an adult Neanderthal man who lived near caves in what is now Croatia also revealed that the Neanderthals in Europe probably never numbered more than 10,000 individuals at any one time – a precariously small population size .
The new evidence about the demise of the Neanderthals comes from the complete sequence of DNA within tiny cellular structures known as mitochondria .
This mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited and is easier to isolate from ancient bones than the conventional DNA found within the cell nucleus .
The scientists repeatedly decoded the mitochondrial DNA from the 38,000 - year - old Neanderthal bone 35 times to make sure that they had the correct genetic sequence , so that they could use it as an accurate comparison against the mitochondrial DNA of modern humans and chimpanzees – man 's closest living relative
" For the first time , we 've built a sequence from ancient DNA that is essentially without error , " said Richard Green , who led the investigation at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
" It is still an open question for the future whether this small group of Neanderthals was a general feature , or was this caused by some bottleneck in their population size that happened late in the game , " said Dr Green .
Archaeological evidence shows that Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans , known as Cro-Magnon man , occupied the same habitats and sites at overlapping periods of time but there is no hard evidence that there was any direct contact between the two last species of humans to share living space .
" There 's no proof that they saw each other , only that they inhabited the same place at about the same time but I think it 's likely that they came across one another , " said Adrian Briggs , a researcher at the Max Planck Institute , who was part of the study .

" What we 've done is confirm that the mitochondrial DNA of Neanderthals and modern humans was so different that it forms powerful evidence that there was very little if any interbreeding between the two species , " said Dr Briggs .
" We have also got tantalising evidence that the Neanderthals formed a small population and we can only speculate as to what happened to them .
Small population sizes are always more prone to extinction and they have a greater chance of something going wrong . "
Speculation about who the Neanderthals were , and what happened to them , has raged ever since the first Neanderthal skull was excavated from the Neander Valley , near Düsseldorf , in 1856 .
It is now generally agreed that they were not the direct ancestors of modern humans but a side - branch on man 's extensive family tree .
However , some anthropologists have clung to the belief that they must have interbred with humans at some stage in their history , which means that there is a little bit of Neanderthal in us all .
However , a number of DNA studies , including the latest published in the journal Cell , have found little to support that theory .
Whenever it has been possible to analyse the sequence of heavily degraded DNA fragments extracted from Neanderthal bone , it shows that the genetic variation lies well outside the variation seen in modern humans .
The latest study suggests , for instance , that the Neanderthals last shared a common ancestor with modern humans some 660,000 years ago – long before the emergence in Africa of Homo sapiens as a distinct species about 100,000 years ago .
However , the scientists who carried out the study emphasised that their work cannot as yet completely rule out the possibility that there was some limited , small - scale interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans , at some place between the Caucasus and western Europe – the geographic range of the Neanderthals .
One of the best bits of evidence in support of that idea emerged about a decade ago when scientists found the skeleton of a young boy who had died about 25,000 years ago in what is now Spain .
His thick - set features suggested he was hybrid of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon – but other scientists believed he was just an unusually stocky lad .
There is little doubt that Neanderthals would have looked very different from the new arrivals in Europe .
Their rib cage flared out , so they would have had no waists , which would have exaggerated their thick - set appearance .
Heavy jaws , a double arch over the eyebrow resulting in a beetle brow and strong muscles added to the overall thuggish look .
But despite the reputation for being thick , Neanderthals were intelligent – they used quite sophisticated stone tools , controlled fire , wore animal skins and buried their dead .
The presence of a hyoid bone in their throats also suggested they could speak , although few experts believe that they were capable of the sophisticated language being developed at the time by early modern humans .
Professor Chris Stringer , head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London , believes that the long period of separation – and genetic isolation – between the Neanderthals and early modern humans meant that profound physical and mental differences had evolved between them .
" The question then is whether , when the populations met , they regarded each other as simply people , enemies , aliens or even prey , " he said .
" We simply do n't know the answer , and the answer may have varied from one time and place to another , especially given the vagaries of human behaviour . "
We may never know what happened when modern humans came to live in the same space inhabited by the Neanderthals .
They may simply have avoided one another , with Neanderthals retreating to their last stronghold in Europe – a cave system in Gibraltar where the most recent Neanderthal bones have been found .
Or the two species might have engaged in the sort of brutal conflict that has been the hallmark of human history throughout time .
Genetic differences
Neanderthal Man
Heavy jawbone and beetle brow would have made him look like a rugby player on steroids .
Flared rib cage meant he did not have a defined waistline .
Strong muscles would have added to his thick - set appearance .
Used stone tools , controlled fire and buried his dead but little evidence for more symbolic behaviour .
Presence of hyoid bone in the throat suggests the use of speech , but experts doubt that language was sophisticated .
Well adapted to cold conditions , with short limbs and heavy torso , which would have helped to survive the successive ice ages in Europe .
Modern Man
Graceful chin and jaw and lack of a double arch over the eyebrow gives his face a softer appearance .
Tapering rib cage separated the lower abdomen from the chest , giving a marked waistline .
Used sophisticated stone tools , controlled fire and buried their dead with ritual .
Indicates the development of symbolic thought and being able to plan for the future .
Hyoid bone indicates speech as an important feature in terms ofsocial organisation .
Gracile limbs and body indicates adaptation to a warm climate .
Iranian president says no war with US , Israel The Associated Press
Published : Tuesday July 8 , 2008
Print This Email This By VIJAY JOSHI KUALA LUMPUR , Malaysia - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Tuesday that he sees no possibility of a war between his country and the United States or Israel .
" I assure you that there wo n't be any war in the future , " Ahmadinejad told a news conference during a visit to Malaysia for a summit of developing Muslim nations .
Ahmadinejad 's comments came less than 24 hours after Iran 's Revolutionary Guards announced that its forces were carrying out a military drill involving " missile squads " and warned that the country would retaliate against any military strike by targeting Tel Aviv and U.S. warships in the Gulf .
Iranian officials have been issuing a mix of conciliatory and bellicose statements in recent weeks about the possibility of a clash with the U.S. and Israel .
Ahmadinejad also predicted Israel would collapse without Iranian action .
The Israelis " are a complex political group , but you should know this regime will be eventually destroyed and there is no need of any measure by Iranian people , " he said when asked to comment on whether he has called for the destruction of Israel .
Ahmadinejad has in the past called for Israel 's elimination .
But his exact remarks have been disputed .
Some translators say he called for Israel to be " wiped off the map , " but others say that would be better translated as " vanish from the pages of time "  implying Israel would disappear on its own rather than be destroyed .
Ahmadinejad also said Tuesday that the next U.S. administration " would need at least 30 years in order to compensate , renovate and innovate the damages done by Mr. Bush . "
" Today , the government of the United States is on the threshold of bankruptcy  from political to economic , " Ahmadinejad said .
" The greatest threat in the Middle East and the whole world ... is the United States ' intervention in other countries , " Ahmadinejad said .
He urged Washington to heal its image by " relying on ( the ) basis of justice , humanitarian acts and respect for human beings . "
For months , Ahmadinejad and other Iranian officials have said they do n't believe the U.S. will attack because of its difficulties in Iraq , domestic worries and concerns over the fallout in the region .
At the same time , Tehran has stepped up its warnings of retaliation if the Americans  or Israelis  do attack it , including threats to hit Israel and U.S. Gulf bases with missiles and stop oil traffic through the vital Gulf region .
The Web site of the elite Iranian force posted a statement late Monday quoting guard official Ali Shirazi as saying that Iran would retaliate against any military strike by targeting Tel Aviv and U.S. warships in the Gulf .
" The Zionist regime is pushing the White House to prepare for a military strike on Iran , " Shirazi was quoted as saying .
" If such a stupidity is done by them , Tel Aviv and the U.S. naval fleet in the Persian Gulf will be the first targets which will be set on fire in Iran 's crushing response . "
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev would not comment on Shirazi 's warning other than to say " his words speak for themselves . "
State Department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said such statements by Iran were " unfortunately ... not out of the norm . "
" We continue to stress our desire to resolve this issue diplomatically , " Gallegos added .
Israel 's military sent warplanes over the eastern Mediterranean for a large military exercise in June that U.S. officials described as a possible rehearsal for a strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities , which the West fears are aimed at producing atomic weapons .
The U.S. Navy 's Fifth Fleet , headquartered in the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain , is responsible for patrolling the Gulf , the Suez Canal and parts of the Indian Ocean .
Shirazi is a cleric who represents supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the guards ' naval force .
Khamenei has the final say over all state matters .
The Guards '
Web site also announced late Monday that forces were carrying out a military drill involving " missile squads , " but did not say where it was taking place .
Iran 's guards and national army hold regular exercises two or three times a year , but the statement did not say whether this drill was one of them or if it was a special exercise .

Update : Just as I was writing / releasing my patch , Matt Brown apparently committed r38 ( diff ) to the Google App Engine Helper for Django source tree which resolves the same issue -- and much more simply and elegantly than my solution , by using Django 's own settings file .
Use Matt 's solution instead of my patch .
Original post follows :
The Google App Engine Helper for Django is an excellent library if you want to build Django apps on Google App Engine .
I 've been using it without any hassles on the new Singularity Web Conference site .
One thing that it currently lacks , however , is a way to specify dev_appserver options ( like smtp_host and smtp_port , for example ) when you start the server .
So I got into the lazy habit of using dev_appserver .py to start the server when I needed to test email functionality and using ./ manage .py runserver at other times .
Do n't do this ! :)
It started tripping me up because the two use different datastore instances .
So I would do dumb things like run the server using dev_appserver.py and then start a shell with ./ manage .py shell and wonder why certain entities were not in the datastore .
Doh ! :)
Instead , I 'd recommend that you use manage .py for everything .
The problem then remains , how do you pass options to manage .
py ?
Well , I just bit the bullet and added that functionality to the Google App Engine Helper for Django .
Here 's the patch ( runserver.patch.zip , 1 kb ) .
After you apply it to your appengine_django folder , you will be able to pass the smtp_host and smtp_port options to the server just like you can with dev_appserver.py .
For example :
./manage.py runserver --smtp_host=localhost --smtp_port=5000 192.168.1.2:8080
Alvin M. Marks , a prolific inventor who held patents on polarized film for sunglasses , a 3 - D moviemaking process , a generator the size of a grapefruit that could produce enough electricity for a house , a windmill with no moving parts and a trillion - dollar “ space train , ” died Sunday in Gardner , Mass .
He was 97 and lived in Athol , Mass .
The cause was liver and pancreatic cancer , said Molly Bennett Aitken , his former wife .
A man capable of both small - bore pragmatism and large - scale imagination , Mr. Marks held 122 patents .
An expert in optics , he developed several variants of polarized film that were used in sunglasses and to reduce glare on television screens ; a headlight system to aid night driving ; and window panels that change gradually from transparent to opaque and back again .
In 1951 , he was granted a patent for a “ three - dimensional intercommunicating system ” that could be used to make TV shows and movies .
He was president for many years of the Marks Polarized Corporation , based in the Whitestone section of Queens , where , along with his brother , Mortimer , who died in 2006 , he invented many improvements on his original device , even though three - dimensional moviemaking never became the widespread technique he hoped it would .
For much of the latter half of his career , Mr. Marks focused on developing alternative and low - cost energy sources .
An early experimenter with solar energy , he served as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy , and in 1967 was a consultant to the United States Senate on new technologies .

The facial features told excavators they were on to something very new
Enlarge Image
Archaeologists digging in Turkey have found the colossal marble head of a Roman empress .
It was discovered in a rubble - filled building where parts of a huge statue of the emperor Hadrian were unearthed last year .
The discovery , at the ancient site of Sagalassos , is thought to show Faustina the Elder , wife of Roman emperor Antoninus Pius .
Sagalassos was once an important urban centre .
It was abandoned after being hit by several strong earthquakes .
A team led by Marc Waelkens , from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium , has been excavating the site since 1990 .
The head of Faustina was lying face down in rubble that fills the ruins of a bath house that was partially destroyed by an earthquake between AD 540 and AD 620 .
It was unearthed just 6 m from the spot where the Hadrian statue was found , but was sitting higher up in the rubble .
Emperor 's line
At first , exacavators thought they had found a statue belonging to Hadrian 's wife , Vibia Sabina , who was forced into a marriage with the homosexual emperor at the age of 14 .
But when they turned it over , the face was very different from the usual depictions of Sabina .
This was a more mature woman with fleshy lips and a distinctive hairstyle .
Experts said most of the features of the head identify the woman as Faustina the Elder .
She married Hadrian 's successor as emperor and adopted son , Antoninus Pius .
Faustina was well respected , especially for her charity work .
She enjoyed a happy marriage to Antoninus which lasted 31 years until her death in AD 141 .
In her memory , Antoninus formally deified her as a goddess .
The building in which the statues were found at Sagalassos was probably a " frigidarium " - a room with a cold pool which Romans could dip into after a hot bath .
It is part of a larger bath complex that is being carefully uncovered by archaeologists .
The fragments were found not on the floor of the frigidarium - beneath the rubble from the earthquake - but higher up in the debris pile .
More discoveries
This suggests they did not originally stand in this room , but were hauled there from elsewhere in the bath complex - probably from the " Kaisersaal " , or emperor 's room .
They speculate that the Kaisersaal once hosted statues of Hadrian , Faustina the Elder and other members of Rome 's so - called Antonine dynasty - many of whom belonged to a Spanish or southern French provincial aristocracy .
The Hadrian statue was probably brought to the frigidarium either to remove its gilded armour or to be burned to cement in a nearby kiln .
The fragments are now on display at the exhibition Hadrian : Empire and Conflict at the British Museum in London .
But the frigidarium did have colossal statues of its own .
On the floor of the room , experts have found the front parts of two huge female feet , surrounded by mosaics that follow the contours of the statue 's long dress .

" It 's not uncommon to find insects in amber ... but I 'm not sure that one has turned up on eBay that has been undiscovered before .
It 's a rather unusual route to come by , " said Dr Harrington .
The Differences Between Mercurial and Git
I realized recently that I 've been using distributed revision control for several years now .
It 's always been an exciting landscape for me , although it 's been a bit lonely .
I used gnu arch for most of my code for a long time , and dabbled some in darcs at the same time .
It was n't until I saw Brian O'Sullivan 's tech talk on mercurial that I started wondering if my needs were n't being fully met .
He showed what mercurial provided that my systems lacked and provided a generally useful tool , so I dove in and enjoyed it greatly .
Neither darcs nor gnu arch were particularly fast systems , but they did a reasonably good job .
The most obvious difference between them was that darcs had a really nice UI , and the philosophy of gnu arch was all but against having a useful interface .
The idea was that it was something on which revision control systems could be built , and was n't so much one on its own .
I heard about git on the darcs list a while back , but did n't see what it provided that was so great .
In its early days it was ... well , considered difficult enough to use that only the sickest bothered .
Once git started rising in popularity , I tried to understand what it had to offer that I was missing .
Linus Torvalds ' tech talk on git seemed to just be selling distributed systems ( and pretty much said mercurial was decent ) .
Randal Schwartz 's git talk promised to tell me why I should use it instead of CVS , Subversion , SVK , Arch , Darcs , Mercurial , Monotone , Bazaar , and just about every other repository manager , but I did n't really get the impression he 'd actually used any of these to compare with .
Certainly did n't convince me .
But I eventually did start looking at git , only because there were projects to which I contribute that also use git .
I 've been taking the time to fully understand it and its ways and explored much of its dirty parts ( but I 'm not quite done yet ) .
So now I feel I can start writing a bit about the differences I 've encountered .
Technical Differences
The primary difference between distributed systems and centralized systems is in granularity .
i.e. in a centralized system , there 's no distinction between saving a change and making it available .
In this regard , git is more granular than mercurial .
There are lots of small parts that work together .
It 's possible for this to be mostly transparent to the user , but as we 've seen in comparing the difference between centralized and distributed , it can be very beneficial in creating new types of workflows .
History is a DAG
In both git and mercurial , the history is just a directed acyclic graph , but mercurial attempts to provide a linear history and this has a negative effect in a few places .
For one , the rev number is displayed a lot and people try to use it , but it varies from repo to repo and probably does little more than cause confusion .
git will show you from a particular point all of the changesets that led up to it by following the history backwards , but otherwise it represents what happens in the real world .
From a given point , there 's a change .
That change may be desirable or may not be .
It may have been at one point , but is n't any longer .
The only thing that matters is a head .
And I believe this is where mercurial has gone wrong .
A head in mercurial is inferred ... it 's just a point on the DAG where there are no children .
A branch is inferred to be inactive when it 's not a head .
Contrast to git where all heads are explicit .
A tag or a branch points to a particular node in the graph , and there are tools to compare the changes between two nodes .
This is obviously right for tags , but it 's also really nice for heads .
You can simply dump mass changesets into another repo ( for example in a mob branch ) , but only include heads you feel are worth noting .
It 's this distinction that allows for private branches .
Mutability Tools
The culture of mercurial is one of immutability .
This is quite a good thing , and it's one of my favorite aspects of gnu arch .
If I commit something , I like to know that it 's going to be there .
Because of this , there are no tools to manipulate history by default .
git is all about manipulating history .
There 's rebase , commit amend , reset , filter - branch , and probably other commands I 'm not thinking of , many of which make it into day - to - day workflows .
Then again , there 's reflog , which adds a big safety net around this mutability .
Branch Management
I heard many people say they felt git handled branches better , but nobody could explain why .
I 've described the foundation above , but I 'll go into more detail here .
In mercurial there are two types of branches you might see as a user : named branches and repository clones .
Cloning a repository is how you branch in darcs and is a really simple concept .
When you want to do something different , you just clone your repo somewhere else and start working .
Named branches allow you to have a workflow where you can switch back and forth between branches in the same working directory .
However , named branches are flawed .
In mercurial , every changeset belongs to a named branch .
That is , the branch name is stored in the changeset .
The flaw is that it 's quite easy to have more than one branch with the same name , and it 's difficult to tell when this has happened .
This can cause confusion in a team where one is left wondering what changes , exactly , have made it into the stable branch when multiple people have reopened and merged the branch on different timelines .
Also , because the branch name is in the changeset , the branch lives forever .
The only short - term branches are clone branches .
That just does n't encourage quick experiments .
In git , a branch is just a head ( see above ) .
Making changes to a branch actually moves the pointer to the new changeset .
This head must be explicitly shared across repositories .
In practice , this drops the cost down to approximately zero .
You wo n't accidentally push code you do n't mean to .
You wo n't have to be reminded of a failed experiment for the rest of your life , and you wo n't have to fear naming them in such a way that they do n't collide with something someone else has done somewhere else .
Interoperability Tools
Mercurial has the convert extension , which does a great job of converting repositories from some other system to mercurial .
It 's clean , consistent , and fast .
git has a variety of tools for common systems , some of which are bidirectional .
Not many of them seem similar to each other ( mob design ) , but the most common ones get the best treatment .
git -svn , in particular , is so good it 's evil .
Some of my earliest experiences with git involved cloning an svn repo , creating a git branch of an svn branch , doing various changes there , git merging svn trunk on top of it , doing more changes , and pushing all that work as individual changesets back onto svn .
That 's good stuff and just should n't work .
There 's a similar tool for CVS , but neither really makes up for a proper distributed system .
You can do all your work in your git tree , but the git tree itself can't be meaningfully cloned ( e.g. you ca n't train svn or cvs to merge ) .
Non-Technical Differences
The biggest non-technical difference between git and mercurial is the rabid culture surrounding git .
mercurial users fairly happily and quietly use their tool , while I 've had to send two separate door - to - door git missionaries away today alone .
While popularity is a terrible reason to use something , it 's contributed a lot to making git a usable system , and you can see this happening on the mailing list .
Take a quick look at some recent posts .
There 's generally more development going on on that list than discussion .
And along came github .
There was repo.or.cz before that , and gitorious is also quite nice , but github has made people really want it .
Tons of people signing up constantly , tons of projects entered , and a very easy way to contribute to these projects .
Although mercurial may still feel nicer today , the change feels inevitable .
This flood of people leaving centralized systems means that it's way easier to contribute to their projects than ever before .
This is the important part .
In the end , we all win either way .
Stinky Tofu : And the Same To You Too !
What is stinky tofu and why is it such a popular treat in Taiwan , Indonesia and China ?
Stinky tofu , which is actually a form of fermented tofu , is manufactured and prepared in a myriad of ways depending on the region where it is sold .
The strong odor is formidable to say the very least and not for the faint of heart .
Stinky tofu is a very popular snack in East and Southeast Asia where it is easily found with no place to hide at night markets or roadside stands .
The words , “ stinky tofu ” ,  are a direct translation from the Mandarin term , “ chou doufu ” .
Chou does not translate negatively , like stinky , and is considered a description rather than a judgment of the unmistakable odor .
Usually marinated in a brine made from fermented vegetables for as long as several months , the potent marinade can also include greens , bamboo shoots , herbs and dried shrimp .
Once , stinky tofu was a military staple for soldiers patrolling China ’s borders .
From a distance , it is said that rotting garbage is as close as one can come to describing the smell of stinky tofu .
Some also say “ baby poo ”  and “ hellacious ”  come a bit closer .
Its flavor is very mild , and some claim it is similar to blue cheese ( on non-garbage , pick - up days ) , Afficianados swear that the worse it smells , the better the flavor .
Stinky tofu can be steamed , eaten cold , stewed or fried , which is the most common form of preparation .
Usually served with a chili sauce on the side , the color of stinky tofu varies from golden fried to the black typical of Hunan - style preparation .
In Hong Kong , stinky tofu is a trademark street food along with fish and beef balls , which are deep fried and eaten with hoisin sauce .
Sold by the bag , it is guaranteed to contain almost enough grease to oil a diesel truck .
Is stinky tofu for you ?
I guess that all depends .
How do you feel about perfume and deodorant ?

Check out a simultaneously refreshing and infuriating article about American drinking - age laws from CNN .
It 's nice to see that adults are finally starting to approach this absurd law , given the near impossibility of a youth - led effort at liberalization in this area
( " We should be allowed to drink as much as we want , we 're responsible enough ! ! ! " ) .
But in reading the article , I noticed something wonderfully irritating :
But critics say McCardell has badly misrepresented the research by suggesting that the decision to raise the drinking age from 18 to 21 may not have saved lives .
In fact , MADD CEO Chuck Hurley said , nearly all peer - reviewed studies looking at the change showed raising the drinking age reduced drunk - driving deaths .
A survey of research from the U.S. and other countries by the Centers for Disease Control and others reached the same conclusion .
This is a paradigm instance of pointing to a piece of evidence in isolation without considering the mechanism by which it would come about .
As a 22 - year old who has been able to observe underage drinking in its natural habitat for several years , I can attest to the fact that the illegality of drinking between the ages of 18 and 21 almost certainly resulted in fewer instances of drunk driving among people I knew .
But the reason for this has nothing to do with people within this age range drinking less .
Believe me , we drank plenty ; probably a whole lot more than we would have if we had been going to the bars and paying vastly inflated prices to get alcohol .
We messed up and damaged our parents ' houses , some of us drank until we could n't drink any more , and some us incorporated a pretty fair deal of pot into the process .
We learned to orient our fun around drinking ; we got better at all the drinking games , and played them more often and with greater enthusiasm as a result ; we never had to worry about what adults would think of us , since they were never around when it happened , and so never learned to be " presentably drunk " ; it became cool to drink a lot , and to be able to drink a lot ; we made friends with the people who had the alcohol , even if they were n't always the greatest people ; luckily , I never personally had to deal with sexual assault among my friends when I was underage , but I would imagine it 's a whole lot easier to assault someone at a high school or college house party than it is at a bar .
But largely , we did n't drive home drunk .
That 's because we were at our friends ' houses , and we could always sleep there if we did n't have a ride .
There was no bartender to force us to leave .
So there you have it : the seen and the unseen .
The seen : we did n't drive home drunk as often as we probably would have if drinking had been legal , and so fewer of us were lost to car crashes .
The unseen : many more of us were likely sexually abused , many more of us developed patterns of alcoholism or became full - blown alcoholics , many of us likely failed to learn how to integrate responsible drinking with an adult lifestyle until we were already well into adulthood , and many of us probably used other drugs which we may not have if we had been exposed to the less drug - oriented bar scene .
There you have it , Mothers Against Drunk Driving .
Even by your own standards , where 18 year olds are somehow incapable of deciding whether or not to drink , but can decide to get addicted to cigarettes , sign up to go to war , participate in the democratic process , and go off to college to live on their own , it 's not clear that your draconian goals are being advanced by your draconian policy .
Of course , I do n't think that the federal government should have anything at all to do with determining whether someone should be allowed to drink or not .
Even if you do believe that there is a role for drinking - age laws , it 's not clear why a centralized national solution is necessary to bring them about .
And of course , if you do n't think that drinking - age laws are desirable , obviously you wo n't want the federal government to have anything to do with them .
So the best - case solution , I think , would be for the federal government to completely get out of this particular policy arena .
Decouple road funding ( which probably should n't have anything to do with the federal government either , but that 's a separate discussion ) from drinking - age laws , and wash your hands of the whole thing .
But if the government is going to insist on having its own set of rules , the lower the better !
As is so often the case , the alleged benefits of the existing policy come along with a host of unintended consequences , which in this case are particularly pernicious .
But that should n't be surprising to anyone ; after all , it 's the government we 're talking about !
JOLIET , Ill . 
A top General Motors executive said Thursday that automakers were “ deserving ” of as much as $ 50 billion in government - backed loans so that they can build more fuel - efficient cars .
G.M. ’s vice chairman , Robert A. Lutz , said the car companies need money to retool their plants but probably cannot raise enough capital on their own because of the tight credit markets .
He said the automakers have already made considerable progress in transforming themselves and that the government should help them proceed faster .
“ The American auto industry is deserving of government loan guarantees , ” Mr. Lutz told reporters at an event near Chicago where G.M. showed off its 2009 lineup .
“ We have done a whole bunch of things that people said , ‘ Why are n’t you doing this ? ’ ”
The automakers , along with the United Automobile Workers union and Michigan lawmakers , are urging Congress to appropriate $ 3.75 billion to back the $ 25 billion in loans authorized last year .
The human species now has drinking partners .
German scientists have discovered that seven species of small mammals in the rain forests of western Malaysia drink fermented palm nectar on a regular basis .
For several of the species , including the pen-tailed tree shrew , the nectar , which can have an alcohol content approaching that of beer , is the major food source  meaning they are chronic drinkers .
Frank Wiens and Annette Zitzmann of the University of Bayreuth were separately studying two of the species , including their eating habits .
They discovered that the nectar of the bertam palm becomes fermented by yeast carried on the flower buds .

The pen-tailed tree shrew , in particular , takes advantage of it .
By watching the animal and analyzing fur samples , the researchers estimated that the tree shrews consumed enough alcohol that they had about a 36 percent chance of being intoxicated ( by human standards ) .
But the researchers never saw any signs of inebriation , and from an evolutionary standpoint , it makes no sense to be drunk anyway .
With predators all around , Dr. Wiens said , “ it ’s just too risky for an animal . ”
Viktor Sarianidi , barefoot at dawn , surveys the treeless landscape from a battered lawn chair in the Kara - Kum desert of Turkmenistan .
" The mornings here are beautiful , " he says , gesturing regally with his cane , his white hair wild from sleep .
" No wife , no children , just the silence , God , and the ruins . "
Where others see only sand and scrub , Sarianidi has turned up the remnants of a wealthy town protected by high walls and battlements .
This barren place , a site called Gonur , was once the heart of a vast archipelago of settlements that stretched across 1,000 square miles of Central Asian plains .
Although unknown to most Western scholars , this ancient civilization dates back 4,000 years — to the time when the first great societies along the Nile , Tigris - Euphrates , Indus , and Yellow rivers were flourishing .
Thousands of people lived in towns like Gonur with carefully designed streets , drains , temples , and homes .
To water their orchards and fields , they dug lengthy canals to channel glacier - fed rivers that were impervious to drought .
They traded with distant cities for ivory , gold , and silver , creating what may have been the first commercial link between the East and the West .
They buried their dead in elaborate graves filled with fine jewelry , wheeled carts , and animal sacrifices .
Then , within a few centuries , they vanished .
News of this lost civilization began leaking out in the 1970s , when archaeologists came to dig in the southern reaches of the Soviet Union and in Afghanistan .
Their findings , which were published only in obscure Russian - language journals , described a culture with the tongue - twisting name Bactria - Margiana Archaeological Complex .
Bactria is the old Greek name for northern Afghanistan and the northeast corner of Iran , while Margiana is further north , in what is today Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan .
Through the region runs the Amu Dar'ya River , which was known in Greek history as the Oxus River .
Western scholars subsequently used that landmark to dub the newly found culture the Oxus civilization .
The initial trickle of information dried up in 1979 when the revolution in Iran and war in Afghanistan locked away the southern half of the Oxus .
Later , with the 1990 fall of the Soviet Union , many Russian archaeologists withdrew from Central Asia .
Undeterred , Sarianidi and a handful of other archaeologists soldiered on , unearthing additional elaborate structures and artifacts .
Because of what they have found , scholars can no longer regard ancient Central Asia as a wasteland notable primarily as the origin of nomads like Genghis Khan .
In Sarianidi 's view , this harsh land of desert , marsh , and steppe may instead have served as a center in a broad , early trading network , the hub of a wheel connecting goods , ideas , and technologies among the earliest of urban peoples .
Harvard University archaeologist Carl Lamberg - Karlovsky believes the excavation at Gonur is " a major event of the late 20th century , " adding that Sarianidi deserves credit for discovering the lost Oxus culture and for his " 30 consecutive years of indefatigable excavations . "
To some other researchers , however , Sarianidi seems more desert eccentric than dispassionate scholar .
For starters , his techniques strike many colleagues as brutish and old - fashioned .
These days Western archaeologists typically unearth sites with dental instruments and mesh screens , meticulously sifting soil for traces of pollen , seeds , and ceramics .
Sarianidi uses bulldozers to expose old foundations , largely ignores botanical finds , and publishes few details on layers , ceramics , and other mainstays of modern archaeology .
His abrasive personality has n't helped his cause , either .
" Everyone opposes me because I alone have found these artifacts , " he thunders during a midday break .
" No one believed anyone lived here until I came ! "
He bangs the table with his cane for emphasis .
Sarianidi is accustomed to the role of outsider .
As a Greek growing up in Tashkent , Uzbekistan , under Stalinist rule , he was denied training in law and turned to history instead .
Ultimately , it proved too full of groupthink for his taste , so he opted for archaeology .
" It was more free because it was more ancient , " he says .
During the 1950s he drifted , spending seasons between digs unemployed .
He refused to join the Communist Party , despite the ways it might have helped his career .
Eventually , in 1959 , his skill and tenacity earned him a coveted position at the Institute of Archaeology in Moscow , but it was years before he was allowed to direct a dig .
The ancient Oxus culture may have arisen at sites like Anau , a settlement at the base of the Kopet - Dag mountains , which dates back to 6500 B.C. Later settlements like Gonur , roughly 4,000 years old , may have been founded by people from the Kopet - Dag cultures .
NASA
When he finally received permission to run his own excavations , Sarianidi worked in northern Afghanistan during the relatively peaceful decades of the 1960s and 1970s .
His most famous discovery there came just before the Soviet invasion in 1979 .
His team uncovered an astounding hoard of gold jewelry in the graves of Bactrian nomads who lived around the first century A.D.
But the region 's mysterious Bronze Age sites , dating to the second and third millennia B.C. , intrigued Sarianidi more .
His excavations revealed thick - walled structures built with regular proportions and a distinctive style of art .
Most scholars had thought that such sophisticated settlements had not taken root in the region until more than 1,000 years later .
Sarianidi had long suspected that similar sites might be found beneath a collection of strange mounds he had glimpsed during a 1950s trip in the Kara - Kum desert , a barren region in the middle of eastern Turkmenistan .
Later , during a brief visit to a colleague 's dig in that area in the mid-1970s , he commandeered a car and driver to investigate the site more closely .
It was June , he recalled , and the heat was so overpowering he had to overcome an urge to turn back .
Then , not far from the rough road , he spotted mounds rising up from the plain .
In treeless areas , such geographic features often indicate ancient settlements formed from mud-brick structures that later human occupation has compressed over time into artificial hills .
The site covered so much land that Sarianidi assumed it dated from medieval times .
So he was astonished to find pottery resembling what he had found in ancient Bactria .
When the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan forced him and other archaeologists to relocate to other areas of interest , Sarianidi remembered this site , which locals call Gonur , and determined to return .
In the early 1980s , he came back to Turkmenistan , working at Gonur and other sites .
What he has uncovered at Gonur is a central citadel — nearly 350 by 600 feet — surrounded by a high wall and towers , set within another vast wall with square bastions , which in turn is surrounded by an oval wall enclosing large water basins and many buildings .
Canals from the Murgab River , which once flowed nearby , provided water for drinking and irrigation .
The scale and organization of this construction was unmatched in Central Asia until the Persians ' arrival in the sixth century B.C .
Sarianidi's team has also turned up intricate jewelry incorporating gold , silver , lapis lazuli , and carnelian .
The prowess of the Oxus metalworkers — who used tin alloys and delicate combinations of gold and silver — were on par with the skills of their more famous contemporaries in Egypt , Mesopotamia , and the Indus Valley , Lamberg - Karlovsky says .
Their creations display a rich repertoire of geometric designs , mythic monsters , and other creatures .
Among them are striking humanoid statues with small heads and wide skirts , as well as horses , lions , snakes , and scorpions .
Wares in this distinctive style had long been found in regions as distant as Mesopotamia to the west , the shores of the Persian Gulf to the south , the Russian steppes to the north , and the great cities of Harappa and Mohenjo Daro , which once flourished to the east — on the banks of the Indus River of today 's Pakistan .
Archaeologists had puzzled over their origin .
Sarianidi's excavations seem to solve the puzzle :
These items originated in the region around Gonur .
With the collapse of the Soviet Union , a handful of Western researchers got word of Sarianidi 's finds and began to investigate for themselves .
Fredrik Hiebert , a young American graduate student , learned Russian , visited Gonur in 1988 , and then a few years later returned with his Harvard adviser , Lamberg - Karlovksy .
A team of Italians followed to dig at nearby sites and to examine Gonur 's extensive cemetery .
The Westerners brought an array of modern archaeological techniques , from radiocarbon dating to archaeobotany .
U.S. labs determined that the early phase of the Gonur settlement dated to 2000 B.C. — five centuries earlier than Sarianidi had initially postulated — and that the people grew a wide variety of crops , including wheat , barley , lentils , grapes , and fleshy fruits .
The archaeological record shows that the site was inhabited for only a few centuries .
The people of Gonur may simply have followed the shifting course of the Murgab River to found new towns located to the south and west .
Their descendants may have built the fabled city of Merv to the south , for millennia a key stop along the Silk Road .
Warfare among the Oxus people could have undermined the fragile system of oasis farming , or nomads from the steppes may have attacked the rich settlements .
Sarianidi has found evidence that extensive fires destroyed some of Gonur 's central buildings and that they were never rebuilt .
Whatever the cause , within a short period Oxus settlements declined in number and size , and the Oxus pottery and jewelry styles vanished from the archaeological record .
The large and square mud-brick architecture of the Gonur people may live on , however , in the clan compounds of Afghanistan and in the old caravansaries — rest stops for caravans — that dot the landscape from Syria to China .
Jewelry , carved images of wheat , and the remnants of a stone eagle are among the artifacts from an apparent royal burial at Gonur .

Why the Oxus culture vanished may never be known .
But researchers think they have pinned down the origin of these mysterious people .
The answers are turning up in traces of mound settlements bordering the rugged Kopet - Dag mountains to the south , which rise up to form the vast Iranian plateau .
The most prominent settlement there lies a grueling 225 - mile drive from Gonur .
At this site , called Anau , three ancient mounds poke up from the plains .
Volunteer Lisa Pumpelli is working there in a trench at the top of a large mound with a spectacular view of the Kopet - Dag mountains .
She is helping Hiebert , who is now an archaeologist with the National Geographic Society in Washington , D.C. , track down the precursors to the Oxus culture .
Both are following in the footsteps of Lisa Pumpelli 's grandfather , Raphael Pumpelly , and great - grandfather , also named Raphael Pumpelly ( Pumpelly is an alternate spelling of the family name ) .
" I 'm digging in my great - grandfather 's back dirt , " Pumpelli quips .
Trained in geology , the elder Pumpelly believed that Central Asia in ancient times was wetter and more fertile that it is now .
He hypothesized a century ago that " the fundamentals of European civilization — organized village life , agriculture , domestication of animals , weaving , etc. — were originated on the oases of Central Asia long before the time of Babylon . "
Such assertions sounded radical — even outlandish — at that time , but Raphael Pumpelly was persuasive .
An adventurer and son of an upstate New York surveyor , he convinced industrialist Andrew Carnegie to fund his expedition , charmed the authorities in Saint Petersburg into granting permission for a dig in 1903 , and was even provided with a private railcar .
He was 65 years old when he arrived .
The mounds at Anau , just off the Trans - Caspian railway , immediately caught Raphael Pumpelly 's eye .
A Russian general searching for treasure had already cut through the oldest of them , so Pumpelly and his son began there , using methods that were surprisingly modern in an era when most archaeologists were fixated on finding spectacular artifacts .
" A close watch was kept to save every object , large and small . . . and to note its relation to its surroundings , " Pumpelly wrote in his memoirs .
" I insisted that every shovelful contained a story if it could be interpreted . "
The close scrutiny paid off .
One shovelful yielded material later determined to be ancient wheat , prompting Pumpelly to declare that Central Asian oases were the original source of domesticated grain .
Although that claim later proved false — subsequent Near Eastern finds of wheat date back even earlier — it was the first recorded instance of serious paleobotany .
In 1904 a plague of locusts " filled the trenches faster than they could be shoveled , " Pumpelly wrote , and plunged the area into famine , forcing him to abandon the dig .
Traveling east , he noted the mounds dotting the foothills of the Kopet - Dag , indicating the sites of ancient towns similar to Anau that had survived on the water flowing down the slopes .
Venturing northeast into the forbidding Kara - Kum desert , he examined locales along the ancient course of the Murgab River but turned back amid heat so brutal , he wrote , that " I gasped for breath . "
He had come just a few miles short of where Sarianidi would later find Gonur .
Pumpelly clung to his vision of an early civilization that thrived along the rivers flowing down from the Kopet - Dag .
Years later , Soviet archaeologists working along the mountain foothills confirmed that as early as 6500 B.C. , small bands of people were living in the Kopet - Dag , raising wheat and barley and grazing their sheep and goats on the mountains ' foothills and slopes .
That 's a few thousand years after these grains were domesticated in the Near East but much earlier than most researchers had thought likely , supporting Pumpelly 's view that Central Asian culture developed much sooner than commonly believed .
By 3000 B.C. , the people of the Kopet - Dag had organized into walled towns .
They used carts drawn by domesticated animals , and their pottery resembles the kind later found in Gonur .
Many Soviet and Western archaeologists suspect that the Oxus civilization — at least in Margiana , the region in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — evolved from this Kopet - Dag culture .
What prompted the settlers to abandon the Kopet - Dag and migrate into the area around Gonur ?
One possibility is drought , says Yale University archaeologist Harvey Weiss .
He theorizes that the same drought that he claims destroyed the world 's first empire — the Akkadians in Mesopotamia — around 2100 B.C. also drove the Kopet - Dag peoples from their homes .
If the small streams that poured out of the mountains stopped flowing , life in the arid climate would have been impossible .
That would have forced the people of Kopet - Dag to head toward Gonur and settle by the Murgab River , the only reliable source of water in the Kara - Kum .
With its headwaters in distant Hindu Kush glaciers , the river would have continued flowing even in the hottest summers or longest droughts .
These tiny figures show not only the craftmanship of the Oxus people , but also the importance of animals in their culture .

Another possibility is that population growth forced people down from the mountain slopes and onto the plains , where the Murgab then flowed lazily into a delta , creating an oasis of dense brush teeming with game , fish , and birds .
That could explain why so many Oxus sites are built on virgin soil , as if carefully planned in advance .
" The people came from the foothills of the Kopet - Dag with baggage , a knowledge of agriculture , irrigation systems , metal , ceramics , and jewelry making , " says Iminjan Masimov , a retired Russian archaeologist who once excavated Oxus sites in Margiana .
Indeed , many Kopet - Dag sites appear to have been abandoned about 2000 B.C. , just around the time Gonur and nearby sites took root .
Hiebert 's excavation at Anau , however , shows that it at least remained inhabited even as Gonur flourished .
While scholars debate the relationship between the Oxus culture and other early urban settlements , there is no dispute about the importance of the Kopet - Dag as a natural highway for nomads , traders , and armies between the Central Asian steppes and the Iranian highlands .
The evidence is unmistakable when Hiebert shows me around the ruins of a medieval mosque on the summit of one of Anau 's mounds .
Damaged by time and earthquakes , the edifice is still famous for the two serpent - dragon mosaics — showing more the influence of China than of Mecca — that once guarded its facade .
Around us are hundreds of mysterious little constructions , Stonehenge - like , each made of three small bricks .
Hairpins and bits of cloth — probably linked to Central Asian shamanism — are scattered about the hilltop .
Women come here to pray for children .
One family , three generations of women , sits silently in a row by a tomb .
Hiebert casually picks up glazed Iranian ware and a bit of Chinese blue pottery .
" Here is your Silk Road , " he says .
The find dovetails with Sarianidi's work at Gonur , where he has found a Mesopotamian cuneiform seal not far from an Indus Valley stamp bearing symbols above an etched elephant .
Both lay near small stone boxes similar to those manufactured in southeastern Iran .
These items provide tantalizing hints of commercial traffic on a Silk Road predating by two millennia the trading route that eventually linked China to Europe in the early centuries A.D. Hiebert likens the Oxus civilization to Polynesia — a scattered but common culture held together by camels rather than canoes .
Sarianidi sees the settlers of the Oxus region as traders , not just in goods but also in faith .
For him , Gonur is the capital of a people who came from the West with a religion that evolved into Zoroastrianism .
In the long , still desert evenings at his camp , he speaks of migrants fleeing from drought - plagued Mesopotamia to this virgin land , bringing a conviction that fire is holy , as well as techniques for brewing a hallucinogenic drink called soma .
Eventually , some wandered farther east , part of the migration of Aryans on horseback who conquered India about 3,500 years ago .
This theory of his finds little support , however .
" Sarianidi has persuaded few if any archaeologists of his strongly held opinions , " says Lamberg - Karlovsky .
Sarianidi may be the last archaeologist in the mold of the 19th - century adventurer , with a larger - than - life swagger , a sharp tongue , and a thick stubborn streak .
Few researchers today can claim to have laid bare acres of ancient settlements virtually unknown a generation ago .
The desert freed Sarianidi from the repression of the Soviet Union .
In return , he uncovered the lost history of the desert .
On the excavation team 's last night at Gonur for the season , we picnic in the desert , reclining on rugs and pillows like Turkomans , toasting with vodka like Russians , and enjoying roast lamb as Oxus shepherds no doubt did four millennia ago .
" Here you understand who you are , " Sarianidi says , lying like a pasha on his cushions .
A stocky and robust man , he looks worn , almost frail , in the twilight .
" I am one of those who can not go on living without the desert .
There is no place like this in the world .
I want to be buried here . "
I am continuing my series of sample articles for the Tricks Wiki with one that is intended to represent a general class of such articles .
It is common practice in lecture courses ( at least if the ones I attended as an undergraduate are anything to go by ) to state useful theorems , lemmas , propositions , etc. , without going to much trouble to explain why they are useful .
Of course , there are many ways to pick up this further understanding : taking note of where and how such results are used , doing carefully designed exercises , and so on .
Nevertheless , it is often the case that more could be done to help people recognise the signs that indicate that a particular result can be applied .
This article , which is principally aimed at undergraduates early on in a mathematics degree , is inspired by an experience I myself had as an undergraduate .
I had a sheet of challenging problems ( set by Béla Bollobás ) and one of them completely stumped me .
( I ’m sure several of them stumped me but this is the one that sticks in my mind . )
I ca n’t remember exactly what the question was , but it was something of similar difficulty to that of determining whether an additive function from to was necessarily linear .
My supervision partner solved the problem using Zorn ’s lemma , which we had been told about in a lecture , and I just sat there in disbelief because it had n’t even remotely occurred to me that Zorn ’s lemma might be useful .
At some point in the intervening years , I “ got ” Zorn ’s lemma and now find it straightforward to see where it is needed .
This article is intended to speed up that process for other people .
One might argue that it is better to work out how to apply theorems for oneself .
I ’m in two minds about that .
Probably for any individual theorem , if one works out for oneself how to recognise situations where it can be applied then that is better than being told by somebody else .
But working it out can take quite a lot of time and effort , so if one has help then one may be able to learn how to apply more theorems , and one may be able to learn about theorems in branches of mathematics other than one ’s own .
On balance , I think that a series of articles on how to use various important mathematical principles would be a useful resource , one that I would love to have to help me understand better the many areas of mathematics where I feel shaky .
So here ’s a first attempt at Zorn ’s lemma .
So far I have only two examples of applications : at some stage it would be good to have several more .
Title : How to use Zorn ’s lemma .
Quick description :
If you are building a mathematical object in stages and find that ( i ) you have not finished even after infinitely many stages , and ( ii ) there seems to be nothing to stop you continuing to build , then Zorn ’s lemma may well be able to help you .
Prerequisites : Basic concepts of undergraduate mathematics , such as vector spaces .
Example 1 : A function from to is called additive if for every .
Clearly any function of the form is additive .
Are there any other additive functions ?
An easy induction shows that if then for every positive integer .
( This is because , .)
It is also easy to prove that ( since e.g. ) .
And from this it follows that , so , for every positive integer .
Another easy induction shows that for every real number and every positive integer .
Therefore , , from which it follows that for every real number and every positive integer .
From these observations it follows that if then for every rational number .
At this point it seems to be hard to deduce anything about other values of .
Indeed , there does n’t seem to be much obstacle to defining to be anything we like .
If we set to be , then an argument similar to the argument of the previous paragraph shows that for every rational number , but no number of the form is rational except when , so this is not going to conflict with the choices we have already made .
We will of course be forced to set to be , but there is no problem in doing that .
Let us be slightly more explicit about why this is n’t a problem : it is because if then and ( since otherwise we would find that , which is rational ) .
This will enable us to see more clearly what is going on later .
The discussion so far strongly suggests that there should be a function that is additive but not of the form .
We have n’t yet defined one , since by no means every real number is of the form with and rational .
But we have produced a partially defined additive non-linear function , and the method we have used is rather flexible .
Indeed , if we pick another number , such as , say , where is not yet defined , then we can extend the definition to all numbers of the form with by setting for some arbitrarily chosen .
More generally , we could construct a sequence of numbers with , with the property that no is a rational linear combination of .
And then we could define , for arbitrarily chosen , which would tell us that for every sequence of rational numbers .
The trouble is , even when we have built an infinite sequence in this way , we still have n’t defined for all real numbers , since the set of rational linear combinations of those numbers is countable .
However , we can still continue to build our function , since we can pick a new real number that is not a rational linear combination of the and choose a value for .
And then we can choose that is not a rational linear combination of the and , and so on .
But again we find that even if we produce an infinite sequence of we have still defined for only countably many real numbers .
A good way of regarding what we are doing is this : we are considering the real numbers as a vector space over the rationals , and we are trying to build a basis for this vector space , where this means a collection of real numbers such that every real number is a rational linear combination of numbers in in precisely one way .
Then if we define the values of however we like for the numbers in and define the values of in the obvious way for rational linear combinations of those numbers , we have a function from to that is linear over the rationals , and hence additive , but not necessarily of the form .
Now , considered as a vector space over , is certainly infinite - dimensional .
In fact , it has uncountable dimension .
So does it have a basis ?
( All we mean by “ has uncountable dimension ” is “ cannot be spanned by countably many vectors , ” so it is not true by definition that it has a basis . )
Inspired by finite - dimensional vector spaces it is tempting to say , “ Pick a maximal linearly independent set , ” since such a set is not just linearly independent but also spans the whole space , since if it did n’t we could just pick an element that did not belong to its linear span and we could add it to the linearly independent set , contradicting maximality .
So now we seem to be done : we are looking for a basis of over , and all we need to do to find a basis of any vector space is take a maximal linearly independent set .
But why should a maximal linearly independent set exist ?
Is n’t that exactly the difficulty we were facing earlier : we could carry on picking more and more rationally independent real numbers but we never seemed to reach the point where we could no longer continue .
Let us now interrupt this example for a more general discussion of Zorn ’s lemma and how to use it .
General discussion :
We are now in a very typical situation where Zorn ’s lemma can be applied .
We would like to build a maximal object , and we feel as though we ought to be able to , because any non-maximal object can easily be extended .
The usual statement of Zorn ’s lemma is as follows .
A partially ordered set is a set together with an ordering of the elements of that is transitive and antisymmetric ( this means that if and then ) .
A typical example is where is a collection of sets and if and only if .
( Here I use the symbol “ ” to mean “ is a subset of ” and not “ is a proper subset of ” . )
A chain in a partially ordered set is a totally ordered subset of : that is , a subset such that if then either or .
An upper bound for a subset of a partially ordered set is an element such that for every .
And a maximal element in a partially ordered set is an element such that the only element with is itself .
Zorn ’s lemma states that if is a partially ordered set such that every chain in has an upper bound , then has a maximal element .
( Note that a maximal element does not have to be bigger than everything else : it just must n’t be smaller than anything else . )
In order to see how this rather abstract - looking statement relates to the kind of problem we had earlier , let us imagine that we have a partially ordered set and are looking for a maximal element .
We could try to build one as follows .
We start with an element .
If it is n’t maximal then we find a bigger element .
If that is n’t maximal we find a bigger element , and so on .
That gives us an increasing sequence .
Now we seem to be stuck , and indeed sometimes we are stuck .
For example , if is the set of natural numbers with their usual ordering then we might have created the sequence , which would not help us to find a maximal element — not surprisingly , since does n’t have a maximal element .
However , does not satisfy the hypothesis of Zorn ’s lemma , because the sequence is a chain with no upper bound .
If does satisfy this hypothesis then the sequence , which is also a chain , has an upper bound , which we could call .
If this is not maximal , then we can find a larger element .
If that is not maximal , then we can find a yet larger element , and so on .
Example 1 continued :
Note the similarity between the position we are now in and the position we were in when we were trying to create a basis for over .
Once again , we can continue to create larger and larger objects , but there seems to be no easy way of saying that the process eventually ends .
Or rather , there is an easy way : Zorn ’s lemma tells us that it ends .
Let us see how Zorn ’s lemma applies in our example .
The objects we were looking at were subsets of that were linearly independent over .
We noted that a maximal linearly independent subset of spanned the whole of , where by “ maximal ” we meant that the set was not contained in any larger linearly independent set .
Thus , we were looking at the set of all linearly independent subsets of , with the partial order .
All we have to do if we want to apply Zorn ’s lemma is check that every chain has an upper bound .
So let us imagine that we have a collection of linearly independent subsets of and that for any two of those sets one is contained in the other .
What could serve as an upper bound ?
By definition it has to be a set that contains all the sets in , so it has to contain their union .
We want it to be linearly independent , so the smaller it is , the better .
So there is basically only one candidate to try : the union itself .
Is the union linearly independent ?
Well , if belong to the union , then each belongs to some linearly independent set .
Because is a chain , one of these sets contains all the others .
If that is , then the linear independence of implies that no non-trivial linear combination of can be zero , which proves that the union of the sets in is linearly independent , just as we wanted .
Therefore , by Zorn ’s lemma , there is a maximal linearly independent set .
Earlier we observed that such a set was a basis and could be used to create additive functions not of the form , so our problem is now solved .
Further general remarks :
How , one might ask , is Zorn ’s lemma itself proved ?
One answer is that it cannot be proved : it is just an axiom .
But a slightly more informative answer is that it is equivalent to the axiom of choice and the well - ordering principle .
A hint of why this should be can be found in the attempted proof above .
There we created an infinite sequence , which we then continued “ transfinitely ” with the elements .
This transfinite process can continue until a maximal element is reached , but to do so one needs to make infinitely many choices ( since there is n’t a way of defining the next element of the sequence ) .
Thus , the axiom of choice comes into play .
If we knew in advance that could be well - ordered ( that is , given a total ordering such that every non-empty subset had a minimal element ) , then we could build up the sequence by always taking the minimal element that worked .
And it ’s an easy exercise to use Zorn ’s lemma to prove that every set has a well - ordering .
Example 2 : Let us justify this last statement , since it gives another representative application of Zorn ’s lemma .
Suppose , then , that we have a set and we would like to give it a well - ordering .
That is , we would like to define a total ordering on the elements of such that every non-empty subset of has a minimal element .
Once again , we find ourselves in a situation where there are no obvious constraints to building the object we require , other than the “ transfinite length of time ” needed to complete the process .
We just pick an arbitrary element to be the minimal element of itself , then an arbitrary element to be the minimal element of , and so on .
In other words , at each stage we would like to choose an element not yet chosen and declare it to be the next element in our ordering .
To convert that rough idea into a Zorn ’s - lemma argument , we need to define a partial ordering on the set of “ incomplete attempts ” at defining a well - ordering on .
An incomplete attempt means a subset of and a well - ordering of that subset .
Let us define an attempt to be precisely that : a subset of with a well - ordering of the elements of .
The partial ordering on the set of all attempts should reflect the idea of one attempt extending another , so the obvious partial ordering to take is as follows : given two attempts and , we say that if is an initial segment of .
This means that is a subset of , that the ordering associated with is the same as the ordering associated with when you restrict it to , and that every element of is less than every element of in the ordering on .
Does this partially ordered set satisfy the chain condition ?
Well , if we have a chain of attempts , then we can define an upper bound to be the union of the sets in that chain , with the following ordering : if there is some attempt in the chain such that and both belong to and in .
This ordering is well - defined , because if is another attempt that contains and , then either or ( since and both belong to the chain ) , and the definition of guarantees that the orderings on and are consistent .
Is the ordering on a well - ordering ?
Yes , since if is a non-empty subset of , then there must be an attempt in the chain such that is non-empty .
But then has a minimal element in .
This must be minimal in as well .
To see why , suppose that and .
Then there must exist an attempt in the chain with .
Since it follows that does not contain , so we must have .
Therefore , must be an initial segment of and we have with and .
This is a contradiction .
We have now shown that is well - ordered , and thereby verified the chain condition .
( Note that verifying the chain condition was fairly straightforward : this is true of many applications of Zorn ’s lemma . )
Therefore , by Zorn ’s lemma , there is a maximal attempt , which we hope will be a well - ordering of the whole of .
If it is not the whole of , then it is a well - ordering of some proper subset of .
But we can easily extend this attempt : let be any element of and define to be , ordering by taking the ordering we already have on and stipulating in addition that for every .
( Of course , we also stipulate that . )
This produces a larger attempt , contradicting the maximality of .
This contradiction completes the proof that ( Zorn ’s lemma implies that ) every set can be well - ordered .
Further general remarks :
Note that the final step of the last argument , the proof that every maximal attempt must be a well - ordering of the whole of , corresponds to the informal observation made earlier that we can keep on and on extending a well - ordering , while the verification of the chain condition corresponds to the fact that if we produce an infinite sequence of attempts then we can take their union and carry on .
Again , this is typical of Zorn ’s - lemma arguments .
So how , in general , does one recognise the need for Zorn ’s lemma and how does one construct an appropriate partially ordered set in order to apply it ?
The clues are in the two examples above .
Typically , one is trying to build a structure of some kind ( such as a basis for a vector space , or a well - ordering of a set ) .
The natural way to do it appears to be to build the structure up in stages , but there are too many stages for this to work straightforwardly .
However , once one has an idea of what a stage is and what the building - up process is , one can wheel out Zorn ’s lemma to finish the job .
The partially ordered set will consist of all objects that might conceivably be stages in the construction , and one of these objects will be smaller than another if it might conceivably come before the other in the building - up process .
If the resulting partial order satisfies the chain condition and if a maximal element must be a structure of the kind one is trying to build , then the proof is complete .

If Congress bows to pressure from Republicans and decides to lift its restrictions on offshore oil drilling , it is unclear exactly what would happen next .
Such a move would take the country into uncharted waters , and there is no guarantee that a substantial amount of new drilling would take place at all .
The frequent " drill here , drill now " refrain of Sen .
John McCain and his fellow proponents of offshore drilling that has become part of this year 's presidential debate suggests that removing the congressional moratorium would throw open the nation 's waters to a spree of new drilling — and , eventually , new oil .
But there are major obstacles that are rarely addressed .
New drilling , if it does happen , wo n't take place willy - nilly .
The most likely scenario , if Congress were to relax restrictions on drilling in federal waters , is that individual states would get the authority to approve or reject new drilling .
Yet even that issue is , technically , undecided .
" There 's no historical precedent here for this sort of action , " says Eileen Angelico of the Minerals Management Service , the Interior Department office that handles offshore drilling in federal waters .
" It all depends on what Congress decides to do . "
One hint may come from a recent proposal by the so - called " Gang of 10 , " a bipartisan group of senators led by Democrat Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Republican Saxby Chambliss of Georgia .
Earlier this month , just before Congress took its August recess , the group announced a compromise energy plan to open up the eastern Gulf of Mexico and give four states — Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia — the right to " opt in " to new leasing .
Chambliss said that it would be up to the state legislatures to approve new drilling under the proposal .
It 's unclear at this point if state legislatures will grant such approval , or how eager they will be to take up the discussion .
Historically , coastal states have resisted new offshore drilling , in state waters , which usually extend about three nautical miles out to sea , as well as in federal waters , which lie farther out from the shore .
( Texas and Louisiana , among others , are notable exceptions . )
Concerns about the impact of oil spills on tourism and coastal industries loom large , as does disdain for the " visual pollution " of oil rigs looming off the coast .
Florida , in fact , recently wrapped up an effort to buy back oil leases in state waters , many of which had been in granted to oil companies in the 1940s and had long become idle .
Critics also point to a Department of Energy report from 2007 , which found that new drilling wo n't have a significant impact on oil production before 2030 , and determined that the ultimate impact on prices would be " insignificant " because oil is a globally traded commodity .
Still , voter pressure could sway the debate .
According to recent polls , between 55 and 60 percent of Floridians say they support new drilling off their coasts .
In California , a slim majority — 51 percent — now favor the idea .
That number is up by about 10 points from a year ago .
Some of these polls may be a bit misleading .
A widely cited Rasmussen poll in June asked voters if they would support drilling " to reduce the price of gas , " a connection that most experts say is dubious at best .
But the polls nonetheless capture an attitude shift among coastal residents that politicians of both parties have been keen to acknowledge .
At the state level , the battle will come down to who runs the legislature .
Democrats control both the House and Senate in California , North Carolina , Oregon , and Washington , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Republicans , meanwhile , hold both chambers in Florida , Georgia , and South Carolina .
Virginia is split .
Because these bodies would likely be tasked with approving new drilling , such proposals could languish in Democratic - dominated states , or at least face sizable opposition .
Governors would also likely have some say in this debate .
At the very least , they could strike down legislation .
In a notable break with both his party and McCain , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has expressed vocal opposition to new drilling near his state .
So have governors in Oregon , Washington , North Carolina , and South Carolina .
But the political winds are shifting .
Presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama has shown a new willingness to allow expanded drilling .
The Republican governor of Florida , Charlie Christ , recently changed his mind on this issue , saying he now supports drilling if it 's done in an environmentally safe manner .
Meanwhile , in North Carolina , where a competitive gubernatorial campaign is underway , Republican candidate and Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory has said that , if elected , he would sign an executive order to allow new drilling .
That might work for state waters , but he would need federal approval to go beyond there .
Even if some states eventually do grant approval for new drilling , there are numerous other potential obstacles .
Environmental reviews will need to be conducted .
State officials will have to consult with the public .
Lease sales — in which oil companies bid on tracts they may want to explore - - will have to be scheduled and held .
These requirements can take several years to complete .
In 2006 , for example , Congress opened up several million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for new leasing and drilling , of which a large portion had been previously off - limits .
Because of the necessary planning work , many of these tracts wo n't come up for bidding until next year .
( And even if these tracts receive bids , and an oil company chooses to develop them , it usually takes about seven to ten years for oil to start flowing , according the Energy Information Administration . )
The best estimates now suggest that about 18 billion barrels of oil are sitting in areas currently off - limits to drilling .
But the oil deposits are n't distributed evenly .
Nearly 10 billion gallons lie off California , compared with only about 3.8 billion along the Atlantic .
Maggot secretions could provide drug that can kill 12 strains of deadly superbug MRSA
A liquid produced by green bottle larvae has been shown to kill MRSA , C difficile and the E coli food poisoning bug in lab tests
Green bottle maggots could provide doctors with a powerful new drug against MRSA , a study has found .
Scientists have turned a brown sticky liquid produced by the larvae into an antibiotic capable of killing 12 different strains of the deadly superbug .
The drug , named Seraticin , can also combat the C difficile stomach bug , lab tests show .
If trials on patients prove successful , the drug could give doctors a much - needed extra weapon in the fight against the infections which are becoming more and more resistant to treatment .
Between them , superbugs kill or hasten the death of more than 8,000 Britons a year and MRSA alone costs the NHS an estimated £ 1 billion annually .
The wound - cleaning power of maggots has been known for centuries and they are regularly put to work in some hospital wards where they eat their way through diseased tissue .
But bottling their bug - busting powers - by synthesising the compound - would allow their widespread use .
The Swansea University scientists have isolated and purified a bug - killing compound produced by green bottle larvae as they munch through flesh .
Green bottle maggots were chosen because , unlike the larvae of some other flies , they do not harm healthy flesh .
In lab tests , the drug zapped MRSA , C difficile and the E coli food poisoning bug .
Dr Yolande Harley , of Action Medical Research , which funded the work , said : ' The discovery of a potential new antibiotic is an exciting advance .
' It could mean a possible new novel treatment for people with chronic wounds that are infected with MRSA or other bugs .
' By developing the pure antibiotic into a cream , it could reduce the contact patients need to have with live maggots to heal wounds .
' It could also offer a potential treatment , such as an injection or pill , for internal infections such as C difficile . '
Professor Norman Ratcliffe , the lead researcher , said there was a desperate need for new antibiotics .
' Who knows what the next superbug will be ? ' he said .
' And we are running out of antibiotics to treat them with . '
If trials on humans are successful , the drug could help doctors fight several deadly infections .
It is thought the treatment is eight years away from the market .
Professor Ratcliffe said : ' It takes approximately 20 mugs of maggots to yield just one drop of purified Seraticin at present .
' The next stage will be to confirm its exact identity in order for us to produce it chemically at a larger scale . '
Dr Alun Morgan , of ZooBiotic , a firm that breeds maggots under sterile conditions , said : ' Maggots are great little multi-taskers .
' They produce enzymes that clean wounds , they make a wound more alkaline which may slow bacterial growth and they produce a range of antibacterial chemicals that stop the bacteria growing .'
The Swansea scientists are not the only ones to harness nature in the fight against MRSA - U.S. researchers have shown proteins found in alligator blood are capable of killing a wide range of bacteria .
Address by José Ramón Machado Ventura , vice - president of Cuba ’s Councils of State and Ministers , to the high - level conference on World Food Security : The Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy .
( English translation by Climate and Capitalism , from Juventud Rebelde , June 4 , 2008 )
Two years ago , in this very hall , the international community agreed to eradicate world hunger .
It adopted a goal of halving the number of malnourished people by 2015 .
Today that modest and inadequate goal seems like a pipe - dream .
The world food crisis is not a circumstantial phenomenon .
Its recent appearance in such serious form , in a world that produces enough food for all its inhabitants , clearly reveals that the crisis is systemic and structural .
Hunger and malnourishment are the result of an international economic order that maintains and deepens poverty , inequality and injustice .
It is undeniable that the countries of the North bear responsibility for the hunger and malnourishment of 854 million people .
They imposed trade liberalisation and financial rules that demanded structural adjustment , on a world composed of clearly unequal actors .
They brought ruin to many small producers in the South and turned self - sufficient and even exporting nations into net importers of food products .
The governments of developed countries refuse to eliminate their outrageous agricultural subsidies while imposing their rules of international trade on the rest of the world .
Their voracious transnational corporations set prices , monopolise technologies , impose unfair certification processes on trade , and manipulate distribution channels , sources of financing , trade and supplies for the production of food worldwide .
They also control transportation , scientific research , gene banks and the production of fertilisers and pesticides .
The worst of it all is that , if things continue as they are , the crisis will become even more serious .
The production and consumption patterns of developed countries are accelerating global climate change , threatening humanity ’s very existence .
These patterns must be changed .
The irrational attempt to perpetuate these disastrous forms of consumerism is behind the sinister strategy of transforming grains and cereals into fuels .
The Non-Aligned Countries Summit in Havana called for the establishment of a peaceful and prosperous world and a just and equitable international order .
This is the only way to an end to the food crisis .
The right to food is an inalienable human right .
Since 1997 , this has been confirmed on Cuba ’s initiative by successive resolutions adopted by the former Commission on Human Rights and later by the Council and the UN General Assembly .
Our country , representing the Non-Aligned Movement , and with the support of more than two thirds of UN member states , also proposed the calling of a seventh special session of the Human Rights Council , which has just called for concrete actions to address the world food crisis .
Hunger and malnourishment cannot be eradicated through palliatives , nor with symbolic donations which — let us be honest — will not satisfy peoples ’ needs and will not be sustainable .
At the very least , agricultural production in South countries must first be rebuilt and developed .
The developed countries have more than enough resources to do this .
What ’s required is the political will of their governments .
If NATO ’s military budget were reduced by a mere 10 % a year , nearly US $ 100 billion would be freed up .
If the foreign debt of developing countries , a debt they have paid several times over , were cancelled , the countries of the South would have at their disposal the $ 345 billion now used for annual debt service payments .
If the developed countries honoured their commitment to devote 0.7 % of the gross domestic product to official development aid , the countries of the South would have at least an additional $ 130 billion a year .
If only one fourth of the money squandered each year on commercial advertising were devoted to food production , nearly $ 250 billion could be dedicated to fighting hunger and malnutrition .
If the money devoted to agricultural subsidies in the North were directed to agricultural development in the South , our countries would have around a billion dollars a day to invest in food production .
I bring this message from Cuba , a country ferociously blockaded but standing proudly by its principles and the unity of its people : yes , we can successfully confront this food crisis , but only if we go to the root of the problem , address its real causes and reject demagogy , hypocrisy and false promises .
Allow me to conclude by recalling the words of Fidel Castro , when he addressed the UN General Assembly in New York in October 1979 :
“ The din of weapons , of threatening language , and of arrogance on the international scene must cease .
Abandon the illusion that the problems of the world can be solved by nuclear weapons .
Bombs may kill the hungry , the sick and the uneducated , but bombs cannot kill hunger , disease and illiteracy . ”
Thank you very much .

You are here : Home / Bizarre Stuff / 20 Abandoned Cities from Around the World
There are many reasons why cities are abandoned ; some , like the ghost towns of the American West , have become tourist destinations while others have been condemned or simply forgotten .
These 20 abandoned cities of the world share an eerie , haunted quality that is part of what makes them so fascinating .
For more amazing abandoned places by region visit the WebUrbanist abandonments archive .
1. The Kowloon Walled City was located just outside Hong Kong , China during British rule .
A former watchpost to protect the area against pirates , it was occupied by Japan during World War II and subsequently taken over by squatters after Japanâ€™s surrender .
Neither Britain nor China wanted responsibility for it , so it became its own lawless city .
Its population flourished for decades , with residents building labyrinthine corridors above the street level , which was clogged with trash .
The buildings grew so tall that sunlight couldnâ€™t reach the bottom levels and the entire city had to be illuminated with fluorescent lights .
It was a place where brothels , casinos , opium dens , cocaine parlors , food courts serving dog meat and secret factories ran unmolested by authorities .
It was finally torn down in 1993 after a mutual decision was made by British and Chinese authorities , who had finally grown wary of the unsanitary , anarchic city and its out - of - control population .
2 . The small village of Oradour - sur - Glane , France , is the setting of unspeakable horror .
During World War II , 642 residents were massacred by German soldiers as punishment for the French Resistance .
The Germans had initially intended to target nearby Oradour - sur - Vayres and mistakenly invaded Oradour - sur - Glane on June 10th 1944 .
According to a survivorâ€™s account , the men were herded into barns where they were shot in the legs so they would die more slowly .
The women and children , who had been held in a church , all perished when their attempt to escape was met by machine - gun fire .
The village was razed by the Germans afterward .
Its ruins still stand today as a memorial to the dead and a reminder of the events that took place .
3. Kolmanskop is a small town located a few miles inland from the port of LÃ¼deritz in Namibia .
Windswept sand has made its way into nearly every building in the town , which was once a diamond mining town and abandoned in 1956 as diamond demand declined and richer sources of diamonds were discovered in other areas .
Its only residents are now birds , hyenas and other animals .
4. Humberstone , Chile was a booming town from the 1920s until the early â€˜40s , enjoying the wealth and prosperity that came from mining and processing nitrate , also known as saltpeter .
Once synthetic saltpeter was invented , the town began to decline and experienced a slow outpouring of residents until it finally lay empty in 1961 .
Since then , the blowing sand from surrounding deserts has made its way into the remaining buildings , which still house machinery and furniture .
The town has been named a World Heritage Site and will likely be preserved as a historical monument .
5. Wittenoom , Australia was once home to 20,000 people in its mining heyday .
The asbestos mining town effectively shut down after the health risks of asbestos became clear in the â€˜60s , and 1,000 residents died of asbestos - related illnesses .
The remaining residents left , aside from the 8 people who still live there today .
The city is littered with the blue fibers of asbestos , which can be seen in the bottom left photo above .
6 . Only 30 minutes from the south side of Chicago lies Gary , Indiana , established as a company town for U.S. Steel in 1906 .
When the steel industry took a downturn in the â€˜60s , the town became depressed and has never recovered .
Gary , which has oft received the dubious honor of the murder capital of the U.S. , is beginning to see signs of revitalization and is still home to thousands of people , but by the looks of its downtown area youâ€™d never know it .
7. Ruby , Arizona is one of the best preserved ghost towns in Arizona , but you can only gain access to it by helping in the restoration effort .
It was founded as a mining camp , producing mostly copper , lead and zinc .
At its peak in the mid â€˜30s , Rubyâ€™s population reached 1,200 .
The population diminished after the mine was closed in the â€˜50s .
The few buildings that remain include the jail , a schoolhouse , mine offices and a handful of homes .
8 . The eerie city of Agdam , Azerbaijan was once a thriving city of 150,000 people .
It was lost in 1993 during the Nagorno Karabakh war ; though the city was never the setting of combat , it fell victim to vandalism while occupied by Armenians .
The buildings are gutted and empty , with only the graffiti - covered mosque remaining intact .
Agdam residents have moved to other areas of Azerbaijan , as well as into Iran .
9. Bodie State Historic Park in California is one of the many gold - mining ghost towns in the American West .
The town of Bodie once had 10,000 residents during the gold rush ; the last of its residents left during the â€˜50s and â€˜60s .
Only a small part of the town still stands today , but what remains has been well preserved .
Interiors remain as they were when Bodie became a National Historic Site in 1962 , with goods stacked on the shelves .
Bodie is now frequented by tourists , but its ghost town atmosphere is intact â€ “ there are no commercial facilities in the area .
10 . Located south of Indore in the state of Madhya Pradesh , Mandu was once the capital city of a northern Indian Muslim state and has lain abandoned for over 400 years .
The ancient city takes up a large plateau just above the Narmada River and is home to a dazzling array of ruins , including a royal palace and a mosque .
The Nil Kanth Palace is an important pilgrimage point for devotees of the Hindu goddess Shiva .
Today , the cityâ€™s only residents are gypsy tribes who live on the hilltop plateau .
11 . Kadykchan was one of many small Russian cities that fell into ruin when the Soviet Union collapsed .
Residents were forced to move to gain access to services like running water , schools and medical care .
The state moved them out over a period of two weeks , and they were taken to other towns and provided with new housing .
Once a tin mining town of 12,000 people , the city is now desolate .
In their hurry to leave , residents left their belongings behind in their homes , so you can now find aging toys , books , clothing and other objects throughout the empty city .
12 . The small town of Cody was established in what has been called the â€˜Valley of the Ghostsâ€™ in British Columbia in the 1890s during the silver boom .
Named after silver prospector Henry Cody , the town was expected by residents at the time to surpass other nearby towns in size and greatness .
At the pinnacle of its success , though , Cody only had 150 residents , and when the town failed to attract more people it was deserted in 1910 .
13 . Balestrino , Italy is just as picturesque as many other medieval Italian towns , with its stunning hilltop location 70 km southeast of Genoa .
Once owned by the Benedictine abbey of San Pietro dei Monti , Balestrino began losing its population in the late 19th century as earthquakes struck the region and damaged property .
In 1953 , the town was abandoned due to â€˜geological instabilityâ€™ .
The part of the town that has remained untouched since that time is currently undergoing planning for redevelopment , so it wonâ€™t remain abandoned for much longer .
14 .
Once home to 2200 residents , Times Beach , Missouri stood empty and condemned for over a decade .
Itâ€™s the site of one of Americaâ€™s worst pollution disasters .
From 1972 to 1976 , city officials had waste oil sprayed on the unpaved roads to alleviate a dust problem .
Unfortunately , that waste oil contained dioxin , a toxic carcinogen and component of Agent Orange .
The dioxin permeated the soil and flooding further spread it through the town .
After a long cleanup effort , the town has been reborn as Route 66 State park .
15 . Deception Island is located in the South Shetland Islands off the Antarctic Peninsula .
One of the areaâ€™s only safe harbors , Deception Island offered a refuge from storms and was also the site of several research stations and whaling operations .
Many buildings have been abandoned there due both to a decline in the use of whale oil and a volcanic eruption in 1969 .
The volcano has made it an unpopular location , but Spain and Argentina still have summer - only research stations there .
16 . Tyneham is referred to as â€ ˜the village that Dorset lostâ€™ .
During World War II , the Ministry of Defence took over this town on the Isle of Purbeck in south England for use as an army base .
Citizens were promised their homes back after the war ended , but were never allowed back in .
It has stood as ghost village ever since , lying in ruins except for the schoolhouse and church that still stand relatively untouched .
Schoolwork still sits on the aging desks , and a sign on the church still reads , â€ ˜Please treat the church and houses with care ; we have given up our homes where many of us lived for generations to help win the war to keep men free .
We shall return one day and thank you for treating the village kindly .â€ ™
17 . Kayakoy , Turkey was once a thriving Greek village , home to 25,000 people .
In 1923 , the town was completely deserted when its inhabitants , along with millions of other Greeks in Turkey , were forced out of the country due to the Greek war of independence .
Since then , the village â€ “ which had been populated since the 13th century â€ “ has stood empty and deteriorating .
Kayakoy is the largest and most well preserved ghost village in Asia Minor .
18 . The medieval village of Craco , Italy was built on a very steep summit for defensive reasons , in a dry and mostly vegetation - free area in the south of the country .
Over the centuries , this village lost residents due to a plague , French occupation and civil unrest , and finally lost nearly all of its residents between 1892 and 1922 as they fled for America due to poor agricultural conditions .
Earthquakes in the â€˜60s forced the remaining occupants out of the city , and itâ€™s now completely uninhabited .
19 .
Polish officials have been trying to get rid of the village of Klomino for years ; it was last on the market for â‚ ¬2 million , but most of its remaining buildings were demolished after lack of interest and locals destroyed what was left .
Klomino is the only official ghost town in Poland , built solely as living quarters for the Russian Army .
It has lain empty since the Red Army withdrew its forces in 1992 .
20 . Pyramiden , Norway was a Russian settlement and coal mining community founded by Sweden and sold to Russia in 1927 .
The settlement once had a population of over 1,000 people but has been empty since its owner , the state - owned Soviet company Arctikugol Trust , abandoned it in 1991 .
The buildings still stand today exactly as they were when it was still in use .
Tourists can access it for now by snowmobile or boat , but Russia plants to redevelop it soon .

Speculation has been rife about who will share Mr Obama 's platform US Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is set to reveal his vice - presidential running mate ahead of a rally in Illinois .
Unconfirmed US media reports say Senator Joe Biden , a veteran lawmaker , is Mr Obama 's choice , but he has not yet announced this .
The decision is due to be announced by text message and e-mail to anyone who signs up to receive it .
Democrats start their party convention in Denver on Monday .
Text alert
In an interview with USA Today newspaper , the Illinois senator said he had selected a running mate who was independent and would challenge him in the White House .
Senator Biden has long experience of foreign policy and national security
He added that he had opted for someone who would help him strengthen the economy , and was also ready to act as president .
But Mr Obama gave no clue as to whether he had notified his preferred running mate yet .
The expectation was that during the course of Friday a text message would be received by those who had signed up for it , revealing the name .
However , by the end of the day there had been no announcement .
Early on Saturday , several US news outlets reported that Joe Biden had been chosen .
Mr Biden has three decades of experience in the Senate and chairs the Foreign Relations Committee - something analysts say would balance Mr Obama 's lack of foreign policy experience .
Media crews are camped outside his home to watch for any developments , the BBC's Jonathan Beale reports from Washington .
Surprise in store ?
The conventional wisdom is that vice - presidential candidates do not swing elections , correspondents say .
But Mr Obama 's choice is interesting because it will reveal a little more about the style of the man and how willing he is to be adventurous .
Mr Obama 's rival , Republican presidential hopeful John McCain , has reportedly not settled on a running mate .
Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney are reported to be under serious consideration for the role .

A multi-million dollar marijuana operation has been shut down in Southern Utah .
Iron County narcotics investigators say it 's Utah 's largest marijuana growing operation .
Detectives have discovered massive marijuana gardens in Iron , Washington , and Garfield counties .
The latest " grow , " as they call it , is in the Little Creek Mountains in Iron County .
It 's a one - acre garden about 10 miles east of Paragonah .
Detectives seized 3,000 to 5,000 plants , some as tall as eight feet high .
Narcotics investigators say the street value of the Little Creek bust ranges somewhere between $ 5 million and $ 10 million .
What 's equally startling is where the plants were found .
Detectives discovered them in rugged , steep terrain .
It took a helicopter to bring the marijuana plants off the mountain .
KSL cameras were rolling as the chopper brought down load after load .
Iron County authorities say an illegal immigrant named Ignacio Rodriguez is behind several of these operations .
He is in the Iron County jail and could face federal drug and firearms charges .
Detectives say he had a residence in Cedar City but was running the operations to distribute pot to northern California .
According to Iron County authorities , Rodriguez hired illegal immigrants to plant the marijuana and to harvest the crops .
Workers would hike into the rural areas with a laundry list of supplies to set up an advanced operation .
It included pipes , drip systems , plastic sheeting and car batteries to charge phones .
Detectives say they had a drying and bagging system , as well .
They would then haul the pot off the mountain on foot .
Investigators believe the marijuana was then distributed to northern California .
Iron County investigators say similar operations have been found in Garfield and Washington counties .
They believe they 're all connected .
Mike , an undercover narcotics agent with Iron County , said , " It appears he 's [ Rodriguez ] running the show for grow operations in Iron and Garfield counties .
We can also place him at a grow site in Washington County . "
Investigators say these busts are the culmination of a year - long investigation involving the Iron , Washington and Garfield County sheriffs offices .
Authorities in northern California have been cracking down on pot growing operations for years .
Detectives think that 's forced drug operators into rural Utah .

USFed Blinks : Propaganda & Bluffs By Jim Willie CB
Jun 26 2008 3:05 PM www.GoldenJackass.com
USFed Blinks : Propaganda & Bluffs
For the last couple weeks , my attention has been given to the amusement and desperation behind propaganda , bluffs , and the utter desperation of the USFederal Reserve in the orchestrated rumors of a new position wherein they would soon or eventually raise the official interest rate in order to combat the horrendous price inflation brought about by the falling crippled USDollar .
What utter nonsense !
To hear that the investment community actually accepted and embraced this notion was laughable on its face , and served as continued evidence that the loose collection of investors , speculators , and observers simply cannot wake up reality despite the events that began last August 2007 when the mortgage debacle ripped the banking system wide open with gaping wounds .
The USFed needs to arrest the falling USDollar , no doubt .
But it cannot .
The USFed needs to stem the price inflation , no doubt .
But it cannot .
This parasite central banker organization has its own track record of inflation boom & bust , complete with profound destruction .
The USFed does not control the shallow and ineffective USGovt policies on ethanol , trade sanctions , geopolitical isolation , crackdown on oil speculators , and delay for actual mortgage bailout programs .
The USGovt collectively is responsible for the chronic budget deficits and huge USTreasury Bond sales every year .
The USMilitary is the largest single non -govt user of gasoline , diesel , and jet fuel in the world , yet nobody seems to point a finger at endless war as another reason why the crude oil price is high .
The US Federal Reserve oversees the sequences of credit explosions , fails in its rational regulation , orders hidden subsidies to Wall Street banks , justifies the colossal inflation permitted , and under - writes the last bubble bust with more liquidity .
It fails to comprehend that the sequence has gutted the national economy .
The ongoing drama must be watched closely .
The USFed on Wednesday was laid bare in its legless weakness and incapacity .
They revealed they are in a corner , trapped , stuck in an unresolvable dilemma .
Its propaganda was stripped .
Its bluffs were called and they blinked .
Its desperation is vividly and tragically clear .
Enough on these guys , these charlatans , these improperly revered destructive parasites on the body economic !
STARK MARKET RESPONSE TO THE USFED
The effect on four key markets was pronounced and loud since Wednesday , when the USFed sheepishly blinked in profound weakness .
Its bluff is over now .
The euro currency jumped up sharply in a reversal , now at 157.30 or so .
The 2 - year USTreasury Bill yield fell down sharply in a reversal , now at 2.70 % or so .
The gold & silver prices jumped up sharply in reversals , now at 913 and 17.3 or so .
Anyone who cannot see in basic terms what happened in response is not awake , plainly put !
On June 25 , everything changed and reality entered the room again !
The stage is set for the next two to four months for a broader banking system deterioration , most likely the bankrupt collapse of a few big banks , and a good chance of lost control of portions of the credit derivative complex .
A big broad powerful liquidation sequence is coming soon for the biggest of bloated money center and investment banks .
They have tried in vain to sell most of their overpriced mortgage bonds and related financial securities .
They cannot find truly stupid parties anymore to buy them .
Past rescues are all showing big losses for participants .
The bonds lack true price discovery .
In many cases no market exists for them , such as with the Collateralized Debt Obligations that leverage mortgage bond in reckless fashion .
In an increasing number of cases , many of the mortgage securities cannot be properly associated with ‘ perfected titles ’ to the actual properties .
The big banks might soon choose to dump the bonds on the market in a race to be first , BEFORE class actions are taken by the public to block the foreclosure process .
They can and are blocking their own foreclosure , dispossession , and eviction , as they properly and legally demand for the banks or financial agencies to produce perfected property title .
In many cases , the banks cannot .
In its haste during the Go- Go years of 2003 through 2006 , the Wall Street bond dealers , purveyors of fraud , conmen to the pension funds and insurance firms , did not bother to file the documents and connect the asset backed bonds with the properties that backed up the securities .
They were concerned about fast bond sales and ripe fees earned .
Now they are vulnerable to class action and civil disobedience , which will possibly accelerate disorder and chaos .
Enough on these guys , these untouchable conmen felons , these destructive parasites on the body economic !
The official Federal Open Market Committee statement said , “ Although downside risks to growth remain , they appear to have diminished somewhat , and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased . ”
Their statement actually stated that the USEconomy was continuing to grow , although slowly .
One must wonder what statistics they are reading .
Perhaps these clueless guys believe the $ 165 billion in handouts to US households will sustain the economy .
In my view such handouts are very similar to Third World Nations delivering handouts of rice and beans to the impoverished citizens .
The next ugly resemblance will be dead cars used as lawn ornaments .
Four specific reactions occurred after the USFed took no action , did not raise the official FedFunds rate , mentioned ongoing housing weakness , and basically tipped its hand that it cannot conceivably raise rates as long as the housing market , financial markets , and USEconomy remain so weak .
They actually cited weakness , but understated the actual weakness .
The economic stagflation underway is powerful , and like nothing seen in seven decades .
Even Greenspan expects a recession to last for a much longer time in a break from past patterns .
Let ’s proceed with four key markets , as reality entered the room .
The next phase is almost ready .
The spring deception is now completed , a closed chapter .
The next bank bond gigantic losses are soon to come .
The next selloff retest of the USDollar critical support is coming soon .
The next gold & silver runup toward the critical resistance levels of 1030 and 21.50 is coming next .
Prepare for fireworks running from July 4th all the way into the autumn in steady fashion , with some assured climaxes in two to four months .
THE EURO JUMPS IN REVERSAL
Even the EuroCB is guilty of phony messages disseminated .
It was bluster !
They perhaps should raise their official interest rate , but they will not .
They too must contend with rising price inflation , but they too are stymied by housing declines , economic slowdowns , and banking crises also .
In the past few weeks , they have been displaying a position of bravado , as the Germans defiantly claim they might hike their official interest rate soon , further straining the USDollar , as they work to manage and protect the economy across the European Union .
If they really cared about inflation , they would halt the 12 % annual euro money growth .
It is all talk , gamesmanship , in a grand struggle to wrest banking leadership from the reckless corrupt Americans who continue out of control .
On Wednesday in Europe , the EuroCB head Jean Claude Trichet was on the defensive .
He found himself dismissing the notion that the ECB would install three separate rate hikes before December .
He tried to make the case that the ECB would perhaps order just one rate hike .
They will not hike at all .
They will be forced to deal with a growing conflict within the European Monetary Union , covered in the Hat Trick Letter in recent monthly reports .
The southern nations are crippled by housing declines , mortgage disasters , and associated economic harsh slowdowns .
They need lower interest rates , but the Germans who run the EuroCB refuse to budge .
A potential breakdown of the EMU and euro looms .
The euro currency had been weakened in the last few weeks by accepted beliefs in the propaganda , that the USFed would next cut its official short - term interest rate .
That would have narrowed the differential between the 4.0 % official Euro Central Bank rate and the 2.0 % official USFed rate .
As stated in my article last week , neither central bank will be hiking interest rates in the foreseeable future , not with economic weakness , housing vulnerability , and bank crisis continuing to wreak havoc .
The euro had been down to slightly flat on Wednesday in trading .
When the news broke on the USFed statement to do nothing , and to paint the picture of helplessness on defense of the USDollar as engrained policy , the euro jumped up .
It is now 150 basis points higher .
The Goldman Sachs statement pushed the euro higher still , highlighting the US bank weakness .
The contrived USDollar bounce is officially done , cooked , stick a fork in it .
A more complete analysis will appear in the July Hat Trick Letter in a couple weeks .
For now , just view the tremendous single day movement in the euro .
The opposite occurred in the USDollar DX index , weighted by over 50 % in the euro .
THE SHORT - TERM USTREASURYS JUMP
In the last few weeks , the 2 - year USTreasury Bill yield has climbed rather suddenly .
The bond traders accepted the notion of an eventual USFed rate tightening , in response to painful price inflation .
They overlooked the weakness in housing , economic slowdown , and worsening bank balance sheets , all of which render impossible any official rate cut .
Sure , the Germans and Americans are at odds and in conflict .
Each has talked tough on price inflation , stealing from each other the mantle of leadership .
But despite the rhetoric and bravado , the facts remain .
The two economies of Europe and the Untied States cannot possibly tolerate a rate tightening episode .
To order higher rates would push both economies over the edge into a downward spiral .
To accept the notion of rate hikes is an exercise in embarrassing naivete at best , and reckless stupidity at worst .
In the ensuing minutes following the USFed public announcement , the short end of the USTreasurys rallied .
The USTBill yields are showing more clearly the economic slowdown and ongoing endless recession .
The gap between the 2 - year TBill yield and the FedFunds 2.0 % target has been reduced .
They realized the jig was up .
The USFed blinked as the gold longs and dollar shorts called their bluff successfully .
Below is the bond principal chart in minute ticks .
The 2 - year TBill yield had been flirting above the 3.0 % level .
After the announcement , it fell sharply toward 2.8 % and stands at 2.7 % now .
The short - term USTreasurys are screaming recession again .
Consistent with such loud cries is the associated painful notion that the USFed will almost certainly LOWER the official FedFunds rate reluctantly .
Give them a few months .
With the next official rate cuts , all USFed leadership , all USFed credibility , and all USDollar integrity will be thrown out the window .
GOLD JUMPS IN REVERSAL
The gold price has been doing repeated tests of the critical support .
At least three or four such successful tests have been completed .
The uptrend in the gold price remains clearly evident , very firm in its support , as it prepares for the next summer and autumn fireworks .
The silly notion of a USDollar rebound led by USFed vigilance to price inflation is now cast aside like last month ’s Sunday newspaper .
Recycle both the newspaper and the failed propaganda that has become like a rancid sugarcoating upon the financial markets , endlessly repeated deceptions heaped upon the public .
The housing weakness will spur continued inflationary responses to deal with it .
Any mortgage rescue platform program will be extraordinarily packed with inflation medicine .
Gold will respond .
The USEconomic weakness will spur continued inflationary responses to deal with it .
Any further USFed stimulus and rescue packages will be extraordinarily packed with inflation medicine .
Gold will respond .
The bank crisis and upcoming bank failures will spur The USEconomic weakness will spur continued inflationary responses to deal with it .
Panic will soon enter the financial markets and banking world .
Gold will respond .
Not a single bank run by depositors has occurred , at least not yet .
There will be many .
The reversal on Wednesday , continuing into Thursday , was plain as day .
For believers in real money , and advocates of sound money , the gold response was reassuring and soothing , not to mention promising .
Some credibility had been accepted within the FedFunds futures market in the last few weeks , that a rate hike or series of rate hikes would come before the end of the year .
This is patently nonsense .
The financial markets in the Untied States have swallowed the notion of bank system recovery , mortgage market stability , and immunity of the USEconomy from the housing decline .
All three notions are absurd on their face , with much worse distress and losses to come in the near future .
The USTreasury Bonds on the short end are finally reflecting the USEconomic recession that is growing worse by the month .
The news on housing was terrible this week , as the Case Shiller housing price index over 20 cities fell 2.0 % in April , registering a hefty 15.3 % decline in the last full year .
Also , the consumer confidence index by the Conference Board fell hard to 50.4 in June from 58.0 in May .
The June reading is the lowest in its history .
The next bank failure will put the final nail in the Rate Hike Coffin , dispelling any doubt .
The inevitability of a General Motors bankruptcy has begun to take root .
Perhaps Ford Motors will go bust also .
Car sales , SUV sales , and truck sales are down badly .
The entire car industry supply chain is suffering .
Claims of growth in the USEconomy by USFed Chairman Bernanke defy reality .
GOLDMAN SACHS PAINTS THE PICTURE
Some clear indications are coming to light .
The Wall Street firms are both banding together and at odds with each other .
First a preface .
The Bear Stearns kill job engineered by JPMorgan has numerous stories behind the public face story told .
Some of my views have been shared .
Here is more .
Bear Stearns did not participate in the LongTerm Capital Mgmt emergency bailout rescue in 1998 .
They were punished ten years later .
Furthermore , when the USFed opened the Bear Stearns books in March , they found a giant position that was short the USDollar .
They found a giant position that was betting on a higher gold price .
So Bear Stearns was killed , with the liquidation of their gold position responsible for a huge gold price drop , aided by the cover of their US $ position .
See the mid-March gold price and US$ action .
The Wall Street firms took notice of the message .
If they bet against the US $ and bet in favor of gold , they would not have any further access to the USFed discount window or lending facilities .
So now the Wall Street firms might be helping each other to stand up .
If one fails , they all might fail and go bust .
That is why the Lehman Brothers story and the Merrill Lynch story are so important .
They are being propped up .
Enter Citigroup .
My guess is that a huge amount of mortgage bonds are to be sold soon by Citigroup , and maybe another big bank , in the initial stage of a bond liquidation scheme and exercise .
Citigroup is busted , and will portray their bankruptcy as a restructuring procedure , complete with liquidation .
We will have to wait to see what remains .
Goldman Sachs on Thursday downgraded Citigroup with a short stock recommendation .
Why would they do that ?
They put Citi on their ‘ Americas Conviction Sell ’ list , which just has to evoke laughter for its name .
They expect another gigantic bond loss to be admitted by Citi , more cash to be raised as they sell capital and undermine stock equity value , and even more dividend cuts .
Up to May , the total amount of cash they raised by selling off capital to foreign entities was a robust $ 42 billion , thus undermining US control of the biggest US bank .
One can only speculate .
Perhaps GSax finally has a big short position in place against Citi , and wants the public to climb aboard the selling parade .
Perhaps GSax has inside word of the big Citigroup bond liquidation fire sale upcoming .
People need to remember that GSax is not a charitable organization .
They make money by legitimate trades , but also by lying , cheating , and sometimes stealing , all legally .
Just to prove that GSax remains a corrupt information source , they downgraded the entire brokerage sector from ‘ Attractive ’ to ‘ Neutral ’ in laughable style .
The US brokerage industry is fast approaching extinction .
Check their bond and stock issuance lately .
Their ugly position matches the US banks , which on average are insolvent .
Sanford Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz forecasted a $ 3.5 billion Q2 writedown for Merrill Lynch , matched by Bank of America analyst Michael Hecht .
The Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden said just a week ago that the US banks must produce $ 65 billion more capital to cope with the destruction to their balance sheets before the peak of the crisis sometime in 2009 .
So have we seen the worst yet ?
No way !
Once again , they are not raising capital .
They are raising cash .
They are selling capital in the form of stock equity and long - term debt .
As they do so , control of the banks goes into foreign hands more so .
STRANGE TIDBITS
Yet another excellent quote came from Art Cashin of UBS , from the New York Stock Exchange floor .
Two weeks ago he responded to the crude oil mania when he said , “ Goldilocks is thinking about a career change .
She is considering a new job renting out and operating a drill rig . ”
Today he said simply , “ The Fed cuts before it raises , ” which surprised the anchors on the financial advertisement public address system known as CNBC .
Even Ron Insana , yesterday afternoon said , “ The Fed offered nothing for everyone . ”
The smart guys out there have figured out the helpless and desperate situation that the USFed finds itself .
It can not raise rates , since that would harm the stock market , further cripple the mortgage and housing markets , and worsen the rapidly advancing USEconomic recession .
Sure , it needs to raise rates in order to defend the USDollar , but the US $ is not defensible .
It has been totally ruined by three decades of mismanagement , corruption , pork projects , sacred war budgets , socialist programs like Medicare , and reckless creation of bubbles in serial fashion .
Yet another shadowy story came to light ( for those who know how to flash the spotlight ) , certainly not mentioned by the intrepid lapdog US financial press networks .
Lehman Brothers and the London Stock Exchange announced plans to set up a pan-European trading platform steeped in darkness .
The joint venture is called Baikal , named after the world ’s deepest fresh water lake in western Siberia within Russia .
It is known as the ‘ Blue Eye of Siberia ’ in exotic terms .
It is famous for holding a volume of water larger than all the North American Great Lakes combined .
At 1637 meters ( 5371 feet ) , Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world , and the largest freshwater lake in the world by volume , holding approximately 20 % of the total surface fresh water on earth .
How appropriate !
The new Dark Pool Trading Platform will offer access to securities across 14 European countries , featuring computer driven trading schemes .
The claim is to address complexity of order execution , but the real intention is to minimize market impact and avoid the scrutiny of public disclosure .
Wall Street and London firms , as in investment banks , large money center banks , and hedge funds , are anxious to dump huge positions without attention .
Those who claim the US and London financial markets have transparency are dead wrong !
Those who claim they have price discovery that seeks equilibrium are dead wrong !
A bizarre story was just told to me by a friend from Philadelphia .
On a daily basis , his wife travels the New Jersey Transit Train line as many commuters do , from Philly to New York City .
In the last month alone , three suicides have taken place , almost never heard of before .
Some men without hope jumped in front of the train .
Each time the usual 2 - hour trip by train suffered delays , including today .
The delay added 2 - 1/ 2 hours , making the commute over four hours .
The entire NJ Transit line was interrupted , which included the Amtrak Metroliner and Keystone Service .
People trying to avoid cars , gasoline , and its nightmare face a different nightmare .
Contrast this story to a recent analysis that points to how many US citizens earning under $ 25 k in annual income will be forced to stop driving altogether .
In typical overextended US style , over 30 % of them have more than one car .
The perceived right of Americans to drive will slowly endure a transition toward the privilege to drive .
Japan has made its investment in electric cars and hybrids for well over ten years .
The Untied States made its investment in Sport Utility Vehicles piglets , Hummer true hogs , and light trucks .
The US has not made any meaningful investment in commuter railways , and especially not high speed railways like Japan , London , and Europe .
The US is horrendously mismanaged and corrupt .
The 60 % share of new vehicle sales that were from SUV and light trucks will be cut in half in the next year .
Shocks to the US landscape will be ongoing , regular , and severe .
Expect shocks to become routine .
The strange new world is emerging , with more onerous extensions of the Fascist Business Model .
My view is that the financial markets will declare the shock filled status as normal very soon .
Panic will slowly seep into the environment .
This late summer or early autumn , some really nasty bank failures are assured .
GOLD WILL REACT VERY STRONGLY , AS WILL SILVER .
The next USDollar decline is coming soon , right on schedule for those who ignore the propaganda , nonsense , and blatant deception promulgated by Wall Street .
Has anyone noticed that the Dow Jones Industrial index has fallen below critical long - term support , but the S&P500 index is near critical long - term support levels ???
Each is falling badly .
This occurs while gold rises !!!
The criminal prosecution has begun finally .
They started with the small fries at Bear Stearns .
Look for these little guys to roll over , to turn state ’s evidence , and to attempt to bring down some executives for criminal fraud felonies .
The process is very early here .
Bad publicity like CFO or CEO indictments akin to WorldCom , Enron , and Tyco lies in the future .
Gold will respond .

Little green men might shock the secular public .
But the Catholic Church would welcome them as brothers .
That 's what Vatican chief astronomer and papal science adviser Gabriel Funes explained in a recent article in L'Osservatore Romano , the newsletter of the Vatican Observatory ( translated here ) .
His conclusion might surprise nonbelievers .
After all , is n't this the same church that imprisoned Galileo for saying that the Earth revolves around the sun ?
Does n't the Bible say that God created man – not little green men – in his image ?
Indeed , many observers assert that aliens would be bad for believers .
Jill Tarter , director of the Center for SETI Research , once wrote that finding intelligent other - worldly life " will be inconsistent with the existence of God or at least organized religions . "
But such predictions tend to come from outside Christianity .
From within , theologians have debated the implications of alien contact for centuries .
And if one already believes in angels , no great leap of faith is required to accept the possibility of other extraterrestrial intelligences .
Since God created the universe , theologians say , he would have created aliens , too .
And far from being weakened by contact , Christianity would adapt .
Its doctrines would be interpreted anew , the aliens greeted with open – and not necessarily Bible - bearing – arms .
" The main question is , ' Would religion survive this contact ? ' " said NASA chief historian Steven J. Dick , author of The Biological Universe .
" Religion has n't gone away after Copernican theory , after Darwin .
They 've found ways to adapt , and they 'll find a way if this happens , too , " Dick says .
The central conundrum posed to Christianity by alien contact would involve the Incarnation – the arrival of Jesus Christ as God 's representative on Earth , his crucifixion and the absolution of humanity 's sins through his forgiveness .
" It would still be true – but if there are other races and intelligences , then what is the meaning of this visit to our race at that time ? " asked Vatican astronomer Guy Consolmagno , who in 2005 penned the booklet Intelligent Life in the Universe ?
Some propose that the Earthly incarnation of Jesus some 2,000 years ago redeemed all intelligent creatures , in all places and – since a space - faring race is likely older than us – in all times .
Others have suggested that Jesus could take multiple forms .
" Just as Jesus is human like you and I , you would find an alien - specific Jesus , " said Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary professor Ted Peters .
But Peters and others also say that aliens may not have fallen into sin , instead existing in a state of grace , neither having nor needing Jesus .
In that case , missionaries would have no call to convert them .
" Would sin be the same on another planet as we conceive of it here ?
Would there even be sin , or would God be present to that species in a completely different way ? " says Richard Randolph , a Kansas City University ethicist .
All this , however , assumes that humanity not only encounters new forms of life but also understands them .
Other intelligences may be incomprehensible to us , thus intensifying another doctrinal question :
What does it mean to be made , as the Bible proclaims , in God 's image ?
Many astrotheologians argue that God 's image refers to our spiritual nature , with our physical forms being irrelevant .
Not everyone , however , agrees .
" If there are aliens , the Bible specifically does not say that they were created in his image , " said Mark Conn , pastor of the Noble Hill Baptist Church in Springfield , Missouri .
" God created many other intelligent beings on this planet , and they were not created in His image . "
Conn 's church recently met to discuss the issues posed by extraterrestrial contact , ultimately deciding that " if they 're there , they 're there .
It does n't change a whole lot . "
Unlike Peters ,
Conn suggested that missionary work may be required , something the aliens may not welcome – especially if , as many postulate , they are technologically superior to humanity and do not have religions of their own .
" Maybe they 'll say that they used to need religion but have outgrown it .
Some people say that would be a great blow to religion , because if an advanced civilization does n't need it , why do we ? " said Douglas Vakoch , director of interstellar message composition at SETI .
" I do n't buy it , though .
I think religion meets very human needs , and unless extraterrestrials can provide a replacement for it , I do n't think religion is going to go away , " he continued .
" And if there are incredibly advanced civilizations with a belief in God , I do n't think Richard Dawkins will start believing . "
Birth control methods .
There are many , but the two most common forms are the condom and the hormonal pill .
Can these products be manufactured sustainably ?
If not … who cares ?
There is something I would like to add to list of “ things I would never give up , even if sustainable solutions are never found . ”
The first thing I mentioned in my second post with Sustainablog .
In “ An Evil Kind of Green , ” I concede the importance of Western medicine after the immediate relief it gives me from a severe poison ivy rash .
The second is along the same lines …
Based on my grasp of the environmental situation we face right now , it matters little if birth control pills cannot be manufactured in a sustainable way , or if some excess estrogens may be leaked into waterways as a result .
The number one factor that needs to be brought under control as soon as possible is … just how many of us there are around .
Since 1960 , the human population of the planet Earth has more than doubled .
Even considering aggressive campaigns to promote birth control , the population is expected to climb to 9 billion by 2042 , as estimated by the UN .
It could be less , but … it could also be much , much more .
In my research to determine which choices are the most effective for an individual to reach environmental sustainability for him or herself , it becomes evident that the number one thing on the top of the list is :
1 . Have fewer babies ( or none at all ) .
The impact this has is so significant , that # 2 and the following numbers are dwarfed by it .
There are plenty of people to go around .
An excerpt from Robert Engelman ’s book , More : Population , Nature , and What Women Want suggests that environmental sustainability would be the natural result if women everywhere were allowed the right to determine their reproductive choices .
To summarize , “ Women do n’t want more children .
They want more for their children . ”
It is crucial that we all achieve maximum levels of education and work together to address our planet - wide debacle with our full agency , creativity and abilities .
Surely , those of us who are parents will agree , we want to see our children excel and fulfill their potential in life .
To do so is indeed essential to the survival and advancement of us all !
However , this sentiment need not be addressed to only our own kin .
Advocating and acting for education opportunities for all of the children ( and adults ! ) of the world is a definite way to contribute toward improving the global situation .
Additionally , there is plenty we can do–and to a more significant impact–if we focus our efforts on eliminating the production of plastics that imitate estrogens when they break down and enter our biological pathways .
Thus , I am willing to trade off on this matter .
Birth control , in its various manifestations , still has some issues in terms of environmental viability .
But what has even worse implications … is what we ’d do without it .

Media Manipulation 101
How to manufacture a candidate
Creating support out of thin air
All kidding aside , this kind of manipulation is part and parcel of most " information " campaigns .
Task # 1 is to create " evidence " of the widespread popular acceptance of an idea when little or none exists .
See how easy this is to do if you have just one well - placed media figure who is willing to get the ball rolling ?
Oprah played this role for Obama and Fox News has played it for countless psycho causes and their spokespeople .
Unless they have a personal ax to grind , most news outlets simply accept the representations of other news outlets and repeat the story .
By the way , note how easy it is to manipulate video images to create a " reality " where none exists .
All the BRASSCHECK images were superimposed on existing video ( but I 'm sure you already knew that . )

Some moths and butterflies bear circular , high - contrast marks on their wings that have long been thought to scare off predators by mimicking the eyes of the predators ' own enemies .
Not so , say Martin Stevens and two colleagues at the University of Cambridge in England , who argue the marks work simply because they are conspicuous .
( Predators are wary of prey with striking patterns , as those patterns often warn of toxic substances . )
To test their claim , the team created artificial prey using pieces of gray paper marked with black - on - white spots in various shapes , sizes , and numbers ; they attached the paper " wings " to dead mealworms , pinned the worms to trees , and waited .
Two days later , they found that the worms affixed to " moths " with eye - mimicking pairs of spots had been devoured by wild birds in numbers equal to those associated with eye - catching shapes : rectangles , single large spots , and trios of small spots .
It was conspicuousness that was doing the trick .
Why , then , do wing marks look so much like eyes ?
The answer may lie in the process of wing formation .
During moth development , molecules that cause wing cells to produce pigment can easily radiate from a central point , resulting in circular designs .
Eye - like marks in the animal kingdom are often called " eyespots . "
Now , Stevens recommends that the words " wing spots , " " tail spots , " or " fin spots " be used to designate them instead .
The finding was detailed in the journal Behavioral Ecology .

Have no fear .
Britain ’s etiquette bible has come to the rescue for social networkers who are at a loss about how to behave with online decorum .
Debrett ’s have helped to compile a new set of “ golden rules ” for devotees of sites like Facebook and Bebo .
The rules were put together after research by the telecoms company Orange showed that almost two thirds of social networkers are frustrated and confused by online etiquette .
It discovered that more than a quarter were uncertain about how to respond to unwelcome “ pokes ” or messages .
Eighteen percent confessed to being confused on “ how to respond to my ex when in a relationship with someone else . ”
Debrett ’s etiquette adviser Jo Bryant tried to guide the confused through what can be a social minefield .
Acknowledging that social networking has made new demands on traditional etiquette , she said “ My advice is to play it safe and always employ your usual good manners when online , treating others with kindness and respect . ”
And you should never throw caution to the wind .
Mark Watt - Jones , head of development and innovation at Orange , said “ Whether you are checking your Facebook profile or posting photos of friends on MySpace at work , these guidelines will ensure you never lose old friends or make unwanted new ones . ”
The golden rules compiled by Debrett ’s with Orange are :
1 . You do n’t have to make friends with people you do n’t know .
Think before you poke .
2 . Wait 24 hours before accepting or removing someone as a friend .
The delay will help you gather your thoughts .
3. Birthdays , engagements and weddings are not “ virtual ” events .
Always send cards or phone friends when there is an important event .
4 . Think before posting a friend ’s photo what you would feel like if it was you .
5 . Think carefully about your profile picture .
Would you want it to be appearing in your local newspaper ?

Unless you ’ve been able to avoid the news for the last two years , you ’re probably well aware of the fact that the price of crude oil has been on a strong and steady climb .
While there are some economists who claim that the major factors behind the dramatic increase in price are a weak dollar and out of control commodity traders , a vast majority of economists , ecologists and every day people are worried that the real answer is much simpler : we ca n’t produce enough oil to meet current demand and we ’re quickly draining what supplies we have left .
Thanks to the industrialization of the two most populated countries in the world – China and India – the world - wide demand for oil and petroleum based products has soared over the past decade .
Unfortunately , since oil is a finite commodity ( there ’s only so much left in the world , not to mention the fact that there is n’t much , if any , excess refining capacity ) this increased demand has done two distinct things :
Driven the price of oil up nearly 75 % in the last year alone Drastically reduced the amount of the world ’s remaining supply of oil
While I ’m sure there are plenty of very educated people out there who have a pretty good idea how much oil is left , it seems that considering the wide range of time frames being given , it seems that even most people “ in the know ” are just guessing .
So , I figured why not give Daily Fuel Economy Tip readers a chance to guess as well ?!?
About a week ago I put up a poll which asked : “ When do you think the world will run out of oil ? ”
Well over 200 people responded , and this is what they had to say :
38 % said we will run out of oil in more than 100 years
23 % said we will run out of oil in less than 25 years
18 % said we will run out of oil in 26 to 50 years
13 % said we will run out of oil in 51 to 75 years
8 % said we will run out of oil in 76 to 100 years
It certainly seems like there ’s a pretty good split between those who think we have some time ( 38 % for 100 + years ) and those of us who think time is running out ( 41 % for less than 50 years ) .
It seems us common folk can do about as good of a job predicting future oil supplies as the so called “ experts . ”
Unfortunately , since most of the world ’s expansion over the last 50 years can be directly attributed to cheap energy ( specifically cheap oil ) it really does feel as if we are on the cusp of a Brave New World .
Will we experience hyper-inflation on everything from fuel to food ?
Will things like transcontinental flights be a thing of the past ?
Will we begin to see a gradual decrease in the world ’s population ?
I know that many of these questions seem rather absurd , especially when they ’re looked at in the context of “ the here and now . ”
However , when taking the long - term view , it ’s actually very easy to see the world coming to a grinding halt thanks to a significant decline in the availability of oil .
The reason being , less oil will have an enormous trickle - down effect .
Just look at the following examples of what could happen due to higher oil prices :
Obviously , the price of most forms of energy will go through the roof .
The price of all transportation fuels will skyrocket .
In order to help combat these increased costs , people will become more urbanized and things like the suburbs will become a thing of the past .
High transportation costs will cause a dramatic trickle - down effect on consumer prices as manufacturers have no choice to pass on the costs to their customers .
No consumer product will be safe .
Any petroleum based product ( plastic anyone ? ) will undergo significant price increases .
Do yourself a favor and try and pick out even one item near you that neither contains plastic nor was produced by anything containing plastic .
As oil prices increase , there will be greater emphasis placed on bringing alternative fuels to the market .
Right now , it appears our main efforts are being focused on ethanol .
As farmers focus more of their efforts on producing ethanol producing plants , the price of these plants , as well as the prices of every other fruit / vegetable / dairy / poultry / beef / pork product will climb exponentially higher .
These likely scenarios just scratch the surface , and do n’t even begin to speak to the increased conflict over the world ’s remaining oil supplies .
But , so I do n’t end this post on such a gloom and doom note , it does appear that there is reason to be thankful for the recent run of gasoline and oil prices , as there now appears to be much more focus on finding cheap , clean and sustainable alternative fuel sources .
As these fuels / energies become more mainstream , hopefully they will reduce our demand for oil to the point that we do n’t even care how much petroleum is left in the earth .

Above audio clip and more from Media Matters :
While discussing the controversy surrounding Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Sen. Barack Obama 's former pastor , on the April 30 edition of his nationally syndicated Fox News radio show , host John Gibson aired an audio clip of MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow in which she asked , " What else has to happen in the news to push Jeremiah Wright out of the headlines ? "
Following her comments , Gibson aired an unidentified audio clip of a man saying , " Ooh , lesbians .
Yummy . "
Later in the segment , Gibson 's producer , known on - air as " Angry Rich " said , " That Maddow 's become bathtub boy 's pit bull , has n't she ? " -- an apparent reference to MSNBC's Countdown host , Keith Olbermann .
Gibson replied , " Ooohhh . ...
Well , I do n't know , you know ?
She may have one of those -- I should n't say anything more , should I ? " " Angry Rich " said , " No , " and Gibson said , apparently referring to his associate producer , " Christine 's shaking her head back and forth , " and went on to air an audio clip in which an unidentified woman said , " I would like to thank my wife . "
Gibson later said , " Did I tell you about the people ... on the island of Lesbos ? "

Vanishing Species ?
Think the polar bear has it bad ?
Here are 10 critters that are even worse off than our favorite threatened Arctic resident .
Listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature 's ( IUCN ) Red List as critically endangered , meaning they face an extremely high risk of extinction in the immediate future , these animals may not live to see the end of the next decade without the a similar effort of human intervention that brought them to the brink in the first place .
Sumatran Rhinoceros

The smallest of rhinoceroses ( Dicerorhinus sumatrensis ) used to flourish throughout the rain forests , cloud forests , and swamps of India and Southeast Asia .
Now critically endangered , only six substantial populations remain in the wild , where they 're estimated to number around 300 .
The main culprits for their dwindling numbers ?
Illegal poaching — their horns can fetch as much as $ 30,000 per kilogram on the black market — and the rampant destruction of their habitat in the name of human progress .
Another reason the animals are doomed : Zoos have found very little success breeding the rhinos in captivity .
Western Gray Whale

Although the International Whaling Commission banned the hunting of gray whales in 1947 , the Western Pacific population ( Esrichtiius robustus ) never recovered from unchecked whaling in the 19th and early 20th centuries :
Out of the 100 western grays that remain , only 23 are reproductive females .
Their only known feeding ground off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island in Russia has since been annexed by oil companies whose exploration and mining activities , including high - intensity seismic surveying , drilling operations , increased ship and air traffic , and oil spills , are driving the 30 - ton mammals to extinction .
Red Wolf

Smaller and more slender than its gray - wolf cousin , the red wolf ( Canis lupus rufus ) managed to survive the Late Pleistocene ice age but may not be able to slink by modern man .
Once widespread throughout the southeastern United States , red wolf - populations have been so devastated by predator - control programs and habitat loss that the dearth of breeding partners has led many of them to mate with coyotes instead , further reducing the number of genetically pure wolves .
An estimated 100 wolves roam northeastern North Carolina today , while another 150 reside at captive breeding facilities across the United States .

Siberian Tiger

Also known as the Amur tiger , the Siberian tiger ( Panthera tigris altaica ) , whose former range included northeastern China , the Korean Peninsula , and Mongolia , is now almost completely confined to Russia 's Amur - Ussuri region , where it is now protected .
An estimated 350 to 450 tigers are believed to be still alive , although the persistent threats of habitat loss through logging and development , as well as poaching for their fur and bones continue to loom overhead .

The only ferret native to North America , and one of the most endangered mammals on the continent , the black - footed ferret ( Mustela nigripes ) teeters on the edge of extinction because human development has reduced their grasslands habitat to less than 2 percent of its original size .
Because prairie dogs comprise 90 percent of a ferret 's diet , the destruction of prairie - dog colonies due to habitat destruction , pest- elimination programs , and disease are huge contributors to the ferret 's downward spiral .
Philippine Crocodile

Found only on the islands from which it derives its name , the freshwater Philippine crocodile ( Crocodylus mindorensis ) is legally protected in its native country , although it continues to face threats from human disturbance , including habitat loss and accidental death by dynamite fishing .
A 1995 survey found only 100 adult crocs left in the wild , making the animal one of the most severely threatened species on the planet .
Mountain Gorilla

Although mountain gorillas ( Gorilla beringeiberingei ) managed to elude discovery until as late as 1902 , their populations have been so decimated by deforestation , hunting , and the illegal pet trade that only 720 remain in the wild , split between Uganda 's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and the Virunga range of volcanic mountains on the borders of the Democratic Repulic of Congo , Rwanda , Uganda .
Civil unrest in central Africa , particularly in the Congo , add another wrinkle in conservation efforts .

This rare and elusive species of shark ( Glyphis gangeticus ) makes its home in India 's Ganges River , where it has a reputation as a man-eater , although people may be confusing it with the more dangerous bull shark .
One of 20 sharks on the IUCN 's Red List of endangered species , the Ganges shark is highly sought after for its oil .
Rampant fishing , habitat degradation from pollution , and increasing river utilization , however , remain the primary causes for its rapid disappearance .
Sumatran Orangutan
A baby orangutan takes thumb - sucking to a new level thanks to prehensile feet .
Much like human children , baby orangutans remain dependent on their moms for a long time , sometimes being carried most of the time until they 're 5 years old .
Young orangutans normally do n't leave mom's side until they 're 10 or so , and even when they do strike out on their own , they often return to ' visit ' for the next few years .

The smaller and rarer of the two species of orangutans , the fruit - and insect - loving Sumatran orangutan ( Pongo abelii ) is being pushed to imminent extinction by ... you guessed it ... habitat loss and poaching .
While orangutans live for roughly 45 years in the wild , they also breed more slowly than other primates — a single female produces no more than three offspring in her lifetime — which means that orangutan populations grow slowly and are less tenacious when it comes to recovering from external threats .
California Condor

A resident of the Grand Canyon area and the western coastal mountains of California , the carrion - eating California condor ( Gymnogyps californianus ) has a lifespan of 50 years , making it one of the world 's longest - living birds .
Because of poaching , lead poisoning , and habitat loss , however , it 's also one of the world 's rarest bird species — one that was almost wiped out completely in the 1980s .
With the help of conservation efforts , 332 condors are now known to exist , including 152 in the wild .
One of the little challenges with writing Unix programs in Python is the search path problem .
The natural structure of Python programs is to split functionality up into a bunch of modules and then import them all in the main program , but the natural structure of a Unix program is to put its binary into one directory ( such as /usr / bin ) but all of its helper bits into a second , completely different directory .
So the problem is : how is a Unix Python program supposed to find its modules ?
( The normal Python search path for import is the directory that the program is being run from , such as /usr / bin or $ HOME / bin , and the system Python package areas . )
The obvious solution is to have your program start off by adding its module directory to sys.path .
The problem here is that this is an installation dependent location , which means that you 're customizing your main program each time it gets installed .
I dislike this and find it ugly , plus I maintain that overriding sys. path gets in the way of a number of things and can cause subtle problems .
It turns out that there is a simple workaround , hinted at by the aside there : put the Python main program into its library directory along with the rest of its modules , and turn the command that gets installed into the binary directory into a tiny shell script that is just :
#! /bin/sh
exec / where / ever /prog.py " $ @ "
This results in the library directory being added to the search path , because it is the directory that the actual Python program is being run from .
( And you can be confidant that Python will know what that is , since the program is being started by absolute path . )
It is easy to create this tiny shell script as part of your installation process ( when you 're sure to know where the library directory is , since you are about to put things in it ) .
As a bonus , your main program can still have a .py extension so that you can easily do things like check it with pychecker or import it into an interpreter to poke at something .
( Credit where credit is due : I did n't invent this trick .
I believe I first saw it being used by a Python program on Fedora or one of the pre-Fedora Red Hat version . )
PEJ Campaign Coverage Index July 28 - August 3 , 2008
For the first time since this general election campaign began in early June , Republican John McCain attracted virtually as much media attention as his Democratic rival last week .
Barack Obama was a significant or dominant factor in 81 % of the campaign stories compared with 78 % for McCain , according to PEJ ’s Campaign Coverage Index for July 28 - Aug .
3 . Not only was that a high water mark for McCain in the general election season ( his previous best was 62 % from June 30 - July 6 ) .
The virtual dead heat in the race for exposure between the two candidates also marked the first time his weekly coverage had even been within 10 percentage points of Obama ’s total .
Indeed , in the eight weeks since early June when the general election contest began , 79 % of the stories have significantly featured Obama , compared with 55 % for his Republican rival .
The spike in press attention to the McCain campaign came a week after Obama ’s tour of the Mideast and Europe commandeered the headlines , accounting for half the election coverage for July 21 - 27 .
It also came a week after the media engaged in a spasm of introspection , amid a wave of accusations that the media was being unfair to the GOP standard bearer .
The third biggest campaign storyline for July 21 - 27 was the issue of whether the press was biased toward and lavishing too much attention on Obama .
Last week , the McCain campaign also drove the narrative by directly tackling that perception in a controversial ad .
It described Obama as “ the biggest celebrity in the world ” and featured images of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton — two tabloid favorites known more for hard - partying lifestyles than any other achievements .
( It was a relatively big week for Spears , too .
First , she was featured in the ad .
Then an Obama spokesman responded to that spot by accusing McCain of another negative attack , saying “ Oops !
He did it again ” — which is a play on the title of her hit single . )
The “ celebrity ” spot also helped push campaign advertising to a more prominent place in the coverage than before .
Advertising was the second - biggest campaign story line last week , filling 10 % of the campaign newshole .
And the ripple effects were felt throughout the week .
The ad generated another narrative — whether McCain campaign was too negative — that filled 6 % of the newshole .
The tone of the campaign , and the new McCain ad , then triggered a third major story line .
When Obama accused Republicans of trying to frighten Americans because he “ does n’t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills , ” the McCain team responded by accusing Obama of playing the “ race card . ”
And that controversy , at 15 % , became the biggest campaign narrative of all .
In total , the chain of events set in motion by the celebrity ad accounted for almost one - third of the campaign coverage last week .
Hence McCain ’s attack advertising strategy , which played off the notion that the press was infatuated with Obama , and blended it with the McCain theme that Obama offered less than meets the eye , drove the media narrative last week .
Stories about vice - presidential picks , fueled by speculation that Obama might select Virginia Governor and fellow Harvard Law alum Tim Kaine , accounted for another 9 % of the campaign newshole .
Also at 9 % was the policy debate over the economy as Obama convened a summit of his fiscal advisors and McCain hammered away at the theme of increased oil drilling as a solution to energy price inflation .
One story that could have dominated the week , had the news been bad , subsided ( down to 2 % of the newshole ) after a mole removed from melanoma survivor McCain proved to be benign .
In some ways , the media ’s soul searching over its own role , and the resulting spike upward in coverage of McCain , were perhaps predictable .
This had happened before , back during the primaries between Obama and Hillary Clinton .
The week of Feb. 25 - March 2 , after Clinton complained about a pro-Obama bias and cited a Saturday Night Live skit to make her point , the press spent considerable time examining the possibility it was being unfair .
And it followed that the next week , Clinton generated more coverage than her Democratic rival , reversing a trend of several weeks when Obama had been the top newsmaker .
If the McCain camp was trying to force the press to recalibrate and rethink , in other words , there was reason to imagine it might have an effect .
Overall , coverage of the presidential campaign last week accounted for 26 % of the overall newshole , as measured by PEJ ’s News Coverage Index from July 28 - Aug .
3 . That represents a drop of 12 percentage points from the previous week , when the Obama trip fueled much of the campaign coverage .
The campaign was the No. 1 story in every media sector , but the overall coverage number was again inflated by cable ’s intense interest .
Last week , the campaign accounted for 49 % of all the cable news airtime studied .
That contrasted with radio ( 28 % ) , network news ( 22 % ) , online ( 15 % ) and newspapers ( 13 % ) ,
During the primary season , the principal focus of the Campaign Coverage Index was on the competition for exposure among the candidates .
That was measured by the number of stories in which a candidate played a significant role ( as a subject of between 25 % and 50 % of the story ) or a main newsmaker role ( at least 50 % of the story ) .
Now , in the general election season , the CCI is also highlighting another dimension of the coverage , the campaign storylines of the week — the specific themes that make up the campaign coverage .
They are measured as a percentage of overall coverage , or newshole .
We will continue to track the quantity of coverage generated by the leading candidates .
The CCI is an addition to PEJ ’s News Coverage Index , which tracks all the topics in the news and which will continue to appear at the bottom of the CCI .
As soon as McCain ’s new ad was released on July 30 , it triggered a torrent of commentary , even from some of the lighter - hearted quarters of the punditocracy .
“ Have you seen the new commercial ?
The McCain campaign compares Barack Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , ” joked the Tonight show ’s Jay Leno .
“ And today the Obama campaign released an ad comparing John McCain to Zsa Zsa Gabor and Bea Arthur . ”
A more sober analysis of the ad came in Reuters story on Yahoo !
News .
The Republican camp “ senses a chink in Obama ’s armor following the Democrat ’s European tour , which did not appear to give Obama a noticeable bounce in the polls , despite drawing a crowd of 200,000 in Berlin . ”
But much of the coverage of McCain ’s strategy tried to add a note of skepticism about it as well .
The Reuters story noted that , “ it is a strategy that carries some risks with Americans weary of partisan sniping . ”
That risk was also part of the discussion on the July 30 edition of CNN ’s Election Center when correspondent Dana Bash said that , “ Beyond this one ad , other overriding concerns I ’m hearing is that McCain … has perhaps gone too negative and it ’s taking away from his above - the - fray campaign that he has said that he wants to run . ”
If the McCain camp faced some criticism of the Spears ad , it seemed to regain the offensive on the “ race card . ”
It began after Obama accused Republicans of scaring voters and made the point that he does not look like other Presidents .
The front - page Aug. 1 New York Times story was only one of many accounts that quoted McCain campaign manager Rick Davis ’ assertion that “ Barack Obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck . ”
While the story noted that the McCain rebuttal “ could cut both ways , ” it said the “ remarks put Mr. Obama ’s campaign … in a delicate position ….his campaign gingerly tried to tamp down the issue , saying he did not believe that Mr. McCain had tried to use race as an issue . ”
The Associated Press story in the Aug. 1 edition of The Gazette of Colorado Springs took a broader view , declaring that this latest volley between the two campaigns “ was the latest spike in a contest that ’s grown increasingly negative despite pledges by both Obama and McCain to run aboveboard campaigns . ”
“ The daily rhetoric has turned red hot , ” the story continued , “ as both maneuver for advantage and polls show the race competitive three months before the election . ”
And now , in the rest of the week ’s news :
The No. 2 and No. 3 stories for the week of July 28 - Aug. 3 were closely related subjects .
Coverage of the economy — at 5 % of the overall newshole as measured by PEJ ’s News coverage Index — was driven by the signing of housing legislation and news of a projected federal budget deficit of nearly half a trillion dollars .
Next , at 4 % of the newshole , was the subject of energy prices in a week in which oil fluctuated , gas dropped and Exxon Mobile reported record quarter profits of $ 11.7 billion .
That was followed , also at 4 % , by news of the indictment of Senator Ted Stevens , the seven - term Alaska Republican .
Events inside Iraq constituted the No. 5 story , also at 4 % of the newshole .

Ring by Stephen Baxter , but it 's a pretty common motif in a lot of " hard " sci-fi .
For everyone who 's been asking me about this whole strip - redrawing thing I mentioned on Friday : fear not !
The original strips are not going anywhere .
If I do re-draw any of them , it will be mostly for my own amusement anyway , and they will go up in a different section of the site .
I never even got around to doing one this weekend anyway , so nobody has any reason to be nervous .
If you , like me , enjoy bizarre humor and goofy sketchy drawings , you will probably really enjoy Monkey Business .
It 's a very simple strip , but in this case simple means ruthlessly effective at making me giggle .
Anyway , Karl ( Monkei )
Wang has said that he'd like a little more traffic to his site , and I thought " who better to enjoy his comic than the fine readers of my own ? "
Anyway , check it out , and if you like it , drop him a line and let him know who sent you .
It is always good to find new funny things to laugh at .
Questionable Content has secured a comfortable berth at # 20 on Buzzcomix .
Super - bonus thanks to everyone who votes .
It really helps .
I think that is all for now .
I am getting back into Soul Calibur 2 , that is pretty much what I was doing all day when I was not working on the comic .
Time to go kick some more ass with Mitsurugi .
See you Wednesday !
I think today 's strip was inspired by all the sci- fi I 've been reading lately , specifically the stuff where people figure out how to extend their lifespans over centuries .
I 'm talking specifically about
The Proton launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome A Russian Proton Breeze M rocket has successfully launched one of the biggest commercial satellites ever built - the Inmarsat - 4 ( I4 - F3 ) .
The telecommunications spacecraft was released by the Proton at 0746 GMT , after a flight of more than nine hours .
It was the rocket 's first outing since an upper - stage failure in March left a US coms platform at a useless altitude .
The I4 - F3 , operated by the UK - based Inmarsat company , will complete the firm 's satellite broadband network .
The latest spacecraft joins two others of the same design that are already in orbit .
The new satellite will be positioned over the Americas at 98 degrees West to give Inmarsat global coverage .
The company 's network delivers high - speed ( up to half a megabit ) mobile internet and phone services to users on land , at sea and in the air .
The I4s are immense .
The main body is 7 m high and incorporates a 9 m - wide antenna reflector that is unfurled in space like a fan .
" Each is almost the size of a double - decker bus , weighs six tonnes , and has a solar wingspan the length of a football pitch , " said Andrew Sukawaty , CEO and chairman of Inmarsat .
It will take about a month to get the I4 - F3 ready for service " Each I4 is 60 times more powerful and has 16 times the capacity of an Inmarsat - 3 satellite . "
The Proton Breeze M , operated by International Launch Services , left the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 2243 GMT , Monday .
The 58 m - high , 700 - tonne vehicle was making its return to flight after stranding the US AMC - 14 satellite well below its intended operational orbit .
A review board determined that a pipe rupture in the Breeze M upper - stage caused the booster to shut down early , and the rocket 's manufacturer - the Khrunichev Space Centre - was ordered to make modifications .
Protons have been launching commercial satellites since 1996 , but they have a much deeper governmental heritage going back to the 1960s .
The vehicles have despatched science missions to the planets .
They have also launched key components of the Soviet - era Mir space station and the International Space Station .
Although the Proton can be regarded as one of the most successful heavy boosters in history , the March failure was the third in three years and a successful outing for the Inmarsat satellite was deemed absolutely essential to maintain market confidence in the rocket .
The I4 is one of the biggest commercial platforms in operation today

Amy Goodman from DemocracyNOW asks investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill how Blackwater profited off Hurricane Katrina .
Security and intelligence expert Dr. R.J.
Hillhouse reports at her " Spy Who Billed Me " blog that Blackwater has issued a shout - out for armed security officers for possible deployment under their DHS contract in the wake of Hurricane Gustav .
Officers must have a firearms license - and those with revolver - only status need not apply .
She reproduces this call for personell from Blackwater themselves , issued late Friday :
Blackwater is compiling a list of qualified security personnel for possible deployment into areas affected by Hurricane Gustav .
Applicants must meet all items listed under the respective Officer posting and be US citizens .
Contract length is TBD .
Law Enforcement Officers ( all criteria must apply )
1. Current sworn [ may be full time , part time or reserve ]
2 . With arrest powers
3. Armed status ( must indicate Armed and / or Semi Auto .
Revolver only not accepted ) expiration must be greater than 60 days out
4. Departmental credentials ( not just a badge )
Armed Security Officers ( all criteria must apply )
Only from the following states : OR , WA , CA , NV , NM , AZ , TX , FL , GA , SC , NC , VA , MD , IL , OK .
1. Current / active / licensed / registered armed security officer
2 . All training verification [ unarmed and armed certificates of completion ]
3. Current state issued face card indicting armed status [ expiration must be greater than 60 days out ]
Last time out , during Katrina , Blackwater mercenaries were patrolling New Orleans in full battle dress and with assault weapons in what some called an end - run around Posse Comitatus .
It looks like they 're ready to do it again .
If so , let 's hope there 's none of the kind of " accidents " they 've had in Iraq
WASHINGTON -- The 110th Congress , whose term officially ends in January , has n't passed any spending bills or attacked high gasoline prices .
But it has used its powers to celebrate watermelons and to decree the origins of the word " baseball . "
Barring a burst of legislative activity after Labor Day , this group of 535 men and women will have accomplished a rare feat .
In two decades of record keeping , no sitting Congress has passed fewer public laws at this point in the session -- 294 so far -- than this one .
That 's not to say ...
I ’m thrilled to announce the release of Launchpad 2.0 !
This brings together new features from the past nine months of Launchpad ’s development and introduces two exciting beta features .
And , of course , if you ’ve visited Launchpad recently you ’ll have seen our new , simpler , layout and navigation .
Let ’s take a look at the key new features in this release .
Restful web services API and Python library
One of our main goals for Launchpad 2.0 has been to make it easier to manipulate data in Launchpad .
With this release , we ’re introducing a beta test of two things that will enable you to develop external applications that can authenticate ,
query and modify data in Launchpad ’s database :
a restful web services API
and a Python library to access the new API .
Initially , the API will provide access to file and search for bugs , as well as the people and teams systems .
We ’ll announce full details of the API and Python library later this week ; keep an eye on this blog !
In the mean time , apply to join the Launchpad Beta Testers team if you ’d like to take part in the beta .
Closer integration with Bugzilla and Trac
Often , bugs in free software affect more than one project .
Launchpad lets projects share the same bug report and comment history so they can worth together on a fix .
Up until now , that ’s only been available where each project uses Launchpad as their bug tracker .
With Launchpad 2.0 , we ’re introducing a beta test of two new GPL plugins — one for Bugzilla , one for Trac — that enable projects to share a comment history between the bug as it ’s tracked in Launchpad and in external trackers .
If you would like to help beta test the new plugins , let us know .
Simpler page layout and navigation
One of the most obvious changes in Launchpad 2.0 is the web interface ’s new design .
Our aim has been to simplify the layout and navigation .
There ’s more in our blog post .
New tour
Want to show someone what Launchpad ’s all about ?
Send them to our new tour !
Other new features that make up Launchpad 2.0
Since our 1.0 launch in April 2007 , we ’ve introduced many new features that make up Launchpad 2.0 , including :
Code review : public discussion and voting on proposed code merges .
public discussion and voting on proposed code merges .
Mailing lists for teams .
. Personal package archives : publish Ubuntu packages in your own apt repository .
publish Ubuntu packages in your own apt repository .
Atom feeds for bugs , branches and project announcements .
Plus : binary file downloads , improved universal search , translation string search and support for more external bug trackers , amongst other improvements .
As ever , we ’d love to hear what you think of our new release .
If you come across a problem , please file a bug .
Otherwise , send us an email , in particular if there ’s something you really want to see in a future Launchpad release .
DIGG THIS
Writing in The Freeman recently , Roy E. Cordato explains how it is impossible to harm the environment .
His conclusion is based on an examination of the so - called " polluter pays principle " from a property standpoint .
The polluter pays principle states that " whoever is responsible for damage to the environment should bear the costs associated with it . "
Cordato points out that the " polluter pays principle " sounds good because it appeals superficially to people ’s sense of justice and fair play , as must every salient political program .
As goes the popular argument , people should be held responsible for their actions and polluters who cause damage to others should " pay " for that damage .
Now what man in his right mind could argue with that ?
But on reflection , these questions come to mind : what damage , to whom and by whom ?
The trouble is these questions cannot be answered in a political context .
In examining this popular principle of justice from a property - rights standpoint , Cordato discovers , naturally , that what is casually referred to as polluting can be the result of definite acts of specific humans that may cause damage .
And if it does , it is because it results in harm to other specific humans .
As he points out , real damage is harm measurable in terms of specific economic impairment to somebody ’s property and the prerogatives that pertain thereto .
In this realm of real responsibility and authority , there is a specific , measurable cause of action .
In this event , science offers means of connecting causes with effects .
Forensic science , in particular , seeks to trace particular consequences to particular acts , human versus non-human .
Ideally , the legal profession and the courts process such evidence to wrangle settlements between interested and affected humans according to tort law in a ritual known as " due process of law . "
If the settlement is consistent with the evidence connecting cause with effect , the outcome is known as " justice . "
This is the outcome Cordato has in mind .
However , regardless of such an outcome , merely a day in court engaged in the legal ritual passes for justice more often than not .
Since the environment is not a person , either real or incorporeal , the environment can have no property rights that can be damaged by human action and resolved under tort law .
Indeed , the environment is not property subject to any human authority .
Furthermore , tracing specific human acts to actual permanent effects on the general physical environment — let alone " damages " — is a daunting task riddled with questionable assumptions .
If so , “ environmental protection ” is a myth having no legal or ethical standing .
Therefore , laws purporting to protect the environment are invalid , null and void .
Prosecutions under them must be considered political scams because there is no identifiable property to examine for damage , let alone specific culpability for the consequences .
Without a property issue , there can be no determinate cause and effect in society and , thus , no resolvable question of justice or welfare .
So how does " the environment " become a legitimate concern of government ?
It is not a constituency that is mentioned anywhere in James Madison ’s Constitution of 1787 .
So the question arises as to how it came to be a province of government with all the legislative and judicial initiatives attendant thereto ?
A plausible theory of environmental protection by government is paternalism , immortalized in the expression " papa knows best . "
The natural history of paternalism shows that " papa " must somehow supersede the bounds of biological kinship if he is to obtain indefinite and unlimited parental authority over his less - mature fellows , thereby to see to their welfare , need it or not .
As an opportunistic expedient for implementing the paternalistic regime within a constitutional framework , environmentalists claim jurisdiction over " the environment " ( whatever it is ) for the government under the “ general welfare ” clause of the Preamble to the Constitution .
It is doubtful Madison could have imagined such a reach for power within the meaning and intent of his charter of government .
That the general welfare of the people expressed as a mere sentiment in a perfunctory statement could be construed as evidence of a beneficent superhuman entity with rights of its own stretches the imagination of even the most modern person imbued with the romance of technology .
Actually , personification or deification of the environment is a vestige of mankind ’s pagan roots , such as Aztec Sun worship .
It follows that environmentalism is the religion that worships the environment , whatever that is .
Its " protection " is a sacred trust of the properly devoted , who are rewarded with the celebrity status of moral superiority .
If fervent environmentalism is most moral , it is fair to ask how human welfare is enhanced by this religious practice .
The answer is surprising .
Akin to many ancient religious practices , environmentalism advocates human sacrifice .
Human welfare is subordinated to the welfare of the environment as defined by the environmental clergy .
How perverse !
But the environment is not a human being that can have moral standing .
It can have no property that can be infringed , encroached , injured or damaged .
Having no property , the environment has neither legal nor social standing either .
This means that it plays no role whatsoever in the multitude of voluntary transactions comprising the market .
On the other hand , the market , comprised as it is of the multitude of voluntary transactions between property - wielding - and - owning people throughout the population , constitutes the environment for human action .
Protection of this part of the environment is a matter of concern for the general welfare .
Such environmental protection consists of the housekeeping , hygiene , conservation , exchange and restitution practices common to proprietors and familiar to all still living on the planet .
More specifically , it consists of upholding the integrity of the property principle .
Sadly , Madison neglected to make this connection .
Perhaps he could not foresee how his concept of " the general welfare " could be perverted .
Populist demagogues are delighted to have the state hold the bag for payments for " damages " to the " environment " because they expect to control the state with its monopoly of political power .
The environment is nobody and the polluter is everybody .
Goody !
Goody !
So in the name of the general welfare , legislators create a discretionary program to gratuitously remediate the guilt of others for alleged despoliation , otherwise known as living .
Oddly enough , this intervention is called " public service . "
Never mind the restitution of real injuries .
What ’s that ?
Environmentalists will object to Cordato ’s work to resolve environmental issues under the property principle because it relegates the role of the state to tedious due process of law and then only on strictly individual human considerations .
Libertarians will applaud Cordato ’s work precisely because it is concerned with the fate of individual humans striving to survive and prosper in the mass of humanity .
However , some may be impatient with his concentration on legal remedies instead of market alternatives .
Even though Cordato may not be entirely laissez faire in his approach to environmental issues , he succeeds very well in clarifying the nature of them .
He makes it plain that environmental protection is nothing more than a political ruse .
Without recourse to the property principle , environmentalism has no ethical , common - law or constitutional standing .
The only part of the environment that has any ethical significance is the market economy , which is the wholly social institution comprised of volitionally acting human beings .
It is not the market but the physical and biological surroundings of the market economy and human population at large that exhibit such phenomena as climate , seasons , storms , temblors , volcanoes , conflagrations , and disease epidemics .
These matters are virtually beyond human influence .
There is little or nothing for humans to do in this arena of nature but to act defensively .
The global physical environment is outside the realm and reach of human action .
Adapting to this non-human environment is the subject of human evolution , a biological and technological process of adaptation that has been going on imperceptibly for eons as a matter of survival .
Adapt or perish .
There is no recourse or choice in the matter .
" Environmentalism " is an ideology that idolizes the Earth as a superhuman entity .
Like most antique theologies , environmentalism ascribes to its deity anthropomorphic traits .
The phrase " Mother Earth " is an apt expression in the liturgy of this religion .
As a theology , environmentalism is detached from reality .
A curiosity of the faithful in this religion is that they worship dirt and disparage humanity .
The clergy of the church of environmentalism is anointed with a mission to assuage the guilt of the mere mortals the mere mortals did n’t know they should have .
Fundamental environmentalism is also a form of collectivism .
People are lumped together as " humanity , " a mindless herd that is held to be culpable for injuries and insults to Mother Earth for which , taken as a whole , should be driven to redemption by those of superior moral standing .
Round up all the strays for their own good .
Environmentalism is a political movement .
As such , it is naturally anti-property , anti-libertarian , anti-individualistic and anti-social .
In other words , it is misanthropic .
An example of the environmentalists ’ program is their campaign to wipe out carbon emissions by humans .
Never mind that carbon is the essential element of all life on Earth , and that the carbon in the environment is from the planet itself ( volcanoes , bogs , fires , etc. ) .
Nevertheless , carbon in the atmosphere is demonized as the cause of allegedly impending catastrophic Earth warming .
Regardless of the realities and actualities of global climate , and any changes to it that may be in progress , the environmentalists ’ concern with carbon is no conquest of physical nature .
Make no mistake — it is the conquest of man .
The mantra “ catastrophic anthropogenic global warming ” presages an excuse for a war of human conquest — a war on spontaneous human life that must be waged by the rabid environmentalist collectivists to empower their politically ambitious cohorts .
Their objective is an old one , viz .
to enslave humanity by capturing the seat of political power in the human population and suppressing all contenders .
What is new in this program for conquest is the idea of mobilizing and regimenting humanity to prevent climate change , which is a fantasy .
The rhetoric emanating from the rapturous environmental zealots is full of arrogance .
It is mere pretense to control humans regardless of culpability .
If the environmental mystics are clever enough to deify dirt in the minds of the public , they very well might be able to convince them that every human breath is poisoning the environment and threatening the very world they live in .
Then the fable of Chicken Little comes home to roost .
Some libertarians assert a continuum of belief in the environment as an entity deserving protection from human nature should be considered .
They are looking for a balance in belief between outright totalitarian fascist tyranny involving draconian regulation of behavior and enterprise to some benign pollution taxes or a cap - and - trade regimen in mimicry of the market or enforcement of state court judgments under tort law .
This continuum is envisioned as a spectrum in the level of application of the coercive power of the state for protecting the " environment " from allegedly insulting and degrading human behavior .
But the Austro - libertarian or laissez faire market approach to the environment would not be found in this spectrum because it does not countenance the use of any state political power whatsoever .
Libertarians should be wary of looking for alternatives courses of action in a spectrum of coercive behavior even if they believe their cause is worthy , like the Earth really is warming and something must be done about it .
But means must be consistent with the ends sought or all is lost .
Even Cordato ’s property - rights - based environmental protection scheme is in the middle of this coercion spectrum insofar as it depends on tax - supported state courts and legislatures having a monopoly in the implementation of his " the polluter pays " policy .
This approach is not only hampered by political expedients and distractions but it is doomed to failure in the situations that actually occur .
Apropos of the above , recall Mises dictum :
“ The middle of the road policy leads to socialism . ”
There is no happy medium between coercion and voluntary - ism .
The lesser of two evils is still evil .
There is nothing analogous to public policy in the free market .
The only notion that comes close in free - market parlance is Adam Smith ’s “ invisible hand , ” which is definitely not an appendage on any politician ’s arm , or even the long arm of the law .
Free market institutions cannot be introduced into the government ’s " environmental protection " game except as corrupt rent - seeking rackets .
Such fashionable rackets nowadays include the carbon emission cap and trade schemes .
The government caps and you trade on some government franchised and regulated bourse .
Trade or quit .
Some market , not !
A pollution tax is more honest .
Tax is a euphemism for theft .
Humans should be alarmed not so much over perceived threats to their shared environment by careless human action , or even from the obvious abuses of opportunistic political government .
Their real enemy is but the misanthropy of a righteous environmental movement that seeks absolute control of a strong political state and all who can be brought under its hegemony .
If the environmentalists have their way , humanity stands to experience the misery of policide ( politically inflicted social devolution ) .
If you think global climate change is threatening , you have n’t considered the consequences of social devolution .
The grand alternative to this state of affairs is laissez faire — spontaneous order evolving in free markets superseding political government altogether .
For what other reasons would the environmentalists want uncontested control of the state ?
Certainly not to control the global climate .
They ai n’t that stupid .
They ai n’t that reckless , either .
They dread possible genocide of the affluent population of the Earth that pays the taxes they crave .
But they risk this outcome in the formulation and pursuit of their policies , which cannot accomplish any of their climate aims because human life has so little to do with that aspect of the environment .
Environmental protection under the rule of statute law is impossible precisely because it does not fit the property principle .
Neither law nor politics is relevant to global climate or any other environmental concern .
If the Earth is warming , not even preemptive genocide would stop it .
Nature would be taking its course and there would be no way for humans to intercede to control it , let alone stop it , with or without the full force and credit of government .
The best they can do is adopt the Boy Scout Motto : " Be Prepared . "

In the cat and mouse game of preparing and eavesdropping on secret messages , quantum encryption trumps all .
At least , that ’s what we ’ve been told .
The truth is a little more complex .
Quantum key distribution , the quantum technique by which a classical encryption key can be transferred , is perfectly secure in theory .
In practice , there are a number of loopholes that can give an eavesdropper a grandstand view of the conversation .
Here ’s one loophole .
The security of quantum encryption schemes depends on our inability to make a copy of a quantum state .
If that were possible , Eve could make a copy of the message and pass on the original without anybody being the wiser .
But in the quantum world , copying anything destroys the original , so the sender and receiver can always tell if they ’ve been overheard by examining the error rates in their message .
If it rises above a certain limit , the line is not secure .
That would be pretty convincing were it not for our ability to make imperfect copies of quantum states without destroying the original .
That ’s a loophole that an eavesdropper can exploit to extract information from a quantum message without the sender or receiver knowing .
It should work as long as Eve is careful to keep the error rate below the critical limit .
Today , Yuta Okubo from the University of Tskuba in Japan and a few mates outline the design of a quantum eavesdropper that works on just this principle .
They ’ve yet to build their device but the publication of its plans should raise the blood pressure in a few government agencies and more than one hi-tech start up that has been selling quantum encryption as a new generation of perfectly secure communication .

' Do n't know much about industry ...'
Obama ad mocks McCain RAW STORY
Published : Monday August 25 , 2008
Print This Email This
If the gloves were n't officially off , they are now .
The latest ad released by the Obama campaign does n't out - and - out call Republican presidential candidate John McCain a dummy , but it comes close .
A press release states that the ad , ' Do n't know much , ' was intended to highlight " McCain 's inability to manage the economy " and his " desire to instead , just offer four more years of failed Bush economic policies . "
The ad changes the lyrics to the classic Sam Cooke song " Wonderful World " to portray McCain as misinformed on key issues .
" I 'm not up on the economy , " a singer intones as a McCain quip from last winter is shown on the screen : " Economics is not something Ive understood as well as I should . "
The song continues , " Do n't know much about industry .
Really can't explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class . "
A picture of McCain and Bush smiling together is displayed as the singer sings " but I know that one and one is two . "
A caption notes that McCain " voted with Bush 90 % of the time . "
" And if I could be just like you , " the song concludes with a picture of McCain embracing Bush ( " the infamous hug , " TPM's Greg Sargent calls it ) , " what a wonderful world this can be . "
The ad asks , " Do we really want four more years of the same old tune ? "
The press release by Obama adds , " At a time when Americans are struggling with soaring costs , McCain will provide more tax breaks to corporations that ship American jobs overseas and provide no direct relief at all for more than 100 million middle class families .
Well , we 've tried this approach , and look where it 's gotten us .
Barack Obama knows that these policies have n't worked for the past eight years and they wo n't work now . "
According to the campaign , the ad " will air on national cable and in battleground states around the country beginning today . "
The following video was uploaded to YouTube by the Obama campaign .
On May 5 , 2008 , we posted links to four online surveys on this website , seeking the opinions of atheists and committed Christians on a wide variety of topics .
Over the next few weeks , we received 36,781 finished surveys ( some respondents completed all four , some fewer ) .
Below , we have provided links to the ( as yet unanalyzed ) results for all respondents who met our criteria for inclusion in the study .
We filtered our results according to each person ’s response to the following two statements :
Please indicate your degree of belief in the God of the Bible .
1 . Disbelieve strongly 2 . Disbelieve somewhat 3 . Do n’t Know 4 . Believe somewhat 5 . Believe strongly Please indicate your degree of belief that the Bible is the word of God.
1 . Disbelieve strongly 2 . Disbelieve somewhat 3 . Do n’t Know 4 . Believe somewhat 5 . Believe strongly
Below , we present the data on those who responded with a 1 or a 5 to both of these statements .
The primary purpose of this poll was not opinion research per se .
Rather , we were designing stimuli for an experiment that we are now running on atheists and Christians using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
The goal of this survey was to produce stimuli of two categories – factual and religious – which would behave appropriately once we put members of each group inside our MRI scanner .
We needed factual statements that both atheists and Christians would accept with the same order of confidence and religious statements that would divide them more or less diametrically .
In addition to vetting our experimental stimuli , however , we took the opportunity to solicit the responses of atheists and Christians to psychological and social statements that were not strictly relevant to our ongoing neuroimaging work .
Our ( unanalyzed ) results can be viewed on the pages below .
For each statement the number of respondents averaged around 5000 , 80 - 90 % of whom were atheists .
The numbers of Christian responses ranged from 254-787 .

Now that they 've made it as difficult as possible for those pesky 90 - year - old nuns to cast votes , it 's time to make sure that vets injured and disabled in Iraq and Afghanistan have as difficult a time voting as possible .
The Republican War on Voting , as directed by Commander - in - Chief George W. Bush out of the White House , continues to continue .
The new front : Disallowing registration drives , by non-partisan organizations at Veterans Administration facilities .
That , despite an order issued in late April by the Department of Veterans Affairs that they would allow such activity , in compliance with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 .
Apparently someone high up ( we do n't yet know who ) found out about that , and ordered an about - face on the previous directive , leading the Veterans Health Administration 's Under Secretary for Health , Michael J. Kussman , to announce this week that " Voter registration drives are not permitted " at their facilities , " due to Hatch Act requirements and to avoid disruptions to facility operations . "
" The Department of Veterans Affairs has retreated on a recently announced policy to allow voter registration drives at its facilities where veterans ' groups and others would assist wounded former soldiers to participate in the 2008 presidential election , " writes Steven Rosenfeld over at AlterNet , where he points out that " the Hatch Act restricts political activities by federal employees . "
Non-partisan voter registration drives by groups such as the League of Woman Voters , however , can hardly be considered " political activities by federal employees . "
Senators such as Feinstein and Kerry , and disabled veterans groups , as you may imagine , are none too happy ...
Rosenfeld goes on to quote from a statement and letter issued yesterday by the Senators , demanding an explanation for the quickly changed policy , and wondering what " type of disruptions the VA envisions might occur during voter registration drives by ... the League of Women Voters or veterans ' organizations . "
( Their statement and letter are posted in full at the end of this article . )
As well , Rosenfeld offers comment from disabled vet groups who charge " block[ing ] voter registration for our hospitalized veterans is shameful , outrageous , and despicable . "
But since when has shamefulness ever gotten in the way of Republican Party policy to undermine American democracy or show out - and - out contempt for U.S. troops ?
Paul Sullivan of Veterans for Common Sense added that his group " finds it unconscionable that VA would reverse position and prohibit voter registration efforts for our wounded , injured , ill , and disabled veterans in VA hospitals and nursing homes as more and more casualties flood home from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars . "
An attorney who has been taking on the VA further points out that the Administration got caught allowing paid campaign workers from the Republican Party to register voters at their facilities while they disallowed nonpartisan groups from the same places .
" They 've been forced to admit under oath that they told the League of Women Voters that if they took a position on Iraq , they 'd lose their access .
The court told them they can't do that anymore , so they are going to ban all voter registration drives , " D.C. attorney Scott Rafferty tells Rosenfeld .
Yeah , it 's that bad .
The complete statement from Feinstein and Kerry follows below [ emphasis in original ] ...
Senators Feinstein and Kerry Express Concerns About Apparent Reversal in Department of Veterans Affairs Policy in Providing Access to Voter Registration for Veterans - New VA Directive appears to include blanket prohibition on voter registration drives - Washington , DC U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) and John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) today expressed concern about a new directive by the Veterans Health Administration that appears to reverse an earlier proposal to provide greater voter registration access to veterans in the departments care .
On April 25 , the Department of Veterans Affairs issued a directive that required all VA facilities develop comprehensive voter registration plans to assist veterans in voting .
It also required the VA to publicly post voter registration information for veteran facility inpatients and required that VA facilities provide absentee voter applications if patients cannot leave the facility .
Earlier this week , the Department of Veterans Affairs withdrew that directive , and issued a new directive that introduces a broad prohibition against organizations conducting voter registration drives at VA facilities .
In response , the senators wrote a letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary James B. Peake , saying the new policy could discourage involvement from nonpartisan groups such as veterans service organizations and the League of Women Voters in helping veterans to vote .
We believe that the earlier directive better addressed the need for a consistent voter registration policy for our veterans , the senators wrote to Secretary Peake .
While the changes made in the new directive seem small , the impact is large .
It appears to us that the Department took one step forward for our veterans and the right to vote by directing that assistance be provided with voter registration and with securing absentee ballots , but then took a large step back by prohibiting voter registration drives .
The Senators requested clarification about why the new directive was issued , who retracted the initial policy directive and whether Secretary Peake sees the change as a complete bar on external , nonpartisan voter registration drives .
Background The VAs April 25 directive came in the wake of a letter exchange between Senators Feinstein and Kerry and Veterans Affairs Secretary James B. Peake over whether VA facilities should be designated as voter registration agencies within the definition of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 .
The Act requires states to offer voter registration opportunities at all offices that provide public assistance , services to the disabled and at all motor vehicle offices .
Many veterans live at VA facilities and some , especially those who are disabled , find it difficult to travel off - campus for services including voter registration .
However , a federal appeals court recently ruled that voter registration groups do not have the right to register veterans on the grounds of VA facilities .
In light of the court decision , Senators Feinstein and Kerry wrote a letter in March to Secretary Peake to find ways to ensure that all veterans have access to voter registration materials and identify the policies they have in place to support voter registration .
Following is the text of the letter by Senators Feinstein and Kerry : May 6 , 2008 The Honorable James B. Peake
Secretary
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
810 Vermont Avenue NW
Washington , DC 20420 Dear Secretary Peake : On April 25 , 2008 , the Department of Veterans Affairs responded to our request for a consistent voter registration policy by issuing Directive 2008 - 23 .
While we do not believe it went far enough , we commend the changes made by the Directive which provided that veterans would be required to receive voter information and assistance in registering and applying for an absentee ballot .
We were pleased that you took action to ensure that our nations veterans can easily register to vote and apply for an absentee ballot .
However , in the few days following the issuance of the first directive , the Department apparently withdrew it .
Without explaining the rationale for this change , the Department today released a new policy , Directive 2008 - 25 .
While the new directive retains many positive provisions found in the earlier directive , it appears that a new and broad prohibition was included against third - party organizations conducting voter registration drives , even with the approval of the Department of Veterans Affairs .
This would have the impact of discouraging involvement from nonpartisan groups for civic support for veterans .
We request that some clarification be provided on why the new directive was issued , who specifically retracted the initial policy directive , and whether you consider this change a complete bar on external , nonpartisan voter registration drives .
The new directive references Hatch Act requirements , but the Office of Special Counsel has made clear that federal employees , even those who are considered to be in sensitive positions , may assist in voter registration drives .
It is also clear from numerous policy statements issued by the Office of Special Counsel that federal employees can participate in nonpartisan voter registration drives on federal property and on official time .
Moreover , the veterans the VA should support are not subject to any restrictions under the Hatch Actbecause they are not federal employees .
Directive 2008 - 25 further states that the policy changes are designed to avoid disruptions to facility operations .
We would appreciate knowing the type of disruptions the VA envisions might occur during voter registration drives by nonpartisan organizations , such as the League of Women Voters or veteransorganizations , and why any potential disruption could not be addressed by less restrictive means .
We believe that the earlier directive better addressed the need for a consistent voter registration policy for our veterans .
While the changes made in the new directive seem small , the impact is large .
It appears to us that the Department took one step forward for veterans and the right to vote by directing that assistance be provided with voter registration and with securing absentee ballots , but then took a large step back by prohibiting voter registration drives .
We hope to continue to work with your office to ensure that the VA has a strong and consistent policy to support voter registration for our veterans .
Sincerely , U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - The United States has shown that Russia is the true target of its planned missile defense shield by signing a deal with Poland during an international crisis over Georgia , Russia ’s NATO envoy told Reuters on Friday .
U.S. chief negotiator John Rood ( L ) and Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Kremer sign a missile shield preliminary deal at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Warsaw August 14 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kacper Pempel
Poland agreed on Thursday to host elements of a U.S. global anti-missile system after Washington agreed to boost Poland ’s own air defenses .
“ The fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between Russia and the United States over the situation in Georgia shows that , of course , the missile defense system will be deployed not against Iran but against the strategic potential of Russia , ” Dmitry Rogozin said in a telephone interview .
Washington says the missile system is aimed at protecting the United States and its allies from long range missiles that could in the future be fired by Iran or groups such as al - Qaeda .
The Kremlin says that is untrue and has long opposed the shield , though Russian generals boast it could never stop the fire power of Russia ’s giant missile arsenal .
Moscow and Washington have been trading barbs over Georgia , an ally of the United States aspiring to join NATO , after Russian troops routed Georgian forces which had tried to take control of a Georgian separatist region backed by Moscow .
Russian units then went into several towns in Georgia proper , provoking the ire of Washington , with top U.S. officials invoking memories of the Soviet Union ’s occupation of Eastern Europe during the Cold War .
CONFLICT “ PRETEXT FOR AGREEMENT ”
Polish analysts argued that images of the conflict helped push Warsaw to agree to the shield deal after months of talks .
They also said it risked putting more pressure on ties with Russia just months after Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk vowed to improve his country ’s historically strained relations with its big neighbor and former overlord .
“ It can now be expected that this will be the beginning of the end of Polish - Russian talks .
This agreement can be seen as a purely anti-Russian agreement , ” said Kazimierz Kik , a sociology professor at Swietokrzyska Academy .
“ It ’s making Poland part of the U.S. defense system and , in my view , pushes Poland along a well - worn road of mistakes -- looking for allies afar and enemies nearby , ” he added .
Russia says the conflict -- Moscow ’s first major foreign military operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union -- has been misrepresented by the West and that Georgia has been treated as a victim rather than the aggressor .
Rogozin criticized the United States for failing to support Russia in the crisis and said relations could be harmed .
“ I consider that the United States is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation , ” Rogozin said , when asked about U.S. - Russian relations and the situation in Georgia .
“ Instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing , we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats .
That will , of course , not strengthen our relations . ”
Russia ’s top brass said on Friday that the United States was aggravating relations by signing the agreement with Poland .
“ It can only be regretted that in this most difficult situation , the American side is aggravating relations with Russia , ” Colonel - General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , deputy head of Russia ’s General Staff , told a news conference .
Initial jobless claims and inflation surged this morning , coming in worse than estimates .
Initial claims rose to 450,000 , slightly lower than the revised 460,000 last period but higher than the 436,000 consensus estimate .
Headline CPI rose 0.8 % in July , vs. consensus of 0.4 % , but lower than last month 's 1.1 % .
Core CPI rose 0.3 % , above consensus and in line with June 's 0.3 % .
Inflation remains a serious problem .

Technology used by the US military to trace snipers in Iraq and Afghanistan is to be employed by British police to combat gun crime and terrorism .
The ShotSpotter system , already used by police in 29 cities across the US , uses patented technology to detect the exact location of gunfire or explosives within 80ft in less than seven seconds .
It works by using an elaborate network of microphones placed on lamp posts , rooftops , masts and pylons in urban crime hotspots .
Four British forces are interested in using the technology to combat organised crime and gang violence : Greater Manchester , Merseyside , West Midlands and the Metropolitan Police .
It will be trialled in the UK in September and in use six months later .
The sensors , grouped between 15 and 20 per square mile , recognise the sound of gunfire or mortar .
Within five to seven seconds of a shot or explosion , they send signals to each other via GPS ( global positioning system ) , locating the source through " acoustic triangulation " .
Less than a second later , a parallel video system can zoom in on the same spot , potentially identifying any criminals .
Within 15 seconds of the shot , a detailed message is sent to police operators .
A spokesman for Merseyside Police commented : " This technology is a potential asset in the fight against gun crime .
By notifying police as soon as a shot is fired , it could save invaluable time in reaching a crime scene . "
The company behind the technology , ShotSpotter Incorporated , says that as well as expressions of interest from the UK police forces , it has spoken to the British intelligence agencies .
The technology was developed in 1994 to detect sniper fire in war zones .
It is now used in New York , Chicago , Boston , Los Angeles , San Francisco , New Orleans , Philadelphia and Washington , DC .
In Washington it already covers 17 square miles , and by next year will be expanded to cover the whole city .
ShotSpotter came to public attention in 1999 when it helped to catch a sniper who was shooting at drivers on a highway in Columbus , Ohio .
The gunman killed one woman and was later jailed for life .
" American police have mostly used this for area protection and to accompany visiting dignitaries , " said Gregg Rowland , senior vice - president of ShotSpotter Inc .
" Part of its use is as a deterrent – when criminals know they can be heard and found , they are more likely to think twice before using firearms .
Twenty - nine different police forces ... would n't put their faith in technology that did n't work . "
He claims that the technology has brought reductions in gun crime of up to 35 per cent .
Whereas US police officers carry firearms , many British officers do not .
That means that when armed police in Britain are called to a scene where they are not needed , a scarce resource can sometimes be wasted .
" There will be advantages to British police knowing for sure where a gun or explosion has gone off , " said Mr Rowland .
" And the concerns over civil liberties that are associated with CCTV do n't affect ShotSpotter , because it only detects a certain level of noise , not normal conversation . "
A British firm , Gun Shot Locating Ltd , has been founded to promote the technology in the EU .
The company has held four demonstrations to British civil and military police , British intelligence agencies and police from Ireland and Denmark , in the north of England on 8 - 9 July and in the south on 21 - 22 July .
One of the four forces to have expressed an interest , whose identity remains confidential , is believed to have agreed to buy ShotSpotter in September .

Nancy Pelosi is currently serving as the Speaker of the House … despite much of her talk about opposing President Bush ’s agenda and standing behind the Constitution , Mrs. Pelosi ’s record speaks for itself !
She voted for the PATRIOT act , voted for every bill funding a war she supposedly is against , and has also even voted against legislation that would protect the 4th Amendment .
It is also key to mention that Mrs. Pelosi is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations , a global think tank which has publicly stated that it wants to destroy national sovereignty .
Nancy Pelosi was brought into the House in order to push for impeachment as well as an end to the war in Iraq … to date , she has done none of this !
Recently , members of WeAreCHANGE confronted Mrs. Pelosi at the New York Times Center in Manhattan about these facts .

$ 1,000 to Ask Pelosi a Question : She ’s Coming to a Town Near You
Submitted by davidswanson on Tue , 2008-07 - 29 01:00 .
We ’ll gladly pay you $ 1,000 to ask Nancy Pelosi a question .
Pelosi told “ The View ” today that she ’d impeach Bush if anybody knew of a crime he ’d committed , just as she told Ed Schultz a year ago .
Here ’s a list of crimes ( PDF ) drawn up by Conyers 2.5 years ago .
And here ’s a list of crimes ( PDF ) from Kucinich ’s articles of impeachment drawn up by Elizabeth de la Vega .
Could a few thousand people fax these to her please ?
Fax : 202-225-8259 , Phone : 202-225-0100 , Email : [ email protected ] or [ email protected ]
Could someone also deliver them to her at her appearance with Politics and Prose bookstore of Washington , D.C. , on Saturday , August 2 at 3 p.m. at Friendship Heights Village Center , 4433 S. Park Avenue , Chevy Chase , Maryland .
( There is no cost for this event .
Please sign up in advance by calling the Village Center at 301-656-2797 . )
Bush has repeatedly instructed current and former staffers to refuse to comply with subpoenas and contempt citations .
Bush has violated numerous laws and claimed the right to do so in signing statements , as documented by the Government Accountability Office .
To watch a video of Bush admitting to violating FISA ( thereby committing numerous felonies ) go to the White House website here , and watch the December 19 , 2005 , press conference .
You ’ll notice that Bush claims he began these crimes after September 11 , 2001 , which is not true ; he began them earlier .
You ’ll notice that Bush claims to have legal justification for violating the law , but those claims have completely collapsed .
He also claims the spying is limited in ways that it is not .
And when asked why he did n’t try to change the law rather than violating it , he said he just does n’t have to because he ’s the president .
Does Pelosi subscribe to the belief that torture was ever legal ?
Here ’s someone who does not : http://cindyforcongress.org

% 26ldquo; Virtual reality holds the key to the evolution of the human mind % 26rdquo ; - Dr. LawrenceAngelo , a terrible film ( 1992 ) I was born in 1985 , and thus grew up believing that by the mystical and far off Year 2000 I %26 rsquo;d be testing my wits alongside Sherlock Holmes in a holodeck , plugging all sorts of electronic nonsense into my brain , and seeing the world through kickass bionic eyeballs .
It %26rsquo ;s now 2008 , and aside from briefly experimenting with psychedelics , I %26rsquo;ve yet to experience anything compellingly realityish outside of the onein whichI pay parking tickets every month .
Why ?
The term % 26ldquo; virtual reality % 26rdquo ; was coined by dreadlocked theoristJaron Lanier ( left ) in the % 26lsquo;80s , and quickly succumbed to much hype , theorization , and sci - fi speculation .
% 26ldquo;Home Reality Engines % 26rdquo ; were going to revolutionize our daily lives .
We were going to turn into cats and prowl cyberspace , navigate file structures by zipping through miles of glowing electronic cabinets , and make sweet love to all sorts of virtual womens .
It was all very poetic and exciting , and I believed every word of it , even the fictional ones .
In a1988 interviewwith the Whole Earth Review , Lanier explained what it might be like to play an instrument inside of virtual reality : % 26ldquo ; With a saxophone you 'll be able to play cities and dancing lights , and you 'll be able to play the herding of buffalo 's plains made of crystal , and you 'll be able to play your own body and change yourself as you play the saxophone .
You could become a comet in the sky one moment and then gradually unfold into a spider that 's bigger than the planet that looks down at all your friends from high above .
%26rdquo ;
If Lanier 's vision existed , WiiMusic would be toast .
So where did we go wrong ?
What happened to all of the grandiose speculation ?
Sure , I paid too much to be strapped into VR machines in % 26lsquo;90s arcades , and current military simulations are quite advanced , but they % 26rsquo ;re far from the % 26ldquo ; Home Reality Engine , %26rdquo ; and nothing at all like the cyberspace I envisioned as a fanciful child .
I have yet to unfold into a spider bigger than the planet .
As it happens , the fictions that inspired my fascination with VR may not be so farfetched % 26ndash ; and the following developments may eventually make Lanier % 26rsquo ;s crystal plains my new favorite place to pay parking tickets .
David Cronenberg % 26rsquo ;s 1999 filmeXistenZdepicts an all - consuming form of virtual reality % 26ndash ; your typical % 26ldquo ; am I still in the game ? % 26rdquo ; conundrum .
It certainly isn%26rsquo;t the first instance of the concept , but it works well as an example .
Two devices are presented within the film : the first is a morbid biological computer which is inserted into the spinal cord , and the second is a much more sterile device which sits atop the head , wirelessly manipulating thoughts .
Only one is the % 26ldquo ; real % 26rdquo ; game , but I %26rsquo;ll leave the plot of the movie to the movie and try to avoid spoiling it any further ( Netflix it , seriously ) .
Above : eXistenZ 's semi-erotic biological gaming device
These fictional devices allow both for the player to control the game as he controls reality , with what feel like his physical limbs , as well as experience the game as if it were reality , with his own senses .
Two technologies exist today which rudimentarily mimic the control concepts of the two technologies envisioned in eXistenZ .
The first requires physical sensors to be placed within the brain ( similar to the parasitic spinal cord device ) , and the second wirelessly reads brainwaves ( a bit more appetizing ) .
In 2005 , Wired ran a storyabout a paralyzed man named Matthew Nagle , who , with the help of wired brain sensors and a refrigerator sized computer , was able to control a cursor , click on buttons , draw rough circles , and play Pong .
( Right : Matt Nagle playing pong , Nature , 2006 )
The interface , called BrainGate , used 96 electrodes which were implanted into the part of Nagle % 26rsquo ;s brain which appeared to control his dominant hand .
The system worked surprisingly well for the extent of the year - long experiment .
Matt Nagle passed away in 2007 , six years after the stabbing which rendered him a quadriplegic , and is remembered as a brave and selfless contributor to the advancement of the science .
As is made apparent by Matt % 26rsquo ;s story , there are far more important applications of this technology aside from letting me pretend to pilot the Starship Enterprise .
Nevertheless , the potential for videogames and mind control is clear , and gaming applications have already been developed .
Of course , no one is going to stick electrodes in their brains to keep their hands free while they play WoW , so let % 26rsquo ;s look at the other option .
Nagle % 26rsquo ;s experimental procedure tapped into brain signals directly related to movement .
The result was effective , but it seems that similar ( though somewhat less sophisticated ) results can be achieved via non-invasive devices which read brainwaves through electrodes placed around the skull .
Above : OCZ 's " Neural Impulse Activator " Our own David Houghton played witha device created by OCZ , and was able to fairly rapidlyjump into a game of Unreal Tournament 3 .
The result isn %26rsquo;t quite the same as Nagle % 26rsquo ;s in - brain control - the OCZ device maps controls to different thought intensities .
Think really hard to go right , think a bit less hard to go left , and so on .
While it seems counterintuitive , consider how malleable the brain is % 26 ndash ; once you receive feedback from a game that a certain brain pattern creates a certain result , replicating it should become easier and easier .
David commented : %26ldquo; We used the mouse to aim , but everything else , including jumping and firing , was done entirely with our brains .
Put simply , it felt like we were flying .
The more we got a feel for the levels of thought needed , the faster , smoother , and more instinctive things got , until we eventually got back to the point we achieved in Pong , where we were hardly having to think about what we were doing .
We were going Tetsuo on everyone % 26rsquo ;s asses and it felt great .
%26rdquo ; Sounds brilliant to me .
If you %26 rsquo ;re dying to try it out , OCZ % 26rsquo ;s device isavailable now for around $ 160 .
Another company , Emotiv , has designeda similar neuroheadsetwhich also has the capability to record facial expressions ( something Lanier predicted in the % 26lsquo;08s ) .
Emotiv % 26rsquo ;s headset isn %26rsquo;t available yet , but will eventually retail for $ 299 .
They may not provide as precise control as in - brain implants , but there % 26rsquo ;s certainly hope for improvement .
So what about the flip side , computers controlling our sensations ?
To return to our initial example , eXistenZ isn %26rsquo;t just about being able to control a game with one % 26rsquo ;s mind % 26ndash ; it % 26rsquo ;s about the game manipulating all of the senses to completely immerse a player in a reality indistinguishable from any other .
Donning a stereoscopic headset is not the same as having sensation piped directly into the brain .
While we %26rsquo ;re not looking at living in Cronenberg % 26rsquo ;s world any time soon , the potential exists , and is scientifically plausible .
In fact , Sony owns a patent for a noninvasive method of implanting sensations into the brain via ultrasound .
No , really , take a look .
Sony stated a couple years ago that this is a % 26ldquo ; prophetic invention % 26rdquo ; and not something they are currently experimenting with , and some , like Nova Spivack , warn againt over hyping the concept , given that any actual application of it may be 100 years off .

Above : Cyberspace in 1982 , ala TRON
In 1991 Michael Benedikt gathered 50 attendees at the first International Conference on Cyberspace in Austin , Texas .
Cyberspace was not , at the time , synonymous with the internet or the world wide web the way it often is now – in 1992 Bruce Sterling described it as the “ place between phones , ” and “ a vast flowering electronic landscape . ”
Come 2003 and things did n’t quite pan out the way the early poets predicted .
In an interview with GAIN 2.0 , Benedikt lamented : “… cyberspace — that wonderful , phantasmagoric three - dimensional alternative reality imagined by William Gibson — was not actually shaping itself on - line as I and many others thought it surely would .
What Mosaic , then Netscape , then Explorer delivered was mostly the content of your local drugstore newsstand , but worse : delivered more jerkily , more shallowly , and more resolutely two - dimensionally — like paper flyers blown against the back of the computer screen …
To this day , only advanced intranet gamers have a foretaste of Gibsonian cyberspace : a real - time , shared , virtual space seamlessly mixing useful data , personal presence , and real - world , real - time connection . ”
Neal Stephenson did n’t coin the word “ cyberspace ” – William Gibson and Neuromancer are credited with that – but Stephenson ’s novel , Snow Crash , is a stellar example of the “ cyberpunk ” vision .
Snow Crash describes a virtual world that would make Benedikt proud ( if it existed ) , and was a major factor in the popularization of the Sanskrit term “ avatar . ”
Its hero , snarkily named Hiro Protagonist ( now the Gamertag of J Allard ) , navigates a completely physically immersive virtual space ( " The Metaverse ” ) which he can mold to his liking with his decidedly 1337 hacking skills .
The internet today has grown to similar lengths , sans the immersive virtual space .
Whether or not it ’s impressive to the fathers of the cyberspace concept , the internet relays massive amounts of data , and has a very real effect on economics , public opinion , and day - to - day life .
But gee Mr. Writer , what does it all mean for gaming ?
Ugh , Second Life .
I did n’t want to , but I had to bring it up .
It ’s not that it ’s the best MMOG out there , far from it , but its open - endedness , if clunky , makes it a good example of the cyberspace concept and its relation to virtual reality .
Second Life is no Snow Crash Metaverse , but it does apply many similar concepts .
It ’s a shared , malleable experience .
And what is virtual reality , after all , if you ’ve no one to share it with ?
In what “ reality ” are we surrounded by artificial characters ?
MMOGs like Second Life represent a major step toward the realization of the cyberpunk vision .
As for the future , the number of MMOGs which currently exist or are in development is massive , and the genre ’s growth does n’t seem to be slowing .
What began as text based D&D clones has evolved , and continues to evolve at a heavy clip .
Enhance the graphics , physics processing and apply less rigid rule sets and something approaching the poetic visions of cyberspace begins to emerge .
It may not be where the internet in general is heading ( why complicate the ruthless efficiency of HTML ? ) , but it is certainly a more fun and exciting way to interact online , and gamers seem to be the most willing to explore the possibilities laid out by the cyberpunk genre .
On the next page : Augmented reality , and what to expect in the foreseeable future …

Tom Caudell coined the term “ augmented reality ” ( AR ) in 1990 , but the concept of artificially modifying our perceptions of reality is very old .
In a lose sense , any artistic endeavor can be considered an act of augmenting reality , especially those which manipulate perspective , such as trompe l'oeil ( literally , " trick the eye " ) paintings .
( Right : Pere Borrell del Caso , Escaping Criticism , 1874 , National Gallery of Art , Washington D.C. )
In the modern sense , augmented reality refers to the integration of real world and computer generated data .
In this sense , the HUDs fighter pilots are accustomed to are forms of augmented reality .
Simple HUDs are cool , but as a child , I was fairly certain that by now I ’d see things the way robot vision was always portrayed in movies - grainy text would tick along the bottom of my vision , identifying well - muscled men as potential threats , three - dimensional grids would overlay everything for some reason , and the answers to all my homework assignments would materialize in front of me .
Above : I can has neural - net processor ?
In the 1988 Whole Earth Review interview I mentioned earlier , Lanier suggested that after putting on our virtual reality gear , we would be presented with a virtual version of the room we were in .
Our furniture would be replaced with virtual furniture ( so we do n’t bump into it ) , and new virtual elements would be spawned within the room .
Ideally , one day I ’ll put on my sunglasses and see virtual fish floating through downtown San Francisco , an arrow indicating the direction to my current destination , and an avatar representing a distant friend who has decided to chat with me .
A lot has actually happened in the department of augmented reality since I was just a boy dreamer .
The boring utilitarian applications aside ( like dropping that white bar over the first down line in televised football games ) , gaming applications are being experimented with extensively , and will likely be one of the big driving forces for other augmented reality applications ( aside from military research ) .
Essentially , any game that superimposes virtual elements on video in real time can be considered an augmented reality game .
The latest is You ’re in the Movies , which dynamically cuts out the bodies of its players and places them into virtual scenes .
Not exactly Minority Report , but it will do as an example .
Above : OH MY GOD IT'S LIKE SHE'S IN A REAL MOVIE !
The much cooler applications involve headsets which overlay 3D models on real space .
Unfortunately , the headsets are rather large at the moment , and generally have to be connected to bulky wearable computers ( not exactly the magic sunglasses I envisioned ) .
These headsets must be not only capable of calculating spatial geometry well enough to realistically superimpose computer generated 3D objects into real space , they must also track eye movement and have the processing power to render the objects in the first place , all in real time .
Film studios get to spend months working on special effect scenes – these systems have milliseconds .
( Right : A conceptualization of the Tinmith AR system , 2006 ) Clunky or not , the technology already exists .
The barriers now are in regards to size and horsepower .
To create effective consumer AR headsets , everything needs to be smaller .
When we can pack the power of a couple PS3s into a pair of sunglasses , bundled with batteries capable of powering them , we can have all the augmented and virtual reality we want .
Expect Japan to be first on the scene with virtual girlfriends .
Of course , you wo n’t be able to touch that virtual girlfriend – she ’s just a 3D model being projected into your vision .
Star
Trek would n’t have any of that , concocting a device which converts photons into physical matter .
Sorry , it ’s not so plausible .
Certainly there have been creations that sort of look like holodecks , projecting 3D renders onto all six surfaces of a room , as well as holographic displays which no longer require stereoscopic headsets , but nothing that comes close to that whimsical TNG episode in which Picard and company are stuck in 1941 San Francisco .
It ’s about , as I have already suggested , miniaturizing technology and increasing processor power .
Consider all of the elements I have described packaged into one affordable consumer device – a sleek wearable stereoscopic headset which tracks head motion , eye motion , expressions , and neural activity .
Add gloves which track hand motion and a highly open - ended MMOG and …
You ’ve got everything you need to navigate and interact with a virtual world .
The next generation of neuralheadests should be able to take care of basic motion in space ( without having to stand in a hamster ball ) , head and eye tracking will allow you to look around , and motion sensing force feedback gloves will allow you to interact with objects ( guns , swords , BDSM whips ) and menu systems .
Add augmented reality functionality , and you can turn your office building into a war - zone , or your bedroom into a 1950 ’s bar , placing , as Lanier suggested , virtual objects over the real objects in your surroundings .
Above :
The technology is still far too expensive to make Home Reality Engines possible just yet .
Even at the affordable end , the Headplay head mounted display costs about $ 500 , and it 's just a stereoscopic display - no head or eye tracking
It ’s no holodeck , but it ’s perhaps even more advanced that what Lanier described in the ‘ 80s when he coined the term “ virtual reality , ” and all of the required elements already exist in rudimentary forms .
The revolution will occur when VR gadgets are no longer designed as disparate peripherals intended to mesh with standard games , and are integrated into singular “ VR consoles ” for which triple - A game titles are specifically designed .
Sega tried once with Sega VR , and that did n’t quite pan out .
Neither did Nintendo ’s Virtual Boy , but it was designed to exploit the '90s VR hype , not as a serious attempt to build a virtual reality console ( the technology simply was n't available ) .
Above : Fail
The hype surrounding virtual reality may have faded to an extent , but with the popularity of MMOGs and the inevitable cooling - off of the " casual gaming " boom , I expect VR to regain some of its glamourous draw , and not just amongst speculative dreamers - console manufacturers will regain interest as well .
I would be surprised if consumer devices of the grade I have described are n’t available within the next 10 years .
Yeah , I know it has all been said before - predicting the future is hard - but if I 'm right , you can be sure that I 'll be one of the first to assume the body of an electric phantasm and take a swim in the binary oceans of The Metaverse .

OVER the past 14 years , a tiny insect no bigger than a grain of rice has laid waste a swathe of British Columbia 's forests so vast that the rust - red wasteland is visible from space .
The mountain pine beetle has infested and killed over half the lodgepole pine forest in the centre of the province — an area larger than England .
It has rampaged eastwards into northern Alberta for the first time .
( It has also made localised attacks on forests in all 11 western American states . )
Scientists now fear the voracious beetle is about to invade the jack pines of the boreal forest , which could see the plague sweep across northern Canada to the Atlantic coast .
It is an unprecedented infestation that could become a catastrophe .
The pine beetle is a well - known pest , not an exotic import , but no effective means has been found to stop it .
The beetles swarm up trees in large numbers , killing them by boring through the bark , sapping their nutrients and emitting a damaging blue fungus .
Cold winters and forest fires normally keep the beetle populations in check .
Some forest scientists trace the current outbreak to 1994 , when provincial - government foresters , fearing the ire of greens , failed to eradicate a small infestation in a provincial park by cutting and burning .
In any event , recent British Columbian winters have not been cold enough to kill the beetles .
The infestation is gathering pace : foresters fear that by 2013 four - fifths of British Columbia 's central - southern pine forest will be gone .
Wafted eastwards by strong winds , in 2002 the beastie made its debut in northern Alberta and further south in the national parks of Jasper , Banff and Kananaskis on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains .
It has advanced 400 kilometres ( 250 miles ) across the province to Slave Lake .
The beetle is now established in Alberta , despite vigorous cutting and burning .
It is closing in on the vast boreal forest .
It is only 100 km from the nearest outbreak , and winds can carry newly - hatched pine beetles up to 300 km a year , notes Allan Carroll of the Canadian Forest Service .
The boreal forest is mainly composed of jack pines , which lack the natural defences of the lodgepole pine ; this has evolved in coexistence with the beetles .
The hope is that the infestation will stall on Alberta 's eastern border with Saskatchewan , where large stands of jack pine are scarce .
Better still would be a long , bitterly cold winter like those that were common until the 1980s .
“ Climate change is unequivocally affecting the outbreak , ” says Mr Carroll .
They may be big energy consumers , but many western Canadians have also started to worry about what carbon emissions may be doing to their beloved forest .
As a science site , one thing we understand is physics and how it can be exculpatory - no snowflake in an avalance ever has to take the blame .
The American Beverage Association ( ABA ) knows this too .
They are the trade association representing the broad spectrum of companies that manufacture and distribute non-alcoholic beverages in the United States - that means soda and juice but also water and things that are basically good for you .
Dr. Maureen Storey is their senior vice president for science policy and former director of the University of Maryland 's Center for Food , Nutrition , and Agriculture Policy .
The ABA recognizes there is a lot of talk about childhood obesity and the link to sugary drinks .
Since no snowflake in an avalanche takes the blame , that means obesity should be Doritos or it can be bread or it can be bad parents who buy their kids sugary drinks but the one thing that cannot definitively be linked to obesity are sugary drinks or the advertising departments at sugary drink companies .
To prove this , Storey and colleagues did a meta- analysis ( see notes ) of 12 recent studies and published it in the June issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
They make a fine point and one we have made here over and over - the source of the calories is basically irrelevant .
It 's also something of a straw man .
But as earnest as Storey is , you are n't hired as senior vice president for science policy of a group representing soda and juice companies unless you already believed they are not to blame .
The last thing they need is person coming in and writing an article that says 'we are making children fat . '
It makes for great " 60 Minutes " stories and movies starring Russell Crowe but clients tend to be angry .
In the early 1990s sugary drink companies and public schools teamed up to put junk food in cafeterias .
It 's your fault , the American public was told , because schools are under - funded .
We then had to endure stories about how every teacher was sacrificing to buy pencils for students so junk food was necessary .
15 years later and we have a generation of obese children but no one is at fault .
Groups like the American Beverage Association win either way - since all calories are the same ( that 's right , a big salad and a small candy bar are the same in calories so if you forget nutritional value , i.e. , you are an idiot , you are buying that logic ) they can now replace full - calorie drinks with low calorie drinks .
As long as the vending machines stay and they 're stocked with bottles , it 's a marketing victory .
Then they can do advertising campaigns telling kids to go outside and exercise - but take a sports drink so you remain healthy .
The one thing beverage companies will not do is take any blame .
Especially not if they can find someone else to blame .
" My co-authors and I carefully analyzed 12 studies using scientifically validated methods and found that there is virtually no association between sugar - sweetened beverage consumption and weight gain in children and teens , " Storey said .
" In fact , the evidence strongly suggests that reducing or eliminating sugar - sweetened beverages would have almost no impact on children and teens weight .
While other investigators have reached other conclusions , our findings are consistent with three recently published review articles that concluded that the evidence that adolescent consumption of sugar - sweetened beverages leads to weight gain is ' weak or equivocal . ' "
Is there methodical weakness in that statement ?
Of course there is .
I have lived most of my life in the convergence business , solving Maxwell 's Equations , and the one thing you can be sure of is that if you accept a bad model and you run an analysis , it will still converge .
It will even converge to 0.01 % accuracy .
But it wo n't be the right answer .
It 's that Bertrand Russell idea that once a contradiction is allowed into a closed system anything can be proven .
When someone challenged him with " if 2 plus 2 equals 5 , prove that I am the pope . "
Russell responded : " If 2 plus 2 is 5 , then 4 is 5 ; if 4 is 5 , then ( subtracting three from each side ) 1 is 2 ; you and the pope are two , therefore you and the pope are one . "
He should have worked for the American Beverage Association .

Notes on meta analysis :
Meta analysis is a set of statistical techniques for combining information from different studies to derive an overall estimate of a scientific effect .
Some studies will show a greater effect , some will show a lesser effect — perhaps not even statistically significant .
Meta - analysis combines data from different studies just as data can be combined from different individuals within a single study .

There are several existing ways to generate PDF with Ruby ( and Rails ) .
Unsatisfied with existing solutions , Gregory Brown decided to design his own library which uses a DSL approach .
Prawn is also supposed to be faster than other Ruby PDF libraries .
Once installed you 'll be able to generate easily PDF with a DSL - ish approach ( example excerpted from a Prawn sample ) : With this quick sample you 'll end up with PDF output looking like this :
Prawn will definitely be interesting in the Rails / Ruport world , and PDF : : Writer is going to be replaced by Prawn in Edge Ruport very soon .
The Prawn release was the perfect opportunity to catch up with Gregory as he founded a community funded development venture : Ruby Mendicant .
6 months ago , Gregory made a call for participation for an open source project he would be dedicated to for the next 6 months .
After raising more than 10000 $ , Gregory selected Prawn as the project he would concentrate on .
Gregory Brown : Prawn is significantly different than other Ruby PDF solutions , as it is n't a port of a library from another language , nor is it a wrapper on top of a lower level library .
We 're not really extensively researching the other solutions out there , except when we need to consider specific aspects of things , so I doubt we 'll turn up creating a carbon copy of some random PDF library out there .
We hope that this is a good thing , and that it leads to a solution that feels natural in its setting .
Given the available time thanks to the Ruby Mendicant project , I knew I could tackle a hard problem .
The PDF spec is over 1300 pages long , and although only part of that is dedicated to the generation side of things , it 's a daunting task that is unlikely to be easily accomplished in someone 's spare time .
Since I have a serious need for a pleasant PDF library to work with , it gives me a lot of motivation to head down this read .
The catalyst was mainly a post from James Gray , which suggested that we 'd end up spending less effort overall by writing a new library rather than maintaining PDF :: Writer for the long run .
You can check that out here I did n't .
Technically speaking , I 'm still the active maintainer and will apply patches to fix critical bugs and get out maintenance releases until Prawn is widely adopted .
The only decision I 've made at this point is that there will be no PDF :: Writer 1.2 , at least not through my efforts .
Michael Milner and I took over PDF :: Writer from Austin Ziegler a few months ago , but only because no one else would take the job , and there were lots of bug fixes that have been collecting dust for several years that needed to be applied .
We got out a few maintenance releases , and that has made PDF :: Writer better .
But there is a reason PDF :: Writer was n't able to find a maintainer , and that is because the code is largely unmaintainable .
Despite the fact that the library was good for its time , it is not possible to extend or repair without major hurdles .
This is why I believe Prawn will be the way forward , it has a chance to avoid some of the pitfalls that would have been hard to see the first time around while developing PDF :: Writer .
It is much faster for table rendering .
This is mainly because of algorithmic difference , the library itself has not yet been optimized at all for the small things .
However , these algorithmic differences can add up to orders of magnitude speed boosts , which no one can complain about .
;) We have one distributed with the source that compares Prawn and PDF writer for nearly identical output of an 1833 record , 2 column table .
On my machine , this takes about 3.5s to run on Prawn , and about 90 - 100s on PDF :: Writer .
As you increase the data size , the gap widens .
James
Healy had a benchmark doing the same thing for PDF :: Wrapper , a library that wraps Cairo bindings .
Amazingly , Prawn was a hair faster because he was doing his pre-processing in Ruby and the stuff we were doing in Prawn was slightly more efficient .
The libraries are probably comparable in performance now that new features were added , but I did n't ever run these myself .
I also heard reports than Prawn is much faster than FPDF , a port of a PHP library of the same name , but I have n't benchmarked there .
One user mentioned that his invoice generation code that previously took over 3 minutes to run was taking about 37s on Prawn .
I really have n't benchmarked against C libraries or anything of the like .
I think the goal is to make Prawn ' fast for Ruby ' and ' fast enough to be useful ' .
I have the goal in mind of keeping Prawn pure Ruby , and also keeping the code as readable as possible , so I wo n't be sacrificing those in the name of squeezing out every last bit of performance .
However , users can be sure we 'll keep an eye on performance and make it so PDF is not the bottleneck that forces them to code outside of Ruby .
When researching for Prawn , I looked at the two other languages I 'm most comfortable with : Perl and Python .
I have to be honest and say neither language provided solutions I was terribly impressed with .
Although Prawn tries to stay simple and core- functionality centric , I feel like it has a much nicer interface than any library I could find in these other languages .
Of course , I 've been doing much more Ruby than I have been doing Perl or Python lately , so I may have missed something obvious .
If so , I really want to know so I can go steal as many good ideas as possible .
It was basically a whim .
I wrote a post to the O'Reilly blog during a moment of feeling stressed out and annoyed by my contracting work .
It basically suggested I wanted to take some time off from work to hack on open source exclusively .
Some people took me seriously and when enough people voiced their support , I threw up a Pledgie campaign for donations .
A month later , I had 22 weeks of funding , and that 's how the Ruby Mendicant project started .
PDF generation is one of the few ideas I had .
The next most popular among the community was doing a dedicated documentation effort , where I 'd hit a bunch of libraries and spruce up the rdoc and maybe write some tutorials .
PDF turned out to have more popular support , and people liked it because it was a single , unified goal .
Since it 'ssomething I really need , it was relatively easy to stay motivated , so I think it was a good pick .
In the near future , Prawn will be able to do basic inline styling .
We 're also going to add some additional features to our image support that allows you to scale an image to fit in a box while preserving the aspect ratio .
We 've also got big plans for increasing the flexibility of Prawn 's table generation .
Soon , you will be able to create components that consist of elementary drawing operations , images , or whatever you want , and then be able to stick these into table cells just like you would text .
These components will also be able to be rendered directly on the PDF document itself , possibly in multiple places .
If we do it write , this might permit people to write some custom widgets that could be distributed as plugins to the core , which would be pretty neat .
I really want to work with the PDF :: Writer users to get the necessary features into Prawn to allow them to migrate .
The big hurdle here is that we wo n't be attempting any sort of API compatibility , but our features and stability will hopefully be appealing enough to bring people over to us .
From there , my dream is to retire PDF :: Writer and change the Prawn namespace to PDF , yielding PDF :: Document .
Once this is done , I want to bring in closer integration with PDF :: Reader ( currently maintained by James Healy ) .
Though it 's likely these projects will remain separate gems , I 'd like to unify them under a single overarching Ruby PDF project .
From there , we can also bring other PDF related packages into the fold , and then have a truly unified PDF solution for Ruby .
But this all depends on how fast things move , and how open the community is to this idea .
Time will tell .
Why would it be ?
We 're a demanded commodity , and clients need us more than we need them .
Our community is awesome , even under the enormous growing pains Rails has steadily laid onto us .
However , I can't complain about a community that 'll happily shell out some cash to let someone they trust hack on projects for them .
It shows that even with the commercial successes going on , there are still a lot of people left supporting grassroots efforts , and that is very encouraging .
The main trouble I see is that the internet hype machine has created a lot of drama and skewed public perception so that people tend to think Ruby programmers are zealots who only want to program in Ruby and bash everything else .
Speaking generally , this could n't be farther from the true .
Many great Rubyists are actually even more annoyed by this problem than outsiders are , so I feel the pain of others on this one .
;) I will be blogging on O'Reilly News .
O'Reilly is changing the way their blogging network is structured internally , and there are some big changes in the works that have n't quite been discussed publicly as far as I 'm aware .
But I 'll still be on O'Reilly talking about Ruby , only the URL is changing .
The standards for content on O'Reilly News will be a little different but I like the way things are headed over there .
For my informal technical posts , I 'm starting up a blog that is separate from my personal blog to help keep things a bit more focused .
Those interested in that sort of thing can follow me once I 've got the customized blogging software I 'm building
All in all , both places will allow me to dabble into languages and concepts other than Ruby .
I often want to write about various * nix tools I 'm using , and I 've been meaning to dabble into Erlang a bit more , so it 'll let me do some more varied posting , which I think will be more fun .
MINNEAPOLIS ( Reuters ) - Former funnyman Al Franken hopes to convince Minnesotans that he can represent them in the buttoned - down halls of the U.S. Senate .
So for now , jokes are off the record .
Democratic senatorial candidate Al Franken speaks to delegates after receiving the Minnesota Democratic - Farm - Labor ( DFL ) Party endorsement during the 2008 Minnesota State DFL convention in the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester , Minnesota , June 7 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Eric Miller
At a gathering of Democratic activists last week , the author , one - time liberal radio show host and former star of the late - night sketch comedy program “ Saturday Night Live ” swapped quips with supporters -- after ensuring a reporter would not write them down .
Wearing a sober pinstripe suit , Franken vowed to defend the government programs that helped his wife through a hardscrabble childhood and called for universal health care and an end to the Iraq war .
He promised a tough campaign against incumbent Republican Sen. Norm Coleman .
“ Norm Coleman is going to try to run away from his record , ” Franken said .
“ I ’m not going to let him . ”
But observers say it is Franken ’s record that could complicate his prospects in the November election .
Even in a state that once elected former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura as governor , the author of “ Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them : A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right ” must convince voters that he is serious , analysts say .
“ If you ’re the challenger , you only win by putting the incumbent in the spotlight .
Well , for the past two months , Al Franken ’s been in the spotlight , ” Carleton College political science professor Steven Schier said .
Franken secured the Democratic endorsement over the weekend after courting each of the 1,400 delegates that attended the convention .
He had raised $ 9.4 million for his bid by the end of March , more than the $ 8.7 million raised by Coleman .
A Franken win in this battleground state would help Democrats solidify their precarious control of the Senate .
Most polls show Coleman leading , but The Cook Political Report , a Washington newsletter , rates the race a toss - up .
Republicans have mined provocative statements from “ Saturday Night Live ” and Franken ’s books and radio show to paint him as undignified and too edgy for a state that prides itself on civility .
“ There ’s a lot to work with there , ” Minnesota Republican Party spokesman Mark Drake said .
“ Things you ca n’t say in a newspaper , he said them , and he said them about people he ’d have to work with in Washington . ”
‘ WRITING PORN ’
Several Democratic members of the Minnesota congressional delegation have said they are worried that a sexually explicit column Franken penned for Playboy magazine in 2000 could distract from issues like the economy , health care and Iraq .
Coleman has also taken a dig .
“ Eight years ago , I was making the streets of St. Paul safer and he was writing porn , ” the former mayor and prosecutor said at the Republican state convention on May 30 .
Another setback has been the revelation that Franken paid income taxes in the wrong states between 2003 and 2006 .
Franken blamed an accounting error and paid $ 70,000 to 17 states .
Franken has apologized for the Playboy column , but he said he wo n’t explain away his past .
“ If I tried to put things in context or explain things as satire , and explain that satire involves hyperbole and irony and absurdity and parody of style ... that ’s all I ’d do , ” he said in an interview .
He said his books and radio show have given him a solid grounding in policy , and noted that two of his movies that tackled alcoholism are used widely in sobriety clinics .
The real scandal , he said , is Coleman ’s tenure in the Senate .
As head of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , Coleman opted to focus on the United Nations , a favorite target of conservatives , rather than the botched Iraq war , Franken said .
“ He was put on that committee to not do his job , ” he said .
Coleman , who ran for the Senate at the request of President George W. Bush in 2002 , has emphasized his independence as Bush ’s popularity has plunged in recent years .
A Coleman spokesman said he has worked closely with Democrats on the subcommittee to examine Iraq reconstruction and border security , and has voted against his party when he thought it would help Minnesota .
“ Minnesotans do know the difference between a senator who is qualified to do the job , and a satirist who wo n’t even explain what he meant when he attacked people throughout the years , ” Coleman spokesman Luke Friedrich said .
But Franken also will be able to draw on the fervent support of those who see him as a hero .
“ Al was the only one who was standing up for us when Rush Limbaugh was beating us up pretty badly , ” said Roann Carter , a Democratic activist from Minneapolis .

Despite the narrowing gap in cost between green building and traditional " to - code " building , most builders and home buyers still perceive the green option to be significantly more expensive .
The reality is that due to increased builder education and an influx of affordable green building products , a building can be built green within the same budget as a non -green building .
According to Clark Wilson , CEO of Austin based Green Builders , Inc. , " Itâ€™s our job as builders to find those green products that donâ€™t drive up the price of the home . "
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Rick Hunter of the St. Louis green building firm Sage Homebuilders agrees : " With proper planning and a little experience , building green , even certified green , can be done for about the same cost .
We are building certified green homes at the highest levels of certification for less than 1 % cost increase . "
For an informative breakdown on how green buildings cost from 0 to 2 % more than non -green buildings , check out " The True Costs of Building Green " from the folks at Buildings.com .
Now that green building is an affordable option , itâ€™s time to change the way we frame the affordability debate .
Too long have supporters of green building been on the defensive , forced to justify the costs of building more energy efficient , healthier , more sustainable homes .
Instead of focusing on the costs of making your building green , letâ€™s talk about the costs of not building green .
Energy
For those strictly interested in a financial reason to go green , the energy savings of a green building speak for themselves .
With the help of the EPAâ€™s ENERGY STAR program , advances in energy efficiency have resulted in savings of 40 to 60 % over non-green buildings .
Greater focus on appropriately sized HVAC systems , tight construction and ducts , effective insulation , and energy efficient windows can save a significant amount of energy and money .
Add in the water savings from low - flow fixtures , tankless water heaters , very efficient appliances , greywater systems , water - friendly landscaping , and rainwater collection systems and itâ€™s clear how wasteful a non -green building can be .
Save a little bit of money now by ignoring these green options and you could be throwing away money for years .
Health
You wouldnâ€™t buy baby bottles with potentially harmful chemicals or toys with toxic paint , so why would you buy a whole house with both ?
Paints , adhesives , and caulks can all contain volatile organic compounds ( VOCs , ) the greatest causes of indoor air pollution in the home , which have been tied to increased asthma rates .
Wood products in the home can contain urea - formaldehyde , a known carcinogen that is banned in Canada and Europe and soon will be on its way out in California .
The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory studied indoor air pollution in homes and " found moderate to strong increases in respiratory and allergic health effects among children in homes with higher concentrations of selected VOCs . "
Companies that still manufacture products with urea - formaldehyde or other VOCs continue to do so because it costs them less to produce and consumers continue to choose the less expensive , but less healthy , choice .
Iâ€™d like to think this is because of a lack of awareness of the health risks of such chemicals , rather than a conscious choice to expose their families to toxic chemicals .
A green building not only reduces , if not eliminates , such toxic chemicals , it constantly cleans the air through efficient HVAC and ventilation systems .
The potential health risks of non-green buildings are reason enough for many to choose to build green .
Sustainability
Third in the green trinity is sustainability , the environmental cost of your building project .
Green builders start by significantly reducing waste on building sites .
While building materials that are not recycled or made from renewable materials might seem less expensive , the cost to the environment must be considered .
And itâ€™s not just the sustainability of the product that should be considered , but the companyâ€™s manufacturing process as well .
Naysayers point out that individuals can do little to nothing to affect the environment , but if consumers begin to favor environmentally friendly products made from companies that have cleaned up their manufacturing process , including reducing waste and using renewable energy , then other companies will be forced to follow suit .
Companies that have earned the Cradle to Cradle certification represent the height of sustainability .
If products were forced to label their environmental impact and embodied energy , consumers would think twice about many products .
Green builders seek out durable materials that leave a lighter impact on the environment .
Parting Thoughts
The energy , health , and environmental costs make traditional , â€ œto - codeâ€ building much too expensive .
It will also be expensive for the builders themselves .
As Rick Hunter points out , " Most builders have still not fully realized that we are entering a whole new era of building ; the builders that make the changes now will be the ones that prosper , those that take the wait and see approach , will ultimately be hurt . "
The builders I know donâ€™t like to be associated with anything shoddy or cheap , much less unhealthy , so itâ€™s only a matter of time before green building practices are adopted as the norm .
The term " builder quality " is used to describe the cheapest and lowest quality material available while still within code .
Isnâ€™t it time for builders to take back the term " builder quality " and make it something positive ?
Hereâ€™s your new slogan : Green : The New Builder Quality .
Stephen Colbert , Meet the Press
Who can step into Little Russ ' big shoes ?
This week , NBC announced that Tom Brokaw will fill in for former host Tim Russert on the $ 60 - million - a year - franchise " Meet the Press " -- but only temporarily .
" The plan is for me to be in place until they can find somebody who can take it over on a permanent basis , " Brokaw said .
Who could that someone be ?
Like most conservatives , I was a skeptic when NBC News announced a Democrat political operative named Tim Russert was stepping over into the supposedly neutral journalism slot ; like most Americans , I became a big fan .
Which is why I 'm urging NBC to go outside the journalism box a second time for the rare guy who can continue the Russert tradition of fair , penetrating and effective decency : Stephen Colbert , anyone ?
I know , I know .
You 're saying : " He 's a comic actor , not a journalist . "
Tim Russert was a political operative , not a journalist .
But Stephen Colbert , the man who coined the word " truthiness , " can ( like Russert ) pierce through the multiple veils of doublespeak to get politicians on both sides of the aisle to tell us the truth about themselves , whether they want to or not .
For a another thing , Colbert is brilliant , likable , funny and remarkably evenhanded in skewering sacred cows .
His liberal fan base in the mainstream media , who think of him as a doctrinaire liberal , do n't know this .
( An NPR reporter expressed the view recently that most of Colbert 's fans would be surprised to know he 's a Mass - going Catholic who 's married with three kids , including a son named after Pope John Paul II . )
What his liberal fans also do n't realize is that conservatives love him , too .
" The Colbert Report " rules both sides of the aisle , because in a twisted , brilliant technical performance -- I still can't figure out how he pulls it off -- Colbert manages at precisely the same moment he is making fun of conservatism to simultaneously lampoon what liberals imagine conservatives are like .
Colbert is , like Russert , one of those rare figures who swing both ways in a deeply divided and divisive political culture .
And I suspect that 's partly because , like Tim Russert , he 's Catholic .
A new Pew Forum study released this week confirms that on most issues , Catholic opinion most closely mirrors the American public 's at large .
Catholics are also the folks most likely to embody in their own family lives the idea of unity in diversity .
We love folks on the other side of the aisle -- politically and morally -- because we are likely to be married to and / or closely related to such folks .
Maureen Dowd , another cradle Catholic journalist , once wrote : " People often wonder what our Thanksgiving is like .
It 's lovely -- if you enjoy hearing about ... how valiant the president is as he tries to stop America 's slide into paganism . "
None of us Americans are the political caricatures that get hacked to pieces right and left in the daily media .
Colbert is no conservative , but you can tell that he knows and loves people who are .
That Catholics are particularly prone to mirroring mainstream opinions is not something that I think is a particularly good sign for the Catholic faith , by the way ; it 's a symptom of my church 's failure to transmit a Catholic culture and identity under the onslaught of postmodern secularism .
But in the meantime it creates a distinctively Catholic moment in American culture in which Americans who look for some escape from the constant angry crossfire and long for the America of our dreams ( where we really are one nation , really under God , committed to liberty and justice for all ) seek their news from a journalist who is a decent family man of faith , who maybe happens to be a Democrat but does n't hate his dad or his brother who are n't .
Stephen Colbert for " Meet the Press , " anyone ?
( But only if we can keep " The Colbert Report " too . )
Last week , I posted part one and part two of different color combinations for some fall - look inspiration .
In the spirit of all things autumn and eyeshadow palettes , I wanted to share some custom palette ideas for the season -- it 's definitely more challenging ( and pushes me creatively ) when it ...

US Vice President Dick Cheney has threatened Russia after the country was forced to reply Georgia ’s attack on South Ossetia ’s region .
In a phone conversation with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili on Sunday , Cheney said Russia ’s military actions in Georgia ‘ must not go unanswered ’ .
Continuation of Russian attack ‘ would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States , as well as the broader international community , ’ Cheney ’s press secretary , Lee Ann McBride , quoted him as telling Saakashvili .
“ The vice president expressed the United States ’ solidarity with the Georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to Georgia ’s sovereignty and territorial integrity , ” McBride said .
Earlier , Chairman of Russia ’s State Duma Security Committee Vladimir Vasilyev announced that US helped Georgia start military operation in South Ossetia .
“ The further the situation unfolds , the more the world will understand that Georgia would never be able to do all this without America , ” said Vasilyev .
Georgian military forces launched a large - scale military offensive against South Ossetia on Thursday evening hours before the start of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games .
Russia , in response , moved its forces to the region .
The conflict has left at least 2000 people dead .

E - Gold pleads guilty to money laundering
Robert Lemos
SecurityFocus
E - Gold 's days of operating outside U.S. jurisdiction are at an end .
 From our perspective , the possibility of resolving the legal case in a manner that allows for a path forward , that provides an explicit roadmap enabling e-gold to emerge as a regulated financial institution in full compliance with U.S. law is greatly preferred over continued conflict . 
On Monday , the Nevis , West Indies , company , its founder and two senior directors all agreed to plead guilty to various charges related to money laundering and the operation of an unlicensed money transfer business .
The agreement ends a nearly four - year investigation into the company and its digital currency service , which -- because of the anonymity it provided account holders -- became a popular method for cybercriminals to turn ill - gotten proceeds into clean cash .
" The operations of E - Gold Ltd. and the other defendants undermined the laws designed to maintain the integrity of our financial system and created opportunities for criminal activity , " Jeffrey A. Taylor , U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia , said in a statement announcing the agreement .
" Because of the successful prosecution of these defendants , digital currency providers everywhere are now on notice that they must comply with federal banking laws or they will be subject to prosecution . "
Under the terms of the agreement , E - Gold 's founder , Dr. Douglas Jackson of Melbourne , Florida , and two principal directors will plead guilty to charges of operating an unlicensed money transfer business , according to the statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice .
Jackson will also plead guilty to conspiracy to launder money .
Both E - Gold and its corporate affiliate Gold & Silver Reserve , a Delaware corporation , have also agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to launder money .
According to the Justice Department , Jackson faces a sentence of up to 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 750,000 , while the two directors -- Barry Downey , 48 , of Baltimore , and Reid Jackson , 45 , of Melbourne -- could serve up to 5 years in prison and fines up to $ 25,000 each .
In addition , the companies have agreed to forfeit $ 1.75 million in profits and could be fined up to a maximum of $ 3.7 million .
In addition , the companies will begin to comply with all application federal and state laws governing money transfer businesses , hire a consultant to aid in the process of adding additional security to its systems , and contract with an auditor to verify the companies ' claims that transactions are backed by gold , the U.S. Department of Justice said in its statement .
Despite the guilty pleas , the founder has vowed that the service will continue to operate .
In a statement titled A New Beginning and posted the company 's blog , Dr. Jackson promised that the company will redesign its service to be less hospitable to criminals .
" The resolution of the criminal case ... provides for a second chance , an opportunity to address the flaws embedded in the e-gold system and to transform the ' e - gold Operation ' into the institutions ( sic ) I , the other directors , and our long - suffering employees and contractors have always envisioned , one that serves to advance the material welfare of mankind , " Dr Jackson wrote .
In April 2007 , the United States indicted E - Gold and its founders , charging the company with offenses related to money laundering .
Digital cash services , such as E - Gold , have increasingly been used by cybercriminals as a way to launder money and to accept payment for delivering cybercrime services and malicious code .
A number of U.S. agencies cooperated to investigate E - Gold , including the U.S. Secret Service , the Internal Revenue Service 's Criminal Investigation unit and the FBI .

Editor ’s note :
This is a guest post from Leo Babauta of Zen Habits , a father of six children .
Being a father can be a wonderful thing , once you get past all the gross stuff , all the stressful events , the loss of privacy , and the bewildering numbers of ways you can screw it up .
But other than those few things , fatherhood is wonderful .
Every dad has fears that he wo n’t be a great dad , that he ’ll mess up , that he ’ll be a failure .
It comes with the job .
Unfortunately , what does n’t come with the job is a simple set of instructions .
As guys , we often will skip the manual , figuring we can wing it … but when things go wrong , it ’s nice to have that manual to go back to .
Fatherhood needs that manual .
And while , as the father of six children , you might say that I ’m qualified to write such a manual , it ’s not true — I ’m winging it like everyone else .
However , I ’ve been a father for more than 15 years , and with six kids I ’ve learned a lot about what works and what does n’t , what ’s important and what you can safely ignore ( unlike that odd grating sound coming from your engine ) .
What follows are the fatherhood tips I wish they ’d passed out to me upon the delivery of my first child .
It would have helped a ton .
I hope they ’ll help you become an even more awesome dad than you already are — feel free to refer back to them as a cheat sheet , anytime you need some help .
Cherish your time with them .
One thing that will amaze you is how quickly the years will fly .
My oldest daughter is 15 , which means I have three short years with her before she leaves the nest .
That ’s not enough time !
The time you have with them is short and precious — make the most of it .
Spend as much time as you can with them , and make it quality , loving time .
Try to be present as much as possible while you ’re with them too — do n’t let your mind drift away , as they can sense that .
It gets easier .
Others may have different experiences , but I ’ve always found the first couple of months the most difficult , when the baby is brand new and wants to feed at all hours of the night and you often have sleepless nights and walk around all day like zombies .
It gets easier , as they get a regular sleeping pattern .
The first couple of years are also a lot more demanding than later years , and as they hit middle school they become almost functioning , independent adults .
It gets easier , trust me .
Do n’t look at anything as “ mom ” duties — share responsibilities .
While there are a lot of good things from our grandparents ’ day that we should bring back , the traditional dad / mom split of parenting duties is n’t one of them .
Some men still look at certain duties as “ mom ” duties , but do n’t be one of those dads .
Get involved in everything , and share the load with your baby mama .
Changing diapers , giving baths , getting them dressed , even feeding them ( you can give them breast milk in a bottle ) .
Love conquers all .
This one sounds corny , but it should be at the center of your dad operating philosophy : above all , show your children love .
When you ’re upset , instead of yelling , show them love .
When they are upset , show them love .
When they least expect it , show them love .
Everything else is just details .
Kids like making decisions .
While it is easier to be an authoritarian parent , what you ’re teaching your child is to submit to orders no matter what .
Instead , teach your child to make decisions , and he ’ll grow up much more capable — and happier .
Kids like freedom and decisions , just like any other human beings .
Your job is to allow them to make decisions , but within the parameters that you set .
Give them a choice between two healthy breakfasts , for example , rather than allowing them to eat a bowl of sugar if they choose to .
A little patience goes a long way .
As a parent , I know as well as anyone how easy it is to lose your patience and temper .
However , allowing yourself to react in anger or frustration is not the best thing for your child , and you must remember that .
That means you need to take a deep breath , or a walk , when you start to lose your patience .
Practice patience with your child and your relationship , and your child , will benefit over the long run .
Sense of humor required .
There will be times when your child does something that might make you blow your lid — writing in crayon all over the walls is a good one , as is dumping some kind of liquid on your couch , or sneaking out and taking your car to meet up with friends .
While you need to teach your child not to do these things , it ’s better to just laugh at the humor in the situation .
I ’ve learned to do this more often , and it helps me keep my sanity .
Read to them , often .
Whether you ’re a reader or not , reading to your children ( from the time they ’re babies onward ) is crucial .
It gets them in the habit of reading , and prepares them for a lifetime of learning .
It gives you some special time together , and become a tradition your child will cherish .
I read with all my children , from my 2 - year - old and my 15 - year - old , and love every word we read together .
See my list of Best All - Time Children ’s Books .
Do n’t be the absent dad .
The biggest mistake that dads make are not being there for their children .
Always , always set aside time each day and each week for your children .
Do n’t let anything violate this sacred time .
And at those big moments in your child ’s life — a soccer game , a music recital , a science fair — do you very best to be there .
It means the world .
Let them play .
Kids really develop through playing — and while it might seem obvious , you should allow them as much free play as possible .
That ’s aside from TV and video games ( see below ) , aside from reading , aside from anything structured or educational .
Just let them play , and make things up , and have fun .
Spark their imagination .
Free play , mentioned above , is the best way to develop the imagination , but sometimes you can provide a little spark .
Play with your kids , creating forts , dressing up as ninjas , role playing , imagining you ’re explorers or characters in a movie or book … the possibilities are endless , and you ’ll have as much fun as they will .
Limit TV and video games .
I ’m not saying you have to be Amish or anything , but too much of this type of entertainment keeps them from doing more imaginative playing , from reading , from getting outside to exercise .
I recommend an hour a day of “ media time ” , but you can find the amount that works for you and your family .
Learn the “ firm no ” .
While I ’m all for giving kids the freedom to choose , and for free play , and lots of other freedoms , there should be limits .
Parents who do n’t set boundaries are going to have children with behavior problems , who have problems when they grow up .
And if it ’s not good to always say “ yes ” , it ’s also not good for the child to say “ no ” at first … and then cave in when they throw a temper tantrum or beg and plead .
Teach them that your “ no ” is firm , but only say “ no ” when you really feel that it ’s a boundary you need to set .
Model good behavior .
It ’s one thing to tell you child what she should do , but to say one thing and do another just ruins the message .
In fact , the real lesson your child will learn is what you do .
Your child is always watching you , to learn appropriate behavior .
Excessive drinking or smoking or drug use by parents , for example , will become ingrained in the child ’s head .
Bad manners , inconsiderate behavior , sloppy habits , anger and a negative attitude , laziness and greed … all these behaviors will rub off on your child .
Instead , model the behavior you ’d like your child to learn .
Treat their mother with respect , always .
Some fathers can be abusive toward their spouse , and that will lead to a cycle of abuse when the child grows up .
But beyond physical or verbal abuse , there ’s the milder sin against the child ’s mother : disrespectful behavior .
If you treat your child ’s mother with disrespect , your child will not only learn that behavior , but grow up with insecurities and other emotional problems .
Treat your child ’s mother with respect at all times .
Let them be themselves .
Many parents try to mold their child into the person they want their child to be … even if the child ’s personality does n’t fit that mold .
Instead , instill good behaviors and values in your child , but give your child freedom to be himself .
Children , like all humans , have quirks and different personalities .
Let those personalities flourish .
Love your child for who he is , not who you want him to be .
Teach them independence .
From an early age , teach your children to do things for themselves , gradually letting them be more independent as they grow older .
While it may seem difficult and time - consuming to teach your child to do something that you could do much faster yourself , it ’s worth it in the long run , for the child ’s self - confidence and also in terms of how much you have to do .
For example , my kids know how to wash their own dishes , help clean the house , clean their rooms , fold and put away laundry , shower , groom and dress themselves , and much more — saving a lot of time and work for me .
Even my 2 - year - old knows how to pick things up when she ’s told to do so .
Stand together with mom .
It ’s no good to have one parent say one thing , just to have the other contradict that parent .
Instead , you and mom should be working together as a parenting team , and should stand by each other ’s decisions .
That said , it ’s important that you talk out these decisions beforehand , so that you do n’t end up having to support a decision you strongly disagree with .
Similarly , on big Democratic primary nights  which tended to be clustered in the first three months of the year  CNN routinely outdrew Fox News , with MSNBC sometimes coming in second .
Over the last three months , as Senator Barack Obama secured his hold on the Democratic nomination , viewership on all three cable news channels fell , with CNN losing the most viewers ( about 35 percent ) when compared with the first three months of this year , according to Nielsen estimates .
“ I would think Democratic viewers would be more inclined to go to CNN , ” said Carl Forti , executive vice president for issue advocacy for Freedom ’s Watch , a conservative organization .
“ At the same time , there ’s been no Republican primary since Feb. 5 , and there has n’t been a lot going on on the Republican side to drive Republicans to political coverage . ”
But disproportionate interest in the Democratic campaign alone cannot explain the struggles of Fox relative to years past , and the gains of its competitors .
CNN and MSNBC have somehow managed to photocopy several pages from the playbook of Roger Ailes , the founder of Fox News and its chairman , whose emphasis on sharp opinions , glitzy graphics and big personalities has been taken to heart by competitors like CNN ’s Anderson Cooper , Mr. Olbermann and his running mate on MSNBC , Chris Matthews .
“ What Ailes would say is , they ’re following our lead , ” said Bob Kerrey , the president of the New School in Manhattan and a former Democratic senator from Nebraska .
“ There is a certain element of truth to that . ”
But , Mr. Kerrey argued , by making themselves more compelling and entertaining to watch , CNN and MSNBC put themselves in a far better position than Fox News to capture those young voters who were paying attention to a presidential campaign , particularly the race for the Democratic nomination , for the first time .
Meanwhile , Fox ’s hosts have seemed to struggle on camera to find a new voice .
Three times in less than three weeks in late spring , Fox acknowledged making inappropriate references to Mr. Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee .
It said on June 12 that it should not have referred in an on - screen headline to Mr. Obama ’s wife , Michelle , as his “ baby mama . ”
Previously , a Fox anchor , E. D. Hill , apologized for likening a seemingly affectionate fist bump by the Obamas at a rally to “ a terrorist fist jab , ” and a Fox analyst , Liz Trotta , expressed contrition for making a joke about a possible assassination of Mr. Obama .
Which Javascript frameworks are the most common ?
To answer that question , we here at Pingdom have examined a set of almost 200 popular websites to see if they use a Javascript framework , and in that case which framework they have chosen .
The websites were collected from the Alexa US Top 100 and the Webware Top 100 Web Apps .
The frameworks we looked for were Prototype , JQuery , MooTools , Yahoo !
UI Library , Dojo , ExtJS and MochiKit .
We quickly saw that Dojo , ExtJS and MochiKit were not used at all by these sites , which lead us to focus on the other four in this article .
Prototype
Prototype is one of the earlier Javascript frameworks and is also included in the Ruby on Rails framework .
Of the websites in this test , a total of 13 used the Prototype framework .
JQuery
JQuery is a framework that has received a lot of attention due to its speed , size and smart modular approach which has led to a big library of plugins .
Of the websites in this test , 11 used the JQuery framework .
MooTools
Just like other Javascript frameworks , MooTools contains several functions to help development .
One of the more known ones is its advanced effects component .
Of the websites in this test , four used the MooTools frameworks .
Yahoo !
UI Library ( YUI )
Yahoo has developed its own Javascript framework .
They use it for their own websites , but have also made it freely available to others .
Of the websites in this test , seven used the Yahoo ! UI Library .
Websites that could n’t decide
Some of the websites did n’t just use one framework , but several .
This will force all visitors to download more than needed and should be avoided .
The reason for using more than one framework could either be that they want to use the best parts of several frameworks or that they simply started developing using one framework and then later decided to use another one and have n’t been able to migrate all of their code yet .
The ones using more than one framework were Digg ( Prototype and JQuery ) , Bebo ( MooTools and YUI ) and YouSendIt ( Prototype and YUI ) .
Conclusion
Prototype turned out to be the most - used framework in this survey , with JQuery not far behind .
It was also interesting to see that several sites are using the Yahoo !
UI Library .
We had imagined that this number would be lower and that far more websites would be using Prototype and JQuery .
It should be noted that this survey does n’t necessarily give a 100 % complete picture since we only looked at the homepage of the websites .
We also did n’t log in to any websites .
And of course , we did n’t look for every single Javascript framework out there .
How the test was performed
We made a list of websites consisting of the Alexa US Top 100 and also Webware ’s Top 100 Web Apps ( minus actual applications such as Firefox and Skype ) .
Using a special tool we then looked at all the websites after specific keywords to identify the frameworks .
For example , for Prototype we looked for the strings “ prototype.js ” and “ / prototype ” which should cover most variations of including the framework , unless the word “ prototype ” has been completely removed .
We also manually checked all sites that were found to contain references to the frameworks we tested for .
In the case of the Yahoo !
UI we excluded sites that only used its CSS framework and not any Javascript .
MOHAMMAD ALI HOSSEINI : Both the 5+1 incentives package and the Iranian package have valuable elements in common .
If we concentrate on the common ground in the two packages , we can initiate a very serious dialogue .
If diplomacy can deepen and consolidate the commonalities in the packages and create a mechanism toward confidence - building talks , without a doubt , the talks will help peace and stability in the world .
Otherwise the misleading and aimless preconditions are somehow wasting time and cannot lead to settle any problems .
Furthermore , there is not such a thing [ as freeze - for - freeze ] written in the incentives package .
LAT : Would you consider the European " freeze - for - freeze " proposal in which Iran would stop adding new uranium - enrichment centrifuges in exchange for no new sanctions during a period of negotiations ?
Why or why not ?
But usually he was far more expansive , explaining Iran 's positions on a number of topics , including the packages of proposals and counterproposals being bandied about by Iran and world powers to get talks started on Iran 's nuclear program .
Some of his answers were blunt .
Asked why Iran wo n't suspend its controversial uranium - enrichment program for a temporary period to calm world fears and bolster Iran 's diplomatic standing , he replied that Iran has " so far complied completely with its international and legal commitments and that compliance accredits our diplomatic standing . "
Hosseini , 47 , is a physicist by training and a career diplomat .
A native of Tehran , he studied in India before joining Iran ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs 20 years ago .
He ’s a family man , with a wife and three children .
He sat down for an exclusive and wide - ranging interview with the Los Angeles Times about Iran ’s nuclear program , U.S. relations and turmoil in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories , which have became contested terrain in the Cold War between Washington and Tehran .
If there is a war against the Islamic Republic of Iran , it will be out of control and with unpredictable consequences .
Thus , anyone with minimum rationality and political logic does not dare to step on this path .
Public opinion in the world will not permit [ President ]
Bush to exacerbate the pains and tragedies already inflicted on the nations of the region and the American people .
Nowadays , the polling surveys carried out among U.S. elites , thinkers and , by and large , the American people , show they hate violence , further battles and anarchy .
The surveys indicate that the Americans are seeking genuine peace , stability and security .
In a lengthy interview in his office Wednesday , he described Americans as a peace - loving people who " hate violence " and are suffering because of the mistakes of their leaders .
He said he believed economic pressures , the military entanglements in Iraq and Afghanistan , and American public opinion would prevent war from breaking out between Iran and the United States .
" The U.S. and the Zionist regime , thanks to the increasing economic , political , security and military crises in which they are stuck , are not logically in a position to tolerate the expenses of another massive and far - reaching crisis , " Hosseini said .
Known for his good looks , polite manners and kindly attitude toward the media , Iran 's silver - haired foreign ministry spokesman , Mohammed Ali Hosseini has emerged as a frequent public face on his government ’s policies .
But Iranian officials have also been on a diplomatic offensive , reaching out to ordinary people in the Middle East as well as , more modestly , to Americans .
Despite constant talk of war , U.S. officials have tried to reach out to the Iranian people in an attempt to get past the animosity between Washington and Tehran .
LAT : What ’s the rush toward mastering the enrichment of uranium ?
Why is Iran in such a hurry to do this ?
Are n’t most scientific endeavors slow - going processes ?
HOSSEINI : You know that energy is one of the main pillars of the development of any country .
Without utilizing it , there is no chance for development and self - actualization in any aspect of a country .
Most of the sources of energy in the world are fossil fuels , and there is a consensus that the fossil fuels are not renewable and are running out .
So mankind is searching for new sources of energy .
Nuclear energy is cheap and clean and environmental experts admit that this energy is the best available energy in terms of non-pollution .
Many of the Western countries have been using this energy for ages .
In France , for instance , 80 % of the total consumed energy comes from nuclear plants .
The United Kingdom , U.S. and other countries are almost in the same situation .
Those countries must have come to the conclusion many decades ago that nuclear energy is the best alternative .
Now that we have begun the process , you say we have in a rush ?
On the contrary , we have been lagging behind and we have delayed .
Why in 1957 -- 50 years ago , when we had the monarchical dictatorship in Iran –- did the U.S. prescribe nuclear energy for Iran ?
They gave proposals for several nuclear power plants .
The major European countries welcomed the American idea and commenced building a nuclear power plant in Bushehr .
But the same countries , in the post - revolutionary time , did not honor their own undertakings .
They left Iran one after the other while the plant was unfinished .
This caused neck - breaking expenses on the Iranian nation .
Basically , why on earth should we deprive ourselves of this legal right within the nonproliferation treaty , with which we are in compliance with all its relevant agreements , or delay exercising our rights ?
What is the legal or lawful rationality to support the arguments of certain countries ?
Why do some countries illegally enjoy more rights for themselves and exert various pressures against other nations and deprive them from their inalienable rights ?
Peaceful nuclear activities are underway within a 20 - year vision plan .
It ’s natural that all the targets within the 20 - year vision are not achieved overnight .
The wrong approaches of certain powers have tarnished the image of the Iranian nation and caused confusion at the expense of the Iranian nation .
The Iranian nation has fulfilled its contribution to the history of human civilization and will keep on doing so .
Nuclear technology is part and parcel of Iran ’s comprehensive scientific road map .
In recent years .
The Iranian nation has achieved breakthroughs in high technologies , including medical science , genetics , cloning , nanotechnology , aerospace , electronic telecommunications , solar energy , aviation and so forth .
All these achievements are beneficial to the Iranian nation .
LAT : Iran says the U.S. and its allies are behind a campaign of sabotage and terror in Iran .
Can you disclose any evidence that would support that claim ?
HOSSEINI : The evidence is plentiful , and it is enough simply to listen to official American statements in your own media –- overt approval of a budget for interfering in Iran ’s domestic affairs in the U.S. Congress , guiding bomb - planting in Shiraz , supporting the dangerous and terrorist group of Jundollah , who are notorious in thieving and drug trafficking .
Some of its own members are wanted by judicial officials in Iran and Pakistan .
Now look at ABC television , openly interviewing Abdul - Malek Rigi , the ringleader of the Jundollah terrorist group .
And in Iraq , the terrorist group of the hypocrites , [ or munafeqin , what Iranian officials derisively call the Mujahedin Khalq Organization ] , who are on the terrorist lists in Western countries , especially in the U.S. , are active under the protection of U.S. troops in Iraq .
LAT : How does the Iranian government view the recent upsurge of violence in Afghanistan ?
HOSSEINI : The reasons that we are now facing an Afghanistan [ where ] violence is spiking are the fault of occupiers led by the U.S. and U.K .
They should be blamed because of their malpractice .
I can enumerate some factors : First , the occupiers have not paid sufficient attention to the circumstances and convoluted realities of Afghan society .
Second , there is a slow - motion transfer of authority and sovereignty to the Afghan government and the occupiers keep interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan so that the government cannot fully exercise its authority in establishing law and order -- the militaristic approach of the U.S. troops does not allow the Afghan government to do so .
Also , secret talks and contacts between certain Western countries and terrorist gangs and illicit drug traffickers in Afghanistan have impaired the sovereignty of the Afghan central government .
The helm of authority is not fully in the hands of the Afghan government .
For years , we have mentioned and reiterated that terrorism and drug trafficking are two sides of the same coin .
Weakening one side leads to the weakening of the other side .
Strengthening one side implies strengthening the other .
When we are facing an Afghanistan in which illicit drug production is several times more then before the [ U.S. ] invasion , that was six years ago , we can only conclude that terrorist groups are accordingly stronger .
When certain Western countries are negotiating with Afghan extremist groups in some European capitals to convince them of power - sharing in the Afghan government , than we get a result in which extremists are given more room in Afghanistan for further escapades .
LAT : Iraqi officials often say that they wish Iran and the U.S. had better relations .
What steps can the Iraqi government take to improve the climate between Tehran and Washington ?
HOSSEINI : Relations and ties between countries are based on the will and decisions adopted by two countries , and third parties can barely play a role in bilateral relations .
Iran ’s role in supporting [ Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri ]
Maliki ’s government and supporting the democratic state - making process [ in Iraq ] is considerable , and we continue our contribution to enhancing security and stability in Iraq and we are committed to it .
LAT : Iran often says it wants the security situation in Iraq to improve .
What steps has it taken in that direction ?
HOSSEINI : The Islamic Republic of Iran has broad - based contacts with all political and religious groups , both Sunni and Shiite factions and tendencies .
These communications and relations are unbreakable .
They are based on religious , cultural and historic links and common interests and have always been improving and evolving for the better .
You know that Iran has an eye - catching role in supporting the incumbent government in Iraq .
We regard security and stability in Iraq as our security and stability and regional security and stability .
The best and most irrefutable evidence proving that we are helping the security in Iraq is that we have the safest borders with Iraq , according to expert opinion .
LAT : Regarding Lebanon , Iranian Foreign Minister Manoucher Mottaki said Iran played a key role in bringing the two sides together in Doha , Qatar .
Can you detail what happened ?
HOSSEINI : The role of the Islamic Republic of Iran vis-a - vis Lebanese developments is always for rapprochement between the Lebanese groups and encouraging them to achieve consensus and agreement .
In the Doha meetings , the diplomacy of the Islamic Republic of Iran was active in supporting dialogue and persuading all sides to get out of the crisis , insisting on designating a president for Lebanon , and contributing to expediting a mechanism for designating a president .
All sides admit that Iran ’s role in the success of the Doha meeting was notable .
Iran was closely consulting with Qatari officials , whose role in turn was very important .
Qatari officials were good hosts to the Lebanese groups and Iran was in close contact with Qatari officials .
We also talked to Lebanese groups to converge their stances and encourage them to have dialogue .
LAT : Regarding Syria , Israel is trying to entice Damascus to break away from its partnership with Iran .
Is this something that the Iranian government fears ?
HOSSEINI : We welcome any success of Syria in taking back any territory or rights from the usurpers .
Iran -Syria relations are based on indisputable interests between the two nations based on mutual respect and common interests .
In our opinion , no marginal event can affect the strong ties and relations between the two countries .
This subject of the strong ties can be seen clearly in the stances stated by each country .
The attempts of other countries to weaken Iran - Syria relations will be in vain .
LAT : Regarding Hamas , Israel recently began a cessation of hostilities with the group .
Does the Iranian government support this fragile peace ?
HOSSEINI : In our view , lifting the siege of the Gaza Strip is the result of the oppressed Palestinians ’ steadfastness and resistance in order to liberate their lands from the occupier and also the result of the extremely weakened situation of the Zionist regime at the moment .
Anyhow , to any extent that Palestinians can achieve their legitimate rights and reduce their agonies and pains and can enjoy security and welfare like other nations , we do support their legal and lawful demands .
LAT : What are Iran ’s foreign policy strong points ?
What can it do better and should do better ?
HOSSEINI : Our strategic objectives in foreign policy include diversifying our foreign relations geographically ; actively participating in regional and international communities ; making a positive impact on settling disputes and regional tensions ; paving ways for promoting non-oil exports and exporting technical and engineering services and know - how , focusing particularly on Iranian expatriates living abroad and evaluating their potential ; forming inter- parliamentary friendship groups ; streamlining cultural and media cooperation .
In recent years , the facts show that despite certain countries ' attempts to ignore the Islamic Republic of Iran , the role of our country in maintaining security and alleviating crises in the Middle East and Persian Gulf is vital and important .
Given its geostrategic situation , huge untapped economic potential , active , agile and cheerful human resources , cultural and ideological convergence with her neighboring countries and friendly relations with regional countries , the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoys a peerless position in the region which can be in the service of peace , stability and regional and international cooperation .
Fortunately our capacities are good enough in our foreign policy apparatus to pursue the aforementioned targets .
Now we have enough knowledge , experience and capabilities to plan and perform diplomatic dialogue at a very high standard .
LAT : What is the top priority in your daily routine ?
The Middle East , Iraq , the nuclear issue ?
HOSSEINI : Mostly reviewing the incentive package and our proposed package , and nuclear issues are things that we as diplomats are preoccupied with these days .
LAT : What do think about the news of a possible expanded U.S. interests section in Tehran to be active someday ?
HOSSEINI : [ Laughs ]
You are going too fast .
I do not know if it is serious , officially we said if there is such a request , we will review it .
[ SEE UPDATE BELOW ]
LAT : Can you imagine how long the line for visa applicants will be ?
HOSSEINI : [ Laughs ]
Do not be in a rush .
Do not go so fast .

I want to weigh in as a social historian of Iraq on the controversy over whether the “ surge ” “ worked . ”
The NYT notes :
‘ Mr. McCain bristled in an interview with the “ CBS Evening News ” on Tuesday when asked about Mr. Obama ’s contention that while the added troops had helped reduce violence in Iraq , other factors had helped , including the Sunni Awakening movement , in which thousands of Sunnis were enlisted to patrol neighborhoods and fight the insurgency , and the Iraqi government ’s crackdown on Shiite militias .
“ I do n’t know how you respond to something that is such a false depiction of what actually happened , ” Mr. McCain told Katie Couric , noting that the Awakening movement began in Anbar Province when a Sunni sheik teamed up with Sean MacFarland , a colonel who commanded an Army brigade there .
“ Because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others , ” Mr. McCain said .
“ And it began the Anbar Awakening .
I mean , that ’s just a matter of history . ”
The Obama campaign was quick to note that the Anbar Awakening began in the fall of 2006 , several months before President Bush even announced the troop escalation strategy , which became known as the surge .
( No less an authority than Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top commander in Iraq , testified before Congress this spring that the Awakening “ started before the surge , but then was very much enabled by the surge . ” )
And Democrats noted that the sheik who helped form the Awakening , Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al - Rishawi , was assassinated in September 2007 , after the troop escalation began .
The National Security Network , a liberal foreign policy group , called Mr. McCain ’s explanation of the surge ’s history “ completely wrong . ”
But several foreign policy analysts said that if Mr. McCain got the chronology wrong , his broader point — that the troop escalation was crucial for the Awakening movement to succeed and spread — was right .
“ I would say McCain is three - quarters right in this debate , ” said Michael E. O’Hanlon , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . ‘
The problem with this debate is that it has few Iraqis in it .
It is also open to charges of logical fallacy .
The only evidence presented for the thesis that the “ surge ” “ worked ” is that Iraqi deaths from political violence have declined in recent months from all - time highs in the second half of 2006 and the first half of 2007 .
( That apocalyptic violence was set off by the bombing of the Askariya shrine in Samarra in February of 2006 , which helped provoke a Sunni- Shiite civil war . )
What few political achievements are attributed to the troop escalation are too laughable to command real respect .
Proponents are awfully hard to pin down on what the “ surge ” consisted of or when it began .
It seems to me to refer to the troop escalation that began in February , 2007 .
But now the technique of bribing Sunni Arab former insurgents to fight radical Sunni vigilantes is being rolled into the “ surge ” by politicians such as John McCain .
But attempts to pay off the Sunnis to quiet down began months before the troop escalation and had a dramatic effect in al - Anbar Province long before any extra US troops were sent to al - Anbar ( nor were very many extra troops ever sent there ) .
I will disallow it .
The “ surge ” is the troop escalation beginning winter of 2007 .
The bribing of insurgents to come into the cold could have been pursued without a significant troop escalation , and was .
Aside from defining what proponents mean by the “ surge , ” all kinds of things are claimed for it that are not in evidence .
The assertion depends on a possible logical fallacy : post hoc ergo propter hoc .
If event X comes after event Y , it is natural to suspect that Y caused X .
But it would often be a false assumption .
Thus , actress Sharon Stone alleged that the recent earthquake in China was caused by China ’s crackdown on Tibetan protesters .
That is just superstition , and callous superstition at that .
It is a good illustration , however , of the very logical fallacy to which I am referring .
For the first six months of the troop escalation , high rates of violence continued unabated .
That is suspicious .
What exactly were US troops doing differently last September than they were doing in May , such that there was such a big change ?
The answer to that question is simply not clear .
Note that the troop escalation only brought US force strength up to what it had been in late 2005 .
In a country of 27 million , 30,000 extra US troops are highly unlikely to have had a really major impact , when they had not before .
As best I can piece it together , what actually seems to have happened was that the escalation troops began by disarming the Sunni Arabs in Baghdad .
Once these Sunnis were left helpless , the Shiite militias came in at night and ethnically cleansed them .
Shaab district near Adhamiya had been a mixed neighborhood .
It ended up with almost no Sunnis .
Baghdad in the course of 2007 went from 65 % Shiite to at least 75 % Shiite and maybe more .
My thesis would be that the US inadvertently allowed the chasing of hundreds of thousands of Sunni Arabs out of Baghdad ( and many of them had to go all the way to Syria for refuge ) .
Rates of violence declined once the ethnic cleansing was far advanced , just because there were fewer mixed neighborhoods .
Newsrack was among the first to make this argument , though I was tracking the ethnic cleansing at my blog throughout 2007 .
See also Karen DeYoung of the Washington Post on this issue .
This MNF graph courtesy of Think Progress makes the point :
As Think Progress quoted CNN correspondent Michael Ware :
‘ The sectarian cleansing of Baghdad has been — albeit tragic — one of the key elements to the drop in sectarian violence in the capital . [… ]
It ’s a very simple concept : Baghdad has been divided ; segregated into Sunni and Shia enclaves .
The days of mixed neighborhoods are gone . [… ]
If anyone is telling you that the cleansing of Baghdad has not contributed to the fall in violence , then they either simply do not understand Baghdad or they are lying to you . ’
Of course , Gen .
Petraeus took courageous and effective steps to try to stop bombings in markets and so forth .
But I am skeptical that most of these techniques had macro effects .
Big population movements because of militia ethnic cleansing are more likely to account for big changes in social statistics .
The way in which the escalation troops did help establish Awakening Councils is that when they got wise to the Shiite ethnic cleansing program , the US began supporting these Sunni militias , thus forestalling further expulsions .
The Shiitization of Baghdad was thus a significant cause of falling casualty rates .
But it is another war waiting to happen , when the Sunnis come back to find Shiite militiamen in their living rooms .
In al - Anbar Province , among the more violent in Iraq in earlier years , the bribing of former Sunni guerrillas to join US - sponsored Awakening Councils had a big calming effect .
This technique could have been used much earlier than 2006 , indeed , could have been deployed from 2003 , and might have forestalled large numbers of deaths .
Condi Rice forbade US military officers from dealing in this way with the Sunnis for fear of alienating US Shiite allies such as Ahmad Chalabi .
The technique was independent of the troop escalation .
Indeed , it depended on there not being much of a troop escalation in that province .
Had large numbers of US soldiers been committed to simply fight the Sunnis or engage in search and destroy missions , they would have stirred up and reinforced the guerrilla movement .
There were typically only 10,000 US troops in al - Anbar before 2007 as I recollect ( It has a population of a million and a half or so ) .
If the number of US troops went up to 14,000 , that cannot possibly have made the difference .
The Mahdi Army militia of Sayyid Muqtada al - Sadr concluded a cease - fire with US and Iraqi troops in September of 2007 .
Since the US had inadvertently enabled the transformation of Baghdad into a largely Shiite city , a prime aim of the Mahdi Army , they could afford to stand down .
Moreover , they were being beaten militarily by the Badr Corps militia of the pro-Iranian Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and by Iraqi security forces , in Karbala , Diwaniya and elsewhere .
It was prudent for them to stand down .
Their doing so much reduced civilian deaths .
Badr reassertion in Basra was also important , and ultimately received backing this spring from PM Nuri al - Maliki .
There were few coalition troops in Basra , mainly British , and most were moved out to the airport , so the troop escalation was obviously irrelevant to improvements in Basra .
Now PM Gordon Brown seems to be signalling that most British troops will come home in 2009 .
The vast increase in Iraqi oil revenues in recent years , and the cancellation of much foreign debt , has made the central government more powerful vis-a - vis the society .
Al - Maliki can afford to pay , train and equip many more police and soldiers .
An Iraq with an unencumbered $ 75 billion in oil income begins to look more like Kuwait , and to be able to afford to buy off various constituencies .
It is a different game than an Iraq with $ 33 bn. in revenues , much of it pre-committed to debt servicing .
Senator McCain was wrong to say that US or Iraqi casualty rates were unprecedentedly low in May .
Most American commentators are so focused on the relative fall in casualties that they do not stop to consider how high the rates of violence remain .
Kudos to Steve Chapman for telling it like it is .
I ’d suggest some comparisons .
The Sri Lankan civil war between Sinhalese and Tamils has killed an average of 233 persons a month since 1983 and is considered one of the world ’s major ongoing trouble spots .
That is half the average monthly casualties in Iraq recently .
In 2007 , the conflict in Afghanistan killed an average of 550 persons a month .
That is about the rate recently according to official statistics for Iraq .
The death rate in 2006 - 2007 in Somalia was probably about 300 a month , or about half this year ’s average monthsly rate in Iraq .
Does anybody think Afghanistan or Somalia is calm ?
Thirty years of North Ireland troubles left about 3,000 dead , a toll still racked up in Iraq every five months on average .
All the talk of casualty rates , of course , is to some extent beside the point .
The announced purpose of the troop escalation was to create secure conditions in which political compromises could be achieved .
In spring of 2007 , Iraq had a national unity government .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s cabinet had members in it from the Shiite Islamic Virtue Party , the Sadr Movement , the secular Iraqi National list of Iyad Allawi , the Sunni Iraqi Accord Front , the Kurdistan Alliance , and the two Shiite core partners , the Islamic Mission ( Da ’wa ) Party and the Islami Supreme Council of Iraq .
Al - Maliki lost his national unity government in summer , 2007 , just as casualties began to decline .
The Islamic Virtue Party , the Sadrists , and the Iraqi National List are all still in the opposition .
The Islamic Mission Party of al - Maliki has split , and he appears to remain in control of the smaller remnant .
So although the Sunni IAF has agreed to rejoin the government , al - Maliki ’s ability to promote national reconciliation is actually much reduced now from 14 months ago .
There has been very little reconciliation between Sunni and Shiite .
The new de-Baathification law which ostensibly aimed at improving the condition of Sunnis who had worked in the former regime was loudly denounced by the very ex-Baathists who would be affected by it .
In any case , the measure has languished in oblivion and no effort has been made to implement it .
Depending on how it is implemented it could easily lead to large numbers of Sunnis being fired from government ministries , and so might make things worse .
An important step was the holding of new provincial elections .
Since the Sunni Arabs boycotted the last ones in Jan. , 2005 , their provinces have not had representative governments and in some , Shiite and Kurdish officials have wielded power over the majority Sunnis Arabs !
Attempts to hold the provincial elections this fall have so far run aground on the shoals of ethnic conflict .
Thus , the Shiite parties wanted to use ayatollahs ’ pictures in their campaigns , against the wishes of the other parties .
It is n’t clear what parliament will decide about that .
More important is the question of whether provincial elections will be held in the disputed Kirkuk Province , which the Kurds want to annex .
That dispute has caused ( Kurdish ) President Jalal Talabani to veto the enabling legislation for the provincial elections , which may set them back months or indefinitely .
There is also no oil law , essential to allow foreign investment in developing new fields .
So did the “ surge ” “ work ” ?
The troop escalation in and of itself was probably not that consequential .
That the troops were used in new ways by Gen.
Petraeus was more important .
But their main effect was ironic .
They calmed Baghdad down by accidentally turning it into a Shiite city , as Shiite as Isfahan or Tehran , and thus a terrain on which the Sunni Arab guerrilla movement could not hope to fight effectively .
It is Obama who has the better argument in this debate , not Senator McCain , who knows almost nothing about Iraq and Iraqis , and overestimates what can be expected of 30,000 US troops in an enormous , complex country .
But the problem for McCain is that it does not matter very much for policy who is right in this debate .
Security in Iraq is demonstrably improved , for whatever reason , and the Iraqis want the US out .
If things are better , what is the rationale for keeping US troops in Iraq ?
Those Apple " Get a Mac " ads have long been an annoyance to Microsoft and to Bill Gates in particular .
No surprise as Apple , emboldened by rising market share , continues to ratchet up the venom with quips like , " fear of switching is the foundation of customer loyalty for PCs , " found in its latest TV ad .
Now Microsoft is fighting back .
Microsoft 's new $ 300 million campaign ( one of Redmond 's largest ever ) is set to launch with a $ 10 million assist from " key celebrity pitchman " Jerry Seinfeld .
Yes , Bill Gates will appear as well -- the once maligned , rich corporate nerd turned adorable , rich humanitarian nerd .
The campaign is said to be based on the idea of " Windows , Not Walls , " stressing the need to " break down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting . "
Something we think open - sourcers might have a laugh at .
Anywho , the immediate goal of the campaign is to reverse the negative public perception of Vista and thus incorporates elements of the Mojave Experiment .
While we have doubts about the latter , the combination of Seinfeld 's pithy observations with a bit of that Bill Gates , self deprecating humor seen in " Bill 's Last Day " could be a winning combination .
Whether that turns the slow moving boat of public opinion remains to be seen .
P.S. The campaign is said to debut on September 4th .

Thieves lifting manhole covers
Lids attract street crime as prices for scrap metal soar , economy sags
Cities and counties are battling manhole - cover thefts , a crime spree that police tie to the weak economy .
Hundreds of 200 - pound covers have disappeared in three months in California , Michigan , Pennsylvania , Massachusetts and Georgia as scrap metal prices pop up .
" It 's a sign of the times , " says Sgt. Jay Baker of the Cherokee County Sheriff 's Office in Georgia , where 28 manhole covers disappeared in April and May .
" When the economy gets bad , people start stealing iron . "
It 's the first year he has seen such thefts since he started with the department 16 years ago .
The price of heavy melt steel , the medium grade used for manhole covers , has increased from $ 329 per metric ton in January to $ 519 , according to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries in Washington , D.C. A thief can get $ 10 to $ 15 for a manhole cover , says Ryan Alsop , spokesman for the Long Beach Water Department .
Long Beach has lost more than 80 covers this year .
People who have damaged their cars driving over manholes have filed claims with the city , Alsop says .
" Our No. 1 concern " is safety , he says .
" A small kid can fall into these holes , " which can be 20 feet deep .
It costs Long Beach $ 500 to buy and install a manhole cover , Alsop says .
In Georgia , which has lower labor costs , the price tag is $ 200 , Baker says .
Elsewhere :
• In Philadelphia , two children fell into uncovered drains , says Martin McCall , a supervisor at the city 's Water Department .
They were n't badly hurt .
Drain covers vanish daily — more than 600 in the past year , he says .
• In Fall River , Mass. , 12 manhole covers were taken in the past month , police Sgt. Paul Bernier says .
• Dearborn , Mich. , has begun welding manhole covers shut , Democratic state Rep. Andy Meisner says .
• So has Cherokee County , Ga. , Baker says .
A few states are considering legislation .
A Missouri law to tighten record - keeping on scrap-metal sales and the identity of sellers , increase penalties for dealing in stolen metal and prohibit businesses from purchasing recognizable government property took effect last month .
A similar law took effect in Ohio this month .
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama will undergo a routine medical examination at a hospital in the Indian capital on Tuesday , his spokesman Tenzin Taklha told CNN Sunday .

All About Dalai Lama • China • Tibet • Religion
THE powerful , like the victorious , do not just write history .
They grab the seats at the top tables , from the United Nations Security Council to the boards of the big international economic and financial institutions .
They collude behind closed doors .
They decide who can join their cosy clubs and expect the rest of the world to obey the instructions they hand down .
That is how many outsiders , not just in the poor world , will see the summit that takes place from July 7th to 9th of the G8 , the closest the world has to an informal ( ie , self - appointed ) steering group .
Leaders of seven of the world 's richest democracies , plus oil - and gas - fired Russia , gather this year in Toyako , on Hokkaido in northern Japan , to ruminate on climate change , rising food and energy prices , and the best way to combat global scourges from disease to nuclear proliferation .
But in an age when people , money and goods move around as never before , this little group no longer commands the heights of the global economy and the world 's financial system as the core G7 used to do when their small , purposeful gatherings of the democratic world 's consenting capitalists first got going in the 1970s .
Nowadays summits produce mostly lengthy communiqués and photo - opportunities .
And Russia 's slide from democracy into state - directed capitalism has lowered the club 's political tone .
In an effort to show that the G8 is still up with the times , Japan , like Germany last year , has invited along for a brief chat leaders from five “ outreach ” countries : Brazil , China , India , Mexico and South Africa .
Yet this handshake between those who did best out of the 20th century and some potential shapers of the 21st leaves hanging the question of how the old world order should be adapting to the new .
Might the world be better managed by such a G13 ?
Or a G15 or G16 , to include a couple of weighty Islamic states too ?
Or , to preserve the group 's original globe - steering purpose , by a G12 of the world 's biggest economies ?
Meanwhile , the global institutions set up after the second world war are also having to look hard at their own futures .
Unlike the G7/8 , which takes on a bit of everything , these institutions basically divide into two sorts : economic and financial , and political .
At the pinnacle of world political management , but looking increasingly anachronistic , is the UN Security Council .
Of its 15 members , ten rotate at the whim of the various UN regional groupings .
The other five , which wield vetoes and are permanent , are America , Russia , China , Britain and France , roughly speaking the victors of the last long - ago world war .
Alongside them is a secretary - general ( currently Ban Ki-Moon from South Korea ; this job , too , tends to go by regional turn ) , a vast bureaucracy at UN headquarters in New York , and hundreds of specialised agencies and offshoots ( see table ) .
The world had to be saved not just from another war , but from a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s .
That job went to a clutch of institutions : the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , jointly known as the Bretton Woods institutions after the place of their creation ; the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , a rich - country think - tank set up in 1961 ; the much older central bankers '
Bank for International Settlements ; and the World Trade Organisation ( WTO , formerly the GATT ) .
They have been buttressed too by conventions , conferences , courts , declarations , dispute - mechanisms , special mandates and treaties governing everything from human rights to anti-dumping complaints .
The whole elaborate architecture has had extra underpinning from strong regional organisations , such as the European Union , and less elaborate ones like the African Union and the various talking - shops of Latin America , the Arab world and Asia , as well as from steadying alliances , such as NATO .
As a result , there has been no return to the disastrous global conflicts of the first half of the 20th century .
Yet that very success has become one of three powerful pressures to adjust the way the world is run , as new economic winners ( and some new losers ) demand a say .
Pressure also stems from intensifying resentment and frustration .
After ringing declarations on human rights and even the adoption by a UN world summit in 2005 of a “ responsibility to protect ” against genocide and crimes against humanity , the UN Security Council still finds itself unable to agree to do much to protect the people of Darfur , Zimbabwe , Myanmar and others from the murderous contempt of their rulers — just as in the 1990s the UN failed the genocide victims in Rwanda .
If the Security Council , with a charter of high principles at its back , shows such feebleness towards tyrants ( or to those who cavalierly flout nuclear treaties ) , does n't it deserve to be bypassed ?
John McCain , the Republican candidate for president of the United States , supports the creation of a new League of Democracies which , its boosters argue , would have not only the moral legitimacy but also the will to right the world 's wrongs effectively .
The third impetus to rejig the way the world organises itself is a dawning realisation on the part of governments , rich and poor , that the biggest challenges shaping their future — climate change , the flaws and the forces of globalisation , the scramble for resources , state failure , mass terrorism , the spread of weapons of mass destruction — often need global , not just national or regional , solutions .
The shift in 21st - century economic power alone is justification for rebalancing influence in the top clubs .
Much harder to figure out is which bits of the global architecture need mere tweaking , which need retooling or replacing — and who should have the right to decide .
After decades of dividing the world into the rich and powerful West and the developing ( or emerging ) “ rest ” , China 's rapid growth and the economic dynamism of East Asia had led to talk of a new “ Pacific ” century well before the old “ Atlantic ” one had ended .
On present trends , somewhere between 2025 and 2030 three of the world 's four largest economies will be from Asia .
China will just pip America to top the global league , with India and Japan , both determined but so far unsuccessful campaigners for permanent seats on the UN Security Council , following on ( though Chinese and Indians will still be , on average , much poorer than Americans or Japanese ) .
Not unipolar but what ?
Yet talk of an Asian century sounds quaint .
Despite America 's brief “ unipolar moment ” as its rival pole , the Soviet Union , collapsed , Russia has recovered to join a rising China , America , Europe and Japan in a new constellation of big powers that is based on far more than the old boot - and - rocket counts of the cold war .
Bring India into the snapshot , and you capture 54 % of the world 's population and 70 % of GDP .
Whether the leaders of this multipolar world will rub along or bash elbows remains to be seen .
Globalisation 's increasingly unfettered flow of information , technology , capital , goods , services and people has helped spread opportunity and influence far and wide .
To re-emergent China and Russia , add not just India but Brazil ( these four bracketed by Goldman Sachs in 2001 as the upcoming BRICs ) , Mexico , South Africa , Saudi Arabia , South Korea and Australia , to name just some of the new winners as money changes pockets and the world turns faster .
A modern map of power and influence should also include transformational tools such as the internet ; manipulators from lobbying NGOs to terrorist groups ; profit - takers such as global corporations and sovereign wealth funds ; and unpredictable forces such as global financial flows .
The principal characteristic of this world , argues Richard Haass of the Council on Foreign Relations in a recent Foreign Affairs article , is not multipolarity but “ nonpolarity ” .
Dozens of actors , exercising different kinds of power , vastly complicate the effort to find a better balance of influence and responsibility .
But the excuse of complexity is no answer to the demand for equity .
Some clubs have proved more responsive than others .
China got a new economic start simply by ditching Marx , Lenin and Mao .
But its reformers were able to tap the liberal rules - based system codified in the rules of the IMF and the World Bank ( and later the WTO ) for ideas as well as cash .
China rejoined the bank in 1980 ( the Nationalist government on Taiwan had been a founder member ) just as its reforms got under way .
Ironically , Communist - run China has since been one of the system 's biggest beneficiaries .
But it is by no means the only one .
Despite the latest stockmarket dips and credit squeezes , world income per head has increased by more over the past five years than during any other similar period on record .
The IMF and the World Bank , pragmatic institutions from the outset , have adapted already , in fits and starts .
In April the IMF reformed the peculiar formula by which it allocates votes and financial contributions according to economic size , reserves and other measures ( see chart ) .
China 's share of votes will increase to 3.81 % , still far short of its weight in the world economy .
Meanwhile , old power patterns still determine who holds the two top jobs : the bank is run by an American , the fund by a European .
But a bigger problem for both organisations is relevance .
Until the late 1990s the IMF , monitor of exchange rates and lender of last resort to struggling governments , had plenty of work .
But emerging economies , once its chief clients and source of earnings in repaid interest and loans , are these days often awash with their own cash .
Earlier this year the IMF board voted to cut staff and sell off about an eighth of its gold reserves ( some 400 tonnes ) to meet expected future funding shortfalls .
With no obvious role in coping with the aftermath of the recent banking and stockmarket turbulence , its future role may be more as an expert economic adviser .
Some worry that the world may still need a lender of last resort .
Critics think the fund 's days should be numbered and its reserves put to better use for development .
Still others muse that what is needed is a World Investment Organisation , to set basic rules and better track the huge and complex flows of cash that now wash around in hedge funds , sovereign wealth funds , banks and financial markets .
The World Bank has a more certain future , but still needs to retool .
Competition has stiffened from private capital markets .
Many governments that once needed the bank 's help for dams , roads and other big projects are earning plenty from the sale of raw materials .
Even in Africa , the readiness of China and India to spend liberally without strings in pursuit of oil and minerals means that the Sudans and the Congos can take the bank 's cash and ignore the conditions attached .
Yet the bank still has a role lending to unfashionable causes , or countries which donors neglect .
It could also provide global public goods : funding energy - infrastructure and climate - change projects are two examples , agriculture another .
A bit too equal
While the bank and the fund are steered by their biggest shareholders , the WTO , though relying on a representative caucus of states to hammer out deals , belongs to all its members : India and Brazil , for example , are at the heart of the Doha round of trade talks .
But egalitarianism can be a weakness as well as a strength .
Much admired , at least by government lawyers , are the 60,000 pages of jurisprudence that govern the workings of the WTO dispute mechanism , which has helped resolve many a trade spat .
The WTO ensures that members do not discriminate among each other — the best deal they offer to anyone must be extended to everyone .
This has helped level the playing field and expand world trade .
Russia 's is the only large economy still outside the WTO , and that is its choice .
Yet those wanting to join must strike deals with each of the existing members — now a daunting 152 .
Operating by consensus means that the Doha “ development ” round has bogged down in disputes between developed and developing countries over complex , reciprocal cuts in farm subsidies and tariff barriers .
The prospects for moving on to services look dim .
Slow progress has helped push many to forge bilateral or regional deals instead .
And if the Doha round fails completely , the recriminations could run far and wide — threatening any attempt , for example , to get agreement between the developed and developing world on new mechanisms to deal with climate change .
Economic and financial power is to some extent up for bids by governments with a stake in the game , and trade rules are ( arduously ) negotiable .
Yet the distribution of political power has proved stubbornly — debilitatingly — resistant to change .
Most bitterly contested is membership of the UN Security Council , which has the right ( whether exclusively or not is hotly debated ) to decide what constitutes a threat to world peace and security , and what to do about it .
In the UN's other big decision - making institution , the General Assembly , all the world can have its say , and does .
But here outsiders take their revenge : a caucus of mostly developing countries called the G77 ( but these days comprising 130 members including China ) tends to dominate and filibuster .
Might it assuage resentment and improve the council 's authority and the UN 's effectiveness if America , Britain , France Russia and China invited other permanent members to join them — and considered giving up their veto ?
When the P5 , as they are called , first grabbed the most powerful slots , the UN had 51 members ; decades of decolonisation and splintering self - determination later , it has 192 .
The obstacles to reform grow no smaller either .
Most recently a concerted effort by Brazil , Germany , India and Japan ( a self - styled G4 ) to join the council 's permanent movers and shakers was thwarted by a combination of foot - dragging , jealousy and stiff - arming .
African countries failed to agree on which of their several aspirants should join the bid .
Regional rivals — Argentina and Mexico , Italy , Indonesia , Pakistan and others — lobbied to block the front - runners .
China made it clear it would veto Japan ; America , in supporting only Japan , helped destroy its friend 's chances .
New permanent members would broaden the regional balance .
That could add authority and legitimacy to council decisions .
Bringing in not only nuclear - armed India , but soft - powered Japan and the rest , would undercut the notion , perpetuated by the P5 , that to be a winner you need first to crash the nuclear club .
But might the price of a larger , permanently more diverse council be more potential spanner - tossers and thus greater deadlock ?
The hope would be that once difficult outsiders got their feet permanently under the table , sharing the responsibility for managing the world would stop them protecting bad elements , as South Africa ( currently a rotating member ) has been doing with Zimbabwe , in part to defy the permanent five .
Prising the P5 from their vetoes might , however , have adverse effects .
It was dependable veto power , ensuring their vital interests were never overridden , that kept America and Russia talking at the UN — and Nikita Khrushchev shoe - banging — through the darkest episodes of the cold war .
Russia will not forget the mistake of the brief Soviet boycott of the council that led to force being authorised to repel North Korea at the start of the Korean war in 1950 .
China shows no sign of veto self - effacement , either .
But staying at the table does not guarantee agreement .
The UN is deliberately an organisation of states , and states differ for reasons good and bad .
George Bush went to war in Iraq without explicit backing from the Security Council ( just as NATO went to war to end ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , despite Russia 's certain veto had the issue come to a council vote ) .
But the council 's divisions on the most contentious issues have not prevented responsible stewardship elsewhere .
A Security Council summit in 1992 agreed that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was a “ threat to peace and security ” to be dealt with forcibly if need be .
After the attacks of September 11th 2001 , new resolutions were passed to curb terrorists ' finance and keep nuclear , chemical and biological weapons out of their hands .
There has been a huge increase over the past 15 years in the numbers of blue helmets , with 100,000 soldiers and police currently deployed .
This is credited with helping to reduce the number of conflicts between states , as well as calming civil wars from Bosnia to Haiti , from Cambodia to Sudan , from Congo to Lebanon .
Acceptance , at least politically , of a “ responsibility to protect ” takes the council towards territory which , earlier this decade , it would not have approached : an International Criminal Court , for example , separate from the UN but able to take its referrals , and ready to prosecute the worst crimes .
Yet divisions among the P5 have often slowed deployment of peacekeepers where they are most needed , such as in Sudan 's war - torn province of Darfur .
Pessimists doubt that China and Russia , both arch - defenders of the Westphalian principle that state sovereignty trumps all , will ever seriously contemplate authorising forceful intervention even to end a genocide .
A new UN Human Rights Council has yet to prove it is any better than its discredited predecessor at bringing brutal governments to book .
Meanwhile it took years , and North Korea 's 2006 bomb test , for China to condemn Kim Jong Il 's nuclear cheating and let the Security Council pass judgment on it .
The P5 plus Germany have worked together over the past three years , slapping a series of UN resolutions and sanctions on the regime in Iran for defiance over its suspect nuclear work , yet Russia and China have doggedly watered down each text , line by line .
Doing it for themselves
There is much the UN Security Council will never be able to do , no matter who occupies its plushest seats .
And there are lots of other ways to get useful things done these days .
The internet helps campaigners on human rights , as on other issues , to get their message round the world rather effectively .
Stung by constant exposure and criticism of its policy in Sudan and Darfur , China appointed a special envoy ( who soon found he had a lot of explaining to do ) and shifted ground on the need for a UN force , even though deployment is agonisingly slow .
In some cases , regional organisations are better equipped to take the strain .
Enlargement of the EU and NATO has helped stabilise Europe 's borderlands , with mostly European troops and police these days in the Balkans .
Russia may protest , but its western frontier has never been more peaceful .
On a similar principle of African solutions to African problems , the African Union has provided troops in Sudan and elsewhere .
But devolving security jobs to the neighbours can be a disaster : the AU delegated the problem of what to do about Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe to a southern African grouping , SADC , which left it to South Africa 's Thabo Mbeki , who did nothing .
The hard - pressed people of Zimbabwe are still waiting for relief .
East Asia , the other big potential battlefront in the cold war , used to look very different from Europe , which has long had more than its share of shock - absorbing regional clubs and institutions .
Now , alongside the Association of South - East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , a still limited talking - shop , other regional conversations are starting up .
The ASEAN Regional Forum draws in not only China , Japan and Korea , but Americans , Russians and Europeans ; ASEAN - plus - three summits are clubbier , involving only regional rivals China , Japan and Korea .
A new East Asian Summit excludes America but brings in India and Australia , among others ; Americans naturally prefer to boost the Asia - Pacific Economic Co-operation forum ( APEC ) .
Meanwhile Russia , China and their Central Asian neighbours have founded the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation , in part to counter Western influence in the region as NATO battles on in Afghanistan , but in part so that Russia and China can keep an eye on each other .
Annual joint military exercises are a new feature .
Problem - solving groups come in all shapes and sizes , from quartets ( for promoting Middle East peace or trying to settle the future of Kosovo ) to entire posses .
Some 80 countries in the Proliferation Security Initiative ( an “ activity not an organisation ” ) exchange information and train together to sharpen skills for blocking illicit shipments of nuclear or other weapons materials .
Like the P5 plus 1 talks on Iran ( sometimes called the E3 plus 3 by Europeans ) , there are six - party talks hosted by China on North Korea ( and including America , South Korea , Japan and Russia ) , which could yet evolve into a formal north - east Asian security dialogue .
More countries are taking the initiative .
China , Japan and South Korea , East Asia 's rival powers , will meet this year for a first 3 - minus - ASEAN summit .
China , India and Russia meet from time to time to re-swear allegiance to multipolarity .
They may have little more in common than an ambition to put Europe and America in the shade , but earlier this year the foreign ministers of the four BRIC countries got together for the first time ; their economic and finance ministers will soon meet too .
And with a wary eye to China 's growing economic and military weight , America , Australia and Japan have formed something of a security threesome , though Japan 's plan to include India too was deemed a bit provocative .
Quirky but familiar globe - spanning organisations include the Commonwealth , which knits together Britain 's former colonies plus other volunteers and does good works in all sorts of out - of - the - way places , and the Non-Aligned Movement , a cold - war hold - over with 116 members and communiqués that leave no prejudice unrecorded .
But what of Mr McCain 's endorsement of a League of Democracies ?
The notion is n't new .
An American sponsored Community of Democracies got going with fanfare in 2000 .
There is nothing wrong with mobilising freedom - loving governments to speak up for democracy .
But there are difficulties .
Last time , America found it hard to say no to friends , and not all its friends are democrats .
The new League ( or Concert ) of Democracies would have clearer rules for ins and outs .
Supporters see it as potentially an alternative source of legitimacy , should the Security Council be hopelessly divided : a two - thirds majority of the roughly 60 countries that might qualify could even authorise the use of force to deal with threats to peace or to uphold the principle of a “ responsibility to protect ” .
But would a group of countries that spans all continents from Botswana to Chile , and Israel to the Philippines , ever manage to agree on much ?
A supposed democracy caucus at the UN has achieved little .
Dividing the world ideologically again seems a step backwards to some .
Nor could such a club solve pressing global problems .
Coping with climate change needs China as well as India ; energy security needs Saudi Arabia and Russia , as well as oil - dependent Japan or the Europeans .
The good news , given the rise of lots of new powers and players , is that this is not the 19th century .
Then governments had few means other than gunboats to settle their differences .
There are plenty of guns about these days , but also many other ways to settle the world 's disputes .
Monsters are everywhere these days , and belief in them is as strong as ever .
What 's harder to believe is why so many people buy into hazy evidence , shady schemes and downright false reports that perpetuate myths that often have just one ultimate truth :
They put money in the pockets of their purveyors .
The bottom line , according to several interviews with people who study these things :
People want to believe , and most simply can't help it .
" Many people quite simply just want to believe , " said Brian Cronk , a professor of psychology at Missouri Western State University .
" The human brain is always trying to determine why things happen , and when the reason is not clear , we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations . "
A related question : Does belief in the paranormal have anything to do with religious belief ?
The answer to that question is decidedly nuanced , but studies point to an interesting conclusion :
People who practice religion are typically encouraged not to believe in the paranormal , but rather to put their faith in one deity , whereas those who are n't particularly active in religion are more free to believe in Bigfoot or consult a psychic .
" Christians and New Agers , paranormalists , etc. all have one thing in common : a spiritual orientation to the world , " said sociology Professor Carson Mencken of Baylor University .
Tall tales
A tale last week by three men who said they have remains of Bigfoot in a freezer was reported by many Web sites as anywhere from final proof of the creature to at least a very compelling case to keep the fantasy ball rolling and cash registers ringing for Bigfoot trinkets and tourism ( all three men involved make money off the belief in this creature ) .
Even mainstream media treated a Friday press conference about the " finding " as news .
Reactions by the public ranged from skeptical curiosity to blind faith .
" I believe they do exist but I 'm not sure about this , " said one reader reacting to a story on LiveScience that cast doubt the claim .
" I guess we will find out … if this is on the up and up , " wrote another .
" However , that said , I know they exist . "
A subsequent test on the supposed Bigfoot found nothing but the DNA of humans and an opossum , a small , cat - like creature .
Also last week , in Texas there was yet another sensational yet debunkable sighting of chupacabra , a beast of Latin - American folklore .
The name means " goat sucker . "
In this case , law enforcement bought into the hooey with an apparent wink and nod .
Ellie Carter , a patrol trainee with the DeWitt County sheriff ’s office , saw the beast and was , of course , widely quoted .
" It was this — thing , looking right at us , " she said .
" I think that ’s a chupacabra ! "
After watching a video of the beast taken by a sheriff 's deputy , biologist Scott Henke of Texas A&M University said , " It 's a dog for sure , " according to a story on Scientific American 's Web site .
Meanwhile , the sheriff did nothing to tamp down rampant speculation , expressing delight that he might have a monster on his hands .
" I love this for DeWitt County , " said Sheriff Jode Zavesky , who would presumably be just as thrilled to let Dracula or a werewolf run free .
With that kind of endorsement and the human propensity to believe in just about anything , it 's clear that Bigfoot and chupacabra are just two members in a cast of mythical characters and dubious legends and ideas will likely never go away .
In a 2006 study , researchers found a surprising number of college students believe in psychics , witches , telepathy , channeling and a host of other questionable ideas .
A full 40 percent said they believe houses can be haunted .
Why are people so eager to accept flimsy and fabricated evidence in support of unlikely and even outlandish creatures and ideas ?
Why is the paranormal realm , from psychic predictions to UFO sightings , so alluring to so many ?
The gods must be crazy
Since people have been people , experts figure , they have believed in the supernatural , from gods to ghosts and now every sort of monster in between .
" While it is difficult to know for certain , the tendency to believe in the paranormal appears to be there from the beginning , " explained Christopher Bader , a Baylor sociologist and colleague of Mencken .
" What changes is the content of the paranormal .
For example , very few people believe in faeries and elves these days .
But as belief in faeries faded , other beliefs , such as belief in UFOs , emerged to take their place . "
Figuring out why people are this way is a little trickier .
" It is an artifact of our brain 's desire to find cause and effect , " Cronk , the psychology professor , said in an email interview .
" That ability to predict the future is what makes humans ' smart ' but it also has side effects like superstitions [ and ] belief in the paranormal . "
" Humans first started believing in the supernatural because they were trying to understand things they could n't explain , " says Benjamin Radford , a book author , paranormal investigator and managing editor of Skeptical Inquirer magazine .
" It 's basically the same process as mythology :
At one point people did n't understand why the sun rose and set each day , so they suggested that a chariot pulled the sun across the heavens . "
Before modern scientific explanations of germ theory , explained Radford , who writes the " Bad Science " column for LiveScience , people did n't understand how diseases could travel from one person to another .
" They did n't understand why a child was stillborn , or why a drought occurred , so they came to believe that such events had supernatural causes , " he said .
" All societies have invoked the supernatural to explain things beyond their control and understanding , especially good and bad events , " Radford said .
" In many places — even today — people believe that disasters or bad luck is caused by witches or curses . "
Which raises the bigger question :
With science having answered so many questions in the past couple centuries , why do paranormal beliefs remain so strong ?
Related to religion ?
Sometimes the belief in curses crosses paths with religion , as was the case in 2005 when televangelist John Hagee ( whose endorsement was solicited and received by presidential hopeful John McCain ) blamed Hurricane Katrina on God 's wrath for a gay parade that had been scheduled for the Monday of the storm 's arrival .
" I believe that New Orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to God , and they are — were recipients of the judgment of God for that , " Hagee said at the time , reiterating the belief in 2006 .
That might lead one to assume religion and paranormal beliefs are intertwined .
But in a 2004 survey , at the researchers at Baylor found just the opposite .
" Paranormal beliefs are very strongly negatively related to religious belief , " study team member Rod Stark said this week .
Another study , of 391 U.S. college students done in 2000 , found that participants who did not believe in Protestant doctrine were most likely to believe in reincarnation , contact with the dead , UFOs , telepathy , prophecy , psychokinesis , or healing .
Believers were the least likely to buy into the paranormal .
" This may partly reflect opinions of Christians in the samples who take biblical sanctions against many ' paranormal ' activities seriously , " the Wheaton College researchers wrote .
Cronk , the psychologist , did a small survey of 80 college students and found no connection between religiosity and paranormal belief .
But a 2002 study in Canada did find a correlation between religious beliefs and paranormal beliefs , Cronk notes .
He figures that among other explanations , Canadians may not have the same belief systems as U.S. residents .
" My guess is that religiosity has a lot to do with how you were raised , and less to do with genetics , " Cronk said .
" Those people who may have a high genetic susceptibility to ' faith - based knowledge ' may end up being highly religious or may end up having belief in the paranormal depending on how they were raised .
Those people less susceptible to that method of forming beliefs may still end up being highly religious if they were raised in a religious family . "
Religion vs. paranormal
Mencken , the Baylor sociologist , says sacrifice and stigma ( for holding ideas outside the group norm ) keep the paranormal at bay among the highly religious .
He has two papers forthcoming that are based on a national survey of 1,700 people .
The first , to be published in the journal Sociology of Religion in 2009 , reveals this :
" Among Christians , those who attend church very often ( and are exposed to stigma and sacrifice within their congregations ) are least likely to believe in the paranormal , " Mencken told LiveScience .
" Conversely , those Christians who do not attend church very often ( maybe once or twice a year ) are the most likely to hold paranormal beliefs . "
A third group , which he calls naturalists , do not hold supernatural views , Christian or paranormal .
Another study to published in December in the Review of Religious Research , shows that those who go to church " are much less likely to consult horoscopes , visit psychics , purchase New Age items , " and so on , Mencken said .
" However , among those Christians who do not attend church , there is a much higher level of participation in these phenomena . "
Educated to believe
Profiling the typical Bigfoot believer turns out to be as challenging as determining the scientific methodology of a psychic , however .
" Perhaps amazingly , [ paranormal beliefs ] are not related at all to education , " Stark said .
" Ph.D.s are as likely as high school dropouts to believe in Bigfoot , Loch Ness Monster , ghosts , etc . "
The 2006 study of college students , done by Bryan Farha at Oklahoma City University and Gary Steward Jr. of the University of Central Oklahoma , reached a similar conclusion .
Belief in the paranormal — from astrology to communicating with the dead — increases during college , rising from 23 percent among freshmen to 31 percent in seniors and 34 percent among graduate students .
Bader , the sociologist at Baylor , and his colleagues teamed up with the Gallup organization to conduct a national survey of 1,721 people in 2005 and found nearly 30 percent think it is possible to influence the physical world through the mind alone ( another 30 percent were undecided on that point ) .
More than 20 percent figure it 's possible to communicate with the dead .
Nearly 40 percent believe in haunted houses .
Asked if " creatures such as Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster will one day be discovered by science , " 18.8 percent agreed while 25.9 percent were undecided .
In a remote Himalayan village , on the other hand , belief in Bigfoot 's cousin , the yeti , is seen by some as a sign of ignorance .
Media madness
Today 's ubiquitous and often one - sided , promotional coverage of the paranormal , both on the Internet and TV , perpetuate myths and folklore as well or better than any ancient storyteller .
Fiction and belief masquerade as fact and news , feeding the 24/7 appetite of the easily swayed .
Scientists are left with an impossible task : proving something does not exist .
You can prove a rock is there .
You can't prove that Bigfoot or a ghost or the god of thunder is not there .
Bigfoot paraphernalia purveyors and cash - cow psychics know this well .
" Many paranormalists claim that their powers only work sometimes , or that they do n't work if there is a ' non - believer ' in the room , " Cronk points out .
Or , in the case of the unsupportive DNA testing on Bigfoot last week , the top proponent , Tom Biscardi ( who recently produced a film about Bigfoot and might be said to have an interest in garnering press coverage ) , simply dodged the mythbusting bullet by claiming the DNA samples might have been contaminated .
Money motivates even the law to look the other way .
Regarding the chupacabra " sighting " last week in Cuero , Texas : " It 's amazing , " said Zavesky , DeWitt County sheriff .
" We still do n't know what it is . "
Of course his county , specifically the town of Cuero , has been dubbed the Chupacabra Capital of the World and benefits by monster tourism .
So while a sheriff might well be concerned if he thinks there 's a goat - sucking , menace in town , Zavesky is in no hurry to catch the beast and debunk the myth .
" It has brought a lot of attention to us , " he said .
" We 're not near ready to put this one to bed yet . "
Who watches Watchmen ?
It wo n't be you , if 20th Century Fox has its way ( at least not until Fox gets a taste of Warner Bros . ' action ) .
In February , 20th Century Fox sued Warner Bros. over the rights to the DC Comics Watchmen franchise – insisting that Fox still had a claim on Watchmen after failing to develop the graphic novel into a film .
Fox sought an injunction to stop production until the rights dispute was cleared .
But , these big court cases can drag , and director Zack Snyder hustled Watchmen along – getting a three - hour first cut of the film in the can before any legal action could be taken .
A federal court in Los Angeles on Monday refused to dismiss the Fox lawsuit – meaning Fox can proceed with an attempt to shut down Snyder 's movie in court .
The ruling offered no comment on the quality of Fox 's case or its potential for success , but clearly the judge found enough merit in the rights claim to let Fox 's lawyers take it up a notch .
Does
Fox really want to kill Watchmen ?
Or , is there another endgame here ?
Such legal wrangling seems inevitable when you consider Watchmen has been in development at Fox , Warner Bros . or elsewhere since 1986 .
That means a lot of producers , development executives and writers pinned a bloody smiley - face button to their chests at one time or another .
( I think my great aunt crocheted a draft of her own Watchmen script out of discount yarn she picked up at the crafts store .
I read it .
It was a little soft in the middle . )
Since
Fox would seem to gain nothing from killing Snyder 's movie besides vengeful glee , what is the studio really after ?
Or , the better question might be , " What are they always after ? "
Dinah Perez , a Hollywood - based entertainment attorney , said Watchmen fans have no reason to panic : " Fox has no financial risk here in a movie that could produce revenues for it .
As such , I doubt that Fox is going to force Warner Bros. to shelve the movie .
" In all likelihood , a settlement will be reached whereby Warner Bros. gets to distribute the movie , and Fox gets a piece of the action . "
Peter Woodke , a contract attorney working out of the San Francisco Bay Area , agreed : " I assume Fox is playing hardball to extract as much money as they can from the project , but I can't imagine the movie itself would be blocked .
I do n't know what the evidence is , but it sounds like the individual producers are at the crux of the matter . "
While both counselors see a possible Rorschach - rescuing resolution , it wo n't come quickly or easily .
" The bad news is that it 's going to be an arduous process , " Perez said .
" The good news is that Fox and Warner Bros. have until March 2009 ( Watchmen 's current release date ) to figure it out and come to a settlement . "

As all - star comic - book team - ups go , this one beats the first meeting of Superman and Spider - Man .
Three of the elder statesmen of comic books 
Neal Adams , Joe Kubert and Stan Lee  have joined forces to combat what they see as a real - world injustice .
The men are lending their talents to tell the tale of Dina Gottliebova Babbitt , who survived two years at the Auschwitz concentration camp by painting watercolor portraits for the infamous Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele .
Some of the artwork also survived , but it is in the possession of the Auschwitz - Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland .
Now 85 and living in California , Mrs. Babbitt wants the artwork back , but the museum has steadfastly refused to return it .
“ I ’m at a total loss , ” Mrs. Babbitt wrote in an e-mail message .
“ I feel just as helpless as I did when I was at camp .
Totally disempowered . ”
Now Mrs. Babbitt ’s story has been captured in a six - page comic - book story illustrated by Mr. Adams , who helped take Batman back to his dark roots after the ’60s television show made him seem campy ; inked partly by Mr. Kubert , whose comics career stretches back to the 1940s and who has drawn everyone from Hawkman to Sergeant Rock ; and featuring an introduction by Mr. Lee , a co-creator of the Fantastic Four , the X - Men and many other Marvel heroes .
With the 2008 senate elections still in their dormant summer phase I started to experiment with a ratings system .
I started with the greenhorns elected for the first time in 2002 ; there are nine in total with seven Republicans .
The basic notation I landed on , which may be too idealistic , is that the performance of a senator actually has an effect on their reelection efforts .
Heading over to the Library of Congress the data gathering began , by hand .
I started by defining what a good , or for that matter , bad performance entails .
I initially started by analyzing each senators voting record , but ultimately decided that this course would result in the introduction of partisanship .
I needed to find a way to concretely rate the senators based on their actions , but not necessarily their beliefs .
I settled on this formula :
The average number of cosponsors present on a bill that is inducted into law in which a given senator is also a ( co ) sponsor .
The basic rationale behind this formula attempts to gauge the extent to which a given senator individually participates in the law making process .
The general hypothesis is that a lower average will indicate a larger contribution , and a higher number will indicate less participation .
I tabulated the results for all nine first time senators up for reelection in 2008 along with some other , more prominent names for use as a measuring stick .
All data was gathered from the 108th , 109th , and 110th congresses .
Senator State Party Elected Avg # of Sponsors Ted Kennedy Massachusets Democrat 1962 23.397 John Cornyn Texas Republican 2002 31.138 Chuck Hagel Neberaska Republican 1996 33.302 John E. Sununu New Hampshire Republican 2002 33.688 Larry Craig Idaho Republican 1990 34.852 Saxby Chambliss Georgia Republican 2002 35.172 Frank Lautenberg New Jersey Democrat 2002 37.194 Lamar Alexander Tennessee Republican 2002 38.727 Norm Coleman Minnesota Republican 2002 40.459 Mark Pryor Arkansas Democrat 2002 44.357 Lindsey Graham South Carolina Republican 2002 45.323 Elizabeth Dole North Carolina Republican 2002 49.750
As you can seen from the table Ted Kennedy remains a senate legend .
Ted Kennedy scores very low for two reasons ; first he is a seven term , second in seniority senator and he solo authors many bills that eventually become law .
On the opposite end of the spectrum is Elizabeth Dole , who appears to be useless .
On a further analysis of her record , the only bill to become law that she has personally written focuses on the redrawing of coral reef on maps in the Atlantic Ocean .
Is that seriously the most important issue right now ; the answer 's no .
Back on track , based on this small sample set it appears that a lower average is in fact superior , but it remains unclear to what extent this holds true and if the average has any correlation to a senator 's reelection bid .
I should also point out that Frank Lautenberg served as a senator in the 1990s before retiring .
My results cannot be ruled conclusive , although they are interesting .
However , the aftermath leads me to believe a more thorough analysis of this application would yield a fascinating outcome , but the data is sparse .
There is no way to automate the calculation process .
The Library of Congress has a thorough database of legislative data , but it unfortunately is not programmatically available .
I may get ambitious in the future and manually start developing an open database from the Library of Congress ' site .
A mobile development author has discovered a mechanism in Apple 's iPhone software that would allow the company to blacklist and remotely deactivate installed apps that have been purchased and installed by users .
The kill switch would offer Apple a more targeted weapon to snuff out offending apps than its existing capacity to revoke a developer 's signing certificate , an action that could ultimately be used to shut down every application being distributed by a developer .
The more accurate aim of the new system may leave the company less hesitant to use it in rooting out apps it finds undesirable . Â
Jonathan Zdziarksi's iPhone Open Application Development indicates that the CoreLocation framework in the iPhone 2.0 ( as well as the updated iPod touch firmware ) points to a secure website that appears to contain at least placeholder code for a list of " unauthorized " apps . Â
While it 's unclear as to whether or not the operating system consults this site often or at all , its existence hints to Zdziarski the possibility of a kill switch that would give Apple final say over an app's ability to run , effectively putting all of the handheld devices under watch as long as they have an Internet connection .
" This suggests that the iPhone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off , " he says .
" At the moment , no apps have been blacklisted , but by all appearances , this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for , if Apple so chooses to shut them down . " Â
The finding expands upon Apple 's previously recognized capability to revoke developer 's certificates in order to prevent execution of their apps , a power also held by other platforms that have the capacity for mandatory certificate signing , including the Symbian OS 9.1 or greater in use by Nokia as well as RIM's BlackBerry OS .Â
As part of the security architecture for its mobile WiFi platform , as outlined by Apple chief Steve Jobs in October of last year , the iPhone SDK requires that each app that is made available through the App Store be signed by a security certificate , issued by Apple and unique to the developer .
Â
The iPhone refuses to run unsigned apps unless its security system has been defeated by jailbreaking .
The most obvious purpose of requiring that all iPhone apps be signed is that it allows Apple to selectively approve developers and the apps that are distributed through the Apps Store .
However , as the iPhone 's certificate signing authority , Apple has always had the option of retroactively revoking certificates at any stage and rendering programs unusable .
In order for this to happen , the iPhone would only need to consult Apple 's servers to gain an updated list of revoked certificates .
Once a developer 's certificate was revoked , none of their signed apps would run , just as is the case with unsigned apps .
That type of control over third party apps has stirred controversy on other platforms before , as it demands full and complete trust in the company managing the certificate authority to behave fairly and in the interests of users .
Apple , RIM , and others could theoretically abuse their control to revoke rights for competitors ' apps , or to punish developers for arbitrary reasons .
Â Microsoft's Palladium project , which hoped to convert the PC into a similarly secured platform , failed because the industry as a whole did not trust Microsoft to exercise the vast power it would gain over the entire PC hardware market .
Apple has described its certificate signing program as a means of securing iPhones and iPods against viruses , spyware , malware , and material determined to be indecent .
However , since the Apps Store opened nearly a month ago , the company has also pulled a few apps from the store , such as Nullrivers ' NetShare , either without stating any reason or because those apps were found in violation of Apple 's policies .
In the case of NetShare , it appears Apple removed the app from the store in order to appease AT&T , which does not support Internet sharing tethering on the iPhone data plan .
While Apple has pulled apps from the store , it has not yet revoked any known developer 's certificate , a move that would kill all their apps and could potentially prevent them from running on mobile devices after their purchase and installation .
Certificate revocation would likely only be used by Apple in an emergency case , where signed apps in the wild were found to be malicious after the fact .
However , Zdziarski's findings suggest that Apple could use a more targeted blacklist site as a kill switch to disable specific apps .
This mechanism could similarly be used to stop malicious malware , disabling viral apps before they have an opportunity to spread out of control .
Â
It could also be used by Apple to give IT managers the ability to remotely disable apps from their employees ' phones .
Apple has already outlined plans for delivering custom corporate app deployment through a local version of the iTunes App Store .
Being able to both remotely install and remove apps from mobile devices would be a highly desirable feature for IT managers in high security environments .
The technology news site CNET has compiled two interesting lists showing which cellphones give off the most and the least radiation .
In publishing the information , CNET editors note the data are n’t meant to imply that cellphone radiation poses a risk , nor is it meant to say that the phones are safe .
As I recently reported in my Well column last week , the data on cellphone safety are mixed , although a few recent international studies have suggested a link with three types of brain tumors .
The Food and Drug Administration also says there ’s not enough information to determine conclusively whether cellphones are safe or unsafe .
The charts focus on the specific absorption rate , or SAR , of a cellphone , which is a way of measuring the quantity of radio frequency energy that is absorbed by the body , according to CNET .
For a phone to pass F.C.C. certification , that phone ’s maximum SAR level must be less than 1.6 W/kg ( watts per kilogram ) .
In Europe , the level is capped at 2 W/kg , while Canada allows a maximum of 1.6 W/kg .
The SAR level listed in our charts represents the highest SAR level with the phone next to the ear as tested by the F.C.C .
Keep in mind that it is possible for the SAR level to vary between different transmission bands and that different testing bodies can obtain different results .
Also , it ’s possible for results to vary between different editions of the same phone ( such as a handset that ’s offered by multiple carriers ) .
Four Motorola phones top the list , with the V195s putting out the maximum 1.6 W/kg .
The popular BlackBerry Curve 8330 rounds out the No. 5 spot .

If you do n’t see your phone on the list , the site includes lists of cellphones by brand name .
My iPhone was listed under “ other ” brands , but I was interested to learn that its SAR number is 0.974 .
New data from a study of patients with treatment - resistant depression who underwent deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) in the subcallosal cingulate region ( SCG or Cg25 ) of the brain shows that this intervention is generally safe and provides significant improvement in patients as early as one month after treatment .
The patients also experienced continued and sustained improvement over time .
The data are reported in the online issue of Biological Psychiatry by scientists from the University of Toronto and Emory Emory University School of Medicine .
The study began at the University of Toronto in 2002 , led by Helen S. Mayberg , MD , and collaborators Andres Lozano , MD , PhD , neurosurgeon , and psychiatrist Sidney Kennedy , MD .
Mayberg is now a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and the Department of Neurology at Emory University School of Medicine .
This clinical trial is the culmination of Mayberg 's 20 years of research using brain imaging technology that has worked to characterize functional brain abnormalities in major depression and to identify the mechanisms of various antidepressant treatments .
A report on the first six patients in the study was published in the Journal Neuron in 2005 .
The new paper reports on an expanded sample of patients and an extended period of clinical follow - up .
DBS uses high - frequency electrical stimulation targeted to the specific areas of the brain involved in neuropsychiatric disease .
Twenty patients received SCG DBS for 12 months .
Twelve of 20 patients experienced a significant decrease in depressive symptoms ( defined by a 50 percent decrease in the Hamilton Depression rating scale ) by six months , with seven patients essentially well with few remaining symptoms ( remission , defined as a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score < 8 ) .
Benefits were largely maintained at 12 months with continued stimulation .
No long - term side effects were reported .
Each study patient was implanted with two thin wire electrodes ( one on each side of the brain ) in the white matter adjacent to SCG .
The other end of each wire was connected under the skin of the neck to a pulse generator implanted in the chest -- similar to a pacemaker -- that directs the electrical current .
The researchers regulated the intensity of the current according to the response of the patient .
Only patients who were unable to get better with most other types of antidepressant treatment -- including medication , psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy -- were included in the study .

" In previous studies using brain imaging , we found the subcallosal cingulate region was a key region in an emerging emotion regulation circuit implicated in major depression , " explains Mayberg .
" We postulated that if stimulation worked for the treatment of other neurological disorders where abnormal function of specific circuits was well established , such as Parkinson 's disease , then stimulation of the Cg25 region within this apparent depression circuit might provide significant benefit for patients with treatment - resistant depression . "
The researchers were able to track the clinical response of the patients over a 12 - month period using standard depression rating scales as well as various quantitative measures of behavior and general functioning , neuropsychological testing and scanning of both regional brain blood flow and glucose metabolism using positron emission tomography ( PET ) .
PET imaging of these patients demonstrated that metabolic activity changed locally at the site of stimulation but also throughout the previously identified depression network , providing evidence that modulating the circuit and not just a single region was likely responsible for the antidepressant effects .
" We see depression as a complex disturbance of the specific circuits in the brain responsible for regulating mood and emotions , " Mayberg says .
" We hypothesized that if DBS could locally modulate a critical central location within this mood circuit , such modulation would result in clinical improvement -- and it appears it does . "
Mayberg initiated an expanded version of her Toronto study at Emory in 2007 with psychiatrist Paul Holtzheimer , MD , and neurosurgeon Robert Gross , MD , PhD , and with grant support from the Woodruff Fund , The Stanley Medical Research Institute and the Dana Foundation .
The new Emory clinical trial is tackling a number of unanswered issues including the testing of patients with bipolar II depression and refinement of the targeting and selection of the electrodes using new imaging techniques .
The Emory study will enroll 20 patients and will be conducted over a period of at least three years .
The Toronto study was funded in part by a Distinguished Investigator Award from National Alliance for Research in Schizophrenia and Depression ( HSM ) .

New Orleans
On the seventh - floor parking garage of a Holiday Inn that calls itself the “ jazziest hotel in New Orleans , ” soldiers dressed for combat wait for the evening ’s call to fall in .
They chat , smoke and gaze out upon an American city still in need of their armed presence .
At a sergeant ’s bark , these two dozen men and women , all members of the Louisiana National Guard , stand at attention for their nightly pep talk .
The sergeant instructs them to drive carefully , to be alert , to keep an eye out for a hyperactive band of armed robbers and to remember : “ We ’re not here to make friends . ”
They slap clips into their 9 - millimeter pistols and climb into decade - old white sedans no longer of use to the state police .
Then out they go , on patrol , their flashlight beams skimming like the nation ’s eye across shotgun houses achingly abandoned and beautifully restored , down streets named St. Maurice , and Piety , and Elysian Fields .
On this night the shift supervisor is Sgt. Robert Barthelemy , 28 , a brawny sawmill worker from Natchitoches , more than 200 miles to the northwest .
But he has earned his street stripes , first as an Army tank commander in Baghdad and for the last 18 months as a soldier in New Orleans .
He wants to be a police officer someday ; maybe here .
Like countless resurrections of Freddy Krueger , it appears that John Poindexter ’s Total Information Awareness ( TIA ) program has found a new , more accommodating home for its “ mission ” of “ keeping America safe ” –from the Constitution –at the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency ( IARPA ) .
According to McClatchy investigative journalist Warren Strobel ,
IARPA … is the U.S. intelligence community ’s counterpart to DARPA , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which has been in business for more than 35 years and is meant to be a small , flexible R&D agency that funds high - risk , but potentially high - payoff technologies .
( “ What ’s IARPA ? ” , McClatchy Washington Bureau , June 30 , 2008 ) IARPA has been organized under the auspices of Office of Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) Mike McConnell , a former executive vice - president with spooky mega-contractor Booz Allen Hamilton .
As Tim Shorrock reported in March , As Booz Allen ’s chief intelligence liaison to the Pentagon , McConnell was at the center of action , both before and after the September 11 attacks .
During the first six years of the Bush administration , Booz Allen ’s contracts with the U.S. government rose dramatically , from $ 626,000 in 2000 to $ 1.6 billion in 2006 .
McConnell and his staff at Booz Allen were deeply involved in some of the Bush administration ’s most controversial counterterrorism programs .
They included the Pentagon ’s infamous Total Information Awareness data - mining scheme run by former Navy Admiral John Poindexter , which was an attempt to collect information on potential terrorists in America from phone records , credit card receipts and other databases .
( Congress cancelled the program over civil liberties concerns , but much of the work was transferred to the NSA , where Booz Allen continued to receive the contracts . )
( “ Carlyle Group May Buy Major CIA Contractor : Booz Allen Hamilton , CorpWatch , March 8 , 2008 )
According to the agency ’s website , IARPA ’s brief is centered on three program areas :
Smart Collection , “ The goal of the programs in this office is to dramatically improve the value of collected data from all sources . ”
Incisive Analysis , “ The goal of the programs in this office is to maximize insight from the information we collect , in a timely fashion . ”
Safe & Secure Operations ,
“ The goal of the programs in this office is to be able to counter new capabilities implemented by our adversaries that would threaten our ability to operate freely and effectively in a networked world . ”
There ’s no argument that preventing sociopaths–state - sponsored or otherwise–using malware to cause the meltdown of a nuclear power plant ’s uranium core or the sudden release of methyl isocyanate into the atmosphere should be a priority of any sane government .
Certainly such laudatory goals would be optimized by writing better programs rather than through intrusive data - mining ops carried out by the state ’s outsourced and well - paid private “ partners . ”
Unfortunately , we are n’t dealing with a sane government here in the United States .
According to Virtual Worlds News , one IARPA program seeks to “ mine ” information from virtual worlds and online gaming sites for its potential to “ model ” terrorist activity .
Reynard , a data - mining project from Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity ( IARPA ) , is an exploratory effort to monitor activity in virtual worlds and online games and then model what terrorist activity in those worlds would look like .
The Director of National Intelligence recently released a Congressionally mandated report on various data - mining projects of which Reynard is just one .
While it ’s just an early effort right now , “ If it shows early promise , this small seedling effort may increase its scope to a full project . ”
Data - mining is defined as “ a program involving pattern - based queries , searches or other analyses of 1 or more electronic databases ” in order to “ discover or locate a predictive pattern of anomaly indicative of terrorist or criminal activity …. ” and will now be ongoing “ in a public virtual world environment .
The research will use publicly available data and begin with observational studies to establish baseline behaviors . ”
No word on what world that will be in , but we already know that the CIA has a presence in Second Life and that IARPA has investigated Linden Lab ’s world as well .
( “ U.S. Project Reynard Mines Data Looking for Virtual Spies , ” Virtual Worlds News , February 25 , 2008 )
One can only wonder what IARPA will do once “ baseline behaviors ” are mapped !
But apparently there ’s no need to fret since “ the government understands that ‘ applications of results from these research projects may ultimately have implications for privacy and civil liberties , ’ so ‘IARPA is also investing in projects that develop privacy protecting technologies , ' ” Secrecy News reports .
We bet they are !
But as Strobel points out , “ IARPA ’s ancestry is a wee bit interesting ” :
In the beginning , there was Total Information Awareness , a DARPA information - gathering program run by noneother than former Iran- Contra figure and Reagan national security adviser John Poindexter .
Critics saw the program as a major , post - 9/11 intrusion on American ’s privacy and civil liberties , and Congress killed funding for it in 2003 .
But there were persistent reports –confirmed by yours truly in conversations with former U.S. intelligence officials –that portions of the Total Information Awareness research had simply been shunted off to other agencies .
As readers undoubtedly recall , Total Information Awareness ( TIA ) was “ terminated ” by Congress when it learned that Poindexter was setting up a program that would sift through “ public databases storing credit card purchases , rental agreements , medical histories , e-mails , airline reservations , and phone calls for electronic ‘ footprints ’ that might indicate a terrorist plot in the making , ” according to Shorrock ’s excellent read , Spies for Hire .
And to whom did DARPA turn to manage TIA ?
Why none other than Booz Allen Hamilton , of course !
Joining SAIC ( Science Applications International Corporation ) , Booz Allen “ won ” some $ 63 million in contracts to run Poindexter ’s pet project .
While the program–and contracts –were allegedly cancelled , portions of TIA had simply been spun - off to other agencies including the FBI and NSA .
Where else did TIA migrate ?
It turns out , many of its data - mining projects , including the Scalable Social Network Analysis ( SSNA ) operation , which seeks to model networks of connections like social interactions , financial transactions , telephone calls , and organizational memberships into a coherent analytical tool , were “ assimilated ” by the Advanced Research and Development Activity ( ARDA ) , managed by NSA .
Strobel reports that “ ARDA was later renamed , given the ominous - sounding moniker , Disruptive Technology Office . ”
And now ARDA and DTO along with a “ new and improved ” TIA , have apparently been folded into IAPRA .
Which just goes to show , you ca n’t kill off that which the state decrees is necessary for “ your protection . ”
As Wired ’s Ryan Singel advises online gaming enthusiasts , you ’d better “ be careful who you frag ” !

Cable companies should n't force subscribers into renting cable boxes when they could just purchase one outright and save money , a new lawsuit alleges .
Kansas native Matthew Meeds has filed what he hopes will become a class - action lawsuit against Time Warner Cable and parent company Time Warner over what he considers to be an illegal tying arrangement that violates antitrust laws and hurts customers .
In a lawsuit filed earlier this week , Meeds notes that Time Warner customers in Kansas are forced to pay a rental fee to Time Warner for a cable box in order to view premium channels .
Customers do n't have the option of using their own box , and renting a cable box from Time Warner is apparently a condition of subscribing to the premium channels .
" By doing this , Time Warner forces the class to pay a much larger amount of money than would be the case if they were allowed to purchase a cable box of their choice from the manufacturer of their choosing , " reads the lawsuit .
This practice runs afoul of Federal Communications Commission 's regulations requiring the cable industry to separate the descrambling capabilities of the cable box and place them in a separate device ( a CableCARD ) , says Meeds .
Although Time Warner does offer CableCARD to customers , it 's not easy to find on the company 's website and Time Warner promotes its own boxes as superior .
Finally , even if customers decide to go with the CableCARD , Time Warner still requires customers to lease the device instead of buying it .
In fact , it 's quite difficult to purchase any sort of set - top cable box .
Despite the FCC 's optimism that the introduction of the CableCARD would open the flood gates to tons of third - party boxes , that has simply not happened thanks to manufacturers ' disinterest in selling them customers and cable companies ' desire to push the rental of their own devices .
Time Warner 's actions constitute " unlawful tying " under to the Sherman Antitrust
Act because the class can't unbundle tied products from their cable service , says Meeds , who also accuses Time Warner of acting as a monopoly and violating the Kansas Consumer Protection Act .
Meeds would like to see the case turned into a class- action and have Time Warner pay damages , attorney 's fees , civil penalties , and other costs involved in the suit .
When speaking to the Kansas City Star ( via Techdirt ) Meeds ' attorney John Edgar likened Time Warner 's behavior to the days when AT&T used to require customers to rent phones from the company instead of using their own equipment .
" I think it 's very similar to the cases brought back in those days , where slowly but surely , the courts whittled away at that kind of protectionist activity by AT&T , " Edgar told the paper .
" I think the same thing is present here .
You have a lot of companies out there manufacturing these boxes , and there 's nothing necessarily proprietary about them . "
Indeed , it has now been 40 years since the FCC ruled that AT&T could not force customers to rent specific handsets directly from the company as long as other devices do n't harm the phone system , and the landmark case has been used frequently to shape modern FCC rulings .

Josh Susser had a bunch of great things to say about Shoulda in his RailsConf 2008 presentation , The great test framework dance - off .
One of the parts he really liked was the conceptual simplicity of creating macros when drying up your tests .
It ’s a misnomer to even call what you do with Shoulda “ macros ” , since they ’re just normal class methods .
Here ’s one we use all the time for our projects that use Paperclip ( which you should definitely check out if you have n’t all ready ) .
# in test_helper.rb... class Test :: Unit :: TestCase def self .
should_have_attached_file ( attachment ) klass = self .
name .
gsub ( / Test $ / , '' ) . constantize context " To support a paperclip attachment named #{ attachment } , #{ klass } " do should_have_db_column ( " # { attachment } _file_name " , : type => : string ) should_have_db_column ( " # { attachment } _content_type " , : type => : string ) should_have_db_column ( " # { attachment } _file_size " , : type => : integer ) end should " have a paperclip attachment named # #{ attachment } " do assert klass .
new .
respond_to ? ( attachment . to_sym ) , " @ #{ klass .
name .
underscore } does n't have a paperclip field named #{ attachment } " assert_equal Paperclip :: Attachment , klass .
new .
send ( attachment .
to_sym ) . class end end end #
And in the Tests ... class UserTest < Test :: Unit :: TestCase should_have_attached_file :avatar end
One of Shoulda ’s main goals is to remain as simple to understand and extend as possible .
While there ’s a little bit of magic when getting the current class from the test class name , the rest of the macro is concise and easy to understand .
We use this technique liberally throughout our test suites on a variety of applications , and it ’s worked wonders .
We even push the general purpose ones into Shoulda proper .
If you have any that you think should be shared with the community , just send us a Git pull request .

Yet Another Coup in Mauritania .
August 6 , 2008
There seems to be yet another Coup in Mauritania .
Mauritania is one of these fucked up countries where coups are the normal way of changing the government .
The last coup was in 2005 .
And this is yet another classic coup .
First the State TV went of the air and than there were troops moving in the capital .
The former commander of the Presidential guard took over according to AlJazeera .
I wonder how long he ’ll last .
At the moment the Coup is bloodless and my guess is that it ’ll stay that way – ok maybe they ’ll kill the ex-President – but probably the population of Mauritania is not interested enough in those things anymore to fight for one site or the other .
Gary " War Nerd " Brecher wrote an article on Mauritania ’s way of changing the government in 2005 when the last coup happened .
Update : There are Protests in Mauritania both for and against the Coup .
So maybe they do care or at least some of them .
William Burns ( r ) is taking part in the talks with Iran 's Saeed Jalili ( l )
A senior United States official is taking part for the first time in international talks with Iran over its controversial nuclear programme .
The official , William Burns , is joining envoys from the EU and permanent members of the UN security council .
Their talks with top Iranian nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili were expected to focus on incentives for Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment .
Mr Burns ' attendance is being seen as a major shift in US policy .
The US and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the taking of hostages at the US embassy in Tehran .
Formal contact between the two countries has been extremely limited , though last year they met at ambassadorial level to discuss security in Iraq .
' Freeze for freeze '
In addition to the US and Iranian envoys , the talks in Geneva 's city hall are being attended by representatives from Britain , China , France , Germany , and Russia .
We 've been very clear that any country can change course
Condoleezza Rice
US Secretary of State
US and Iran eye diplomatic opening Send us your comments
The aim is to find out how Iran will respond to an offer of economic incentives for Tehran to suspend its nuclear activities .
Iran says its nuclear programme is designed to meet its energy needs , and it is defying UN Security Council demands to halt uranium enrichment .
As the talks began in Geneva , senior Iranian official Keyvan Imani restated his country 's position that a suspension was " out of the question " .
However the BBC's Bethany Bell in Geneva says the Iranians might be considering whether to stop increasing their enrichment .
Diplomats are pushing for a so - called " freeze - for - freeze " formula , under which a freeze of Iran 's programme at its current levels would be matched by a Western pledge not to strengthen sanctions on Tehran .
Ahead of the talks , Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki described them as " positive and constructive " , and said he hoped a framework for future negotiations could follow .
Pragmatism Since 2002 , when President George W Bush famously named Iran as one of the countries that formed the " axis of evil " , his administration had insisted that no face - to - face talks would be held unless Iran suspended the enrichment of uranium , which it says could be used to produce nuclear weapons .
US officials say Mr Burns ' presence will be a " one - time event " and that he is in Geneva not to negotiate but to listen .
With just six months left of his presidency , analysts say Mr Bush is taking a more pragmatic approach .
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice seemed to sum up the new conciliatory mood in a speech on Friday .
She reiterated that Iran was " a difficult and dangerous state " before adding : " We have been very clear that any country can change course . "
Recent reports have suggested the US may even consider opening a diplomatic mission in Tehran - which would be the first such link since the US hostage crisis nearly 30 years ago .
The talks come after weeks of rising tensions in the region .
The Iranians test - fired missiles last week , and a series of threats and counter - threats between Iran and Israel has been watched nervously in the West .

What are these ?
Part 2 on The Plausibility of Life
How does evolution shape living things ?
The fact that evolutionary forces , such as natural selection , can shape living creatures is well - established , but how malleable those creatures are , and what the increments of change are is less well established .
We have a fairly good idea of how genes can change , but how does that genetic change translate into physical changes in the shape and functioning of the organism itself - that is , how does genetic change translate into changes in the organism 's phenotype ?
The authors of The Plausibility of Life , Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart , argue that this issue has been ignored in evolutionary theory ( although they go on to say that it was justifiably ignored for a long time - before modern molecular and cell biology , there was no way to effectively address this question ) :
What if evolutionary biologists were wrong to think of phenotypic variation as random and unconstrained ?
How much would it matter if we really understood how genetic variation leads to phenotypic variation , and in particular , how facile or difficult is it to achieve a specific phenotype ?
These questions get to the heart of the evolution of complexity .
For example , is the mollusc lineage infinitely malleable ?
If webbed feet were to provide molluscs with an adaptive advantage , would natural selection be able to , after many generations , produce them ?
( Keep in mind that when talking about natural selection , the semantics get tricky - I do n't mean to imply that natural selection works towards a focused goal like webbed feet .
I 'm not assuming that it does in these arguments , but we occasionally bump up against the limits of language , or at least my language , when trying to talk about these issues efficiently . )
Here is another way that Kirschner and Gerhart state the question .
Take a line from Shakespeare , " To be or not to be " , and imagine a computer randomly generating letters on a screen - how effectively would a computer generate Shakespeare 's line ?
( Again , the analogy to evolution is imperfect - there is no pre-set goal in evolution analogous to a pre-determined sentence . )
If the computer was varying all letters randomly , and all correct 18 ( including spaces ) had to show up simultaneously at once to get the line , it would take some time before you would expect to see Shakespeare 's line show up by sheer chance .
Now if you added a little selection , your line would likely show up much sooner - if every time you got a correct letter , you kept it , only varying the other letters , you 'd generate the line much faster .
But what if you did n't vary letters , what if you varied entire words ?
Instead of having the computer choose at random 18 different letters , what if it randomly chose six 2 - or 3 - letter words ?
If you used selection together with random word variation , you 'd get Shakespeare 's line very quickly .
In the case of individual letters , you can get many " non-functional , " gibberish combinations - that is , the first hurdle is to get a functional word , and then put those words into a sentence .
Kirschner and Gerhart argue that the variation we observe in real organisms is like variation of complete words , not individual letters .
In organisms , there are functional pieces ready to go , pieces which can be varied as coherent plug - and - play modules to build new variants of complex systems .
Much of this probably sounds obvious , but its significance for evolution is often unappreciated .
It is much easier for an insect or vertebrate lineage to evolve new types of limbs , for example , than it is for a mollusc to evolve webbed feet .
Why ?
Because insects and vertebrates already have the molecular toolkit for making limbs ; to make a new type of limb ( such as wings on a bat or dragonfly ) requires only some tweaks to that tool kit - bats and insects did not have to evolve wings from scratch .
Like I said , this all probably sounds obvious , but what is not obvious is how pervasive these ready - to - go molecular toolkits are .
Almost all of the most important cellular processes evolved very early in the history of life , and much evolution since then has consisted of applying the fundamental organism - building toolboxes in new ways .
A good deal of our metabolism is very similar to what exists in bacteria .
Our cells divide using the same machinery employed in yeast cells .
Biologists study embryological development in flies because the machinery that operates there is extremely similar to what operates in human embryos .
This similarity of basic cellular processes was a huge surprise to many prominent evolutionary biologists .
Ernst Mayr , one of the most successful and influential mid-20th century evolutionary biologists ( and pretty damn smart , writing sharp books at age 100 ) wrote that :
Much that has been learned about gene physiology makes it evident that the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives .
If there is only one efficient solution for a certain functional demand , very different gene complexes will come up with the same solution , no matter how different the pathway by which it is achieved .
The saying " May roads lead to Rome " is as true in evolution as in daily affairs .
- Animal Species and Evolution ( 1963 ) , p. 609 , quotes in Sean Carroll 's Endless Forms Most Beautiful , p. 71-72
This was how Mayr thought that new complexity evolved : evolution built new genetic tool boxes from scratch , over and over again .
Today we know that this idea is wrong in most cases .
It is actually much easier to evolve new complex functions than was believed at mid-century .
Thus , for a long time evolutionary theory went along without any serious account of how genetic variation produces complex phenotypic variation - how new combinations of mutations produce new complex functions .
For a long time evolutionary biologists could easily neglect molecular biology , but the phenomenon has run both ways - most molecular cell biologists have very little training or interest in hard - core evolutionary theory .
They reap frequently reap its benefits , but do n't spend much time thinking about how their own work fits into the larger picture of evolutionary theory .
Kirschner and Gerhart argue that the way forward in evolutionary biology involves overcoming this neglect .
The core cellular processes , conserved for immense stretches of evolutionary time , are the enablers of much of the complex function we see in nature today .
This is the second installment of a series of posts on an interesting recent book by the accomplished biologists Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart .
In this book , the authors lay out what they see as the most important research agenda for molecular biologists in the 21st century .
Part 1 is here .
Part 3 is now up
Israel has built heavily on occupied land in the West Bank and Jerusalem Israel has offered a peace deal to the Palestinians which would annex 7.3 % of the West Bank and keep the largest settlements , Israeli reports say .
In return the Palestinians would be given land equivalent to 5.4 % of the West Bank in the Negev desert , the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported .
Palestinian officials confirmed that such a plan had been put forward , but called it totally unacceptable .
The two sides have been in peace talks sponsored by the US since November .
Israel wants a new border similar to the route of the barrier it is currently building in and around the West Bank , Haaretz reports .
The proposed deal also covers Palestinian refugees and security arrangements , as well as the future of Gaza , Haaretz says , but not the issue of East Jerusalem and the ring of settlements around it .
On Monday , a delicate truce over Gaza 's border was shaken when unidentified Palestinian militants fired a rocket which fell into an open area in the Israeli town of Sderot .
No-one was injured .
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak ordered crossings into the Hamas - controlled territory to be closed on Tuesday .
Wide gap A spokesman for Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said a proposed 92.7 % - 7.3 % split was nothing new - it had been presented by Israel earlier in the year , he said .
They want to blame us Camp David - style for any failures in the negotiations
Saeb Erekat
Palestinian negotiator
" The only subject that was discussed seriously was the borders but we never reached an agreement .
The gap is still as wide as ever , " Abu Rudeineh told the BBC .
" This plan is totally unacceptable because we insisted to the Israelis that the border can only be on the basis of 1967 , " he said .
About half a million Israeli settlers live among 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , land that was occupied by Israel in the 1967 war .
The Israeli government has declined to comment on the reports .
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Haaretz report contained baseless statements and half - truths .
" They want to blame us Camp David - style for any failures in the negotiations , " he said , referring to the aftermath of the peace talks in 2000 .
Free hand Haaretz said it would be a " shelf agreement " implemented over considerable time .
Formation of a Palestinian state - which would be completely demilitarised - would be dependent on the retaking of Gaza from the militant group Hamas , it said .
But Israel would have a free hand to develop the settlement blocs immediately , Haaretz said .
Compared to previous negotiations , Haaretz says it is more generous than what Ehud Barak offered Yasser Arafat in 2000 and but less than his offer at Taba , Egypt , in 2001 .
The latest talks have shown little visible progress and were dealt a further blow in July when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced he would resign within weeks as he battles a series of corruption allegations .

Iraq PR Written Months Before Intel Report Arrived
White Paper Justifying Iraq War Written Three Months before Intel Report Arrived
A war based on deception and fraud Worldpassion cc National Security Archive Stunner Michael Collins
" Scoop " Independent New
Washington , DC
The National Security Archive released a report Friday Aug. 22 , 2008 that sheds even more light on the premeditated lying and deception that took the United States to war in Iraq .
The findings are based on new evidence compiled by Dr. John Prados and published by the National Security Archive .
( See " White Paper " Drafted before NIE even Requested , " Scoop " Independent News , Aug. 24 , 2008 )
Most notably , Prados shows the depth of the deception perpetrated against citizens and Congress regarding the alleged threat to U.S. security posed by Iraq .
It had appeared that the White House rewrote the Oct. 1 , 2002 National Intelligence Estimate and then issued that doctored report to Congress on Oct. 4 , 2002 .
Prados reveals convincing evidence that the Oct. 4 White Paper had already been written by July 2002 .
He shows that it was only slightly altered after the final NIE arrived .
This White Paper served as the basis for the war .
The unavoidable conclusion is that the Bush - Cheney White paper " justifying " the invasion was developed a full three months in advance of the intelligence data and analysis that should have served as the basis for that justification .
The National Security Archive summed it up succinctly :
" The U.S. intelligence community buckled sooner in 2002 than previously reported to Bush administration pressure for data justifying an invasion of Iraq , " The documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis , which then conformed to public positions taken by Pentagon and White House officials .
For example , a July 2002 draft of the " White Paper " ultimately issued by the CIA in October 2002 actually pre-dated the National Intelligence Estimate that the paper purportedly summarized , but which Congress did not insist on until September 2002 . "
National Security Archive in " Scoop ' Independent News , August 24 , 2008 .
The seemingly endless war in Iraq has become a total disaster on multiple levels for all involved .
The awful toll in human deaths and casualties is largely ignored but real nevertheless .
Over 4,000 U.S. soldiers have been lost in battle and tens of thousands injured .
In excess of one million Iraqi civilians are dead due to civil strife unleashed by the invasion .
The U.S. Treasury is drained and the steep decline in respect for the United States around the world is just beginning to manifest .
The United States political establishment responds with collective denial on a scale that 's incomprehensible .
In the presidential campaign , the only sustained public commentary on the war comes from the Republican presidential candidate John McCain who makes the bizarre claim that U.S. is " surrendering " with victory in clear sight .
McCain touts the surge without noting that 4.0 million Iraqis are " displaced from their homes . "
Nearly ten percent of Iraq 's population is either dead or injured and there are 5.0 million Iraqi orphans .
This pathological view of victory claims the " surge ' is a success in the context of a devastated population in an obliterated nation lacking in the most essential supplies and services ; a nation where death continues on a shopping spree
The report by Dr. Prados makes it clear that the executive branch was responsible for creating whatever information they found necessary to justify war and they did it by posing security threats from Iraq and demanding that intelligence briefers fill in the details
Summary of Findings by Prados , National Security Archive
" A recently declassified draft of the CIA 's October 2002 white paper on Iraqi WMD programs demonstrates that that ( the White ) paper long pre-dated the compilation of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraqi capabilities .
" Bush administration and the Tony Blair government began acting in concert to build support for an invasion of Iraq two to three months earlier than previously understood .
" A comparison of the CIA draft white paper with its publicly released edition shows that all the changes made were in the nature of strengthening its charges against Iraq by inserting additional alarming claims , in the manner of an advocacy , or public relations document .
" The draft and final papers show no evidence of intelligence analysis applied to the information contained . "
August 22 , 2004
One Final Hope to Avoid a Tragic War
Ultimately , the White House had what it wanted by July 2002 .
When the National Intelligence Estimate arrived from an intimidated intelligence community , there was still one hope of a rational outcome on the rush to war .
The NIE delivered to the White House on Oct. 1 , 2002 noted that the one scenario in which Iraq would attack the United States involved a U.S. attack on Iraq that threatened Saddam Hussein 's survival .
The following is brutally simple .
The one way to cause the hypothesized ( and erroneous ) claims of Hussein 's intent to attack the United States is to go to war and threaten his regime .
Therefore , refraining from war was the best way to protect the United States .
" Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW against the United States , fearing that exposure of Iraqi involvement would provide Washington a stronger cause for making war .
" Iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the U.S. Homeland if Baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable , or possibly for revenge . "
Key Judgments , National Intelligence Estimate , Oct. 2002
That was deleted entirely .
The July White Paper was " complete " and sent to Congress as the evidence justifying the invasion of Iraq .
In the most supreme of ironies , many members of Congress failed to even review the distorted White Paper before voting overwhelmingly to approve the invasion .
Is there any hope that this same legislative body can remedy the great wrong they helped create ?
Is there anyone who believes that this or any future White House will move with the urgency necessary to end this war ?
Will anyone ever be held to account for this series of premeditated deceptions ?

By By zadzi Nov 20 , 2007 in World Wealthy former warlords in Baghlan , a northern province of Afghanistan , recruit adolescent boys for sex and entertainment , while local authorities remain powerless in stopping the practice .
The bacha bereesh , between the ages of 14 to 18 ( though 14 seems to be the preferred age ) , are dressed in special women ’s clothing , with bells tied to their feet , and paraded out to dance at parties and weddings .
In general , the practice of men dancing at parties is relatively common in Afghanistan , Allah Daad , once a mujahedin commander in the northern Afghan province of Kunduz , Large halls provide the venues for the weekly parties where the boys ’ owners , invite their friends to watch them dancing .
Several different types of dances are popular , Daad says , and if the boy refuses to dance or performs badly , his master beats him with a long stick .
" We have to do that , ” explains Daad .
“ We spend money on these boys , so they have to dance . ”
Later into the night , once the dancing is over , the boys are frequently shared with close friends , for sexual favors .
And by the end of the evening it is not at all uncommon for the boy to have a new owner , as the parties often provide the opportunity for buying and selling .
Both prestige as well as poverty are the main motivators for the revival of bacha bazi .
A beautiful boy who is also the best dancer becomes a status symbol for his master .
A man going by the name of Nasro Bay explains how the public ostentation of bacha bazi is a sign of prestige : “ I am not really rich , but I am just as good as the wealthy .
I want as many bacha bereesh as possible , so that when I go to parties I am no worse than anybody else . ”
He insists that the dancing boy tradition is a good one .
“ It ’s a good thing , ” he said .
“ We have our own culture .
In foreign countries , the women dance .
We have our own dances which do n’t exist anywhere else in the world . ”
The men are said to lavish money and gifts on their boys .
Many claim to love them , and there are cases of boys who are not so dissatisfied with their lifestyle , demeaning as it may seem .
" I was only 14 - years - old when a former Uzbek commander forced me to have sex with him , " says Shir Mohammad .
" Later , I quit my family and became his secretary .
I have been with him for 10 years , I am now grown up , but he still loves me and I sleep with him . "
But at 24 , he is getting far too old to remain a dancing boy .
" I am grown up now and do not have the beauty of former years .
So , I proposed to marry my lord 's daughter and he has agreed to it . "
Ahmad Jawad , 17 , has been with a wealthy landowner for the past two years .
" I am used to it .
I love my lord .
I love to dance and act like a woman and play with my owner , " he says .
When asked what he would do when he got older , Ahmad says he will be an owner and will have many of his own boys .
Some of the men say they are not interested in women .
“ We know it is immoral and unIslamic , but how can we quit ? ” asks 35 year - old Chaman Gul .
“ We do not like women , we just want boys . ”
But poverty tells a less sentimental story , and remains a huge motivating factor in the boy ’s lives .
It ’s often desperation which drives them into the lifestyle .
“ I was dancing last night , ” one exhausted - looking 14 year - old boy said , when his owner forced him to speak .
“ I have been doing this for the past year .
I have no choice - I ’m poor .
My father is dead , and this is the only source of income for me and my family .
I try to dance well , especially at huge parties .
The men throw money at me , and then I gather it up .
Sometimes they take me to the market and buy me nice clothes . ”
Mohammad Zaher Zafari , head of the northern branch of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission , bemoans the government ’s inability to take action .
“ Unfortunately I have to say that this type of dancing , sexual abuse and even the sale of boys has been going on for years , ” he says .
“ It is a despicable culture .
The boys involved are usually poor , underage or orphans , and they are forced into it by their economic circumstances .
Indeed , the government has failed to do much about the practice of bacha bazi , and police force do little to encourage public confidence .
Local officials do admit the practice is prevalent but seem at a loss as to how to combat it .
“ Yes , bacha baazi is practiced a great deal , especially in the Khost - o - Fering and Andarab districts , ” says Hafizullah Khaliqyar , head of the prosecutor ’s office for Baghlan province .
“ Boys are forced to dance , they are sexually abused , and they are even bought and sold .
Fights take place over these bacha bereesh .
It ’s increasing day by day , and it ’s catastrophic . ”
Khaliqyar says there is little that prosecutors could do .
“ The police and district heads wo n’t cooperate with us , ” he complains .
“ They do n’t send us their files , so we ca n’t take action . ”
He says the paramilitary commanders involved are powerful - so powerful that no one , not even the police , is able to rise against them .
But Baghlan chief prosecutor Hafizullah Khaliqyar has more hope , and says those found guilty of abuse would be jailed for at least 15 years .
" We have 25 cases of such immoral acts .
They are being processed and we are trying our utmost to tackle the problem , " he says .
A ‘ bacha bereesh ’ is a boy without a beard , and in several circles a beardless boy is most desired by rich , powerful male patrons .
Grown men become involved in ‘ bacha bazi ’— which literally translates into ‘ boy - play ’ .
This is a time - honored tradition , condemned by human rights activists and Muslim clerics , but it is seeing a revival in the north province of Afghanistan .
It is by no means restricted to the north of Afghanistan only , but has virtually faded in the south , where the Taliban ’s strict moral code act as a deterrent .
The bacha bereesh , between the ages of 14 to 18 ( though 14 seems to be the preferred age ) , are dressed in special women ’s clothing , with bells tied to their feet , and paraded out to dance at parties and weddings .
In general , the practice of men dancing at parties is relatively common in Afghanistan , where the sexes are strictly segregated and women unallowed to partake in such activity .
However , in Baghlan , the former warlords and mujahideen commanders are resurrecting bacha bazi , and holding dance competitions between the boys .
Allah Daad , once a mujahedin commander in the northern Afghan province of Kunduz , explains how the boys are enticed into the arrangement : “ First we select boys in the village and later on we try to trick them into coming with us , ” he said .
“ Some of them stay with us for money ; they get a monthly allowance , and in return we can have them any time we want .
They do n’t stay with us all the time - they can do their own jobs and then just come to parties with us .
” Large halls provide the venues for the weekly parties where the boys ’ owners , invite their friends to watch them dancing .
Several different types of dances are popular , Daad says , and if the boy refuses to dance or performs badly , his master beats him with a long stick .
" We have to do that , ” explains Daad .
“ We spend money on these boys , so they have to dance .
” Later into the night , once the dancing is over , the boys are frequently shared with close friends , for sexual favors .

Private security workers and local government officials have police powers to stop and fine people for littering , dog crap , and other minor offenses , reports the UK Telegraph .
They can even " stop vehicles for the purpose of testing . "
Dominic Grieve , the Conservative shadow home secretary , said the scheme was the latest example of the unjustified extension of surveillance powers under Labour .
He said : " The public will be angered that the Home Office is seeking to take serious powers that should be appropriately applied by the police and encouraging them to be given not just to local councils , but also to private firms .
" The public want to see real police on the streets discharging these responsibilities , not private firms who may use them inappropriately – including unnecessarily snooping on the lives of ordinary citizens . "
America , meet Barack The Arrogant .
Did you hear , this guy ’s already talking about redecorating the Lincoln Bedroom ?
Or that a few weeks back , he stood behind a podium bearing a faux presidential seal ?
The young upstart from Illinois has even got his minions planning a White House transition !
We have reporters , columnists and TV talking heads to thank for exposing these outrageous displays .
So apparently the verdict is in : Sen. Barack Obama , too confident to govern .
It all would be quite funny if many people did n’t seem to be inhaling this multimedia stink bomb as if it were fragrant truth .

I ’ve spent a few days on the campaign trail with Obama and know people who ’ve traveled with him for months .
I would n’t argue that portrayals of the candidate as occasionally aloof , or a little professorial , are imagined .
But it ’s a long ways from , in the words of Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank , acting like “ the presumptuous nominee ” whose “ biggest challenger may not be Republican John McCain but rather his own hubris . ”
Milbank , who is often wickedly revealing , last week seemed mostly wicked as he turned benign campaign tableau -- an Obama motorcade , a talk with the Treasury secretary , a “ pep rally ” with congressional Democrats -- into evidence that Obama thinks he ’s already the winner .
Milbank at least leavened his thesis with humor , unlike others piling on the campaign to turn Barack into Slick Barry .

Fox News host Sean Hannity told viewers last week how “ presumptuous ” Obama had become .
Proof :
The candidate told congressional Democrats that the world had been waiting for his hopeful message and that to some he had become a symbol of a “ return to our best traditions . ”
That may not be humble pie , but does n’t even come close to breaking the narcissism barrier .
Do n’t our politicians routinely boast about how essential they are to the republic ?
Then came the stunning revelation that Obama had begun planning for a transition to the White House .
Fox News hostess E.D. Hill -- who dubbed Obama ’s playful knuckle bump with his wife a “ terrorist fist jab ” -- reminded viewers recently that the Democrat was “ not commander in chief just yet , which is why some find his decision to start planning his transition into the White House a bit presumptuous . ”
Advertisement
Hill wondered whether Obama was “ jumping the gun or just covering all the bases ? ”
Never mind that McCain advisors have acknowledged that they too were planning for a White House transition or the fact that history has rewarded those who looked ahead .
Early transition planner Ronald Reagan hit the ground running in 1980 .
Bill Clinton initially struggled after dawdling on White House preparations in 1992 .
Yeah , but what about that talk of remodeling the Lincoln Bedroom ?
Surely that proves Obama thinks he ’s destined for 1600 Pennsylvania Ave .
That whopper grew out of an entirely benign moment last month in Fargo , N.D. A woman asked if Obama would consider remodeling the room with African kente cloth .

“ No , ” Obama said with a laugh .
He mused that when he had toured the White House in 2005 , he thought a copy of the Gettysburg Address would look more appropriate in the historic chamber than the flat - screen TV on the wall .
What about that seal , complete with American eagle , that the Obama faithful trotted out a few weeks back ?
No question it was a cheesy would - be stature - builder -- but it was far short of counting electoral votes before they ’re cast .
The candidate ’s crowning demonstrations of hubris , according to those building a case , came during his extended trip to Iraq , Afghanistan , the Middle East and Europe .
Recall the pundits demanding the freshman Illinois senator prove he could be presidential in the foreign arena ?
So he appeared at ease with world leaders , talked animatedly with beaming American troops and drew huge civilian crowds .
Then the pundits -- who had been taking a round of bashing for supposedly going easy on Obama -- told Obama he needed to beware of appearing too presidential .

Opponents would like to put the Democrat in another can ’t - win box over his “ failure ” to visit wounded troops at a military hospital in Germany .
Obama canceled a visit to the Landstuhl hospital and was accused of being self - centered .
What if he had appeared at the hospital ?
David Kiley reported in BusinessWeek magazine how a Republican operative described plans to attack Obama for -- that ’s right -- using wounded troops as campaign props , if he had gone through with the visit .
These red herrings , a veritable school of ‘em , are amusing for those who put them in perspective .
But how many take the time to do that ?
In 1992 , George H.W. Bush reportedly was surprised to find a price scanner in a grocery store , which “ proved ” he was out of touch with the common man .
In 2004 , John F. Kerry windsurfed and knew how to speak French .
He was pegged as an elitist snob .

McCain launched a television ad last week lumping Obama with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton : just a trio of celebrities handed fame they have n’t really earned .
“ There ’s an interesting line building on Obama that somehow success and intelligence are a handicap , ” said Mark Sawyer , a UCLA political scientist .
“ If he was n’t extraordinary , he would n’t be there .
But then he is extraordinary and it becomes , ‘ He is just too good , too well spoken , too accomplished . ’ ”
So here are a few lessons for would - be commanders in chief :
Inspire attention , but not too much .
Act presidential , but not like you already have the job .
Be confident , but in an obsequious kind of way .

It ’s really not that complicated .

US forces free AP cameraman in Iraq Reuters
Published : Saturday August 23 , 2008
Print This Email This BAGHDAD - U.S. forces freed a cameraman for the Associated Press in Baghdad on Saturday after holding him for three months without charge , the news agency said .
Ahmed Nouri Raziak , 38 , was handed over to representatives of the Associated Press at a U.S. military compound in Baghdad .
He had been detained by U.S. and Iraqi forces at his home in the northern city of Tikrit on June 4 , the agency said in a report from Baghdad .
Raziak 's release comes two days after the military freed an Iraqi cameraman for Reuters , Ali al - Mashhadani , who was held for three weeks without charge after being arrested while renewing his credentials at a U.S. military press office .
As in Mashhadani 's case , the U.S. military said it believed Raziak posed a threat , but concluded after a review that he did not .
It did not elaborate .
" We are glad Ahmed has been released , " said Kathleen Carroll , AP 's executive editor , according to the agency 's report .
" We will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration . "
Last month , AP said it had been told by the military that Raziak would be held for at least six months .
It said the military gave no explanation for the reversal .
The U.S. military say the U.N. mandate authorizing its presence in Iraq allows it to hold anyone it deems a threat indefinitely .
U.S. forces are now holding about 21,000 Iraqis without charge .
In April the U.S. military freed Bilal Hussein , a Pulitzer Prize - winning Iraqi AP photographer who had been held for just over two years .
Today I received an email that asked :
I have recently come across your excellent articles on concurrency and the changes in software writing paradigm .
They make a lot of sense , but I am having trouble translating them to my world of Telecom oriented web services , where practically everything is run through a DBMS .
It seems to me we get everything “ free ” , simply by using an inherently concurrent multi-everything beast such as that :-) .
Could you please share your thoughts on the issue in one of your coming blog entries ?
It seems to me nowadays most complex systems would take advantage of a DBMS , certainly any application that is internet based , telecom oriented , or enterprise level .
Be it in C++ , Java , or PHP and its ilk , using a DBMS – often as a sort of message queue – is one of the best practices that ensures parallelism .
Sure .
At right is a slide I give in talks that summarizes the answer to this question , and I ’ve addressed this and other similar issues in an ACM Queue article .
The problem with taking advantage of multicore / manycore hardware is n’t ( as much ) on the server , it ’s on the client .
When experienced people say things like , “ but the concurrency problem is already solved , we ’ve been building scalable software for years , ” that ’s server or niche - client application people talking .
That kind of laid - back sound bite sure is n’t coming from mainstream client application developers .
Typical Server Workloads
On the server :
Workloads typically already have lots of inherent concurrency ( 000s or 000,000s of incoming requests for web / dbms / etc. operations ) , and it ’s easy to launch independent requests concurrently .
( 000s or 000,000s of incoming requests for web / dbms / etc. operations ) , and it ’s easy to launch independent requests concurrently .
Shared data is typically inside highly structured relational databases where we have decades of experience with automatic concurrency control .
The DBMS itself knows how to optimistically run transactions in parallel and control conflicts by escalating row locks to page locks , index locks to table locks , and so on .
where we have decades of experience with .
The DBMS itself knows how to optimistically run transactions in parallel and control conflicts by escalating row locks to page locks , index locks to table locks , and so on .
The programming model is typically transactions , and all the programmer has to know about is to write “ begin transaction ; /* … read / write whatever stuff you feel the need to , then … */ end transaction ; ” which is about as sweet as it gets .
We already know how to build somewhat scalable server apps .
Sure , it ’s still rocket science and takes expert knowledge to do well .
But we generally know the rocket science , have experts who can implement it with repeatable success , and have regularly scheduled missions to the “ scalable servers ” space station .
With some care , we can say that the “ concurrency problem is already solved ” here .
Typical Client Workloads
The world is very different for typical mainstream client applications ( i.e. , I ’m not talking about Photoshop and a handful of others ) , where :
Workloads do n’t have lots of inherent concurrency .
The user clicks one button , and we have to figure out how to divide the work and recombine it in order to get the answer faster on many cores .
in order to get the answer faster on many cores .
Shared data is typically in unstructured pointer - chasing graphs of objects in shared memory that require explicit concurrency control .
Note that “ unstructured ” does n’t mean there ’s no structure — of course there ’s some — but it ’s a gloriously diverse pile of objects and containers , and more like an organically growing shantytown with unplanned twisty little alleys and passages , than the nice rectangular downtown city street plan of a nice rectangular database table .
that require .

The programming model to protect shared data is to use error - prone explicit locks .
You have to remember which locks protect which data , and not to acquire them in inconsistent and deadlock - prone orders .
We ’re still discovering and productizing the rocket science here .
You could say that the tools like OpenMP that we do have now are still at the V - 2 stage — they have limited applicability , are somewhat fussy , and do n’t always land where you aim them .
But we ’re working on it .
Up - and - coming tools like Threading Building Blocks are like the Mercury and Venera missions , setting out to reach successively higher goals and repeatability … and we ’re starting to see what are perhaps Apollo– and ISS - class missions in the form of PLINQ , the Task Parallel Library , and one for native C++ we ’ll be announcing in October at PDC .
In part , these tools are trying to see how much we can make client workloads look more like server workloads , notably in providing a transaction - oriented programming model .
For example , transactional memory is an area of active research that would let us write “ begin transaction ; /* … read / write whatever memory variables you feel the need to , then … */ end transaction ; ” , and if successful it could eventually replace many or even most existing uses of locks .
We have rightly celebrated some successful ‘ manned ’ flights with client products like Photoshop ( parallel rendering ) and Excel ( parallel recalc ) that scale to a number of cores .
We ’re on the road to , but still working toward , establishing the infrastructure and technology base to enable regularly scheduled commercial flights / shipments of scalable client applications that “ light up ” on multicore / manycore machines .

How long has McCain been playing the POW card ?
In his first run for Congress ( almost 30 years ago ) McCain was attacked by his opponent as being a “ Johnny - come - lately ” because McCain had recently moved to Arizona .
McCain ’s response :
I wish I could have had the luxury , like you , of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of Arizona , but I was doing other things .
As a matter of fact , when I think about it now , the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi .

" NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T WANT IMPEACHMENT "
By : Devvy
August 15 , 2008
ï¿½ 2008 - NewsWithViews.com
Those were the words spoken by Bill O'Reilly on July 30 , 2008 .
I happened to catch the segment while in my hotel room .
According to Bill O'Reilly , " normal people " do n't want President Bush impeached .
Perhaps one must define ' normal ' in Bill 's world ?
( Did n't we do that with the other Bill and the definition what is is ? )
I guess O'Reilly considers phone sex with a subordinate employee normal since it appears he got caught on tape .
In a 2004 column , Jonna Spilbor , wrote on FindLaw : " Mackris 's complaint details O'Reilly 's alleged soliloquies - complete with " ums " and pauses .
It seems likely , for this reason , that Mackris must have somehow recorded O'Reilly 's ramblings . "
Spilbor then says Mackris ( plaintiff ) could have put a stop to it by just hanging up the phone .
True , but , in the end , it is O'Reilly who made the phone calls full of very explicit sex talk .
Had it truly been an extortion attempt , would O'Reilly pay in the $ 6 million dollar range out of his own pocket ( plus big , fat attorney 's fees ) to settle or was he terrified the tapes would be played in court if it went to trial ?
As O'Reilly advises : fair and balanced , you decide .
I would venture to say that most Americans do n't want a president impeached , but the Founding Fathers had good reason to make it part of the U.S. Constitution .
Bush should have been impeached years ago , but the Democrats who care so much about the lives of our active military , have turned a blind eye since taking power .
Not only have they allowed this liar and deceiver to stay in office , they have continued to fund his unconstitutional , immoral invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq for political leverage .
The cowardly Republicans gave him free reign until they lost power in 2006 .
Of course , considering how many members of Congress are making big bux off this unlawful invasion , it is n't surprising they did nothing to hold Bush accountable for his lies and the deaths of 4,140 American soldiers to date .
According to Bill O'Reilly , the millions of average Americans who want Bush impeached are abnormal .
Americans who are Republicans , Democrats , Independents , all races , religions and professions - all abnormal because we have looked at the hard evidence and find Bush guilty .
Impeachment would only be step one ( political ) .
As I wrote in a recent column , Bush , Cheney and Rice should be indicted and charged with murder ( criminal ) .
Vincent Bugliosi has laid out the case and jurisdiction in his book ( see link below ) and in many interviews over the past few months .
Has O'Reilly read the articles of impeachment submitted by Dennis Kucinich ?
I highly doubt it ; even Pelosi has admitted she has n't read them .
I am by no means a fan of Kucinich , but investigating a president for possible impeachment based on a mountain of provbable lies is the job of every member of Congress regardless of party .
Has O'Reilly read The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder by Vincent Bugliosi or watched any of his interviews ?
I 'm betting the answer is no , O'Reilly is too busy guzzling his famous Kool - Aid.
Mr. Moral High Road would rather belittle millions of Americans who would rather not see an impeachment , but who believe in what 's right and even if it 's painful , doing the right thing .
O'Reilly is n't alone dishing out inane remarks .
On August 13 , 2008 , during a segment on the John Edwards affair fiasco , shallow Sean Hannity opened the big hole in his face and made a fool of himself , again .
The equally fact challenged , Alan Colmes , attempted to bring up Juan McCain 's adulterous affair with his current wife while still married to his former wife .
Hannity came to McCain 's defense by saying " it was 30 years ago . "
And , " McCain spent 5 1/ 2 years as a POW . "
Well , that excuses his immoral behavior .
And , " McCain was n't the same person when he came back , there were extenuating circumstances . "
Extenuating circumstances ?
Now , why did n't John Edwards think of ' extenuating circumstances ' for his confession session with Woodruff last week ?
See link 3 below to read a factual account of just how rotten McCain treated his former wife .
Character counts .
McCain did n't have just one affair , he has admitted to many extra marital affairs .
While there was a recent flap over the New York Times piece implying McCain had an ' inappropriate ' relationship with lobbyist , Vicki Iseman , since there was no serious journalism done , it was easy to dismiss .
Knowing his lying , immoral past , I 'm inclined to believe it .
Perhaps the tabloid rag that printed the Edwards " lies " that turned out to be true , will get around to McCain - after they finish with Obama .
Millions of " abnormal " Americans demanded Bill Clinton be impeached .
The fix was in and instead of impeaching him for treason , the foolish Republicans went after him on a sex charge .
We the people would rather not have to go through these difficult proceedings , but the destroyers continue to shove these immoral people down our throats with their rigged elections .
No president is above the law and when a president steps outside the law , he must be held accountable .
As Bugliosi writes :
" How has George Bush reacted to the hell he created in Iraq , to the thousands of lives that have been lost in the war , and to the enormous and endless suffering that the survivors of the victims -- their loved ones -- have had to endure ?
I have a very distinct impression that with the exception of a vagrant tear that may have fallen if he was swept up , in the moment , at an emotional public ceremony for American soldiers who have died in the war , George Bush has n't suffered at all over the monumental suffering , death , and horror he has caused by plunging this nation into the darkness of the Iraq war , probably never losing a wink of sleep over it ...
" Not only because the words he has uttered could never have escaped from his lips if he were suffering , but because no matter how many American soldiers have died on a given day in Iraq ( averaging well over two every day ) , he is always seen with a big smile on his face that same day or the next , and is in good spirits .
How would that be possible if he was suffering ?
For example , the November 3 , 2003 , morning New York Times front - page headline story was that the previous day in Fallouja , Iraq , insurgents " shot down an American helicopter just outside the city in a bold assault that killed 16 soldiers and wounded 20 others .
It was the deadliest attack on American troops since the United States invaded Iraq in March . "
Yet later in that same day when Bush arrived for a fund - raiser in Birmingham , Alabama , he was smiling broadly , and Mike Allen of the Washington Post wrote that " the President appeared to be in a fabulous mood . "
This is merely one of hundreds of such observations made about Bush while the brutal war continued in Iraq . "
Bush can be indicted the day after he leaves office .
While millions of us may be abnormal in Bill O'Reilly 's egomaniacal world , Bush 's crimes are so heinous , he must be punished to the fullest extent under the law .
You would hope there is one decent American left out there in a prosecutor 's office in the 50 states who is getting a case ready against Bush , Cheney and Rice to present to a grand jury .
I have no doubt Bush and his coconspirators would be indicted .
If enough families of soldiers who have died in Iraq demand a grand jury in their state , it will happen .
This is an election year and no District Attorney up for reelection wants pictures of families in anguish splashed on the front page of the local newspaper .
America must have justice for their crimes .

Disinformation Campaign Continues Five Years After the Invasion
Jon Ponder Byon
8/1/2008 , 3:05 pm PT
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
George Bush went out of his way not to use the term " mission accomplished " yesterday when he quietly declared the surge in Iraq to be a success .
Bush 's declaration has been ignored by just about everyone , except for Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , who used it as an opportunity to trot out one of the tired - est of the GOP Big Lies : that Saddam Hussein 's government was behind the 9/11 attacks .
First , here 's a bit of Bush 's non-declaration of success mumbo-jumbo :
BUSH : This has been a month of encouraging news from Iraq .
Violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004 , and we 're now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady .
General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker caution that the progress is still reversible , but they report that there now appears to be a " degree of durability " to the gains we have made .
A significant reason for this sustained progress is the success of the surge .
Another is the increasing capability of the Iraqi forces .
Iraqi forces now have 192 combat battalions in the fight --- and more than 110 of these battalions are taking the lead in combat operations against terrorists and extremists .
A little later , during a press conference held by Lieberman and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) to congratulate Dear Leader on his latest triumph , Lieberman said this :
LIEBERMAN : That ’s why Senator Graham and I are introducing a resolution recognizing the strategic success that the surge has achieved in a central front — the central front of the war on terror against the enemies who attacked America on 9/11/01 , and expressing our thanks to our troops who ’ve made that success possible .
The lie that Saddam was behind the Sept. 11 attacks has been knocked down multiple times , most recently on March 13 , when the Pentagon said there was no “ no direct link between late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and the Al - Qaeda network . "

It is beyond outrageous that they 're still out there selling this disinformation five years after the invasion .
The Oklahoma Publishing Co. and a sportswriter Monday sued a Nebraska football fan who admitted creating a fake Internet article about two University of Oklahoma quarterbacks .
The publishing company is a leading provider of news and information in Oklahoma through its newspaper , The Oklahoman , and Web site , NewsOK .
Com .
OPUBCO and sportswriter Jake Trotter sued James W. Conradt , the alleged perpetrator of the hoax , in federal court in Oklahoma City .
The 10 - count civil lawsuit accuses Conradt of libel , copyright violations and trademark infringements .
Conradt published a " defamatory ” article on the Internet July 9 that falsely stated University of Oklahoma quarterbacks Sam Bradford and Landry Jones had been arrested for intent to distribute cocaine , the lawsuit alleges .
Conradt allegedly put a link to the article on his Web site , www.darthhusker.com , and on an online sports message board .
The lawsuit claims Conradt used Oklahoman staff writer Jake Trotter 's byline and various OPUBCO trademarks to give the bogus Internet article the appearance of legitimacy .
Conradt placed Trotter in a false light and damaged his reputation and occupation by publishing the story , the lawsuit alleges .
The lawsuit seeks unspecified financial damages .
The lawsuit also asks a federal judge to order Conradt not to misuse OPUBCO trademarks in the future , to require Conradt to prepare a written report stating how he will comply with that order , and to order Conradt to publish " corrective advertising ” to compensate for the harm he allegedly caused .
Conradt , 36 , is a Nebraska fan who works as a computing services manager in the information technology department at the University of Texas .
He could not be reached for comment Monday evening .
Last week , Conradt admitted to Oklahoman columnist Berry Tramel in a telephone interview that Conradt was responsible for the hoax .
He said he was n't thinking .
" I want to express my deepest apologies to the families , ” Conradt said last Wednesday .
" I did n't want to hurt anyone . ”
The lawsuit claims Conradt was " well aware of the dangers that can be caused by posting harmful attacks anonymously on the Internet . ”
It points to a Jan. 10 , 2005 article in the Lincoln Journal Star , a Nebraska newspaper , in which Conradt was quoted discussing how easily people can post untrue rumors on Internet message boards .
" I think anonymity brings out the worst in people , ” Conradt was quoted as saying .
" There are no consequences for saying what you say .
I think that 's probably where the whole concept of flaming comes from .
They probably did n't have that in the old days around the coffee pot at work , the profanity - laced , ultra- negative outbursts . ”
Raina reigns against Murali and Mendis
Happy with runs flowing from his blade , India 's young middle order batsman Suresh Raina says he is particularly satisfied that he 's been able to read Sri Lanka 's enigmatic spin twins Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis .
Raina 's invaluable knock of 76 in the fourth One Day International on Wednesday not only earned him the Man of the Match award but also helped India take an unassailable 3 - 1 lead in the five - match series .

He was 34 years old when the D.C. city council took his rights away .
Today , as a senior citizen , he got them back .
Sort of .
Dick A. Heller , a security guard whose lawsuit resulted in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling favoring gun-ownership rights , was given his handgun registration certificate at D.C. police headquarters this morning .
He applied for it last month , a few weeks after the June 26 court ruling , and had been waiting for police to complete a background check .
Why “ sort of ” ?
Because , as you ’ll recall , his application to register another gun was rejected thanks to D.C. ’s bad faith attempt to define as a “ machine gun ” any weapon that loads from the bottom .
So it ’s back to court he ’s going .
Maybe he ’ll get to register his semi-automatic before he turns 100 .
Here ’s video of him from last month talking about the rejected application .

' Zionism : The Real Enemy of the Jews '— an Interview With Alan Hart
Zionism : The Real Enemy of the Jews .
Volume 2 . By Alan Hart. 452 pages .
World Focus Publishing .
£ 14.99 .
When Alan Hart started his journalism career in Africa at the age of 18 , joining ITN television , his editor summed up what his job ought to be : " Keep democracy alive . "
Hart made it his life 's mission .
The profession took him around the world as a foreign correspondent , with a stop in Vietnam where he learned that " you can not defeat an idea with bullets and bombs . "
The Middle East was another destination for him , and one that had even more impact on his life .
The British reporter was probably the only correspondent to have enjoyed on the professional level access to , and on the human level friendship with , the top leaders of both the sides of the Arab - Israeli conflict , including Yasser Arafat and Golda Meir .
It was not without reason that , in 1980 , he was chosen by United Nations senior leaders to lead a secret peace initiative between Shimon Peres and Arafat , an initiative that , a decade later , became the Oslo process .
But behind the scenes , Hart discovered a bitter truth : that the two - state settlement was " long dead . "
Because the gentile Hart believes that , generally speaking , " the Jews are the intellectual elite of the Western civilization , and the Palestinians the intellectual elite of the Arab world , " his commitment is to find an alternative in order for the two people to work in partnership .
In Zionism : The Real Enemy of the Jews , the 65 - year - old Hart reveals his fascinating , at times shocking , experiences and conversations with top leaders in the most volatile region of the world .
He puts these in their historical context , and , through a logical demonstration , offers an alternative to the conventional peace process , perhaps a more realistic one .
***
Throughout your career , you seem to have lost hope in the " two - state settlement . "
" It is there in theory ; in fact it is long dead , " you say .
What makes you so confidently say so ?
Zionism : The Real Enemy of the Jews .
Volume 1 . By Alan Hart. 596 pages .
World Focus Publishing .
£ 19.99 .
In 1980 I found myself engaged in a secret exploratory dialogue between Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres .
The background situation was the following : Towards the end of 1979 , Arafat sent a secret letter to the [ United Nations ]
Security Council saying he was prepared to accept resolution 242 , that is , to do peace with Israel beyond the 1967 border .
Andy Young [ United States ambassador to the United Nations ] thought the letter was the biggest breakthrough since 1948 , and [ President ]
Carter agreed with him on the necessity to seize the opportunity .
But while he tried to bring the Palestine Liberation Organization ( P.L.O. ) into the peace process , Israel 's then [ Prime Minister ] Menachim Begin got the Zionist lobby in America to move against Carter , who was punished by having to fire Andy Young .
It was then suggested to me by very senior people of the U.N. , who were not unconnected from Carter , that I should try my hand at some unofficial diplomacy because it was generally known in the world that I had good access to both Arab and Israeli leaders as a reporter for the BBC's Panorama program , and that on the human level I enjoyed friendship with them .
In 1980 , Israel was 19 months from its elections , which the whole world ( including Carter ) , hoped Menachim Begin would lose .
The game plan was : if I can persuade first Peres and then Arafat to let me be the middleman between them , we would use these months to try and create a position so that when Peres became prime minister , we could go public .
I went to Tel Aviv , met with Shimon Peres behind closed doors , and said to him : " If Arafat is willing , would you agree to let me lead the dialogue ? "
Peres agreed , and then he made this statement : " It 's already too late . "
He meant too late for peace on any terms Arafat could accept .
When I asked for the reason , the following was his reply :
" Every day that passes sees new bricks on new settlements .
Begin knows exactly what he 's doing .
He 's creating the conditions for a Jewish civil war .
He knows that no Israeli leader is going down in history as the one who gave the order to the Jewish army to shoot Jews out of the West Bank … I 'm not . "
My point is : if it was too late in 1980 — when there were only 70,000 illegal settlers in the occupied territories — how much more too late is it today when they count half a million ?
And that number is growing .
There is absolutely no way that any Israeli P.M. ever goes to confront the settlers .
Some commentators say all the Israeli government has to do is pull out their troops from the Occupied Palestinian Territories , and the settlers would simply follow .
Probably half the settlers could be bought out to have a life in Tel Aviv or somewhere else , but probably half is still a hell of a lot who would fight .
I think the two - state solution has long been killed by Israel 's ongoing colonization .
What do you think is the responsibility of the international community on this issue ?
I think the real evil in this story is not even Zionism , but rather the governments of the major powers — in particular the U.S. , the U.K. , and France .
The moment they could have put a stop on the trip to disaster was after the 1967 war .
They could and should have said : " According to Resolution 242 , not only must Israel go out , but furthermore we would not allow it to build any settlements to colonize this newly - occupied land ( which Israel does in defiance of international law ) — and if Israel does we should sanction it . "
So what do you believe are the options now ?
In my view there are only two :
1 . The one - state solution in which Zionism loses .
It would be a secular state in which Palestinians and Jews who live there now become equal citizens .
It would be end of Zionism , but it would mean peace with real security for Jews .
2 . The doomsday for the Palestinians .
Israel 's policy is currently to create conditions which make life hell for the Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza in the hope that they would just surrender .
I think Israeli leaders still believe they can do that , but they are wrong .
What happens if the Zionist leaders come to the conclusion that they cannot break the will of the Palestinians ?
I think then Zionists will create the pretext for a final round of ethnic cleansing to drive the Palestinians out of the West Bank and Gaza .
If that happens , there will be a Zionist holocaust .
The West Bank will run in blood and it will be mostly Palestinian blood .
That , I personally believe , is the road we are on .
Do you believe the countdown to the doomsday can be stopped ?
The only power on earth that can confront Zionism is America .
The problem is that requiring from Zionism to make peace on terms Palestinians could accept , would mean standing up to Israel and threatening with the use of sanction .
No American president is ever going to do that unless he knows that the majority of America 's Jews would support it , i.e. , unless pushed to do so by an informed public opinion .
The problem is that the public opinion is too uninformed to do so .
There is only one name of the game to make democracy work : information and education .
Most citizens throughout the Judeo - Christian world are totally ignorant about the truth of history .
I 'm a classic example .
I came out of my mother 's womb conditioned by Zionism 's version of history .
It took me 12 to 15 years of being an ITN TV reporter to actually get to the other side of the story .
I can understand how people who did n't have my exposure to it do n't challenge .
There is talk of the " new anti-Semitism " defined as criticism of Israel 's policy that , whether intentionally or unintentionally , has the effect of promoting prejudice against all Jews .
What do you suggest to escape that dilemma ?
If not told with context and sensitivity , the truth about Israel might provoke anti-Semitism .
That 's why I say the key is to explain the difference between Judaism and Zionism .
A large part of Zionists ' success to date is that it has managed to conflate the two .
In fact , they are total opposites .
Like Christianity and Islam , Judaism has at its core a set of moral values and ethical principles .
To the extent that they look to Jerusalem as the centre of their religion , all religious Jews could ( and most do ) regard themselves as spiritual Zionists .
But political Zionism ( and that 's what I refer to in the title of my book ) is something else .
It is a sectarian , colonialist ideology which created a state for some Jews in the Arab heartland mainly by terrorism and ethnic cleansing .
By so doing , it made a mockery of Judaism 's moral values and ethical principles .
Knowing this difference makes two things possible :
One is why it is perfectly possible to be passionately anti-Zionist ( opposed to Zionism 's colonial enterprise ) without being anti-Semitic .
The other is why it is wrong to blame all Jews for the crimes of the relative few — hardest core political Zionists in Israel , which is a Zionist , not a Jewish state .
Clearing nations to this difference is my fight , and I gave five years of my life to research and write this book , drawing off my experiences and conversations with leaders .
But it 's not only the gentile Alan who says Zionism is a threat to Judaism .
One of my dear Jewish friends is Hajo Meyer , a Holocaust survivor , whose latest book is entitled " The End of Judaism . "
The former bishop of Jerusalem , Riah el - Assal , whom I recently interviewed , made this point : Despite everything Zionism has done to the Palestinians , it 's actually been more disastrous for Judaism , because it is n't actually land that has enabled Jews to survive , but rather their moral principles .
It seems Jews are overwhelmingly silent about Israel 's policy toward the Palestinians .
Do mainstream Jews actually support Zionism ?
The silence of the Jews is another obstacle .
Throughout history , they have generally been liberal , except on this issue .
My best friend in the world after my wife is my Jewish accountant .
I 've known him for 40 years , and I even once took him to Israel to meet Golda Meir as a way of saying " thank you " to him .
He does n't like what Israel has done , but he wo n't … read … my … book .
[ Hart paused after each word to convey despair . ]
He does n't want to know the truth of history .
I once said to him : " Like 99 percent of all Jews in the world , you believe that when Israel went to war in 1967 , it was either because the Arabs attacked first or because they were going to attack .
If I can convince you , using only Israeli sources , that this is a complete fabrication , do you believe me ? "
He paused and said : " If what I believe about that war is not true , then everything collapses . "
Ilan Pappe ( an Israeli revisionist historian ) makes this point : Israel is not entirely Zionist .
There are a lot of Jews in Israel who would make peace on almost any terms Palestinians would accept .
The sad thing is that Israelis have been as much conditioned by Zionist propaganda as the rest of the world .
There is another reason why people like my Jewish accountant are frightened to speak out about Zionism : deep down among every Jew there is a fear of Holocaust II .
That 's understandable .
In my book I call for a new Covenant — not between Jews and their God , but between Jews and the Gentiles .
In it , Gentiles would commit once and for all to slaying the monster of anti-Semitism .
The Jews would commit to dealing with the monster of Zionism .
On 1 January this year Torsten Trey , chief executive director of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting , sent a letter to , among others , Steven Spielberg and George W Bush .
He wrote : ' It is reasonable to say that in China organs are removed from executed prisoners as well as from living , non-consenting donors , in particular from practitioners of the peaceful meditation movement Falun Gong .
As medical doctors , we are extremely concerned about these practices . '
On Tuesday , at a meeting in London , European Parliament vice - president Edward McMillan - Scott expanded on those concerns .
' They are hosting a sporting event intended to promote peace and at the same time people are being killed for their organs , ' said Trey .
' It is outrageous .
Once you are a prisoner of conscience you are outlawed and lose any rights .
You are just a body mass . '
Later that evening Spielberg resigned as artistic director for the Beijing Olympics .
There was no connection between the two events - Spielberg , after all , cited China 's failure to put pressure on Sudan to ease the humanitarian crisis in Darfur , not transplant trading , as the reason for his decision - other than that the staging of the Olympics in Beijing means that China will be examined more closely and more critically than ever before .
There are plenty of areas of concern .
Also speaking on Tuesday was Annie Yang .
' On 1 March 2005 , without any legal procedure , I was arrested at home and sentenced to two years in a Chinese labour camp , ' she said .
This was for being a practitioner of Falun Gong , an organisation that is part Taoist , part Buddhist , and that flourished in the wake of communism before being banned as ' an evil cult ' in 1999 .
In an effort to make Yang renounce her beliefs , she was forced to survive on 500 ml of water a day and half a slice of Chinese bread .
She was also tortured .
' They made you sit with your knees closed , your feet closed , your back very straight and your hands on your knees for 20 hours without closing your eyes .
No one dared look at me .
Only this one woman waved at me and she has now been tortured to death . '
Yang , an antiques dealer , recanted and four months later was asked by the authorities if she wanted to be a spy in London .
She declined the offer .
Anne Holmes , from the Free Tibet campaign , said that ' silence is the cost of doing business in China ' .
Silence , in particular , about what is happening in Tibet .
' There are some monks who must be protected and others who are invisible , ' she said , comparing the country to Burma .
China 's influence is so great over Tibet and around the world , she says , that ' Belgium no longer welcomes the Dalai Lama ' .
China , in contrast , welcomes transplant tourists - it is alleged that 40,000 unexplained operations have been conducted in recent years .
Also present on Tuesday was Professor Tom Treasure , a noted heart - transplant surgeon , who wrote an essay last year for the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine entitled ' The Falun Gong , organ transplantation , the holocaust and ourselves ' .
In this he noted that waiting times for such operations in China were a mere one to two weeks and the cost under a tenth of what is charged in the United States .
He also drew attention to the fact that , on being incarcerated , members of Falun Gong are blood - tested .
This is unlikely to be for their own good , but is most helpful if you are looking for a blood - group match for organ donation .
As McMillan - Scott pointed out : ' What makes it even more ghoulish is that the Falun Gong are regarded as good quarry because they neither smoke nor drink . '
Transplanting the organs of executed criminals is one thing , but using the organs of the living one hoped belonged in science fiction .
McMillan - Scott has long campaigned against human - rights abuses in China .
He last visited the country in May 2006 and ' all the reformists I had contact with have been arrested , and at least three of them tortured ' .
Last August he talked from the same meeting room in which we were sitting to eco-dissident Hu Jia in Beijing by live phone link .
On 29 January Hu Jia was convicted of subversion .
' There are 1.3 billion Chinese , most of whom are desperately unhappy living under a corrupt , arbitrary and paranoid regime which is dangerous to them , ' he says .
' It is a terror state . '
Particularly if you are a practitioner of Falun Gong .
' They have been subjected to systematic repression , ' says McMillan - Scott .
' Falun Gong are to the Chinese what the Jews were to the Nazis .
And that 's an understatement . '
Perhaps .
One way in which they are being treated worse is that they are prohibited from competing in the Games .
Hitler , in contrast , allowed one half - Jewish fencer to represent Germany and excluded the rest .
Helene Mayer won silver in the individual foil .
Comparisons with Berlin have seen Beijing labelled the Genocide Games .
This term is somewhat melodramatic , although it does remind one of Chairman Mao 's massacre of 70 million of his citizens during the Cultural Revolution .
It is a reminder that worse things happen behind closed doors than partially open ones and , grim and nasty as life is in China , it may be less grim and nasty than it was .
In part , this is because of the Olympic Games .
Playing host means you are open to scrutiny and Tibet , Darfur and transplant tourism are subjects up for discussion .
Limited aims may be achievable and last year the number of transplants decreased considerably following the passage of the Human Organ Transportation Act .
There is , however , only limited leverage that can be exerted because the total boycott the admirable McMillan - Scott demands is just not going to happen .
This is because the Olympic Games , like US vice - president Dick Cheney , are more about commerce than politics .
The defining modern Games , after all , came in 1996 when they shared a home with Coca - Cola .
Once the sponsors take over , they become indelibly corporate .
Spielberg and a few others excepted , the capitalist West will flock to Beijing to do what it always does - shift product .

And I worked on the Winifred block .
And I talked with SubPress and with Jun .

And I 'm packing up what 's left of my collection of Alabama Late Cretaceous fossil to donate to McWane .
It 's mostly shark , fish , and mollusks .

U.S. Government Policy for Seizing Laptops at Borders
Amazing .
The U.S. government has published its policy : they can take your laptop anywhere they want , for as long as they want , and share the information with anyone they want :
Federal agents may take a traveler ’s laptop or other electronic device to an off - site location for an unspecified period of time without any suspicion of wrongdoing , as part of border search policies the Department of Homeland Security recently disclosed .
Also , officials may share copies of the laptop ’s contents with other agencies and private entities for language translation , data decryption , or other reasons , according to the policies , dated July 16 and issued by two DHS agencies , US Customs and Border Protection and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement . [… ]
DHS officials said that the newly disclosed policies — which apply to anyone entering the country , including US citizens — are reasonable and necessary to prevent terrorism . [ … ]
The policies cover ‘ any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form , ’ including hard drives , flash drives , cell phones , iPods , pagers , beepers , and video and audio tapes .
They also cover ‘ all papers and other written documentation , ’ including books , pamphlets and ‘ written materials commonly referred to as “ pocket trash … ”
It ’s not the policy that ’s amazing ; it ’s the fact that the government has actually made it public .
Here ’s the actual policy .

On 12 July , the Times devoted two pages to Afghanistan .
It was mostly a complaint about the heat .
The reporter , Magnus Linklater , described in detail his discomfort and how he had needed to be sprayed with iced water .
He also described the " high drama " and " meticulously practised routine " of evacuating another overheated journalist .
For her US Marine rescuers , wrote Linklater , " saving a life took precedence over [ their ] security " .
Alongside this was a report whose final paragraph offered the only mention that " 47 civilians , most of them women and children , were killed when a US aircraft bombed a wedding party in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday " .
Slaughters on this scale are common , and mostly unknown to the British public .
I interviewed a woman who had lost eight members of her family , including six children .
A 500lb US Mk82 bomb was dropped on her mud , stone and straw house .
There was no " enemy " nearby .
I interviewed a headmaster whose house disappeared in a fireball caused by another " precision " bomb .
Inside were nine people - his wife , his four sons , his brother and his wife , and his sister and her husband .
Neither of these mass murders was news .
As Harold Pinter wrote of such crimes : " Nothing ever happened .
Even while it was happening it was n't happening .
It did n't matter .
It was of no interest . "
A total of 64 civilians were bombed to death while the Times man was discomforted .
Most were guests at a wedding party .
Wedding parties are a " coalition " speciality .
At least four of them have been obliterated - at Mazar and in Khost , Uruzgan and Nangarhar provinces .
Many of the details , including the names of victims , have been compiled by a New Hampshire professor , Marc Herold , whose Afghan Victim Memorial Project is a meticulous work of journalism that shames those who are paid to keep the record straight and report almost everything about the Afghan War through the public relations facilities of the British and American military .
The US and its allies are dropping record numbers of bombs on Afghanistan .
This is not news .
In the first half of this year , 1,853 bombs were dropped : more than all the bombs of 2006 and most of 2007 .
" The most frequently used bombs , " the Air Force Times reports , " are the 500lb and 2,000 lb satellite - guided . . . "
Without this one - sided onslaught , the resurgence of the Taliban , it is clear , might not have happened .
Even Hamid Karzai , America 's and Britain 's puppet , has said so .
The presence and the aggression of foreigners have all but united a resistance that now includes former warlords once on the CIA 's payroll .
The scandal of this would be headline news , were it not for what George W Bush 's former spokesman Scott McClellan has called " complicit enablers " - journalists who serve as little more than official amplifiers .
Having declared Afghanistan a " good war " , the complicit enablers are now anointing Barack Obama as he tours the bloodfests in Afghanistan and Iraq .
What they never say is that Obama is a bomber .
In the New York Times on 14 July , in an article spun to appear as if he is ending the war in Iraq , Obama demanded more war in Afghan istan and , in effect , an invasion of Pakistan .
He wants more combat troops , more helicopters , more bombs .
Bush may be on his way out , but the Republicans have built an ideological machine that transcends the loss of electoral power - because their collaborators are , as the American writer Mike Whitney put it succinctly , " bait - and - switch " Democrats , of whom Obama is the prince .
Those who write of Obama that " when it comes to international affairs , he will be a huge improvement on Bush " demonstrate the same wilful naivety that backed the bait - and - switch of Bill Clinton - and Tony Blair .
Of Blair , wrote the late Hugo Young in 1997 , " ideology has surrendered entirely to ' values ' . . . there are no sacred cows [ and ] no fossilised limits to the ground over which the mind might range in search of a better Britain . . . "
Eleven years and five wars later , at least a million people lie dead .
Barack Obama is the American Blair .
That he is a smooth operator and a black man is irrelevant .
He is of an enduring , rampant system whose drum majors and cheer squads never see , or want to see , the consequences of 500 lb bombs dropped unerringly on mud , stone and straw houses .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Two of every five South African students say they have been raped , according to a study published on Tuesday suggesting sexual abuse of boys is endemic in the country ’s schools .
The survey published in BioMed Central ’s International Journal for Equity in Health showed that adult women most frequently assaulted the boys , followed closely by other schoolchildren .
“ This study uncovers endemic sexual abuse of male children that was suspected but hitherto only poorly documented , ” Neil Andersson and Ari Ho-Foster of The Centre for Tropical Disease Research in Johannesburg wrote .
The findings underscore the need to raise awareness about the rape of male children and they urged further efforts to prevent sexual violence in South Africa , the researchers said .
This is especially important because South Africa already has one of the highest rape rates in the world , and other studies have shown that people who sexually abuse children were often the target of such violence when young , they added .
Another problem is that the prevalence of rape is hampering efforts to combat AIDS in a country at the epicenter of the global pandemic .
“ There is increasing recognition of links between sexual abuse and high - risk attitudes to sexual violence and HIV risk , ” the researchers wrote .
“ Sexually abused children are also more likely to engage in HIV high - risk behavior . ”
The survey carried out in 1,200 schools across the country asked 127,000 boys aged between 10 and 19 if they had ever been sexually abused and , if so , by whom .
Forty - four percent of the 18 - year - olds said they had been forced to have sex in their lives and half reported consensual sex .
About a third said they had been abused by males , 41 percent by females and 27 percent said they had been raped by both males and females .
The study did not look at the number of girls who were raped .
Abuse by fellow males was more common in rural areas while attacks by women happened mainly in cities , the study found .
There was also a big disparity between provinces with Limpopo -- among the poorest -- showing the highest abuse rates and Western Cape the lowest .
This type of study based entirely on the response of participants has limitations because there are no ways to verify whether people exaggerate or withhold information , the researchers acknowledged .
Even so , the researchers say they constructed their anonymous survey to cut down on these pitfalls and the findings may actually underestimate the sexual violence .
“ We think it is an underestimate for boys because there is no merit for them to report that they have been sexually abused , ” Andersson said in a telephone interview .

First Solar Power Station in Israel is Up and Running
August 28th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
In the department of “ How has this not already happened ? ” , Haaretz reports that Israel ’s first solar power station is now functioning .
The 50 kW solar array is on a farm in the Negev , and will be hooked up to the national power grid in two weeks .
The reason for the long wait ?
Israel ’s state solar incentives just kicked in on July 1st .
They allow home and industrial customers to receive NIS 2.01 per kWh for electricity produced .
Household power plants are limited to 15 kW , and business plants are limited to 50 kW .
The new solar station , built by Moshe Tenne , consists of thin - film solar panels on a cowshed roof and an array of multicrystal silicon solar cells that are spread out over the farmland .
Tenne also plans to build small wind turbines on his property even though wind power incentives are n’t yet in effect .
Hopefully , more homes and businesses will follow Tenne ’s lead — considering Israel ’s abundant sunshine , it would be a shame if they do n’t .

Strong indicators that 2014 will be a bad year for Darwinism and atheism
YUMA - The U.S. Border Patrol says they 've seized 940 pounds of marijuana after an agent monitoring a camera near Yuma spotted men emerging from a drainage pipe .
The agent called in a helicopter and other agents , who tracked footprints from the Colorado River to the pipe .
They found 26 bundles of pot inside the pipe late Wednesday .
The smugglers apparently escaped back to Mexico .
MILE 223 : EVANSVILLE , IND .
The luck of Angel Mounds , where 1,000 people lived between 1050 and 1400 , is that it escaped extreme looting .
Some of the millions of artifacts that have been uncovered there  including graceful reddish - brown painted pottery and delicate earrings and nose rings made of bone  are on display in the large museum .
I was fascinated by a replica of Kneeling Man , an eight - inch - tall figurine carved in the translucent yellow mineral fluorite , unearthed from the site ’s temple mound .
Outside , as you walk the area and gaze at the large mounds , beneath your feet are the buried remains of a town that thrived for about 400 years .
MILE 336 : LOUISVILLE
Back on I - 164 north and then I - 64 east , drive to another encounter with the wide , winding Ohio , over which canoes carried cargo from settlement to settlement for hundreds , perhaps thousands of years before Europeans arrived .
See it up close at Louisville Waterfront Park .
From I - 64 , take the Ninth Street exit and turn left on Market Street .
Make another left on Brook Street , which dead - ends at Witherspoon Street and the park .
You ’ll find walking paths , an adventure playground for children and the Belle of Louisville , the oldest operating steamboat in the nation , which offers a two - hour sightseeing tour .
Eat aboard the boat or on land ; Joe ’s Crab Shack and Tumbleweeds , a Mexican Restaurant , are both in the park .
MILE 436 : CINCINNATI
Drive another 90 minutes to Cincinnati and find your way to the charming Clifton Gaslight District in the northwest part of the city , a few miles off I - 75 south ( exit at Hopple Street ) .
A good stop for the night is the Clifton House , a 1900 mansion a few blocks ’ walk from lively Ludlow Street with its coffeehouses , restaurants and bars .
Cincinnati , like St. Louis , had ancient earthworks that were described in the 19th century , but as in St. Louis , the mounds were flattened long before anyone thought to explore their meaning .
When the sun has risen again , set out to the east on Route 32 ( take Exit 63B from Cincinnati ’s beltway , I - 275 ) .
Near the tiny town of Peebles , Ohio , turn northwest on State Route 73 .
MILE 506 : SERPENT MOUND
This effigy mound , an enormous earthen sculpture of a snake , is nothing short of astonishing .
Walking the footpath that circumnavigates the undulating body or gazing down from the 35 - foot platform , it ’s hard to wrap your head around this ancient accomplishment .
The serpent measures 1,348 feet long , 10 to 15 feet wide and roughly 3 feet high .
It is the largest earthen effigy in North America , constructed around 1070 .
“ It ’s not an art project built by a bunch of bored people , ” said Keith Bengtson , the site manager .
“ It has a very specific design and intent . ”
The serpent was documented by surveyors in the mid-19th century , but it was not until the late 1980s that scholars realized its astronomical purpose : its head and coils are aligned to mark the solstices and equinoxes .
During the summer solstice , the setting sun descends in perfect alignment with the snake ’s head .
Hundreds of visitors now come from around the world each year to watch .
Spend some time in the Serpent Mound Museum and then return to Route 73 and continue east .
Turn north on Route 41 and drive to Chillicothe , Ohio .
MILE 556 : MOUND CITY
Walking from the visitors center at the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park to the Mound City Group ’s 2,000 - year - old cemetery is magically disorienting .
A lush green field of huge curvilinear mounds of varying shapes and sizes conveys the sense of stepping into a page from a high school geometry textbook .
In all , 23 mounds are enclosed by a low earthen wall at this site  one of five in this sprawling park .
The artifacts found in the mounds help tell the story of the people buried there .
The Hopewell must have been traders  they had materials like obsidian from the area of Yellowstone National Park , shells from the Atlantic Ocean and copper from near the Great Lakes .
Gifted artisans made beautiful creations like copper parrots , human hand shapes cut from sheets of mica and whimsical clay effigy pipes in the shapes of woodland creatures .
“ I hope visitors would take away with them that 2,000 years ago there were people with high levels of artistry and complex spiritual cosmology that lived here , ” said Bruce Lombardo , a park ranger .
“ You do n’t have to go to Stonehenge or the pyramids of Egypt . "
The Midwest has its own ancient mysteries .

Fuel injection arrived on two wheels with the release of Honda ’s CX500 Turbo a quarter of a century ago , and Honda has been developing smarter and more intricate computer controlled fuel injection systems for its two wheelers ever since .
These days its advanced PGM - FI ( Programmed Fuel Injection ) technology is fitted across the range from 50 cc scooters through its MotoGP race machinery , offering broader and smoother power , better throttle response and vastly reduced fuel consumption and emissions .
A prototype being quietly shown around Asia suggests that it might also lead to some lightning fast scooters in the near future .
The Thai motorcycle market sells more motorcycles every year than the American market – despite a massive downturn in sales a few years back , the market will still top 1.65 million units this year and 1.15 million of them will be Hondas .
Honda rules the roost in Thailand and is promoting its technological edge heavily , particularly the benefits of its ever developing PGM - FI : fuel economy , lower exhaust emissions and better engine performance .
A few weeks back , it introduced the new fuel injected CZ - i 110 alon with a three - year goal to become “ the number one most admired company that is at the forefront of the environmental issue . ”
Part and parcel of achieving this aim is to a policy that all motorcycles produced and sold in Thailand will be equipped with PGM - FI technology .
PGM - FI is controlled by an electronic control unit called ‘ the Engine Control Unit ’ ( ECU ) that works together with other advanced engine technologies such as fuel injection , fuel pump , throttle body featuring Idle Air Control Valve ( I.A.C.V. ) , Offset , Heaterless Oxygen Sensor and honeycomb shaped Catalyzer with over 300 cells .
As the flagship new product , 110 cc 4 - stroke CZ - i certainly appears to have benefited from the new system , and when tested under strict ECE 40 conditions , delivers staggering the fuel economy figure of 57 km / liter ( that ’s 161 miles per imperial gallon ) , an 18 % fuel saving over the previous 100 cc model .
Does metering out the fuel in a miserly fashion lead to a gutless engine though ?
Not at all , with a significant increase in torque across the range and an improvement in peak torque of 25 % .
All that , and it can even run E20 fuel ( a 20 percent ethanol blend ) .
Emissions wise , it comes in at one fifth of Level 5 Standards and half Level 6 .
In order to overcome any fears of overly complex technology in this emerging market , the PGM - FI system and all its components ( fuel injection , accelerating pump , ECU , throttle body , throttle position sensor , fuel vapor temperature sensor and O2 sensor ) are being sold with a five year or 50,000 km warranty and Honda has set up nearly 1500 service centers and just short of 6000 repair & maintenance centers to ensure PGM - FI technology is fully supported .
But what happens when Honda ’s patented PGM - FI technology is applied with a view to developing horsepower ?
Apparently Honda Japan has been doing just that and we came across the pictured prototype recently at a shopping centre in rural Thailand .
Based on the new 110 cc 4 - stroke CZ - I , the unnamed machine apparently came straight out of Honda R&D and has a top speed approaching 100 mph and all the goodies – upside down forks , big disks , a monoshock rear end , carbon fibre bodywork and showstopping good looks .
No details whatsoever were available to this humble farang , no doubt partially due to my pidgeon
Thai and overly inquisitive nature – but we managed to confirm that it did come out of Honda Japan , and it no doubt looks the Bees Knees to Thailand ’s abundance of red- blooded males .
To me , it meant a whole lot more .
I was one of the journalists who first sampled Honda ’s CX500 Turbo in Japan in 1982 , pushing the bike around Honda ’s Tochigi testing track at ballistic speeds during the day and debating over much saki during the evening whether turbocharging and fuel injection would ever be applicable to everyday motorcycles .
We knew they ’d taken us to a high speed , heavily banked test circuit because of the CX500 Turbo ’s somewhat parlous throttle response , and there were some serious doubters amongst the international contingent of motorcycle testers .
We 've come a long way since then .

[ From a speech delivered by Senator Taft at the Gettysburg National Cemetery 1946 . ]
There is one step now proposed , supported by government propaganda , which seems to me to strike at the very basis of freedom .
It is the proposal that we establish compulsory military training in time of peace .
The power to take a boy from his home and subject him to complete government discipline is the most serious limitation on freedom that can be imagined .
Many who have accepted the idea favor a similar government - controlled training for all girls .
There is no doubt that the government , and particularly the War and Navy departments , are straining every nerve to secure the enactment of this legislation .
Secret meetings are being held in the Pentagon Building and elsewhere .
Recently the chief executive officers of some forty or more women 's organizations were invited there , and it is said they were addressed by the Secretary of War , the Secretary of the Navy , the Under Secretary of State , General Marshall , Admiral King , and other high - ranking officers .
The ladies were requested not to disclose the substance of the speeches made or identify the War Department or its officials with the sponsorship of the plan …
Government propaganda is bad enough when it is open , but it is inexcusable when secret .
We may expect a flood of open propaganda after the ground has been prepared , and everyone who is opposed to the plan will be pictured as for war and for unpreparedness .
We have fought this war to preserve our institutions , not to change them .
We have fought it to permit us to work out our problems here at home on a peaceful foundation , not on a foundation dominated by military preparations for another war .
The question of the best form of military organization should not be an emotional problem .
It should be dealt with by argument and not by propaganda .
But the methods being used threaten the freedom of this country , for if they are successful they can be used to fasten upon us every kind of regulation , price control for business , wage control for labor , production control for farmers … .
Military conscription is essentially totalitarian .
It has been established for the most part in totalitarian countries and their dictators led by Napoleon and Bismarck .
It has heretofore been established by aggressor countries .
It is said it would ensure peace by emphasizing the tremendous military potential of this country .
Surely we have emphasized that enough in this war .
No one can doubt it .
On the contrary , if we establish conscription every other nation in the world will feel obliged to do the same .
It would set up militarism on a high pedestal throughout the world as the goal of all the world .
Militarism has always led to war and not peace .
Conscription was no insurance of victory in France , in Germany , or in Italy .
The countries with military conscription found that it was only an incident and not the determining factor in defense or in victory .
Military training by conscription means the complete regimentation of the individual at his most formative period for a period of twelve months .
If we admit that in peacetime we can deprive a man of all liberty and voice and freedom of action , if we can take him from his family and his home , then we can do the same with labor , we can order the farmer to produce and we can take over any business .
If we can draft men , it is difficult to find an argument against drafting capital .
Those who enthusiastically orate of returning to free enterprise and at the same time advocate peacetime conscription are blind to the implications of this policy .
They are utterly inconsistent in their position .
Because of its psychological effect on every citizen , because it is the most extreme form of compulsion , military conscription will be more the test of our whole philosophy than any other policy .
Some say it is unconstitutional .
It makes very little difference whether it actually violates the terms of the Constitution .
It is against the fundamental policy of America and the American Nation .
If adopted , it will color our whole future .
We shall have fought to abolish totalitarianism in the world , only to set it up in the United States .
As the bad news unfolds in the Caspian Basin that the US is being ' shut out ' of its delusional Grand Chessboard scheme , there are other forest fires , tornados , hurricanes , earthquakes , volcanoes erupting in the US and UK that may well spell the doom of BushCo and the Imbecile Great Decider at the helm .
He is now expendable and vulnerable to both impeachment and possible war crimes charges .
Pay attention to how expendable ' Gorgon ' Brown suddenly has become .
Bush is next as should be most of those in DC .
The Russians are often brilliant strategists , and never , even for a moment underestimate , them .
Some time around 2000 , there was an " investment club " created .
It was somewhere around $ 20 to $ 22 billion dollars and was promoted by a lot of high profile names mentioned often in this 9 - 11 / Caspian Basin fiasco , and some not mentioned at all .
Names like George H W Bush , Tricky Dick Cheney , Nicholas Brady , John Sununu and others .
All of their names surfaced in our investigation of what was going on in the Caspian Basin .
They had all purchased front row seats to get at those trillions , and trillions and trillions of dollars in Caspian oil and gas .
Of course , that is the same John Sununu that had to resign from the Reagan Administration .
Not sure what the connection was but the day he resigned Pan Am filed for bankruptcy .
They must have seen trouble coming in losing their ' best customer . '
Then there is the same Nicholas Brady of the GHWB Administration , the Brady Bonds fiasco and board member of Amerada Hess .
The 9 - 11 Commission Chairman , Thomas Keane , is chairman of Amerada Hess and major shareholder , so , yes , he probably would have ignored the ' truth ' for a board member involved in this Caspian Basin Investment Club .
There is a very real possibility that this ' investment club ' was involved in getting 9 - 11 done , and it is also a possibility that they are about take a major hit due to Junior losing the Caspian Basin .
I frankly hope they take a mega - billion dollar red ink shower and lose it all .
I hope they enjoy their front row seat for the aria , as the Fat Lady begins to sing , and that they lose those billions of still more stupidity of what they thought they could pull off and rip - off via the Caspian Basin .
The days of oil are numbered except for petrochemicals , the days of natural gas run as long as the Earth produces natural gas as a natural process of our planet .
It is very apparent that Russia has now emerged as the dominant global giant in natural gas .
What they control and how they will use that if pushed the wrong way could cause a meltdown in many parts of the world .
The EU is paying attention and it is past time the US did , too .
The day is coming fast that automobiles will be powered by hydrogen and water , not oil and gasoline .
I cannot foresee a time in the future that natural gas will NOT be the KEY energy issue , and Russia has already won that war , hands down .
If this were a hockey game it would be Russia 50 , US 0 .
If it were a basketball game it would be Russia 100 , US 0 .
If it were a tennis match it would be Russia 6 - 0 , 6 - 0 , 6 - 0 .
We lost , that 's the proverbial bottom line .
Game , set and match .
It is over .
Finis .
The next generation of and for mankind is nanotechnology , and it will be powered by natural gas , not oil .
My company scientists are experts in that matter .
Russia has just taken the lead on the NOW and the FUTURE , and has left the US behind , wallowing in its Oil - on - the - Brain mindset .
My sources in Houston inform that Big Oil is realizing fast that the BushCo brain - damaged fraud of its ' Global War on Terror ' has blown up in its face like a nuclear bomb .
To that extent , Big Oil is no longer heeding Daddy Bush 's calls to go help Junior with his dirty diapers .
Why it took them so long to recognize ' catastrophe ' is incredible .
Maybe it is due to their blinding , delusional blizzard of ' $ $ $ ' they were dreaming of making from the Caspian Basin , like sugar plums dancing in their heads .
Maybe it is because the wealthy can afford to not pay attention to the realities right in front of their noses .
I have suspected for a long time that many of the Wealthy Elite in the US are running on either ' lobotomy mode ' or autopilot in ' stuck - on - stupid ' gear .
There is indeed a ' core group ' of Big Oil tycoons in Texas who have been called upon over the years to provide ' opportunities ' for Junior , so the moron will have something to do other than be ' unemployed . '
They have always received ' 911 emergency ' phone calls from Daddy that dirty diaper duty is a must .
One of those major Houston ' players ' and I have spoken often .
My friend is astounded at the lack of perception of the Houston and Washington power players and how it took them so long to figure out what ' stupid ' looks like .
As he said to me once , " Hey , I know stupid shit when I see it . "
He does , indeed , and his comment was about Junior 's cabal 's likelihood of success stealing the Caspian Basin .
That comment was made in 2002 .
Such a call to duty is even a requirement of not being put on the ' Bush Shit List . '
Frankly , I think it 's about the Best list in the world to be on these days .
I have been thrown out of better clubs than BushCo and damned proud that ' smudge ' is not on my resume .
This diaper is so dirty , so putrid , people have decided they have better things to do with their time and money .
They invested heavily in this Grand Chessboard scheme and now it is every man for himself to see how much they can limit the damage and control their losses .
My bet is there are not enough lifejackets on the USS Bush Titanic for all to survive and some have reached that pregnant " moment of truth ' stage .
Cut the losses with BushCo or sink with them .
The Great Decider Bush and Daddy Bush are probably already making plans to push more than a few overboard from the USS Bush Titanic just to save their pathetic Presidential ' legacies . '
They have already made a ' Bush Shit List ' and it grows daily due to people turning and walking away in disgust .
There are three American Presidential legacies that should be stricken from every book , every building and aircraft carrier and every other place of ' honor ' ... and they are those of George H W Bush , Bill Clinton and George W Bush .
We could not combine the best from these three deceitful , traitorous , treasonous , genocidal morons and come up with a single decent American President .
America , face up to this simple reality : The Bush Family has raped , ravaged and thrown you into the trash heap .
They screw up everything they touch with their lie - based schemes , and their treasonous sales of our best technology to our enemies and ' friends ' has tossed away decades of the best R&D any nation ever achieved .
Get over the reality of the matter and figure out how you are going to survive the Sinking of America .
If you do not have a lifejacket , you had better find one ... and fast .
There is a very real possibility that major oil companies and major billionaire Bush Buddies are about to take a bath to the point that even the money and power landscape of America will change significantly .
Yeah , some of the Wealthy Elite are way , way past angry and fed - up with the Bush Show .
They are going to get hosed by this stupid strategic plan and so is the rest of America .
We may soon see some down on their luck billionaires due to collective Bush Stupidity .
It is one thing to ' crap ' on the presidency and the Oval Office as Clinton did , but it is quite another matter to decimate / annihilate Iraq and Afghanistan ( and slaughter a couple million human beings ) , and to dump on Russia and China , bungle the entire Caspian Basin scheme , stab America in the back and essentially blow the entire game in spades .
Only George W Bush could pull of that hat trick .
Even if we had Mr. MaGoo and Elmer Fudd as president and vice president , more accomplishments would have been realized since the 2000 ' elections . '
These two morons , Bush & Cheney - and their Zionist NeoCon parasites and pathological killers - are a hideous , evil plague on the planet by ANY measure .
Remember , I am a Conservative Republican and I know what of I speak .
In my opinion , Bush has blown more opportunities than any President in my lifetime due to his arrogance and self - inflicted ignorance .
I told one of my readers that what is happening right now is the equivalent of being hit in the head with a ( Russian ) Nolan Ryan fastball , and then the umpire takes the bat and hits the batter in the head again for being too stupid to see it coming and too stupid to duck .
The analogy is simply that BushCo has been knocked out , lights out , and Americans are beyond stupid if they do not wake up and look at the realities of the situation .
I know many Americans who feel that way ( hit in the head by a fastball ) and are stunned at what they are witnessing .
This is indeed a Major National Embarrassment and it is the folks in DC , the Fed , Wall Street and corporate America who are to blame .
Stay focused on that .
It is not your idiot next door neighbor who thinks Bush is " hot " or the one across the street who thinks the only ' truth ' in America drivels from the mouths of O'Reilly and Limbaugh .
The real problem is in Washington , DC and the lunatic policies these power - drunk morons keep pushing .
They all are lying to you , folks , so get it straight in your head .
Those ' leaders ' in Washington , DC are LIARS .
When their lips are moving be very wary , be afraid of what they are * really * saying .
Very afraid .
These events also raise serious questions about the sanity of the Barky Obama Black Bush strategery of ' refocusing ' on Afghanistan ( to try to get that pipeline deal finally done . )
I can think of no reason whatsoever to spend even one second or $ 1 to save the reputation of Zbigniew Brzezinski and his lunatic vision for the world .
The man is an idiot and Russia just proved it by pushing the US out of the Caspian Basin in one fell swoop with a contract and a pen .
Seriously , his idea was dim and dumb in 1979 and it is still so in 2008 .
As we now know , it is dead meat lying at the bottom of the sea .
Get over it and come up with a better plan .
And for the love of God , we must not allow the squander of the life of even one more American soldier on this Grand Lie .
I can bet there are plenty of ' CYA ' handwringing strategy sessions going on over at Obamanation HQ and BushCo about how they are going to try to explain away this colossal failure to America .
I still have yet to see that McCain has a clue as to what is unraveling right before his eyes .
Seriously , there is FUBAR , and then there is " W FUBAR " which makes the original military term mild in comparison .
Russia just made it clear to McCain : " We can afford to cut off relations with any of our partners if that 's what they want .
We 're not interested in what [ John ] McCain has to say .
Let him become president first , then we 'll listen to him , " a senior Russian diplomat told reporters on Tuesday , according to AFP .
That was in response to all of the John McGoo ' tough talk ' about how he is going to reign in Russia , ' correct their attitude ' and get the BushCo plan back on track .
Hint - cut a deal with IRAN or pack your bags in the entire Centcom area of the Middle East and Central Asia .
You Bush sycophants are stinking up the world stage with your incompetence .
Another dynamic is the call for ' Gorgon ' Brown to resign .
Just like Tony Blair , his oratory , bullshit and pontificating is just making the hole deeper .
Of concern there is that the Rothschild family is apparently pushing either Zionist Jack Straw or Zionist David Miliband to replace Brown so they can try to get their greed - lust game plan back on the track .
Folks , it is not happening and it is not going to happen .
The Zionist Rothschild family is going to have to come to grips with the fact that they are not going to survive this completely intact .
One of their heirs and author of " Global Warming Survival Handbook " , David de Rothschild , was quoted saying that ' Jupiter and Saturn are closer to the Sun than Earth ' , so that is why his theory of Global Warming was valid .
Yeah , well , money can't buy a brain .
I know , Forrest , stupid is as stupid does .
Nothing is quite so revealing as inbreeding .
Well , the train wreck is total and getting it back on the rails might well take a generation .
They just do n't want Americans to figure that out yet and rise up and cast out their handpicked morons from power in the United States .
That would be their worst nightmare come true ... an awakened America that will not play along any more with these stupid schemes .
America , take a hint .
Learn the joy of saying NO .
We can stop this insanity so fast Washington , DC would need a chiropractor due to whiplash .
In a non-tearjerker moment , Ehud Olmert announced July 30 that he is stepping down ... so there will be regime change in Israel , too .
That one is more problematic because Olmert was pushing for peace with the Palestinians and the powers - that - be do not wish for that to happen .
They want war , so the Musical ' War ' Chairs game is now being played out in the US , UK and Tel Aviv to get the War Plan back on track .
Bush wants a ' peace deal ' by the end of his term between Israel and the Palestinians .
Well , as of Olmert 's announcement that is not happening either .
This is yet another example of ' brain flatulence ' that will backfire in their faces because Iran will not budge and neither China nor Russia are going to let anyone control their economies .
Russia could cut the natural gas and oil off to EU and put the entire EU economy on its knees in a matter of hours ... just turn off a few master valves , and the party 's over .
Talk about NUKE capability and there 's not a damned thing the bogus Bush Missile Shield can do about that .
Russia is now more powerful than ever , and so is China .
They ( theUS , UK and Israel ) seem to be forgetting that in the grand scheme they have created the perfect storm that can end their rule .
They forgot that they are no longer in charge and in no position to dictate terms to any nation , especially to China or Russia .
Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev have proven to be chess masters of the first order and our Imbecile Great Decider can't even play a game of checkers without lying , cheating or screwing it up .
Hello , they cannot handle Afghanistan or Iraq .
Any American who thinks they can handle China or Russia does not have enough brain cells firing at the same time to find a light switch .
They also cannot handle America if we all stand up in unison and say ' NO ! '
If you have been paying attention , the Russian - UK oil partnership of TNK - BP is imploding .
The people at BP recently announced that they had recalled the remaining 60 employees from Russia and powerful forces inside of Russia are forcing out the British CEO of TNK - BP .
This all coincided with the recent announcement that TNK - BP was one of the three Russian oil and gas giants that were granted full access to develop Venezuela 's vast oil reserves ... perhaps as much as 4 trillion barrels .
My bet is BP has not been invited along for the party in Venezuela .
This was in part predictable since the UK is harboring wanted fugitive Boris Berezovsky .
Mr. Berezovsky was the former Yeltsin man and liaison to those same Caspian Basin nations that BushCo and the UK allies so desperately wanted to take over and control .
They lost , now they are scrambling to turn their loss into a victory without America figuring out that the official clock reads ' 00:00 ' left in the game .
Simple rule when a ' team ' of schemers and liars cannot get a deal done after 30 years of lying and scheming , it is time for both a new plan and a new team .
This has now turned out to be ' a swing and a miss ' for three long , agonizing decades .
Of course , it did not help matters when Alexander Litvinenko was murdered on British soil and the UK pointed the finger of blame at Putin .
That was a stupid move on the part of the Brits , but like Bush , they specialize in stupid moves over in London .
That ranked right up there with our Black Poodle Condi Rice jetting all over the world to do ' arf - arf photo ops ' and then scurrying around to piss on the feet of the Russian Bear .
Matters inside of TNK - BP started coming unraveled when the UK continued its protection of their CIA - MI6 Zionist ex-oligarch Berezovsky and would not extradite him to Russia to face charges for crimes against Mother Russia .
It was Berezovsky who tried to sell out the Caspian Basin to the US and UK and the entire Caspian Basin despises this Zionist Jew traitor .
One of the little known facts about how Big Oil is positioned in this global game is that Conoco owns 35 % of LUKOil and there are no problems whatsoever between Russia and Conoco .
They are getting along fine and kicking BushCo black and blue all over the world with LUKOil as their partner .
Evidently , the management of that American oil company figured out long ago that BushCo would crap the diaper , and they wisely chose to team up with who the winners would eventually be .
Just think , BushCo could have spent that $ 5 trillion Iraq war waste on alternative energy and domestic oil and gas production ... and completely weaned the US from dependence on foreign oil .
No , that was too logical and would mean that the Caspian Basin profits would be lost to them and their cronies .
But I digress , that would require that the goons in DC be able to grasp an idea that is was worthy for them to develop a real energy strategy , that to do something for America just might be the moral thing to do .
No , alas , we cannot have realities contradict the delusional bullshit of the current regime in Washington , DC .
Well , those profits from global oil and gas control are being lost to ' others ' anyway , so now it is time for America to demand a ' full accounting ' regarding Use of Funds on that $ 5 trillion Bush blew through .
It is way past time for a full accounting on what these idiots in DC did with $ 5 trillion that they heaped on the backs of the American taxpayers and have nothing to show for it but lies and failure , two destroyed nations and at least two million dead people .
Such is the tragedy of myopic , arrogant , greedy people chasing stupid strategic visions and plans that were , in reality , nothing but a stinky dirty diaper from the day they launched their grand scheme on September 11 , 2001 .
Folks , just prepare yourself for this :
Not only is the Fat Lady about to sing the aria but it will be in an ear - shattering alto in B flat that will shatter ' Glass Towers " in DC , London and Wall Street .
And , damn , is she one Ugly Fat Lady .
Ugly has come home to roost on the New World Order as defined by the Bush Family .
Unfortunately , it has come home to roost on America , too .
Maybe
God will help us through this but , if so , it will not be because of these evil idiots in DC .

A few minutes before Robert F. Kennedy was shot by an assassin 40 years ago , he was talking baseball , expressing his “ high regard to Don Drysdale , who pitched his sixth straight shutout tonight . ”
He added , “ And I hope that we have as good fortune in our campaign . ”
Kennedy spoke after winning California ’s Democratic presidential primary .
Drysdale pitched for the Dodgers .
The recent anniversary of Kennedy ’s death was another in a flow of memories from a tumultuous year , not all of it happy nostalgia .
It is appropriate that it was an extraordinary year for baseball , the Year of the Pitcher with nothing like it before or since , as Drysdale sparkled alongside stars like Bob Gibson , Denny McLain , Luis Tiant and Mickey Lolich .
“ You did n’t realize what was happening that year until it was over , ” said Frank Robinson , a Hall of Fame hitter who played that season for Baltimore .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Sony Corp 6758 .T does not plan to announce price cuts to its flagship PlayStation 3 games console at Europe 's biggest video games fair in Leipzig , Germany next week , a company spokesman said on Friday .
“ It ’s not going to happen .
If you ’re coming for that you ’ll be disappointed , ” Sony Computer Entertainment spokesman Nick Caplin said .
In the 12 months ending March 31 , Sony sold 9.24 million units , below its initial estimates of 11 million sales .
But in an interview with Reuters on July 16 , the company ’s video game chief said the firm was on track for the current year ’s target of 10 million sales .
Cuts to the Playstation 3's original high price have helped boost its fortunes in Sony 's three - way battle with Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Nintendo Co Ltd 7974 .OS in the global video game industry .
Sony ruled the video game industry for about a decade from the mid-1990s with its original PlayStation and PlayStation 2 .
In the current console cycle , Sony has found itself in an unfamiliar position , trailing Nintendo ’s Wii and competing neck and neck with Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 for second place in monthly sales in the United States .
The Leipzig games fair runs from August 20 - 22 .

NASA 'sPhoenix Mars Lander may have found water ice on the red planet , but it stillhas a lot of work left to do to answer the question that has been on scientists ' minds for decades : Has Mars ever been capable of harboring life ?
Phoenix scientists announced yesterday thatthe mission finally confirmedthe presence of subsurface water ice in the north polar regions of Mars ?
first detected by NASA 's Mars Odyssey orbiter in 2002 ? about two months aftertouching down on the Martian surface on May 25 .
The landeris now analyzing the ice to see if it was ever a liquid and if it contains organicmaterials , the building blocks of life .
The ice , collected from below the surface at the lander 's site in the Martian arctic , could have actedlike a freezer , protecting any organics that may have formed there .
" Wehave an environment where organics could be preserved , " said missionscientist William Boynton of the University of Arizona .
Thedetection of organics on Mars would not necessarily mean there is life .
Itwould just mean that carbon and other molecules that make up life as we know itwere present .
" Organicswould be the home run or the grand slam of the mission , " said BruceJakosky , a geologist at the University of Colorado who is not affiliated withthe mission .
However , if they do n't find organics , " that does n't mean thatthere was n't life on Mars , " Jakosky said .
Other missions , planned andunplanned , will keep the search alive .
Liquidwater
Theconfirmation of the Odyssey ice observations was a key goal of the $ 420 million Phoenix mission , but only the first of several steps in characterizing thedirt and ice layer of Mars ' Vastitas Borealis region to determine whether itmay once have been habitable at some point in the planet 's past .
' I see thisas a step along the way of Phoenix getting to its major science results , " Jakoskysaid .
" By itself , that 's not a major result . "
One ofthose steps is determining whether the water ice ever existed in a liquid form , said Phoenix robotic arm co-investigator Ray Arvidson of Washington Universityin St. Louis ?
liquid water being a key resource for life as we know it .
Phoenix willlook for signs of ancient liquid water by heating up samples of the icydirt mixture in the tiny ovens of its Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) , which can analyze the vapors given off by the heated samples to analyze theircomposition .
TEGA hasalready begun heating up the sample that confirmed that the rock - hard layerbeneath the surface dirt was indeed water ice ?
when ice begins to melt , ittakes more heat to raise the temperature of the sample .
Over the course of thenext week , TEGA will gradually heat the sample all the way up to 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1,000 degrees Celsius ) .
As thesample is heated , any hydrated minerals , or those that likely formed in thepresence of liquid water , show themselves as they break apart and the signatureof their water is detected by the instrument , explained Boynton , a TEGAco - investigator .
Findinghydrated minerals , such as carbonates , sulfates or clays , would indicate thatliquid water once permeated the Martian regolith where Phoenix now sits , Arvidson said in a telephone interview last night .
This waterwould not have flowed as rivers or streams , as it once likely did closer to Mars ' equator , where hydrated salts have already been found by NASA orbitersand rovers , but would have percolated through the dirt layer as Mars ' orbitalmotions tipped the northern parts of the planet toward the sun , warming themup , Arvidson added .
Thestuff of life
The otherbig signature Phoenix will look for as the mission continues and the probe ' sovens heat up dirt samples will be organic molecules , the building blocks oflife .
" Findingorganics would really change our way of thinking , " Boynton said .
But so far , organic molecules have n't shown up on Mars .
When the Viking landers heated updirt samples in the 1970s , " there were really no organic molecules atall , " Boynton said .
But dirtnear the Martian equator faces strong oxidizing pressures , which can destroyorganics , Boynton added , which is why Phoenix is looking for them farther north .
Organicshave proven elusive to Phoenixso far ; the first dirt sample analyzed by TEGA , taken from the surface , foundno sign of them .
But this was n't much of a surprise to mission scientists .
" Wedid n't really expect to find them in the surface soils , " because thesurface is subjected to the same oxidizing pressure as the equatorial regions , Boynton told SPACE.com .
TEGA willkeep looking for signs of organics in subsequent samples taken closer to theice layer , he added .
If Phoenix does n't find organics , the mission wo n't be a flop , Jakosky said , because it stillgives scientists valuable information about the northern region .
" Whateverthey find is exciting , " he said .
If it doesdetect organics though , mission scientists will be cautious about interpreting the findings , Boynton said .
They would assume first that any organics could be contaminationbrought with the spacecraft from Earth .
Mission scientists will check with a " blank " brought from Earth to determine whether or not any organicsdiscovered are terrestrial stowaways .
Even if theblank shows that the organics came from the Martian soil , they still may not benative , Boynton said , since the same organic - bearing meteorites that strikeEarth strike Mars as well .
Determining the ultimate origin of any organicswould likely take bringing back a sample to Earth , a project that both NASA andthe European Space Agency are working toward .
Andorganics do n't on their own equal life .
" Just because there are organiccompounds , does n't mean that that 's life , " said Kim Seelos , a postdoctoralresearcher at Johns Hopkins University .
Futuremissions
Whether ornot Phoenix finds signs of organics , it wo n't be the last time that NASA looksfor them on Mars .
NASA 's MarsScience Laboratory ( MSL ) , set to launch in 2009 , will pick up where the1970s Viking missions left off , exploring the regions closer to the equator forsigns of them .
MSL will bebetter equipped than Viking , and even Phoenix , to detect organics in dirtsamples , with more powerful and sensitive equipment , as well as the ability toroam around .
While " life is teeming on Earth , " Arvidson said , it may not have been sodense on Mars ?
if it ever existed ?
perhaps only forming in small pockets .
Since Phoenix , as a lander , stays put by definition , it can only explore thepatch of ground in its immediate vicinity .
However , any organics detected by MSL would have formed in a much more ancient period of Mars ' history because the landscape near Mars ' equator formed billions of yearsago .
The surface that Phoenix is exploring is much younger , only tens of millionsof years old .
For now , Phoenix is the only chance of finding organics on this region of Mars , since no futuremissions in the works now are planned to return to the frozen northern reaches .
To get another mission back there to look the region in greater detail , " it would probably take finding organics , " Boynton said .
But " Phoenix is n't the last gasp , or MSL is n't the last gasp " to answering the question ofwhether life ever existed on Mars , Jakosky said .
Theevidence available to scientists now suggests that Mars could have harboredlife , it 's just a matter of finding a spot that preserves the signs of it , headded .
And Phoenix 's landing site , or even MSL's , may not be the ideal spot togo and look for those signs , whether by sending another rover or staging amission to return a sample to Earth .
There areplenty of other environments on Mars where Jakosky would like to look for signsof life .
While he can't point to a particular spot , there is evidence that Marsonce had features that could have supported life , including ancient lake beds , ancient highlands where evidence suggests that water existed for long periodsof time , and hot springs ?
" places like Yellowstone , " as Jakoskydescribes them .
Somescientists , such as Seelos , doubt that clear evidence of Martian life itselfwill ever be found because any life would have likely been microbial , which is not easily preserved as fossils .
But Jakosky sees this as an" unnecessarily pessimistic " view , because ancient microbes have beenpreserved in some places on Earth .
But itcould be awhile before scientists ever answer the question of life on Earthbecause they currently understand so little about the history and geology of Mars , Jakosky said .
" Wedon ? t know the answer and I don ? t even know how to put odds on " when andwhether they will find the answer , " Jakosky said .
His adviceis to keep using missions like Phoenix , MSL , and eventually a sample returnmission to build our knowledge of Mars , as we have built the knowledge of ourown planet 's past .

A new technique for growing single - crystal nanorods and controlling their shape using biomolecules could enable the development of smaller , more powerful heat pumps and devices that harvest electricity from heat .
Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute have discovered how to direct the growth of nanorods made up of two single crystals using a biomolecular surfactant .
The researchers were also able to create " branched " structures by carefully controlling the temperature , time , and amount of surfactant used during synthesis .
" Our work is the first to demonstrate the synthesis of composite nanorods with branching , wherein each nanorod consists of two materials — a single - crystal bismuth telluride nanorod core encased in a hollow cylindrical shell of single - crystal bismuth sulfide , " said G. Ramanath , professor of materials science and engineering at Rensselaer and director of the university 's Center for Future Energy Systems , who led the research project .
" Branching and core - shell architectures have been independently demonstrated , but this is the first time that both features have been simultaneously realized through the use of a biomolecular surfactant . "
Most nanostructures comprised of a core and a shell generally require more than one step to synthesize , but these new research results demonstrate how to synthesize such nanorods in only one step .
" Our single - step synthesis is an important development toward realizing large - scale synthesis of composite nanomaterials in general , " said Arup Purkayastha , who worked on the project as a postdoctoral researcher at Rensselaer and is now a scientist with Laird Technologies in Bangalore , India .
Because of their attractive properties , core - shell nanorods are expected to one day enable the development of new nanoscale thermoelectric devices for power generation , as well as nanoscale heat pumps for cooling hot spots in nanoelectronics devices .
" Our discovery enables the realization of two very important attributes for heat dissipation and power generation from heat , " Ramanath said .
" First , the core - shell junctions in the nanorods are conducive for heat removal upon application of an electrical voltage , or generating electrical power from heat .
Second , the branched structures open up the possibility of fabricating miniaturized conduits for heat removal alongside nanowire interconnects in future device architectures . "
The researchers discovered that synthesis at high temperatures or with low amounts of the biomolecular surfactant L - glutathonic acid ( LGTA ) yields branched nanorod structures in highly regulated patterns .
In contrast , synthesis at low temperatures or with high levels of LGTA results in straight nanorods without any branching .
It is interesting to note that at the point of branching , atoms in the branch resemble a mirror image of the parent crystal " a finding that reinforces Ramanath 's conclusion that LGTA is able to induce branching through atomic - level sculpture .
" Since LGTA is similar to biological molecules , our discovery could be conceivably used as a starting point to explore the use of proteins and enzymes to atomically sculpt such nanorod architectures through biological processes , " said Ramanath
Results of the study , titled " Surfactant - Directed Synthesis of Branched Bismuth Telluride / Sulfide Core / Shell Nanorods , " were recently published online and will be featured in an upcoming issue of the journal Advanced Materials .

Get a $ 1,000 eBay gift card !
Some people who sell things on eBay are fed up with new rules the company has been imposing in hopes of making the auction site more attractive to online shoppers .
Now even more changes are coming in the next few weeks , but this time eBay Inc. hopes it can cool tempers .
Already this year , eBay has tinkered with its fee structure , search results and feedback system .
These efforts might be meeting eBay 's aims of improving the experience for buyers , but several sellers say their relationship with eBay is worse than ever , and some have left the site entirely .
Jonathan Garriss , executive director of the Professional eBay Sellers Alliance and head of Gotham City Online , which sells shoes on eBay , said his group 's members are seeing fewer of their listed items sell , and lower average prices for things that do sell .
EBay has been rejigging its vast Internet marketplace in hopes of turning around a troubling trend :
Its number of active users is barely rising .
In the most recent quarter , the figure rose 1.4 percent to 84.5 million .
One big change came in January , when eBay altered its complex fee structure and said it was trying to encourage sellers to offer more items for sale , which in turn could attract more buyers .
Generally , eBay cut the fees it charges for listing an item , but raised its commissions on completed sales of products auctioned for less than $ 1,000 or sold at fixed prices lower than $ 100 .
Meanwhile , the company began taking a lesser bite out of higher - end fixed - price sales — as much as 4 percent instead of a previous maximum of 5 percent .
At the time , eBay said more than 60 percent of its sellers would save money under the new rules .
But plenty of complaints poured in .
EBay responded by cutting listing fees by as much as half for items in its " media " category — such as books and DVDs — that sell for under $ 25 .
Still , many sellers were still unhappy that unlike in the past — when eBay consistently talked of a level playing field for brand - name companies and weekend attic - raiders alike — a new top tier of vendors seems to have an easier time flooding the marketplace .
Under a new " Diamond PowerSeller " plan , the highest - volume merchants may be eligible for reduced fees .
One Diamond PowerSeller , Buy.com Inc. , is offering so many goods on eBay that many sellers suspect Buy.com is listing items practically for free .
EBay wo n't comment on Buy.com 's arrangement .
Buy.com 's listings also emphasize eBay 's move toward sales with set prices rather than its traditional auction format .
EBay says auctions are not going away , but fixed - price sales are the fastest - growing part of the company 's marketplace , increasing 60 percent a year .
And more changes are afoot .
EBay announced Wednesday that starting Sept. 16 , it will let U.S. sellers pay 35 cents to list an unlimited number of identical items at a set price , for a month at a time .
Previously , fixed - price listing fees could run as high as $ 4 per item , and the listings were good for a week .
EBay 's president of marketplace operations , Lorrie Norrington , acknowledged there has been " a lot of change " this year .
But she said the company carefully considered the moves and believes they are improving buyers ' experience because " the best values from trusted sellers become better and better . "
For some sellers , like Michael Knight , who dismantles motorcycles and sells the parts on eBay from Garland , Texas , the sheer volume of recent adjustments has been frustrating .
" I have no control .
I have to comply with anything they choose to do and I have no voice in the matter , " he said .
Knight would like to move off eBay , but says it 's difficult to transfer his listings to another site .
Other sites will not easily accept the photos embedded in his item descriptions , and modifying every one of his almost 4,000 listings " is just not practical . "
" I 'd be giving up a month 's income to get that done .
That 's the only thing that 's keeping me on eBay — the inconvenience of leaving , " he said .
Bruce Hershenson of West Plains , Miss. , had spent 10 years selling vintage movie posters on eBay .
Instead he now does that twice a week on his own site , eMoviePoster.com , using technology offered by AuctionAnything.com Inc .
" I talk to other people who have done what I did and they 're happy with their decision .
They 've been able to get their business to the eBay business levels or beyond , " Hershenson said .
His poster auctions on eBay had started at 99 cents each , so under the fee structure eBay imposed in January , he would have paid 15 cents to list each poster , down from 20 cents .
But his average poster sold for $ 50 , and eBay 's take on that sale price would rise to about $ 3.07 , from about $ 2.12 previously .
Even with a discount he could get by keeping his customer - feedback ratings high , he expected to pay eBay almost $ 20,000 more per year .
Sellers have also bristled at changes in eBay 's feedback policy , one of the site 's traditional hallmarks .
In the spring , the company removed sellers ' ability to leave negative or neutral feedback for buyers , though buyers can still offer negative assessments of sellers .
EBay also adjusted its search engine so that items being hawked by people with poorer feedback ratings come up lower in search results .
Some sellers complain that this put them at the mercy of unscrupulous buyers who try to take advantage of the rating system .
" Many times you feel like they 're really pushing it to see if you 'll give them some kind of a refund , " said Bill Cartmel , who sells records on eBay from Lewiston , Maine .
" They 'll float the suggestion that ' This is n't exactly what I expected . ' "
EBay 's Norrington said that sellers can report such abuse , and that the company has n't seen it much .
Even with the rancor , some sellers clearly have benefited from eBay 's changes .
Steven Holt and his wife , Crystal , who sell DVDs from Denison , Iowa , say they 've seen record sales since the spring , when eBay search results began favoring vendors who , like them , have high feedback ratings .
Yet Holt understands why some sellers may be upset .
He notes that the uncertain effect of fee changes , combined with an iffy economy , " is naturally going to be a concern . "
" When eBay makes these dramatic changes , it can make you very nervous , " he said .
" But again , eBay is doing what eBay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace . "

A writer from Washington has won the honor of having the world ’s worst writing .
The guy , named Garrison Spik , came in first in the annual San Jose State University Bulwer - Lytton Fiction Contest for bad writing .
His entry began with the following passage :
“ Theirs was a New York love , a checkered taxi ride burning rubber , and like the city their passion was open 24/7 , steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm , moist , white breath through manhole covers stamped ‘ Forged by DeLaney Bros. , Piscataway , N.J. ’ ”

Renewable Energy For Dummies
What Exactly Is Renewable Energy ?
2008 has been a pretty wild and productive year as far as energy goes , as we have a pretty big problem right now , and no one seems to be able to agree on exactly how to solve it .
Luckily , we do have some options on the table , and after all the smoke and dust clears , perhaps we can figure out which method (s ) are most economical and most efficient .
I ’m speaking of renewable energy , which is quite different than fossil fuels in one main and obvious regard – we can renew it ( hence the name renewable energy ) .
Currently , there are five viable sources of renewable energy that we as humans can take advantage of , and a short description of each :
1. Solar Energy – Ah , the power of the sun .
Unless you ’ve lived in a cave all of your life , you probably have a good idea that solar energy is energy collected from the sun and used later for electricity and heating .
Obviously the sun is quite large , and in most parts of the world , you can collect a rather large amount of solar energy assuming you have the equipment .
The technology required to harness the sun ’s energy is getting less expensive by the year , and it ’s a viable alternative source that we must consider taking advantage of if we want to live to see 50 years from now .
More individuals and even business owners are taking advantage of it these days to fight the skyrocketing costs of electricity bills , and of course , for the tax benefits .
2. Geothermal Power –
If you were n’t aware , we have this really hot thing in the middle of the Earth .
It ’s called the “ core ” .
Anyway , deep inside the Earth , there are all sorts of things going on , and the one we ’re most interested in is the heat .
There is more than an abundance of natural heat down there , and when we harness and utilize that heat for energy , that form of energy is called Geothermal energy .
More and more these days , homes and businesses are using geothermal heating systems to save on energy bills and to do their part in “ going green ” .
Geothermal is actually a really great form of energy , since it does n’t produce any pollution or greenhouse gases , but the only drawback is the initial cost to install the equipment to harness it .
Not to mention , you have to live in a place that has the right geological properties in order to use it .
3. Wind Power –
Wind energy is another one of those renewable sources that is very , very environmentally friendly , and actually has been used for quite some time .
Generating electricity from wind is pretty straight forward – basically , electricity is produced when wind blows a massive turbine that spins to create the electricity .
The equipment is somewhat expensive still , but over the course of the next ten years or so , that may change .
One other drawback is that if it is n’t windy outside , then guess what – no wind , no power .
Luckily , battery technology is very good in that turbines can store energy for days that have less wind than others .
4. Hydro Power – Another widely used source of renewable energy , hydro power is harnessed by using the flow of water to move turbines to create electricity .
Water has been used for quite some time to make electricity , but died out a bit when fossil fuels became more popular .
However , hydro energy is still used today , with about 7 % of the energy in the US being powered by hydro electric power plants .
Hydro power plants are typically found on large bodies of water ( like big rivers ) , so geographically , you ’ll only find them in states that can support them .
Again , as technology develops , we ’ll probably see a more widespread use of hydro power in the future , as it is a clean burning and natural way to power homes and businesses .
5. Bio Energy – Creating energy from plants and grains seems to be all the rage these days .
Biodiesel , corn gasoline , and other forms of bio energy are being utilized all over the place to help combat out of control gas prices .
Ethanol , which is basically gas made from corn , is widely used to power vehicles , and costs quite a bit less than regular gas .
Many manufacturers are crating ethanol ready cars and trucks , and consumers seem to buy them more and more .
There are all sorts of grains , plants and other naturally occurring gifts from Mother Nature that we can use to create different forms of bio energy , and as we move into the future , do n’t be surprised if by the year 2020 , you ’re powering your car on carrots and beans .
( Adds comments from USDA economist , paragraphs 3 - 5 )
WASHINGTON , Aug 20 ( Reuters ) - U.S. consumers should brace for the biggest increase in food prices in nearly 20 years in 2008 and even more pain next year due to surging meat and produce prices , the Agriculture Department said on Wednesday .
Food prices are forecast to rise by 5 percent to 6 percent this year , making it the largest annual increase since 1990 .
Just last month , USDA forecast food prices would climb between 4.5 and 5.5 percent in 2008 .
“ It ’s a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in July , ” USDA economist Ephraim Leibtag , who prepared the forecast , said in an interview .
“ We ’ve been waiting for some moderation , but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently ( at the retail level ) leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year , ” he added .
Leibtag said he expected food prices to moderate , but the timing depends on what happens to volatile energy and food ingredient costs .
Prices are expected to rise by 4 percent to 5 percent in 2009 , lead by red meat and poultry .
The forecast , if correct , would be the third straight year where food prices have surged at least 4 percent .
In its latest food prices report , USDA said the increase for 2008 was due partly to higher costs for meat , poultry and fish , which make up about 12 percent of total food spending .
Overall , costs for these items are forecast to rise 3 percent compared to 2.5 percent estimated last month .
Prices for fruits and vegetables , which account for more than 8 percent of food spending , will also rise 5.5 percent versus 5 percent predicted in July .
USDA also forecast increases this year of 9.5 percent for cereals and bakery products , a 14 percent surge for eggs and a 13.5 percent hike for fats and oils .
A broad range of commodities posted record highs this year , including corn and soybeans .
Prices have since backed off as concerns over smaller crops due to a wet spring in the U.S. Midwest have largely dissipated .
In its first estimate of the fall harvest , USDA last week forecast a corn crop of 12.29 billion bushels , the second largest on record .
Despite the near - record crops , farm - gate prices for this year ’s corn , wheat and soybean crops , while lower than earlier forecasts , will still set records .
Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer said last week he did not see any relief for food prices during the remainder of the year .
The cost of energy -- used to transport , package and process foods -- is still boosting food prices , even though energy prices have dropped .
Oil has slumped from a record high above $ 147 a barrel on July 11 to $ 115 .
“ We have n’t seen those prices reflected in the finished products yet , ” Schafer said .
Americans spend more than $ 1 trillion a year on groceries , snacks , carry - out food and meals in restaurants .
Farmers get 20 cents of the food dollar and the rest goes to processing , labor , transportation and distribution .

Aug. 5 , 2008 -- More than 12 % of children aged 10 to 14 are watching R- rated violent movies , prompting researchers to call for an overhaul of the movie rating system and for more involvement from pediatricians .
A study by Dartmouth researchers , published in the journal Pediatrics , focuses on 40 movies rated R for violence and shows that these movies have been seen by about 12.5 % of American children between the ages of 10 and 14 .
The study was conducted in 2003 among 6,522 adolescents aged 10 - 14 and included top box - office movies from 1998 to 2003 that were rated R for violence .
Some movies scored higher .
The R-rated Scary Movie , starring Carmen Electra , had been seen by 48 % of children aged 10 to 14 .
" We know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content , but how much exposure children actually get has largely been ignored , " says Keilah Worth , PhD , the lead author on the study and a post - doctoral fellow at Dartmouth Medical School and Dartmouth - Hitchcock Medical Center 's Norris Cotton Cancer Center .
Researchers point to an existing body of research that documents the negative effects of violent media on children .
" A clear picture has emerged that exposure to violent media increases the likelihood of aggressive thoughts , emotions , and behavior , " the authors write .
The movie rating system , designed 40 years ago when the only way to see a movie was in a theater , no longer is adequate , according to researchers .
These days , with DVDs , pay - per-view , and movies that are downloadable off the Internet , children have more access than ever to adult media .
Many parents likely are not aware of what their kids are watching .
Researchers call for pediatricians to play a more active role by educating parents about how many children are actually watching violent movies and the harmful effects of that exposure .
Doctors could also assist parents with technology , such as the V - chip , to restrict access to media .
" Ratings need to be more prominent on all movies , whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store , and we need clearer messages to parents , " James Sargent , MD , professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School , says in a news release .
DLP recently teamed up with former LucasFilms effects studios Kerner Optical and Tippett Studios to work on a stereoscopic 3D Trailer for their cinema projectors .
Pushing this style of filmmaking ( kinda like the 3D attractions at theme parks ) forward was something they were all excited about , and they took me around Kerner Optical 's facility and showed me the latest camera gear they used to make the 3D trailer .

Seeing the camera setup in person is pretty awesome .
It consists of two cameras — one facing straight forward in a horizontal orientation , and one facing straight down , in a vertical position .
Between them sits a mirror , angled at roughly 45 degrees , that acts as a beam splitter , directing the image to the vertically facing camera and helping to create the 3D effect .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
While the vertical camera remains stationary , the horizontal camera slides from left to right .
In doing so , the intensity of the 3D effect varies according to position as the pictures from the two cameras phase in and out .
Once the camera has done its job , its up to the viewing apparatus to carry out the rest of the magic .
Kerner Optical uses special LCD monitors with the ability to display 3D images with the help of polarized glasses .
Many rear - projection DLP televisions actually do the same thing , but a lack of content support has kept the technology obscured from most owners .

Many people in the industry are pushing for 3D filmmaking to take off , as they think it 's the next big technical innovation in movie production .
Personally , I 'm all for it , because it really is fun to watch , but until the industry finds a way to get the same effect without glasses , I 'm not sure mainstream acceptance will be easy .

McCain adviser on Iraqi PM's Obama endorsement : ' We 're f**ked ' RAW STORY
Published : Saturday July 19 , 2008
Print This Email This Senator John McCain ridiculed Senator Obama 's timetable for Iraq withdrawal as a tactic aimed only at getting votes .
For the Iraqi Prime minister , it apparently worked .
The clear endorsement of Senator Barack Obama by Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki Saturday morning came as a strong blow to the McCain campaign .
McCain has claimed a superiority to Obama in matters of foreign policy as a major selling point to his candidacy for president , but that position is more difficult in the wake of al - Maliki 's statement .
After hearing of the announcement , a sometime adviser to the McCain campaign said in an email , " We 're f**ked , " according to Mark Ambinder of The Atlantic .
A senior McCain campaign official responded to Ambinder about the development .
" His domestic politics require him to be for us getting out , " he said on the condition of anonymity .
" The military says ' conditions based ' and Maliki said ' conditions based ' yesterday in the joint statement with Bush .
Regardless , voters care about [ the ] military , not about Iraqi leaders . "
But it will be difficult for McCain to deny his own statement in 2004 that the United States would have to leave Iraq if the nation 's leaders requested it .
# QUESTION : Let me give you a hypothetical , senator .
What would or should we do if , in the post - June 30th period , a so - called sovereign Iraqi government asks us to leave , even if we are unhappy about the security situation there ?
I understand its a hypothetical , but its at least possible .
McCAIN : Well , if that scenario evolves , then I think its obvious that we would have to leave because  if it was an elected government of Iraq  and weve been asked to leave other places in the world .
If it were an extremist government , then I think we would have other challenges , but I dont see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the Iraqi government over to the Iraqi people .
# McCain 's criticism of Obama as less able in matters of foreign policy has increased during the week leading up to Obama 's trip overseas which began this weekend and will continue into next week .
" This success that we have achieved is still fragile and could be reversed , " McCain said to Reuters Thursday .
" And if we do what Sen . Obama wants to do , then all of that could be reversed , " and leave behind chaos and Iranian influence , he said .
A ad released by the McCain campaign Friday sharply criticized Obama of shifting positions on Iraq " to help himself become president . "
An MSNBC story discusses McCain 's attacks on Obama leading up to his trip to Afghanistan and other Middle East countries .
Did you know you do n't need a doctorate from Bible school in order to understand and learn the mysteries of God and receive revelation from Him in the Bible ?
According to Christ , " The Spirit of Truth will come and TEACH YOU ALL TRUTH . " - John 16:13 .
This is a convenient truth that has been hidden by religion from everyone in plain sight .
Why ?
Control and financial security .
Religion has once again found a way to make God their cash cow !
In this way , you think that the only way to learn about God is by going to church .
Religion in turn receives consistent members , income and control over how much truth is given to you .

From the Langtang Region to the Annapurna Circuit , this guide takes you through five of the most beautiful and rewarding treks in the Himalayas .
When you walk the crowded streets of Thamel , Kathmandu you will be bombarded by signs advertising trekking tours , guide companies , and a number of shops selling new and used gear .
Photo by phitar .
And with good reason : the treks in Nepal , which wind through the world ’s highest mountains , are unique in the world .
The only problem is picking which one you want to do first .
Here , in no particular order , are five of the best treks in Nepal :
1. The Langtang Region
A trek through the Langtang region will take you to 4,700 meters ( 15,419 feet ) with excellent views of both the Annapurna region to the west and the Makalu region to the east .
The trek also passes by Buddhist monasteries and a nature reserve renowned for animal viewing .
Perhaps the best thing about the 14 - day trek is that it begins near , or even in , Kathmandu .
This makes it very easy to organize and is an excellent option for those pressed for time or looking for an easy introduction to trekking in Nepal .
For more information about trekking in the Langtang region , check out the excellent guide at Yeti Zone .

2. The Mt. Everest Circuit
Nestled in the Khumbu region , home to Sherpa and Tibetan Buddhist cultures , there are many reasons to visit this area of Nepal besides getting a glimpse of Chomolungma , as Everest is known to the people who live around her .
Treks in the Khumbu typically range from 17 to 25 days , depending on the route .
Though it was once popular to begin treks into the Khumbu from just outside Kathmandu , heavy Maoist activity in these areas has forced most trekkers to fly to Lukla , which sits at 2,680 meters ( 9,380 feet ) .
From Lukla , most trekkers head straight for Namche Bazaar and then on to Gorek Shep , a small town that provides unparalleled views of Mt. Everest .
Going all the way to Everest base camp or making the route a loop by visiting the Gokyo Lakes ( highly recommended ) will both add days to the trip .
For help planning , the Yeti Zone has an excellent description of the Everest Circuit , including the Gokyo Lakes loop .
3. The Annapurna Circuit

The major trek in the west of Nepal is the Annapurna circuit .
Reaching a height of 5,300 meters ( 17,388 feet ) , the circuit traverses the incredible mountains and glaciers of the Annapurna Conservation Area .
The circuit takes between 16 and 20 days from Pokhara , Nepal ’s third largest city .
Though the elevations are just as high as in Khumbu , the Annapurna Circuit begins near sea level and allows more time for gentle acclimatization .
The Annapurna circuit is popular because it allows trekkers to pass through diverse terrain , from jungle to high alpine , and passes through a region dominated by Tibetan Buddhist culture .
At one point , trekkers even have the opportunity to look into the heavily restricted Mustang Region , which extends all the way into Tibet itself .
Yeti Zone also provides an excellent guide to the Annapurna Circuit .

4. The Annapurna Sanctuary
The Annapurna circuit itself does not actually go to the common base camp of Annapurna .
It is the Annapurna Sanctuary trek , which also begins from Pokhara , that leads to the base of this impressive 8,091 meter ( 26,545 feet ) mountain .
The trek takes between eight and ten days , round trip from Pokhara , and can be a real trial for the unacclimatized .
The base camp , at 4,157 meters ( 13,638 feet ) , can also be reached as an extension from the Annapurna Circuit .
At the edge of the base camp is the memorial to Anatoli Boukreev .
Boukreev , one of the world ’s great mountaineers , was killed in an avalanche on the peak in 1997 .
For lovers of mountains and mountain lore , the experience is moving , to say the least .
Matador Trips will be publishing a detailed guide of the Annapurna Sanctuary trek later in August .

5. Mt. Kangchenjunga Circuit
If you are looking for something a bit more remote and much less traveled , the trek to the base camp of Mt. Kangchenjunga ( 8,586 meters , 28,169 feet ) may be just the thing .
It is best to plan at least 20 days to reach the base camp of the world ’s third highest peak and return .
Unlike the other treks on this list , the amenities on the Mt. Kangchenjunga route will be basic .
While a tent is not required , expect meals of daal ( lentils ) , rice , chapati ( an unleavened bread ) , and the occasional vegetable curry .
Well off the beaten path , the Kanchenjunga Circuit is a great way to spend time with local Nepali people far away from the hordes of other trekkers who flood more popular treks in peak seasons .
For more information on the Mt. Kanchenjunga Circuit , check out Andris Bjornson ’s excellent guide at Matador Trips .

This library was originally born from a motivation to process sexps in Python .
S-expressions ( aka sexps ) are a concise way to represent structured data that both humans and computers can interpret .
A sexp might look like :
See , easy for humans to grasp , right ?
But what about computers ?
Let 's examine a family of [ currently ] related languages : Python , Ruby , C , and Java , but with emphasis on Python .
We 're going to assume that the sexp has been converted to a Python - style list or tuple already and thus looks like this :
s = ( ' quote ' , ( ' netlist ' , ( ' namespace ' , ' connector ' , ( ' main - board ' , ' J2 ' ) ) , ( ' namespace ' , ' fpga ' , ( ' main - board ' , ' U17 ' ) ) , ( ' net ' , ( ' connector ' , ' 1 ' ) , ( ' fpga ' , ' AE12 ' ) ) , ( ' net ' , ( ' connector ' , ' 2 ' ) , ( ' fpga ' , ' AA22 ' ) ) , ( ' net ' , ( ' connector ' , ' 3 ' ) , ( ' connector ' , ' 4 ' ) , ( ' fpga ' , ' B32 ' ) ) ) )
Phew !
That 's a lot of commas and quotes !
Here 's how one would normally process this statement in Python :
assert ( len(s ) == 2 and s [ 0 ] == ' quote ' ) netlist = s [ 1 ] assert ( len ( netlist ) > 0 and netlist [ 0 ] == ' netlist ' ) for item in netlist : assert ( len ( item ) > 0 ) if item [ 0 ] == ' namespace ' : assert ( len ( item ) == 3 ) name , components = item [ 1 ] , item [ 2 ] print ' namespace ' , name , components if item [ 0 ] == ' net ' : assert ( len ( item ) > 1 ) connections = item [ 1 :] print ' net ' , for namespace , port in connections : print ' %s : %s ' % ( namespace , port ) , print
There are several annoying aspects about this code .
The first annoying aspect is that the the programmer has to keep checking the size of lists before accessing items in the list .
The second annoying thing is that before unpacking a list , the programmer has to be certain what type of list is about to be unpacked .
Functional pattern matching solves these annoyances , freeing the programmer 's mind to focus on more important things !
Here is an example of what functional pattern matching looks like when it is officially supported by a language :
match s : when ( ' quote ' , netlist ) : match netlist : when ( ' netlist ' , * items ) : for item in items : match item : when ( ' namespace ' , name , components ) : print ' namespace ' , name , components when ( ' net ' , * connections ) : print ' net ' , for connection in connections : match connection : when ( namespace , port ) : print ' %s : %s ' % ( namespace , port ) , print
I 'm going to highlight a portion of each code to demonstrate where functional pattern matching really starts to pay off : when multiple cases must be handled .
Look more closely at this bit of Python which has more than one case :
... if item [ 0 ] == ' namespace ' : assert ( len ( item ) == 3 ) name , components = item [ 1 ] , item [ 2 ] ... if item [ 0 ] == ' net ' : assert ( len ( item ) > 1 ) connections = item [ 1 : ] ...
and also look at the pseudo code for these cases :
... match item : when ( ' namespace ' , name , components ) : ... when ( ' net ' , * connections ) : ...
Notice that the comparison , unpacking , and length checking all happen in one statement ( the when statement ) in the pseudo code .
To be fair , the Python code could be compacted a little bit more , but it is still too verbose and the programmer still must worry about indexing and unpacking :
... if len( item ) == 3 and item [ 0 ] == ' namespace ' : name , components = item [ 1 ] , item [ 2 ] if len( item ) > 1 and item [ 0 ] == ' net ' : connections = item [ 1 : ] ...
So far , the pseudo code looks kinda good .
What else could we ask for ?
How about nested patterns and also conditions .
Okay , here they are :
match s : when ( ' quote ' , ( ' netlist ' , * items ) ) , len( items ) >
0 : # <- look here !!
for item in items : match item : when ( ' namespace ' , name , components ) : print ' namespace ' , name , components when ( ' net ' , * connections ) : print ' net ' , for connection in connections : match connection : when ( namespace , port ) : print ' %s : %s ' % ( namespace , port ) , print
How about less indentation ?:
match s : when ( ' quote ' , ( ' netlist ' , * items ) ) , len( items ) > 0 : for item in items : match item : when ( ' namespace ' , name , components ) : print ' namespace ' , name , components when ( ' net ' , * connections ) : print ' net ' , for connection in connections : match connection : when ( namespace , port ) : print ' %s : %s ' % ( namespace , port ) , print

Reader Submission
When in the Course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the Powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature ’s God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men ,
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed .
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shown , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object , evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Americans ; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government .
The history of the present Washington government is a history of repeated injuries and usurptations , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States and Peoples .
To prove this , let Facts be submitted to a reading world .
Government has refused to honor the Constitution , a most wholesome and necessary protection for the public good .
Government has forbidden the 50 states to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless the Supreme Court Assent should be obtained ; and with the States so restricted , Washington has utterly neglected the needs of freedom .
Government has refused to pass other Laws for the protection of the nation ’s border , unless those people would relinquish the right of self defense , a right inestimable to all people , and rights feared by tyrants only .
Government has restricted protesting bodies to places unusual , uncomfortable , and distant from the media and public view , for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with government measures .
Government has dissolved Churches and Militia , for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people .
Government has refused for a long time , after such dissolutions , to defend with laws the rights of the people which cannot be Annihilated , or have returned to the People these rights for their exercise .
The borders remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without , and crime and convulsions within .
Government has endeavored to prevent the population of these States from obstructing the of Invasion of Foreigners ; refusing to pass laws to discourage their migrations , and raising the conditions for a new Defense of Our Lands .
Government has obstructed the Administration of Justice , by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing competing and separation of powers .
Government has made Judges defenders of Washington ’s will alone , for the upholding of their statutes , and the blocking of legal dissent .
Government has erected a multitude of New Offices , and sent hither swarms of Homeland Officers to harass our People , and confiscate their substance .
Government has kept among us , in times of peace , Standing Armies of bureaucrats without the Consent of our legislatures or the people .
Government has affected to render the Homeland Security independent of and superior to the Civil power .
Government has combined with other nations to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution , and unacknowledged by our laws ; giving Washington ’s Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation — public policy –
For placing large bodies of armed officers among us for enforcing them , through mock hearings , and protecting from Punishment for any Crimes which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these Peoples .
For restricting our Communication with all parts of the world with the internet ,
For imposing Illegal Reserve Notes on us without our Consent ,
For depriving us in many cases , of the true benefits of Trial by Jury ,
For transporting us beyond Seas to be punish pretended offences of foreign nations ,
For abolishing the free System of Common Laws in our local communities , establishing instead an Arbitrary government , and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these States ,
For taking away our Local Control , abolishing and declaring Unconstitutional our most valuable Laws , and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Self Government ,
For suspending our own Laws , and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all local cases whatsoever .
Washington has destroyed Government here , by declaring us potential terrorists and waging War against us .
Government has plundered our drinking water , contaminated our vaccines , dumbed down our schools , and in the name of child protection , destroyed the Lives of our people .
Washington is at this time transporting large armies of Blackwater mercenaries to complete the works of death , desolation and tyranny , already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and Viciousness scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages , and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation .
Washington has constrained our fellow Citizens to bear Arms for their own protection , becoming helpless to the executioners of their friends and Brethren , or to fall themselves by their lawless Hands .
Washington has excited domestic insurrections amongst us , and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our land , the merciless planned terrorism , whose known rule of warfare , is an undistinguished destruction of all ages , sexes and conditions .
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms :
Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury .
A Ruler , whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant , is unfit to be the ruler of a free people .
Nor have We been wanting in attention to our American brethren .
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us .
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our enslavement and personal destruction here .
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity , and we have emplored them by the ties of our common history to disavow these usurpations , which would inevitably interrupt our freedoms and personal wealth .
Washington too has been deaf to the voice of justice and of personal freedoms .
We must , therefore , acquiesce in the necessity , which denounces our enslavement , and hold Washington , as we hold the rest of mankind , Enemies when subjecting us to total control , but in Freedom Friends .
We , therefore , the People of the Land , in General Assent , United and appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions , do , in the Name , and by Authority of the good People of these States , solemnly publish and declare , That these United States are , and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States ; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the Central Government , and that all political connection between the States , and the Government of Washington , is and ought to be totally dissolved ; and that as Free and Independent States , they have full Power to Protect Borders , enforce the laws , oppose centralization , establish Freedom , and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do .
And for the support of this Declaration , with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes and our sacred Honor .

AVC , Application View Controller
is a multiplatform , fully automatic , live connection among graphical interface widgets and application variables for the python language .
supports in a uniform way the most popular widget toolkits : GTK + wxWidgets .
The Swing widget toolkit for the java environment is also supported via the jython compiler .is a python package that can be imported by any python or jython application .
The display and the control of some application data through a GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) is a central problem in GUI programming , it absorbs a relevant part of the programming effort .
makes this programming very easy , far more easy than traditional solutions based on MVC ( Model View Controller ) .
23 - Feb -2016 : released AVC 0.11.0 .
New support for python 3 . Now AVC can work with both python 2 and 3 with the widget tookits that support python 2 and 3 : GTK3 , Qt4 , Tk. Python 3 support for Swing and Wx toolkits is not yet available at least as debian package .
Thanks to Stephan P. Helma for his code contribution for python 3 support .
There are no ramps here or guide dogs .
The ground is uneven and strewn with rocks , muddy in some places , gravelly in others .
Even for those with perfect vision , it is difficult to walk without tripping .
But somehow Mr. Ramathan does it , navigating the gullies and the slimy sewage ditches , the Pepsi trucks parked like boulders in the middle of alleyways and the maniacal bicycle taxis that zoom across the road without a moment ’s notice .
He was clipped by a car a few years ago .
His right knee still hurts .
But he keeps going .
Officials in Uganda ’s blind community say Mr. Ramathan has become a hero to the estimated 500,000 Ugandans who are blind .
“ Here is a man who is showing that blindness is not the end of the world , ” said Francis Kinubi , chairman of the Uganda Blind Sports Association .
He said Mr. Ramathan was helping raise attention and much - needed money .
This year the association will miss the Paralympic Games in Beijing because it did not have the $ 200 to begin the registration process , much less the money to cover the airfare , a telling sign of how few resources are available for disabled people in much of Africa .
Mr. Ramathan , who says he is either 36 or 37 ( he does not know precisely ) , hails from Naguru , a poor neighborhood just outside downtown Kampala , Uganda ’s capital .
Naguru is known for its red - dirt hills , its zinc - roofed shanties and its fast hands .
Uganda has a strong fighting tradition , going back to the flamboyantly cruel dictator Idi Amin , who was a heavyweight boxer himself .
And within Uganda , Naguru has produced some of the nation ’s hardest hitters , like John Mugabi , known as the Beast , who fought in the United States and nearly beat Marvin Hagler ; and Michael Obin , a national welterweight champ .
Countless other aspiring Naguru contenders skip rope , pump rusty iron and spar in dimly lighted cinderblock gyms that are squeezed between the shanties and that house all the often glorified nonglories of the boxing underworld : the saggy punching bags , the flattened noses and the oversize street kid dreams .

On Tuesday , Toshiba launched the
Qosmio G55 -802
Windows Vista Home Premium ( SP1 , 64 - bit )
Windows Vista Home Premium ( SP1 , 32 - bit )
Tohiba Quad Core HD Processor
Intel Core 2 Duo Processor P7350 ( 2 GHz )
NVIDIA ® GeForce 9600M GT
4GB PC2-6400 DDR2 800MHz SDRAM
500GB : Two 250 GB 5400rpm hard drives
DVD - SuperMulti ( +/-R double layer ) with Labelflash drive
Atheros Wireless LAN ( 802.11b/g/n )
Bluetooth V2.1 + EDR
18.4 " Screen , the first laptop available with the Cell CPU .
Yep , think PS3 technology , developed jointly by Toshiba , Sony , and IBM .
The laptop has the following features , for $ 1549.99 :
However , in particular , the Cell CPU is not about gaming , but about a multimedia experience .
Taking the load away from the Intel CPU , the Cell processor
performs
the following , as Toshiba indicates on the site
Gesture Control
What if you could start , pause , fast - forward and rewind a movie without a remote control — just by moving your hands ?
No , it ’s not part of a sci - fi novel but Toshiba ’s new Gesture Control technology .
And it ’s unbelievable .
Used with your DVD player , Windows Media Player and other select programs , it offers cutting - edge simplicity and convenience .
Amazing !
Face Navigation
— or that unforgettable scene in home movies and Hollywood films .
From your favorite actor to dear Aunt Freda , the new Toshiba Face Navigation feature captures facial expressions so you can quickly locate the part of the video you want to see .
It also provides thumbnails of scenes and soundtracks to help you find your way around .
Very cool .
Transcoding
If you ’re into home video editing you know how long it can take to process those big files before your masterpiece is ready — sometimes over an hour to convert a typical 1GB movie .
But with the powerful new Toshiba Quad Core HD Processor , transcoding can take as little time as ten minutes .
You ’ll be finished so fast they ’ll be raving for a sequel .
Upscaling to HD
With the Toshiba upconvert technology on the amazing Qosmio G55 - Q802 laptop you can output movies in glorious high - definition on your home entertainment system .
This technology can upscale standard - definition video to high - definition *— and breathe new life into your entertainment .
So why settle for low resolution any longer ?
Interestingly ( and necessary , with 4 GB of RAM ) , the system comes with 64 - bit Vista installed by default , but 32 - bit Vista ships with the laptop as well .
" The exorbitant demands of the US leaders and the global Zionism which have created the current situation in Iraq , Afghanistan , Sudan and Caucasus are gradually directing the world to the edge of the cliff , " he said .
I ’ve been blogging about the housing bubble since September of 2006 .
During the initial months , I was receiving 50 to 60 hits a day .
Now in a few short months , we are reaching an audience of thousands a day .
Suddenly 90 % of articles in the mainstream media are negative about the housing bubble .
We have folks making chump change being able to find access to millions of dollars in credit simply because they have a pulse and are able to fog the mirror on their leased Lexus .
Even though I ’ve featured over 24 homes in Real Homes of Genius , I still get people in the delusional state thinking that there is no housing bubble .
“ Dr. Housing Bubble , you cherry pick homes and what does that prove ? ” they say in a condescending manner .
Aside from the fact that the median value of homes is outrageously priced in every county in Southern California ( and the median is derived from an aggregate of homes )
I ’m simply making the story more tangible for the readers who still have doubts .
To quell these doubts , I spent a few hours picking two homes in each of 5 major counties in Southern California to highlight the magnitude of this bubble .
After all ,
If I ’m able to find 10 homes in Wonderland in a few hours how many more out there exist ?
Today we have a special Real Homes of Genius , today we salute you Southern California with our Real Homes of Genius Award .
Riverside County
# 10 – Riverside
Price : $ 209,000
Sqaure Feet : 768
Median Rent in Area : $ 700
Our first home takes us to Riverside proper .
This beautiful 3 bedroom mansion is a fixer - upper and a handy man special .
Once you dump $ 100,000 in renovations , you can expect a whopping rental income of $ 700 a month even though your monthly payment will run somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 2,000 .
Talk about cash flow !
Initially this home was priced at $ 295,000 but so many people were stopping by , they decided to knock off nearly $ 100,000 because it was too fantastic .
Maybe in a few more months , they ’ll bring it down by another $ 100,000 .
# 9 – Perris
Price : $ 234,900
Square Feet : 850
Median Rent in Area : $ 695
Why live in Paris France when you can live in Perris California !
This is how the rich and famous live .
This wonderful 850 square foot home is inspired by the architectural genius of Da Vinci and you can tell by looking at the picture above .
This home is designed to entertain that pesky and picky buyer out there who wants everything but is on a $ 300,000 or less budget .
The so called champagne taste with a beer income .
Even though your monthly payment will range from $ 2,100 you will be able to rent it out for a whopping $ 695 .
No wonder why Donald Trump is so rich .
Real estate investing is easy .
Where do we sign up ?
San Bernadino County
# 8 – Fontana
Price : $ 273,900
Square Feet : 728
Median Rent in Area : $ 725
Our next home takes us to Fontana in the heart of San Bernardino County .
This place is bank owned and the upkeep is impeccable as you can tell from the picture above .
The lawn has n’t been mowed in ages but hey , we are talking Southern California here and money grows on trees ( and lawns for that matter ) .
This 728 square foot beauty is banked owned and ready for you to invest in .
Even though the bank is holding onto appraisals from 2005 and is desperately hoping yesteryear will come again , we are crossing our fingers for the Easter Bunny to arrive .
This place will carry a monthly nut of about $ 2,500 but you ’ll be raking in the cold hard green at $ 725 a month .
Another cash flow property for you !
We ’re quickly on our way to becoming real estate moguls …
# 7 – Victorville
Price : $ 190,000
Square Feet : 860
Media Rent in Area : $ 550
Alert !
This place is so hot we had to get James Bond to take a snap shot of this place via telescopic camera .
This gorgeous 860 square foot home is amazing in one of the hottest ( literally ) areas of Southern California .
As you can see from the picture , you may have a lot of vacant land ( desert ) next to you but hey , this is for potential growth here !
Think big !
Do n’t let the neg - head housing bears bring you down to reality .
It is much funner in made up world , trust me .
Even though you ’ll pay $ 1,500 a month in taxes and fees , you can rent it out for $ 550 a month .
The bank will love you with your maximum cash flow strategies .
San Diego County
# 6 – Chula Vista
Price : $ 295,000 – $ 350,000
Square Feet : N / A
Median Rent in Area : $ 818
Here we see a wonderful pricing tactic found only in high priced metro areas , the range .
We give you a range that is open to a 20 % negotiation value and you give us an offer .
The seller of this place tells us that this place is “ not for the faint of heart ” because this magnificent lawn will knock your socks off and maybe give you a coronary explosion .
By the look of this place and the lot , we can speculate that it is 800 + square feet .
Your monthly nut will be from $ 2,400 to $ 2,700 , we ’ll give you a range as well , and you will cash flow with $ 818 a month in rent .
Going down
South makes a whole lot of sense eh ?
# 5 – National City
Price : $ 299,900
Square Feet : 432
Median Rent in Area : $ 820
If you ’re the patriotic sort , what better place to live than National City ?
We have this wonderful sprawling 432 square foot palace at $ 299,900 .
Like the car ads you see for $ 9,999.99 , this place is designed to attract the sub - $ 300,000 buyers .
When we look at the median rent in the area we see that a place like this with $ 50,000 in renovations will go for $ 820 a month .
Maybe I should write a book like Robert Kiyosaki because with all these positive cash - flow properties , 24 hours in a day simply is n’t enough !
Orange County
# 4 – Anaheim
Price : $ 459,900
Square Feet : 850
Median Rent in Area : $ 995
Home of Disneyland and Mickey Mouse .
Also home to interesting depth of field photography .
This gorgeous half - a- million dollar home rests beautifully on 850 square feet .
Even though your mortgage will run you $ 3,500 a month , you can rent this place out for $ 995 .
Go out and refinance your home equity and put a down payment on this place now !
This investment opportunity will not last .
# 3 – Santa Ana
Price : $ 435,000
Square Feet : 910
Median Rent in Area : $ 945
All these fantastic deals are making me itchy to call my mortgage broker !
I ’m sure you ’re getting juiced up to purchase each of these homes .
This next beauty is nestled in Santa Ana .
At 910 square feet it is one of the larger homes we are featuring .
When we analyze the income of folks in the area , they are pulling in slightly below $ 50,000 per year for family income .
The monthly payment on this place will be around $ 3,500 so that ’ll eat up about 90 % of their net income .
Who cares about debt ratios when you can use leverage to make it happen !
Time to act since this place is not only in SoCal , but in the OC .
Los Angeles County
# 2 – Huntington Park
Price : $ 359,000
Square Feet : 669
Median Rent in Area : $ 950
There is no other place like Huntington Park .
Easily confused with Huntington Beach , this area in Los Angeles has a lot of potential .
I ’ve featured a couple of places in a previous Real Homes of Genius in this area , but this 669 square foot dream home is for the ages .
Even though you ’ll be paying about $ 2,800 a month in carrying costs , you will be able to recoup that by renting this place out for $ 950 a month .
Business is good my friends !
# 1 – Compton
Price : $ 279,000
Square Feet : 639
Median Rent in Area : $ 800
Our final home brings us to Compton California .
Above we have a wonderful 639 square foot home for $ 279,000 .
This magnificent place is under $ 300,000 , in Southern California , and therefore you should buy it .
Philosophy and logic will prove this out in any theorem .
This place is a must for any savvy real estate investor .
Yes , your carrying cost will be about $ 2,300 a month but you ’ll be renting it out for $ 800 .
I see many light bulbs turning on and all you potential investors are making a beeline to your agents office .
This one wo n’t last folks !
Conclusion
Archimedes of Syracuse , the mathematician and engineer from Southern Italy figured if you could give him enough leverage , he alone could move the entire world .
I know with enough credit leverage , you ’ll find a way to purchase all the above properties .
And the exciting thing is that you ’ll find enough hungry brokers willing to finance you on all these properties .
All you need to do is try .
If you do n’t try , you are guaranteed to fail but if you make a serious and wholehearted attempt , you will succeed beyond your wildest dreams .
Yes the numbers do n’t work out exactly to your advantage but finance and real estate evaluation is for sissy pansies who have no guts to take a risk in real estate .
Even though I invest out of state in properties that cash - flow positively , maybe I ’m missing something with the negative cash - flow game here in my home town .
It is time to take advantage of this spectacular time in history .
From the Southern tip of Chula Vista , to the desert city of Victorville , to the OC , and finally coming back to Compton California we have plenty of deals to go around .
Today we Salute you Southern California with the Real Homes of Genius Award .

■雲間に聳え立つ史上最高峰音源 ・AirMac
Express コメント 集
アップル のAirMac Expressこそが、あらゆるものを超えて聳え立つ最高峰の音源であることが、発覚し
てしまいました 。
おそらくそれは使い方次第で、アナログの初期盤をも、いとも軽く超えてみせてくれるでしょう。
ここに専用コメント欄を設けましたが、私がメールを切り貼りしているだけですので、コメントがいっ
こうに増えないなどという可能性も大いにあります。
AirMac Express関連のメールが来なければコメントも増えませんので、ご了承ください。
このページを設けなくてはならなかった理由は、私のところにAirMac Expressについての問い合わせが
殺到していることもあります。
また、私自身が、皆さんの実験結果や、貴重な情報の恩恵を受けさせていただきました。その恩返しと
いう意味もあります。それと、オーディオを始めたばかりという素人さんも多いです。素人さんにも分
かるようになれば、幸いです。
このページは 、
36）（新）無敵のCDプレーヤーiPod & パソコン・コメント集
の結論の 「続編」に該当します。問題は、アップルコンピューター販売のAirMac Expressに絞ります。
分かりにくいかたは、そちらの結論から読まれてください。
■注意事項（超重要） ：
この種の音源、突出して優れている音源は全てそうですが、音の焦点が急激に変化します。それにより、
CDプレーヤーのほうがiPodより音が良い？？などという大間違いに陥って、その地獄から、未来永劫、
抜け出せなくなります 。
これは基本事項ですので、初心者のかたは必ず下記の音の焦点を読まれて、この種の優れた音源を導入
されてください。でないと、良いものを悪いと断定するなどという、トンチンカンな結果になってしま
います。症状としては、音がシャープになる、ピーキーになり、中低域が出ないなどです。それこそが、
音が劇的に濃密になり、良くなっている現象です。そのままではそれが良いも悪いも皆目分かりません。
それを通常の音に戻すための基礎知識と、特に、それを「実行する能力」が必要です。下記がその基礎
です。

■注意事項２ ：
AirMac Expressが、iTunes史上サイコーとされた、前コメント集の最後に登場した化け物さんの環境に
ついて書いておきます 。
彼の使っているパソコンはマックブックプロです。ノートパソコンであり、バッテリー駆動なのです。
i Podの優位性として、バッテリー駆動ということを、最初に私があげていることに、再度、注目してく
ださい。ノートパソコンも同じくバッテリー駆動です。
さらに、ファイヤーワイヤー800で、外付けレイドの、２テラのハードディスクを音源にしています。
内蔵ハードディスクでは、限界があるのです。 そしてそれは、インテルマックの最新ノートです。
デスクトップパソコンのかたは、iPodにかなわない可能性が大いにあります。また、AirMac
Expressそ
のものの電源をどこから取っているのか、それも非常に大きな要素になります。これには注意されてく
ださい。前コメント集のかたがたは最低でも200V環境+アース環境、又はアイソレーション電源を備え
ているかたがたが大半です。
したがって 、 「良いと書いてあるから良いだろう。」というような単純なものではなく、電源も、ラン
ケーブルも、あらゆる意味でスキがあっては成立しなくなるかもしれない、これは非常に厳しいことで
もあります。その意味でも 、AirMac Expressは、雲間に隠れて聳え立っている山です。
デジタル機器ほど、電源に左右されるものはありません。経験的に、電源で最も激変するのはデジタル
機器です。パソコンこそ、その代表です。なぜか？、電源に性能を左右されてしまう半導体の数が半端
なものではなく、数百万個、数千万個というほどに膨大な数に及ぶからです。
オーディオを始めてみようかというかた、又は、始めたばかりというかたは、手始めはiPodの最新型が
いいです。それらを考慮するに、音源の最終回答は、iPodのままで十分なことです。iPodも、劇的に音
がシャープになり、情報量が増えますので、これもまた、「音の焦点」を合わせ直すテクニックが必要
なことは、言うまでもありません。また、iPodそのものは、今後も果てしなく進化していくでしょう。
もちろんiPodでなくとも 、AirMac Expressのほうが安いですし、それでもＣＤプレーヤーよりは圧倒し
て良いはずですので、iPodではなく、AirMac Experssだけでいいようなことでもあります。ただし、い
づれが良いのか、さらに良いほうをと、どこまでも求めていく姿勢は、すでにマニアの領域であること
は、お忘れにならないでください。それを求められるのであれば、徹底的に最後まで自力でやりとげる
覚悟が必要です。徹底的にやれば、AirMac Expressのほうが、iPodより数段上だということです。
前コメント集は、まったく偶然にも、信じがたいほどのヘビーユーザーのかたがた、ほとんどプロ集団
による解明の結果であったということを、認識されてください。
私自身はＣＤプレーヤーより良くなった段階で、いづれを選択されても、よしとされることを勧めます。
たかが音のことですから、あまりのめり込んでもいけないのだろうと、思う次第です。これらの音源は、
どれもこれも、とてつもなく大それたものです。
重要なことは、iPodからして、そのレベルは非常に高く、完全にその領域に入ってしまっているという
ことです 。
このことこそが、iPodや 、AirMac Expressの、音の濃密さすら分からないというかたが発生する原因に
なっています 。
この種の音源を使いこなすための必須は、音の焦点です。音の焦点を、避けて通ることは出来ません。
まず第一の基本、初歩の初歩は 「 音の焦点」の理解です。

■追加情報 その１
あるかたから、メールをいただきました。
— — — — — ————
AirMac Expressのコメント集を拝見して思ったのですが、無線LANの規格（IEEE802.11b、g 、a等）が、
通信時に転送中の実データとデータ欠損を補修するためのデータといっしょに転送するのでエラー訂正
された状態と同じになるのではないでしょうか。ご存知かもしれませんが・・・
— — — — — ————
とのことです。プリンターがエラー訂正するのは、当たり前のことですから、やはりそうだったのですね。
音楽情報を、プリンター情報であるかのように自動的に扱ってしまう、ということです。AirMac
Express
には、案の定、強力なエラー訂正が効いていたということです。
■追加情報 その２ （超重要 ）
■あの４番さんからのさらなる追加情報 （壁コンセントの最終回答 その２ ）
プロケーブル 様
○○です 。
恥を忍んでご報告します。
私ったら、本当に愚か者でした。
今、壁コンセント に1512Kをつけてみたんです。
やっぱり、これが最高峰です。
回転ロック式 の1162Pよりず〜っと上です。
1162Pはたしかにホスピタルグレード、1318よりはるかに良いですけど、
ほんの少し締まりがなく、
それが気になっ て1512Kにしてみたのですが、
すっかり直ってしまいました。
本当にもう、なにをやっていたんでしょうねえ…。
AirMacのあの出っ張りがアースだとは、ビックリしました。
妙に大げさな部品だと感じていたのですが、
そういうことだったんですね。
で、ためしにアルミホイルで包んでみましたが、
全然変わりませんでした（笑）
それでは 。

○○○ ○
プロケーブル注：）松下医療用1318より、1162Pのほうがずっと上、
1512Kは、さらにず〜〜と上ということになります。工事業者の持っ
ているものが、いかにレベルが高いものなのか、1318ごときのゴミ
とは、雲泥の違いであることを、このコメントにて、思い知ってく
ださい 。
もうこれで壁コン問題は十分でしょう。見過ごすことのできないほど、
非常に重要なコメントでしたので、追加掲載せざるを得ませんでした。
ただし、無茶苦茶なセッティングのかたには、その違いは分からない
でしょう。非常にハイレベルな問題と言えます。
プロケーブル注：）医療用の1318について追記しておきます。
この種の壁コンセントは、そもそも「音」の為のものではありません。医療用現場で、
医療用機器が壁コンセントから抜けないよう、配慮されて、圧が高めてあるものです。
したがって、音としてはゴミだったとしても、医療現場では、貴重品であり、必需品
です。
人命がかかっている医療現場では、それは必需品なのです。
用途がまるで違うのです。ということは、そもそも、用途違いの壁コンセントを
オーディオ用として、売り始めた者がいけないわけで、松下電機さんには、その
ような考えはまるで皆無であったというのが真相でしょう。
松下電機さんは、単に医療用現場で、人命を守る為の壁コンセントを開発したと
いう事です。これは凄い事です。普通の電機メーカーにそのような依頼が来るで
しょうか 。
この事だけは、松下電機さんの名誉の為に、明瞭にしておかなくてはなりません。
■追加情 報 その３（東大阪の１４番さんの重要事項！）
これは付け加えざるを得ません。これは超重要事項です！
Subject : AirMacExpressの件
Pro Cable様
東大阪市の○○です 。
私の発言内容で大切な部分の訂正があります。
いえ、大切かどうかはわかりませんが、法則を否定した内容だった
のでメールさせていただいてます。
と申しますのは 、AirMac Expressの使い方の件ですが、私は
この古いiBook G4では本体からの音はダメと書きました。
（プロケーブル注：14番さんの最初のほうのコメントです。）
しかし、これ又お恥ずかしい話ですが、あの時はボロいプリからの
音だったのです。プリがボロくてその差を僅差と判定し、なおかつ
ぼけたように聞こえていたのをダメと判定したためでしたが、
今日早めに家に帰れましたので、急に思い立ってパワーアンプ直結で
iBook本体から取 るAirMac Express（複数のスピーカー）の音を
確認したら、こりゃとんでもなく音が良かったです。
比べても仕方ないといったアナログと十分肩を並べております。
AirMac Expressのアースを取っていない状態でです( ^^ ; ) 。
これは早急に何か策を講じる問題ではありますが。。。
うちの環境でCDがアナログを越えられない壁として、大太鼓の
「 ドーン」という音が、CDでは「ドーン」のところ、
アナログだと 「ドー〜ゥァ〜ン」とでも書けばいいのでしょうか
皮のしなる音が再現されるのにといった状況がありました。
AirMac Express直ですと、その間ぐらいは行っていたので十分だと
思っていましたが、iTunesでの複数のスピーカーにてしっかり
AirMac Expressを認識させてiBook本体よりパワー直結の音は
正にアナログで再現されるその音が出ました。
そのように訂正させていただきます。
プロケーブル注：）さぁ、これで、化け物さんと、東大阪の１４番
さん、アナログを極めるお二人のかたの意見が一致したわけです。
これはもう疑いのないことと考えてください。パソコン本体から音
を取るほうが、音は、やはりいいのです。
それで良くない場合には、何らかの別の要因が関わっていると思わ
れます 。
それにしても、たった数分で縄目を抜け、鮮やかな脱出トリックを
見せてくれた、あの化け物、一瞬の間隙を縫うかのような登頂
スピードには、今さらながら恐れ入ります。
それにして もAirMac Express、すでにアナログと対等ですか、おそ
らくこのかたは、アナログ初期盤レベルの事を言っています。
ということは、本質的には、すでにアナログを抜き去ってしまって
いる可能性が、大いにあります。
AU LAB + AirMac Expressなどは、また異次元というほどに、上の音
のはずです。さら にAirMacにアースを取ると・・・？？
ただ、アナログは、ボロいプリアンプを通しています。DJミキサー
などのプロ用プリアンプ+その付属のフォノイコなどを持ってきて、
徹底的にフラットになるようチューニングすれば、アナログ初期盤
も、さらに劇的に良くなることも同時に目に見えていますので、や
はりアナログとの正面からの比較は、差し控えたいと思います。
AirMac Expressの、音のレベルが、いかなる次元のものか分かれば、
それだけで十分です 。
注：）これにて、完全に 「結論」は出たと思います。
追加コメント類もこれにて終了します。やはりアナログのかたが終了
に関わるというパターンからは、逃げれそうにありません。

１４番さんのコメント：東大阪の１４番さん再登場、これで十分です。
Subject : AirMac Express & 非メッキメガネプラグケーブル
Pro Cable様
東大阪の○○です。お世話になってます。
少しじっくり聴く時間が取れましたので報告です。
結論から申しますと、何はともあれ非メッキプラグ様々です。
こないだは小さい音だったので気付きませんでしたが、
iTunes + AirMac Expressでもう充分です。
サイトの4番さんが仰っているように非メッキ率の問題が
結局一番大きいのかも知れません。
このメガネ端子電源コードを使用する事によって、
もううちではメッキになってる部分はAirMac
Expressの
メガネオス部分だけになりました。WEケーブルは別ですね。
この電源コードに替えた音は激変だったようです。
QuickTime ＋AirFoil +AirMac Expressを試しましたが、
iTunesとの差がさほど気にならない程度になってます。
あんな筐体でデジタルですから、電源ケーブルの変更もしくは
メッキの弊害を強烈に受けていたのではないでしょうか？
QuickTimeによる再生は勿論iTunesを凌ぐものでしたが、
使い回しが楽なiTunesでもう充分かなって気持ちです。
アナログを越えるという感嘆詞を最後にしようと思いましたが、
CDP では得られないデジタル音源の凄さはアナログのそれと
比較しても仕方ないという気がしてきました。
非メッキメガネケーブルを使用する事で、既にデジタル臭というのは
一掃された気がします。しかし、それはアナログとの比較で言う
それとは違う気がします。
何故ならアナログのそれは使用される機器に因る違いが大き過ぎて
デジタルのそれと比較すると危険な誤解を招きかねないからですね。
うちで はQuickTimeを使用してもまだアナログの方が良いというのが
本音なのですが、今うちで のAirMac Expressを使用する環境で出きる限りの
事をやった結果なだけで、パソコン本体の変更や有線での比較、
AU LAB を使用した場合など条件を変える事により、もっと凄い事に
なる可能性は多いにあるというのは充分考えられます。
AirMac Expressから出てくる音は至高のデジタル音です。
CDに詰まっている音が、デタラメなＣＤＰや接続コードや電源の影響で
デジタルは糞という私の思い込みが払拭されたそのことこそが
最も重要な事だったのです。

Subject : AirMac Expressのアース
プロケーブル 様
AirMac Expressのコンセント部分は取り外し可能になっていて、
どうやらその金属の出っ張りがアース端子も兼ねているみたいで、
MacBookについてくる電源ケーブルを接続するとAirmacのアース
がコンセント先端のアースへと導かれるようです。
ネット でAirMac Expressの分解写真を見つけましたが( 転載不可 ) 、
一番太く見えている緑色のケーブルが金属の出っ張りの裏から出て、
電源基 盤( おそらく ) に接続している様に見えます。
AirMac Expressからアイソレーション100V電源にアースを落として
聞いてみると音はとても良かったです。
高域のひずみは確かに減ります。

歪みに関しては私の許容範囲よりもだいぶ低いレベルになります。
AirMac Expressの歪みが気になる人は試してみる価値はあると思います。
無線を使わないと決めて 、AriMac Express全体をシールドして、
AirMac+アルミホイル→Airホイルというのは如何でしょう？
（プロケーブル注：アルミホイルでシールドすると無線が通らなくなります。）
コンセントの差し方にもよりますが、4個あるコンセント口の右上より右下が
私の装置の場 合AirMacとの相性が良かったです。
( 左上はアンプ、左下はアースが届かない )
オーディオ雑誌にコンセントの場所で音が変わると書かれていて、
眉唾と思っていたのですが、変わるんですね。
○ ○○
プロケーブル注：）またしても、どんどんハイレベルになってきています。
旧コメント集のかたがたが出てくるたびに、ぞっとします。
なんと 、AirMac Expressのコンセントを外して出てくる金具がアース端子！
なんたることでしょうか。
200V導入のかたで、アースのあるかたは、そこにトランスなどからアース
線を引いて接続してやるだけで、音質向上すると思います。無線の場合です。
ランケーブル経由で音だしされる場合には、デスクトップコンピューターが
アースされている場合には、ランケーブルのマイナス側からAirMac

もアースされるはずですので、問題ないはずです。
ただ、本体がプラスチックですので、アルミホイルというのは、有効かもし

コンセントの位置によって、メッキの影響力が変わる、それは本当です。
アナログ重要機材に近いところにメッキプラグを差せば、メッキの音が回り
込みやすくなります。オール非メッキで音が合う場合には、あまり関係ない
と思います 。
なお、メッキプラグが、デジタル処理にも影響している可能性があります。
重鉄タップとマリンコシールドだけで、パソコンの通信速度が40から50に
上がったなどという報告を受けたことがあります。これは、通常100Vのか

４番さんからの、さらなる追加情報：壁コンセントの最終回答 その１
Subject : 松下の壁コンセントについて（AirMac Expressに最適の壁コン）
プロケーブル 様
○○です 。
続けざまにメールしてすいません。
最近ビックリしたことがあったのでご報告します。
松下（National）の壁コンセントのことです。
私が知る限りですが、非メッキ３芯のコンセントは３種類あります。
WN 1318 ホスピタルグレー ド
WN 1512 K 重鉄タップのも の
WN 1162P 回転ロック 式
実は私、ホスピタルグレードを使っていました。
先日、たまたま回転ロック式のものを見つけたので交換してみたんです。
ものすごい激変でした。一気に音がシャープになり、
WE16GA を調節して1.5cm×2回で３cm短くなりました。
（たった３cmですが、それがまた激変することにビックリ）
（プロケーブル注：音の焦点はWEの場合、1.5センチ単位ですから３センチでは激変です。）
理由は全然わからないのですが、
非メッキといえども、松下のホスピタルグレードはダメです。
（そういえばアースの穴から見えるのがメッキなのでそのせいかも？）
家庭用 の1512Kか1162Pにするべきです。
AirMac Expressを使うことで、そのことがよ〜く分かりました。
重鉄タップが1512Kであることのスゴさを思い知った次第です。
—
○○○ ○
プロケーブル注：）1318が全くダメなことは、私はもちろん知っていてやっている
ことです。中にステンレスのバネで補強して圧を出しているだけです。
それが音には、やっかいなことになります。何度も書いていることですが、家庭標準
のもの、電気工事屋さんが持ってくるものが一番いいということです。
その３ピンバージョンが1512Ｋです。それが壁コンセントの最高峰・最終回答です。
こんなものは、外国製でも、家庭の標準品ならば、同じ音でしょうが、標準品が特定
できないですからいけません。壁コンセントについては、外国製は、全て危険とみな
してください。国内に最高のものがある場合、わざわざ外国製を使う意味はないです。

のは、高価なものは全て、ことごとく、「鬼門」だということです。
また、壁コンなど、あれこれ変えたり悩んだりするなどということは、全くの無意味

４番さんからの、追加情報：これは、あまりにも、凄すぎます。
プロケーブル 様
○○です 。
> ところで 、AU LAB のバッファ容量を増やしていくと、
> AirMacを使わなくても、そのままでAirMacを越える
> と言われたかたがいたのですが、どうなんでしょう。
バッファ容量を増やし て
「 AU Lab →Airfoil →AirMac」にするともっとスゴイです。
もうサイコーです 。
ただ、連続再生ができないので
仕方なくてiTunesを使っているのが本音です。
AU Labのバッファ容量を増やすと、
音の濃さ、厚み、実在感等々、すべて向上します。
聴けば聴くほどiTunesが薄い音だと分かるので、困ります。
逆にバッファ容量をうんと少なくすると
ものすごくひどい音になります。
このことから、バッファが多ければ多いほど
音は良くなるものだと断定できます。
AU Labでバッファを増やすにはコツがあります。
値（Preferences … →Devices のFrames）を変更し
たら 、AU LabとAirfoilを両方とも終了して、起動しなおすんです。
そうしないと再生できなくなったりします。
無線使用を前提にし たAirMac Express（のAirTunes）は
バッファがかなり大きいはずですので、
これが音質の向上に貢献しているのは確かだと思います。
—
○○○ ○
プロケーブル注：）これは凄いです。凄すぎます。バッファ容量、タイムラグ、
その種のことがエラー訂正に大きく関わっていることは確かです。
この場合 、AirMac本体から音を取らざるを得ないかもしれませんが、もの凄い
音であることも、確かでしょう。複数のスピーカーにこれが設定できて、パソコ
ン本体から音が取れるのであれば、さらに凄いことになるのでしょうが、これは
出来るかどうか分かりません。
ウィンドウズでの最高の方法は、おそらくFrieve AudioとAirMac Express
の組み合わせでしょうか。マックの最高の方法はこれでしょうか。100dBくらい
までのスピーカーならば、これが最高の方法になるでしょう。
ただ、こちら のAU LABは非常にマニアックなことですので、マニアックなかた
しかやれないことかもしれません。
AU LAB というのは、前コメント集に登場してきていましたが、ウィンドウズの
かたには使えないことと 、OSXの場合も、OSのCD-ROMから、ディベロッパーズ
ツールというものをインストールしなくてはならないことなどから、一般向きで
ないことと考えて、大きくは取り上げませんでした。が、もの凄い潜在能力があ
ることは、確かです 。
また 、AU LAB も 、AirMac Expressと組み合わせてこそ、その真価を発揮するも
のなのでしょう 。
しかし、こういうことが起きているということ自体、ＣＤのパソコン再生の将来
には、まだまだ、ずっと先があるとみなしていいということになります。
音源はＣＤで十分な段階であって、技術面のほうが全く追いついていないという
ことが、どなたにも分かるでしょう。もの凄い、コメントであった次第です。
ただ、コンピューターメーカーは、やれと言われれば、ＣＤ情報をもっと引きず
り出すことくらい、おそらく、いつでもできるでしょう。
■ ＣＤのリッピング時のエラー訂正について
それから、気がついたことで、ＣＤのリッピングについて、ここに書いておきます。
リッピング時のエラー訂正というのは、厳格過ぎると、エラー訂正しきれず、何度
も同じところを読もうと繰り返して、途中で止まってしまいます。
したがって、iTunesのような万人が使うものは、適度なエラー訂正である必要があ
ります。問題は、どこまでエラー訂正するかです。最後までエラー訂正しようとす
ると、読めないＣＤが多発しますので、我々は、同じＣＤを何度も買いにいかなく
てはなりません 。
これは万人向けではないです。多くの場合、それはＣＤに入ったキズ、又はＣＤの
汚れによってもたらされます。そのあたり、どうやって折り合いをつけるかという
問題ですが、この問題も、限界まで読み、さらに読めない箇所は、５秒でパスする、
または１０秒でパスするようにするなど、当然、コンピューターメーカーは、やろ
うと思えばいつでもできるでしょう。
リッピングについても、万人向けであり、同時に厳格にということを両立したもの、
その種のiTunesなどは、未来に期待です。さらに音が濃くなるのは、目に見えてい
ます。単に時間の問題です。時を待ちましょう。
■もう一つ、ついでに重要事項を書いておきます。
コンピューターのソフトなど、全てデジタルは、１と0という信号からのみ成り立っ
ています。これは誰もが知るところです。ところが音楽ソフトの場合には、1と0と
いうだけの単純なものではないとのことです。
「1」というものの中には、様々な情報が詰め込まれており、音量の情報、音のあ
らゆる情報などなど、きりがありません。ということは、現段階でのエラー訂正が、
1と0だけのエラー訂正だったとしたら、エラー訂正していたとしても、とても追い
ついていないことになります 。AirMac Expressがどのような種類のエラー訂正なの
かは知りませんが、1と0だけのエラー訂正の可能性もあります。この問題一つとっ
てみても、まだまだこの先、ＣＤ情報というのは、無限に近く音を引きずり出せる
可能性を持ちます 。
ただこれは、実現に向かおうとすると、今までにないほどの、非常に厳格なエラー
訂正にならざるを得ず、ちり一つでマシンが停止してしまう可能性さえ出てきます。
リッピングにも、現在の数十倍もの多大なる時間、それに伴う大きなCPUパワーを
必要とするでしょう 。
しかしこれもまた、コンピューターメーカーが本気になりさえすれば、可能なこと
なのでしょう。この件もまた、未来への期待事項です。AirMac Expressが、将来的
にも継続して進化していくものであるならば、それが本命かもしれません。
さらに、すでに書いていることですが、録音現場、マスタリング現場の諸問題もあ
ります。その種の場所では、プロの現場であるにかかわらず、エラー訂正など皆無
なのです。少々のエラー訂正をするだけで、音が激変することを考えれば、どれだ
けのデジタル情報が、ＣＤになるまでに欠落しているのか、想像さえつかないほど
の量に違いありません 。
ということは、音楽は今のところＣＤで十分だということです。トータル技術が、
あまりに原始的な段階であり、全く追いついてもいない段階であるに、次世代の規
格などとい う 「 夢物語 」は、単なる「 お笑いごと 」
「お遊び」に過ぎないことは、
これだけの条件を考慮してみただけでも分かります。

１９番さんのコメント：「音の焦点」が、檜舞台、AirMac Expressに登場！
procable様、こんばんわ
○○です 。
AirMacExpressのコラムを毎回楽しみに読んでいます。
冒頭の 「音の焦点」の記述を見て、ハッとさせられました。
御社のサイトを最初に見たとき、その時は何のことか理解できなくて
読み飛ばしていてそのまま忘れていたのです。
WE16の長さは5mで購入してそのまま使っていました。
Rockbox仕様のiPodを接続していた時は気になりませんでしたが、
iTunesをAirMacExpress経由で再生すると、
クリアーだけどハイあがりというか、
低音が弱まっ てD75なのに微妙にデジタルアンプっぽい音になっ
てました 。
まさに下記の症状です 。
＞症状としては、音がシャープになる、ピーキーになり、中低域が出な
＞いなどです 。
＞それこそが、音が劇的に濃密になり、良くなっている現象です。
ひとまず思い切って4mにしてみたところ、低音が甦ってきました。
3.5mにするとさらに低音が出てきてボーカルも生音に近づいてきました。
そこから微調整して最終的に3.3mで落ち着きました。
あくまで自分の感覚的なものですが、この激変ぶりは
iPodにRockboxを導入したとき、或はiTunes に
AirMac Expressを追加したときと同等かそれ以上の違いでした。
いくら高価なレンズを使ってても焦点が合わなければ安いレンズとの差
なんてわからない、ということでしょうか。まさに音の焦点合わせという
言 葉がぴったりですね。
ちなみに電源全ては普通コンセントから100Vを使用しています。
こちらもいずれは改善していきたいと思いますので
その時はアドバイスよろしくお願いします。
プロケーブル注：）音の焦点について、何一つとして語ってこなかったオーディオ
というものは、 「 あてずっぽう 」 、「デタラメ」だったのだということに他なりま
せん。
結局のところ、ＣＤプレーヤーとて、わざとデジタルを欠落させてやると音が聞き
やすくなるぞ、そうしてやれ、などというレベルが、オーディオのレベルだったと
いうことです（デジタルが欠落していることなど、全く知らずにやっていただけで
しょう、と、想像します）。
なお、これは非常に重要なことですが、
＞iTunesをAirMacExpress経由で再生すると、
＞クリアーだけどハイあがりというか、
＞低音が弱まっ て
という一文にご注目ください。明らかにこれは、デジタル量が増えている、つまり
音が濃密になっている証拠に他なりません。高域は目立りやすいですから、その分、
「 相・対・的・に」、低音が弱く聞こえているだけです。
この種の音だけは、セッティングし直さなければ、価値など、皆目分かるはずがあ
りません。あくまでも、どこまでいっても、「基本」が重要だということです。

４番さんの追加コメント：（これも非常に重要ですが、高度なレベルの問題ですので、いったん、問題が複雑になります！）
プロケーブル 様
「 AirMac Express コメント集 」 ４番さんの○○です 。
私は、AirMac Expressから直接音声出力をとっています。
（注：なんと、複数のスピーカーに設定して、AirMac Express本体からだったです！）
Mac G4 MDD の音声出力からですと、ぼやけた音になります。
原因は分かっています。電源です。
オーディオとパソコンは電源をしっかりと分けていまして、
（ブレーカーが異なる壁コンセントで分けています）
パソコンの方はまったく電源対策をしていません。
オーディオの方は 、
松下の非メッキ壁コンセント
＋カナダ製アイソレーショントランス
＋重鉄タッ プ
と 、100Vですがなるべく最善の環境になるようにしています。
もちろん、ぼやけた音なんか全くしません。
AirMac Expressは重鉄タップに刺しています。
しかし直刺しではなく、非メッキ３芯→２芯アダプタを使って
重鉄タップに直接メッキが触れないようにしています。
上記の条件がたったひとつでも欠けると、
AirMac Expressは薄っぺらな音になり、聴いていられません。
メガネ端子ケーブルですが、先日、松下の非メッキプラグを使って
0.5mに短くしてみました。
それでも低域が鈍る傾向に変わりはありませんでした。メッキ/非メッ
キの比率が大きく影響しているのでしょうね）
これま でAirMac Expressを使ってみて、本当に電源に敏感だと、私も
思います 。
幸いにして、こちらで はAirMac Express＋iTunes で
アナログレコードと遜色のない「感興」を得られるようになりました。
Airfoil経由 のQuickTime Player やAU Labではもっと良い
音になるのですが 、
この「感興」のレベルに至ったことで、楽なiTunesにしています。
AirMac Expressで電源の重要さを再認識しましたので、
来年にはパソコンの方も電源対策をしようと考えています。
その時はよろしくお願いいたします。
（ 200Vにできないのが残念なんですけど）
プロケーブル注：）このかたは、ここでは４番さん、前コメント集１３９
番さんです 。
パソコン本体から音を取っているというのは、誤解だったようです。４番
さんは 、AirMac Expressから直に音を取っていました。複数のスピーカー
にセットしておいて 、AirMac Express本体からです。こんな手もあったの
ですね 。
このコメントから、あの手この手を尽くしても、AirMac Expressが、
非メッキでも合っていないことが分かります。といって、４番さんは、
メッキそのままでは問題があったのです。３ｍを0.5ｍにしても合わない、
これ電源ケーブルの問題ではなく、もちろんプラグの非メッキか否かによ
ります。こういうケースは、100V電源時、メッキの率が高すぎることに
よります 。
200+アイソレーションは、簡単です。全て非メッキで合います。それだ
けのシンプルなことになります。それゆえ、１７番さんには単純に非メッ
キにされてくださいとしています。
少しで も100Vが入ると、フラットな音を出すには、ある程度のメッキが
必要です。このことこそが、100V電源のかたの場合は、非メッキメガネ
にしても、まったくケースバイケースになる理由です。
AirMac Express内部は半導体の数、最低でも何万個と想像されますから、
電源により、大幅に性能が左右されるのは目に見えていることです。
電源という問題が、問題をややこしくしていると、認識ください。いづ
れが良いかの問題ではなく、どのような電源でセッティングしているの
か、という問題が、根深くからみついています。
これが多種多様の意見が出てくる原因でもありますが、他にはパソコン
の機種の違いもあるでしょう。一筋縄ではいかないことが、良く分かり
ます。
ただし、シンプルにしてしまえば終わります。200+アイソレーションな
らば、オール非メッキで、いつでも決着のつくことでもあります。
100Vの場合には、音を聞きながら、メッキの率を自分で決めていかなく
てはなりません。具体的には、このかたは、非メッキアダプターをかます
ことによって上手に逃げています。そこしか合わないという、たった一点
を、見いだしていると言えます。
こういう複雑なパズルのようなことが、実は音の正体です。そのようなこ

１７番さんとの、メールのやりとり：
Subject : AirMac Express を導入した際の音の焦点につい て
プロケーブル 様
○○です 。
AirMac Expressの件で、私の環境でiPodに劣る原因としてとても重要なことが一点ありま
す。それ はAirMac Expressの電源をダウン＆アイソレーションから直に取っていないという
ことです 。
理由はメッキの音が混ざるのを嫌ったのと、ダウン＆アイソレーションの100Vがすべて埋まっ
ていて 、115V以外空いていなかったためです。
私はダウン＆アイソレーションを導入の際に、プロケーブル様からのアドバイスで、「以前
入手したカナダのアイソレーションを使えばメッキの音がアイソレートされて混ざらない」
ということをお聞きしていたので、メッキのプラグはD75A以外すべてカナダのアイソレー
ションから４個口タップを介してつなげております。
よっ てAirMac Expressの電源もそこから取っており、４個口タップに刺さっているプラグは
全てメッキですので、その時点で４個分のメッキの音が混ざっているということになります。
これは非常に重要なことですね。解かってはいたのですが、こうする以外方法がなかったの
で上記の通りにしておりました。
AirMac Expressの電源をダウン＆アイソレーションより直で取れば、iPodの音を軽く超えて
くるような気がしてきました。後日ダウン＆アイソレーションより直で電源を取ってみて、
再度比較をしてみたいと思います。
ところで、上記しましたが現在私のダウン＆アイソレーションは115Vしか空きがありません。
115Vの口に100V仕様のコンセントを刺すとやはり駄目なのでしょうか？
カナダのアイソレーションは115Vと書いてありますが、その先に接続している機器が100V
ですので仕方な く100Vから取っている次第です。

■上記メールに対しての、私の返答：
○○ 様
おそらくそれが原因ですね、
AirMac Expressは、100Vから240Vまで自動対応ですから、今からでも115V端子につない
でみてください 。
激変すると思います 。
その際本当は、非メッキが理想ですので、音を聞かれて、もう少し高域のゆがみが取れると良
いと感じられたら、非メッキメガネの出番です。
有無を言わさず、ダウン＆アイソレーションの115に突っ込んでみてください。
最近分かってきたことは、デジタル機器とて、メッキの弊害を受けているということです。ハー
ドディスクですら、おそらくそうです。非メッキにするだけで、性能が上がるものです。
１７番さんの、それに対する返答：
○○です 。
先ほど一時的にダウン＆アイソレーションの100Vを空けて、AirMac Expressを繋いでみました。
激変とまではいかないものの、違いが出ました！
何とも言葉では表現しにくいのですが、私が前のメールでiPodとの違いを「iPodは音に艶があり
パンチがある 。AirMac Expressは繊細で立体感がある。」と表現しましたが、その差がよりハッ
キリとしてきました。より繊細で、透明感が増し、定位がハッキリするようになりました。
最新のコメントの方 が「 AirMac Expressは長時間聴いていれそうな音」と言っておられましたが、
まさにそんな感じです 。
今にして思えば、確かにiPodの方が低域の迫力があったように思えたのですが、それは低域の解像
度がAirMac Expressに比べて低かったため、ぼやけて迫力があるように感じていただけなのかもし
れません 。
中高域に関しては文句なし でAirMac Expressが上です。
解ってはいたことなのですが、電源でここまで変わるとは・・・。
電源は絶対に手を抜いてはいけない箇所なのだと改めて思い知らされました。
これはも うAirMac Expressのプラグを、非メッキメガネに変えるしかありません。というかダウン
＆アイソレーションの115Vに入れようと試みたのですが、物理的な問題が発生しまして・・・。
AirMac Expressは高さがあるため、低い位置にある115Vには床と接触してしまい刺せないという
ことが解ってしまいました（笑）
非メッキのメガネとはケーブル状になっているものなのでしょうか？ケーブル状であれば問題なく繋
げそうですが。（注：３ｍのケーブルです）
ハードディスクまでメッキの影響を受けているとは・・・
私 はACから電源を取るタイプのハードディスクを使用しているのですが、やはりメッキの弊害が気に
なっております。皆さんはどのようなタイプのハードディスクを使われているのでしょう？
前に 「あまり考えすぎずに楽しみたい」と言いましたが、ここまで変わってくるとそうも言っていら
れなくなりました（笑 ）
「 全ての原因は電源にあり」といった感じです。逆に電源さえ完璧にマスターしておけば、Macであ
ろう がWindowsであろうがAirMac Expressで最善の音を得ることができるのでは？と思ったりもしま
す。
■上記メールに対しての、私のおよその返答内容：
ダウン＆アイソレーションがいかなるものかが私には分かっていますから、非メッキで
さらにAirMac Expressは変貌をとげて、上をいくことになるでしょうと回答しています。
通 常100V電源についてどうなるかは、ケースバイケースでしょう。

PC , iPod , AirMac Expressに関しては、音源における三種の神器になりそうですね。
それほどの次元の高さを持っていると思います。
この次元での比較ですと、個人的には、
各人の環境次第で容易に評価が分かれてしまい、
法則を作れるほど 「本質的な差異」は認められないと考えています。
ただし、この三種に共通している「 DAC 直前でのエラー訂正」は、
音源にとっては唯一絶対の法則であることは間違いないでしょう。
その先の話は 、CPUだのLANケーブルだの内部回路だの、
素人には確かめようのない要素であれこれ推測するしかなく、
結局は各人聴いた上での最も良いと思われる音に対して、
自分の納得のいく要因を後付けするしかなさそうです。
しかし、どなたかも仰っていましたけど、
そのことに無駄なコストがまったくかからないことが素晴らしいですね。
そんなわけで、私も三種の神器を比較してみるという、
趣味以外のなんでもない行為をお伝えしようかと思います。笑。
以下私の環境に限定した上での比較ですが、
結論が皆様と少し違っていたところが面白かったです。
デスクトッ プPC（AirMac Express仕様オンボード出力）≧iPod mini（イヤホン端子） ＞
i Pod photo（イヤホン端子） ＞AirMac Express（直結アナログ出力・iTunes再生）＞
i Pod w/ rockbox （イヤホン端子）
先にも述べましたが 、
PCはiPodより優れ、iPodはAirMac Expressより優れている、
という法則を意味しているのではなく、
あくまで私の環境と感覚での結論です。
その中で最も良かったのは、PCのオンボードからの音でした。
再生はiTunes + AirMac Expressで、 「 複数のスピーカー」を選び、
AirMac Express本体にデータを転送しつつPC本体から出力するという、
化け物さんと同じコンセプトを踏襲しております。
AirMac Expressは単にコンセントにささったまま、データを受け取ってるだけです。
一般的にはなんて愚かな使いかたなのでしょう。笑。
ですが、これが最も私には自然に聞こえました。
ちなみに、デスクトップPCの電源は非メッキでシールドしております。
音の違いは本当に僅差です。
特にPCとiPod miniの差は、情報量や音の濃さではなく、
どっちの音を長く聴いていたいか、という感覚レベルです。
その感覚の違いは、8番さんの仰る表現でしっくりきます。
「 全体的な力強さや艶はiPodなのですが、繊細感や立体感に関してはAirMac Expressの方が良い 」
というところです 。
自分なりの表現に置き換えるならば、
PCは生身のプロピアニストの演奏で、
i Podは高精度なピアノの自動演奏といった具合です。
iPodの音は多少分析的である一方 、PCは音楽性豊かで躍動感があります。
聴いていて楽しさが伝わってきます。
miniとphotoの差は、定位です。
音の傾向はまったくと言っていいほど同じです。
ただし、これは焦点を合わせれば解決する差かもしれません。
（私 はHD650なので焦点を合わせられません。）
続いてAirMac Express本体からの出力ですが、
私個人的にはオーディオ的な解像感が耳に障る感じでした。
これはメッキの影響かもしれませんし、LANケーブルのせいかもしれませんし、
PC本体に比べエラー訂正処理が遅延してるのかもしれませんし、
原因を突き止めようとは思いませんが、私には楽しめない音でした。
PCやiPodに比べ、音像が不自然に強調され、
若干音のスケールが小さく、ボーカルが窮屈に聞こえます。
一度にたくさんの音が鳴り響く場面では、その差は顕著で、
ちょうどiPodのイヤホン端子とDockのラインアウト端子の差と似ています。
最後のrockboxは一番皆様からの反感を買いそうですね。笑。
仕掛けはいいのかもしれませんが、音はAirMac
Expressより不自然でした。
音量も最大にすると低域が割れます。
これは私の持っているminiとphotoの限界なのかもしれませんが。
しかし、これも日々発展しているようなので、
今後iPodの性能とのバランスがマッチして、
他を凌駕するときがくる可能性も大いにありますね。
以上、かなり長くなってしまいました。
最後に気になる点としては、
QuickTime + AirfoilでPCのオンボードから音が出るかどうか、ですね。
つまりiTunesのように 「複数のスピーカー」設定があるかどうかです。
ソフトウェア単体ではiTunesよりQuickTimeのほうがいいことを確認
しているので、それができればソフト的な処理の恩恵だけを受けられ
そうです 。
○○
プロケーブル注：）実は化け物さんも、rockboxの音は受け入れられないと、一聴して、
結論を出したとのことです。rockboxがしていることは、最終段階でのエラー訂正に間
違いないですから、デジタル量は多く濃いものと思われますが、周波数特性など、どこ
かに無理がかかっているかもしれません。これも機材次第では、悪く聞こえるケースが
あるということでしょう。

で、先程繋いでみましたら、なるほど片側の緑のキャップを外すと
ピッタリ収まり過ぎて笑ってしまいました。
さて、肝心の音の変化ですが、夜遅くなので大きな音も出せず
なんとも今は評価出来ないですが、先程からずっと小さな音で
確認出来てるのは何か更に埋もれ気味だった音がハッキリ聞こえてる
気がします。後、これは気のせいかも知れませんが、若干ながら
音圧が上がったような？パワーがあると申しますか？
ボリュームをかなり絞ってるのですが明瞭に音が出ていまして
現在はプリもパワーも8時半ぐらいでないと苦情が来そうです(^^ ; ) 。
それは、派手で聞き苦しいという音の出方ではなく、大音量で聴く
音をそのまま小さくしたような音なので非常に心地よいです。
ただ、夜中故ちょっと心配なので、iTunesの方で更に音を下げました。
それでもちゃんと聞こえてますよ。WEケーブルのおかげかも知れません。
ちゃんと聞ける時にもう一度検証しますが、この調子ですと
もしかすると、QuickTime +AirMac Expressの方はアナログを越えるかも
知れません 。
いづれにしても、購入側のこちらも思いがけないラッキーなアイテムが

出てきています。インテルマックのノートだとどうなのか・・、これもまた謎です。
４番さんは、複数のスピーカーに設定して、パソコン本体から出力しないとダメとされてい
ます。環境、トータル的な環境にもよるものかもしれませんので、法則が見あたりません。
これは個々に実験されて、良いほうを取ってください。
化け物さんが、なぜ本体からの音を嫌ったのかには、明確な理由があります。能率が115dBの
スピーカーでは、あまりにもSN比に対して敏感にならざるを得ません。90dBのスピーカーの、
なんと、300倍の音量で「基礎ノイズ」が拡大されて聞こえてきます。酷いことです。それと
同様、メッキプラグがもたらす 「音のゆがみ」すら、300倍の鋭敏さを伴って聞こえてきます。
これは、非常に怖いことでしょう。ただし、だからこそ本当の事が分かるのだとも言えます。
しかしです、300倍の鋭敏さというのではいけません。普通の人間に使えるものではないです
し、そんなものを笑って使っておれるような人物は、あの化け物以外に知りません。
化け物の素性、そこに少々触れます。厳冬期の単独登山家だったかたです。冬期登山の人種に
ついては、私は熟知しています。二種類のいづれかに大別できます。例外は皆無と思います。
死にかけていても、常に寡黙な人か、死にかけていても冗談を言って笑っておれる人種です。
あの化け物は後者に該当します。同じ人間ですから間違いもあるでしょう。それ以上の音の出
し方もあるかもしれませんが、あの化け物は、Ｄ４５の記述で登場するＷＥチームのかたでも
ありません。実は 、WEにおいても単独登山家です。だからこそ「化け物」と私は呼びます。
とにかく、死にかけていても黙っておれるか、下ネタの冗談を連発して笑っておれるか、いづ
れかの人種でないと、厳冬期の登山、特に単独は、到底無理です。WEを扱うというのは、まさ
に、生か死というほどの次元の、壮絶なる戦いになってしまいます。追い詰められて死にかけ
ている状態から抜け出す方法、そのトリックみたいなことを、常に正しく探し当てなくてはな
りません。それゆ えWEだけには決して近寄らないようにと書いている次第です。
オーディオは何に一番近い感覚のものか、それは極限状況に追い詰められた、その瞬間にこそ、
はっきり現れます 。
「 トリック的なる、死から生への脱出」に酷似しており、ほとんどそれに近いことだと、常々
感じています 。
化け物を例にします。みんなが良いと言っている、私には時間がないので実験してくださいと、
電話で依頼しました。で、ついに化け物がそれを手に入れた。300倍に拡大されたノイズは、
それはそれは酷いものであり、到底使えない。
ここで、そんなことですら、WEでは、追い詰められてしまいます。さて、そこから先が大一番、
脱出トリックの出番です。その脱出劇は、たったの数分で成功します。それはすでに皆さんが
周知の方法です 。

１１番さんのコメント：ウィンドウズマシンに直結しただけで・・
プロケーブル 様
本日ケーブルが届きました。有難うございました。
さて、余計な事ですが印象をお伝えします。
私はただの音楽好きで自宅用、オフィイス用そして
オフイスの応接室用として3セットを組んでおります。
もっとも時間を費やすオフイスではよほど忙しくない限りは
ＣＤをながして仕事しております。また仕事柄、外国との取引が
多い為に様々な機械、情報が入手できます。
今のオフイスにはＤ45にＣＤプレイヤー直結で普段ＢＧＭにて流していましたが
ウィンドウズマシンにいただいだケーブルを接続してＤ45からいつものスピーカー
から音だしをしましたところ情報量、緻密さ、フラット（これがフラットな音）さに
コシを抜かすほどの驚きを覚えました。
何故なら私のＣＤプレーヤーは○○○○の最高級は勿論、現存するＣＤプレーヤー、
トランスポート（私の主観、確認範囲ですが）を凌駕する音質だったからですが
（高精度100％ハンドメイドクロック装備、真空管）で世界に数少ないものを自宅用
とオフイス用を使っており少なくとも音質はこれ以上は無いというか、自分の好みと
して( なれもありますか？）200％満足していましたが、こんな簡単な組み合わせが上
記の部分と自然さは完全にかないません。
他の皆さんと同じような話しかできませんが、このオーディオ業界の魑魅魍魎具合が
Ｄ45ととも暴かれる様が反面恐ろしい感覚です。これほど簡単に背筋に悪寒？が走る
ような精緻、自然な音楽が機械をとうして聞ける。また知らない世界を垣間見る事が
出来た事を感謝します。このＤ45と88760そしてコンピューター（ipod)を自宅に持ち
込むのが怖くなってきました。今までの満足、自分を否定する結果になりそうです。
つい長くなりました。失礼しました。

こんばんは、○○です 。
インテルマックが以前のマックより良いということは、
CPUだけに関して言えば、Windows機でも良さそうですね。
私の環境ではiPodがAirMac Expressより上だと言いましたが、
こればかりは、パソコンの環境を変えないといけないのかもしれませんね。
音楽ファイルを保存しているHDの電源プラグがメッキなのもいけないかもしれません。
しかし今日再度聞き比べてみた感じでは、AirMac Expressの方が良いと思うこともありました。
全体的な力強さや艶はiPodなのですが、繊細感や立体感に関してはAirMac Expressの方が良いと
感じるシーンもあったのです。
まっ、いずれにせよCDPからみればどちらも異次元な音なのですから、
あまりこだわり過ぎないように、音楽を“ 楽しもう” と思います 。
PCとiPodを上手く使い分けていきたいと思います。
ちなみに私 はWindowsのノートでの結果です。
IBMの能力的には決して悪くはない機種です。（pentium M で、最新のcore2ではありません）
パソコンは人により環境は実に様々ですから難しいですね。
その点iPodなら皆同じスペックですから、誰もが良い音を得られるのでしょう。
プロケーブル注：）個人的には、音楽にはインテルマックが最善と思います。ノートで
AirMac ExpressがiPodに勝っていないというのは、実に不思議なことに思えます。でも、
このあたりは、あまり神経質にならず、良いほうを使われればいいのではないかと思う
次第です。このかたの姿勢は、自然体で望ましいように感じます。
ただし、このかたの場合もQuickTime +AirMac Express+Airfoilですと、iPodを逆転する
と思われます 。

すいませんでした 。
まず、非メッキメガネ端子ケーブルですが、良質なケーブルと非メッキメス端子の
お陰でさらに音の分離が良くなりました。 購入して正解でした（＾＾）
自分でマリンコプラグ購入して粗悪なメガネ端子にするより コスト、音を考えて

あと、AIRMAC EXPRESS 導入しまして、60G iPodと比べまして VVF2.5M 分音が
シャープになりました。 まさに激変！ というのがふさわしいですね 。
今回新たな問題としましては、普段映画を見るDVDレコーダーの焦点と、AIRMAC
EXPRESSの焦点が大分違いまして、配線器具の3ロSWにて2系統作り対応しましたが、
やはりそろそろチャンネルデバイダーを使用したくなってきました。
プロケーブル注： ）AirMac Expresと、通常オーディオ機材とでは、音の濃さがあまり
に違い過ぎるがゆえ、音の焦点が、かなりずれてしまいます。困ることもあろうかと思
います。チャンネルディバイダーは、いざとなれば、DBXあたりのツーウェイ用の安い

なお、メガネ端子ケーブルの非メッキは持ってはいましたが、必要とされるかたが少な

多いかもしれませんので近々出しますが、遅れる場合には、お問い合わせいただいても

ProCable 様
お世話になります。東大阪市の○○です。
AirMac Expressを介したテストを色々と行いました。
結果から申しますと、私の所有するiBookG4では
i Tunesより 「 複数のスピーカー」を選び、iBookG4本体の
ヘッドフォン端子（ステレオミニ）からアンプに繋いだ
音はiPodよりも音が悪かったです。
所謂HiFi感が無いと申しますか 、AirMac Express直出しの音を
FM音源とすれば、AM音源になったような少しマスクされたよ
うなこもり気味の音でした。
この辺りはマックおたくでもPCハードおたくでもないので
よくわかりませんが、MacBookProや最近のMacBookとは
そもそもの基盤の違いかアナログ信号の扱いが全く
異なっている可能性が有るかもしれませんね。
マック本体でのD/A変換が何でされてるかの違いも考えられま
すね。
後、このテストをする時に気付いたのですが、
「 複数のスピーカー」を選んだ時にAirMac Expressの音声端子に
プラグが差し込まれていない とAirMac Expressとの通信はされないと
思います。まず認識されない旨のアラートが出ますし、
その分、時間差が有るので認識してるように見えますが、
プレイを止めるとすぐに音出しが止みます。
AirMac Expressの音声端子に別のプラグを差し込んで使っていない
テープか何かの端子に繋いでおくと、ちゃんとAirMac Express間と
通信しだします（始まりも終わりも時間差有り）。
勿論これは無線環境の場合でネットの端子に繋いだ有線の
環境は試していません 。
というわけで、うちのような環境ですと、今のところ
QuickTime +AirMac Express > iTunes + AirMac Express >
iPod mini >
iBookG4本体から音をだすiTunes + AirMac
Express
というような感じになりました。
せっかく法則が出来つつあったのに少なくとも私の環境では
上記のような結果になったという報告でした。
もしかしたら本体からの音が良いと仰ってる方は
サウンドボード等使ってらっしゃるのかと考えたりもします。
いずれにしましても、どうやら鍵はAirMacExpressにあるという
事だけは間違い無いと思います。
こいつの電源がどうにかならないかと考えてみたのですが、
あのコンセントプラグ部は取り外し可能になっていて
そこに目を付けたのですが、外したところにあるメガネ
ケーブルのオスになる部分もメッキされていました。残念。
ただ、メガネオス（メッキ）→メガネメス（メッキ）→ACプラ
グオス（メッキ）となっている構造よりもメガネオスに
直接挿せる良好な音源プラグが有れば少しはマシになるのかも
しれません 。

プロケーブル注：）法則は容易にできるものではなかったようです。

５番さんのコメント：（これも実に貴重なコメントです。）
蛇足ですが、以前買い求めましたiPod用の88760ですが、実は
CDからiTunes、iTunesからiPodと言うのが面倒なので、
AirMacExpressでiTunesからそのまんま無線で飛ばして
聴いていました。iPodよりも（うちは第二世代のminiですが）
音が良いので重宝しております。
しかしながら、以前から気になっていましたQuickTimeによる
再生 （Airfoil経由）の方が確かに数段上です。
私の環境は、古いiBookG4から無線で飛ばしてAirMacExpress の
直ケーブル経由ですが、サイトの方の情報からiBookから音を
出す方が更に良くなるようですね。この場合は更に長いケーブルが
必要となりますが、あの化け物さんという方は、マック本体の
ステレオミニからアナログ出力なのでしょうか？
その辺りが少し気になってしまってるのはマニアになってる
可能性がありますか？(笑 )
まぁ、今 回SPケーブルを替えた事で今のままでもCDPなんかよりは
数段良い音で聴けてるので問題無いといえば無いのですが、
ちょっとした工夫で更に音が良くなるならそれに越した事は無いです
からね 。
プロケーブル注：）化け物さんは、AirMac Express無線経由で、ノート本体から直接
音を取っています。これは非常に重要な方法ですので、前コメント集の最後のコメン
トをご覧ください。そちらに方法が詳細に書いてあります。
なお、これは非常に貴重なコメントです。最新ノートでなくても、内蔵ハードディスク
からでも、第二世代のiPodより、良くなることが判明しました。ただ最新のiPodだと、
その差は僅差かもしれません。最初からノートのマックを持っていらっしゃるかたは、
AirMac Expressのほうが安上がりですし、マニアックなことをせずとも、手軽にでき
ます。
法則が、はっきり見えてきました。間違いのない法則があれば、どなたも簡単です。
★ノート とAirMac Expressとのコンビは、そのままで、iPodを越えるという法則です。
★ QuickTime + Airmac Express+Airfoil（シェアウェア）のコンビは、使い勝手は劣る
ものの、その音すら越えてしまうという法則です。

ＢＥＬＫＩＮ ワイヤレ スＧネットワークＰＣカード Ｆ５Ｄ７０１０ｊａ というも の
です。
なお、５４ＭｂｐｓワイヤレスＬＡＮ ８０２.１１ｂ/ｇ対応という表示があります。
新宿ヨドバシカメラ のＭＡＣ 売り場で、 「 ウィンドウズで AirMac Expressを使う際、何か
AirMac Expressと通信するためのものが必要だって聞いたんだけど、それって何。？」と
質問。
店員さんが、調べてくれて、 「これこれこういう規格のものがお使いのＰＣに入っていれ
ば不要、入ってなければ買わないと駄目です。」
家から購入時のＰＣの規格のパンフレットをもって、見てもらったところ、「あ、はいっ
てませんね。」ということで、棚に合った上記通信ボードを買いました。他にも種類があ
ったのかもしれないですが、店員さんのとった商品をそのまま、買った次第です。
ところで、ウィンドウズ はＸＰか２００３だったかな 対応が限定されています。ＭＡＣ
の AirMac Expressのホームページを調べるか、私のようにＰＣの説明書持参で店員さんに
直接聞くのが、楽チンだと思います。また、通信ボードを差し込む部分がＰＣに、空いて
いるか念のため、見といた方がいいと思います。まー、空いてるに決まってますけど。仮
に空きが無くても、多分増設接続用の何か小物商品があるかも。（オーディオでもありま
すよね。 ）
通信ボードは、インストール作業がありますが、付属のＣＤＲの指示通り、簡単に出来ま
した。
自分が、ＰＣ音痴なもので、随分詳しく書きましたが、ご参考になれば、嬉しいです。
プロケーブル注：）なんと、ベルキン・・・。ベルキンは超一流です。ケーブル一本とっ
てみても、非常に品質高いです。そのファイヤーワイヤーケーブルは、モガミ特注、それ
以上の品質のものでした。
何でも非常に、品質の高いメーカーですから、ウィンドウズのかたは、これと同じものを
入手されれば問題ないです。
アップルの販売するファイヤーワイヤー800用ケーブルも抜きんでていますが、ベルキン
製です 。
アップルのファイヤーワイヤー400用ケーブルも、800と似ていますから、ベルキンの製
作と思われます。なお、USBケーブルもベルキンのものが抜きんでて優秀だと思いま す。
アップルストアの通販で入手できますが、USBには、短いものがないですから音質劣化は
ベルキンといえども避けられないでしょう。USB規格も、長さには弱いと思われます。

プロケーブルさ ま
おはようございます。メールありがとうございます。
まず私の環境ですが、前 にTELでもお話させていただきましたが
windows XP pro で自 作Ａｔｈｒｏ ｎＸＰ３２００ + ８０Ｇ ＳＡＴＡＸ２レイド メモ
リー１Ｇを組んでいます。ＣｌｏｎeＣＤ使用でエラー訂正です。
どれくらいの音質の差があるか、あくまで私の環境下です。個人的意見です。
iTunesのイコライザーOFF 、Ｑuick Time もＡＶコントロールせずで
くらべますと高音はさほど変わりないが、低音はかなり差がありぼやけぎみ、奥行きいま
いち、プロパティから音量調整しても直りませんでした。イコライザーを使っても一緒で
、どうセッテングして もＱuick Timeほどの音にはなりません。
ライブの拍手ですがiTunesは大雑把になりますが、Ｑuick Timeですと、
はいそこの君ちゃんと拍手して、ああ前の左の席盛りあがってるな、とか一人ずつ指差しで
きます 。
QuickTimeで再生する時のタイムラグはiTunesより少し長いようです。音の表現はとても難
しいのですが中低音域がどんどん前に出て安心していつまでも聞いていられる音だと思います。
私の環境ではあるていど以上の差があると思います。windows+iTunesで満足得られない方は
+６０００円で試してみる価値はあるのではないかと思います。

プロケーブル注：）iTunesのサウンドエンハンサーというのをオンにすると、QuicikTime に
音が近くなると聞いたことがあります。それで現在、このかたに、そのことを質問しています。
もし根本的な質の部分で、これだけの音の差があれば、音に妥協されないマニアのかたは、実行
する価値、大ありだと思われます。いづれにしても、QuickTimeも、AirMac Expressと組み合わ
せてこそ、これだけの価値になるということです。
また、iTunes +AirMac Expressも相当に次元の高い、ほとんど異次元の音なのですから、それは
お忘れにならないでください。あくまでも、比較すれば、という前提ですが、これはもう異常な
音の世界です。普通は自室にてパーフェクトな音響を実現し、音響という魔物の力を借りない限
り、こうはなりません。音源の優秀性のみ、単にそれだけで、そこまでの次元に到達してしまっ
ていることに、注目ください。
なお、マックでの再生時は、QuickTime +AirMac Expressでの再生のほうが、タイムラグが短い
と聞いています 。

プロケーブル注：）現在このかたには、iTunes+AirMac Expressと、QuickTime +AirMac Expressとの差、
その差がどれほどのものなのかを聞いています。使い勝手は、iTunesのほうがいいに決まってます。それ
でもあえて、QuickTimeを使われているということは、QuickTimeとAirMac Expressを組み合わせたほう
が、さらに良いのでしょうか。これは少々マニアックな使い方ですので、マニアのかたにしかお勧めはし
ません。なお、ウィンドウズ用iTunesには、はじめからQuickTimeが付いていると聞いています。

プロケーブル様、こんばんは。
それにしても、本当にすごいことになってきましたね（＾＾）
今まではiPod ROCKBOX仕様で聞いていましたが、もうAirMac Expressの音を聞きますと
相当劣ってしまいます 。
i Podは車専用ということで今後は使用していくつもりです。

プロケーブル様 こんにちは。○○です 。
AirMac Expressと通信するためのボードのようなものを５０００円位で購入、セットしま
した。
ＩＴＵＮＥＳの下を、複数のスピーカーになるよう設定。
うーん この情報量はすさまじい限りですね 。AirMac Expressが１５０００円、ボードの
ようなもの５０００円でこんな素晴らしいことになるとは。
本当に、凄い情報の提供で、有り難うございます。
善意と熱意のオーディオマニアによるネット社会の恩恵と感謝してます。
なお、ＰＣとAirMac Expressの接続は実際はされてなくて、？ AirMac Expressの表示は、
オレンジ色がピコピコ点滅状態です。
でも、上記のように 、ＩＴＵＮＥＳの下は複数のスピーカーになっていて、ＰＣ本体から
の再生では、表示とタイムラグがあるので、これでいいと思っています。
ちなみに、アンプとＰＣが遠いので、今はIPODに落としてから聞いてます。
プロケーブル注：）このかたはウィンドウズマシンです。
ウィンドウズマシンにも 、AirMac Expressと無線通信できる手段があったということにな
ります。現在このかたに、そのボードの種類を聞いておりますので、分かり次第このペー

By Marie Cocco - July 22 , 2008
WASHINGTON --
When the next president takes office six months from now , it will be both too late and too early to do anything very substantial about the economy .
Too late , because the mortgage , banking and energy crises have been so long in the making and their tentacles reach in so many directions that their stranglehold on Americans ' well being may have only begun to be felt .
The first real chance for the new president to make a seismic shift in economic direction is n't apt to be in 2009 .
It 's more likely to be in 2010 .
That is when the Bush tax cuts -- essentially , the only economic policy the current president has deliberately put in place during his two terms in office -- are set to expire .
And that is when future President John McCain or future President Barack Obama must decide if he is going to be a caretaker of conventional wisdom or a creative leader who at last breaks the psychology of using tax policy as a substitute for a broader , bolder economic plan .
Using taxes as the centerpiece of -- or as a substitute for -- a more comprehensive economic policy is the idea that has dominated Washington since the rise of Reaganism nearly three decades ago .
McCain at first seemed to have shaken it off when he initially opposed the Bush cuts as too costly and misguided .
But then he reverted to me - too - ism in order to please conservative Republicans whose support he needed to grasp his party 's nomination .
Obama has shown a milder orthodoxy , but it is orthodox nonetheless .
Like Bill Clinton did , he would use the tax code to encourage endeavors he finds worthy , whether it 's getting more low - and middle - income people who do not itemize their taxes to be able to deduct their mortgage interest or helping students attend college .
He embraces tax cuts for everyone he considers to be middle class , but generally defines the middle as those who make up to $ 250,000 .
Yet if the past 30 years or so have taught us anything , it should be that the global forces shaping the U.S. economy are more powerful than a mere tax cut -- or tax hike -- and they persist no matter what party is in power and who is president .
Jimmy Carter confronted an economic situation that was strikingly similar , in some respects , to the one we face today .
When Clinton took office , the overhang of deficits and debt created during the 1980s had to be addressed before the investment climate that produced the boom of the late 1990s could take shape .
But despite the relative prosperity of the Clinton era , tectonic economic forces continued to be at work .
The litany is familiar : Rising health insurance costs increased the burden on businesses , which then cut coverage or shifted costs to workers .
Millions of pensions were eliminated .
Wage pressure in part from the globalization of the labor force caused Americans ' wages to stagnate , especially for those in the middle and lower rungs of the economy .
In 2006 , the last year for which data is available , the Census Bureau says real median wages for those who work full - time , year - round dropped by slightly more than 1 percent -- the third consecutive year of decline .
Since 2000 , income stagnation has been the most significant economic event for average Americans -- though the unglamorous topic rarely makes the evening news .
Having mostly missed this larger story , the media now seem stunned by the wave of foreclosures , the intensity of the ire over high gas prices and the pervasive gloom that is afoot .
Coverage of the candidates ' economic messages has dwelled on their tax proposals , their energy plans and the relative merits of how either one would bail the country out of the banking mess .
But even if every McCain or Obama proposal were enacted immediately , nothing much will have changed because our political system seems incapable of stating the obvious :
That the serious erosions of wages , health insurance and pension coverage are themselves a crisis .
They require more than the bromides of campaign promises to keep cutting taxes -- or to soak the rich .
The United States needs nothing less than a new social compact that recognizes what most workers already know :
That employers no longer are a reliable source for health insurance or pensions ; that workers lack the bargaining power once provided by stronger unions and nothing has replaced it .
These arguments would make for a transformative campaign .
Without them , we are consigned to muddle through until the next full - blown crisis demands a president 's attention .
Duke Nukem 3D XBLA Finished , Coming ' Soon ' ; Rewards Stripper Tipping , Stepping in Poop
" We officially passed final cert on our first try Friday , August 15th , " said Broussard .
When asked about a possible price point , he noted that it will be " about what you 'd expect . "
While Broussard 's comments are open to interpretation , most XBLA releases are priced between 800 ( $ 10 ) and 1200 Microsoft Points ( $ 15 ) .
In a separate posting on its official website , 3D Realms affirmed that the game 's release " is now in the hands of Microsoft . "
The original PC edition of Duke Nukem 3D
Original Story : The achievement list for 3D Realms ' downloadable Xbox 360 port of Duke Nukem 3D has appeared on the internet via Achieve360 Points.com , a sign that traditionally indicates the game has passed certification and is due for release soon .
Per the Xbox Live Arcade standard , the classic PC shooter sports a total of 200 achievement points .
Included in the 12 achievements are rewards for tipping a stripper , stepping in excrement , beating the game 's various missions in singleplayer or co-op , and hitting a specific number of kills in the ranked online Dukematch multiplayer mode .
The complete achievement list follows
Boris Johnson pledged yesterday to sweep away the " superannuated Marxist cabal " installed at City Hall by Ken Livingstone , as he launched his campaign to become Mayor of London .
The Tory candidate let himself off his self - imposed leash temporarily as he launched a tirade against the advisers appointed by Mr Livingstone , who has been accused of surrounding himself with friends and cronies on the public payroll during his eight years as Mayor .
The capital votes a month today and there are growing jitters in Labour circles that Mr Johnson could score a famous victory which would boost
Tory hopes of repeating his " time for a change " message at the general election .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But you have to look hard for evidence that Mr Johnson is the Tory candidate on his campaign material .
Outriders with " Back Boris " umbrellas mapped the way to his launch , on a council estate in Edmonton , north London .
His newsletter describes him as " mayoral candidate Boris Johnson " and the only use of the word " Conservative " on the front page was in indecipherable light grey .
Vote for the Boris Party was presumably the message .
An overflowing Bounces Road Community
Hall was not natural territory for Mr Johnson and his special guest David Cameron , who got the film star treatment , engulfed by TV cameras and photographers , when he went to the podium .
The venue was a long way from Eton and Oxford , where the two men were contemporaries .
But a bridge was provided by Ray Lewis , a former prison governor who set up Eastside Young Leaders '
Academy because he was appalled by how many black youngsters ended up in prison .
He called for change in London after a spate of murders and was proud to introduce the man he called " my mate Dave " .
Mr Cameron said the mayoral contest was " vital " for Londoners .
He took a slightly more emollient line towards Mr Livingstone than his man Boris , reflecting the opinion polls that show people may have tired of " Red Ken " but do not hate him .
" He did some good things , " said Mr Cameron , but he was now the Labour Government 's representative in London .
In contrast , he added : " I do n't always agree with Boris , but I respect the fact that he is his own man . "
The venue was chosen in part to answer claims that Mr Johnson was campaigning in the " leafy suburbs " in a " doughnut strategy " that missed out the middle .
There were not many leaves about yesterday .
The other reason was that four of the 11 murders of young people in London this year have been in this area .
Tory strategists are in no doubt that crime is " the number one issue " on the doorsteps .
" When you have 27 teenagers being stabbed or killed last year and another 11 this year , it is not as if they were all individually victims of a series of freak events , " said Mr Johnson .
" These deaths are the culmination and the symptoms of something that is going badly wrong in our society . "
Who else is in the Boris Party is a good question .
Mr Johnson was coy about the advisers he would install , if he becomes Mayor , to replace the " superannuated Marxists " .
This is dangerous territory because it implies he would need minders to keep him on the straight and narrow .
A YouGov survey for the London Evening Standard gives Mr Johnson a 10 - point lead .
He is on 47 per cent ( down two points ) , Mr Livingstone on 37 per cent ( no change ) and Brian Paddick , the Liberal Democrat candidate , on 10 per cent ( down two points ) .
On second preferences , which could decide the election because people have two votes , Mr Paddick is on 43 per cent , Mr Johnson 18 per cent and Mr Livingstone 14 per cent .
Exclusive Tiscali threatened to disconnect a customer for illegally downloading a TV show last week , after receiving a copyright infringement notice from a Hollywood studio .
The only problem was the customer had quit the ISP months before the alleged transgression was made .
Euan MacLay had been a customer of Freedom2 Surf ( F2S ) for two years until it was taken over by Tiscali as part of the Pipex acquisition last year .
His past experience of the Italian buyer 's customer service was poor , so as soon as his Freedom2 Surf line was due to be migrated to Tiscali 's budget network he decided to switch .
That was in early March this year , and Euan never expected to hear from Freedom2 Surf again .
But he did .
On 23 August Eaun received an email from abuse@pipex.net , accusing him of illegally downloading an episode of Stargate Atlantis - a sci- fi show he does not watch - via BitTorrent , a filesharing protocol he does not use .
Most unlikely of all , the alleged infringement took place on 16 August , almost six months after he had quit F2S .
The email said :
We have received a complaint regarding an allegation of Copyright Infringement .
We were supplied an IP address of the system that was sharing the alleged copyrighted material , which we traced to your PIPEX ADSL account ...
Failure to respond or further infringements will cause your account to be temporarily suspended , and could also result in your account being terminated .
We 've reproduced the whole email on the second page of this article .
The complaint was made by BayTSP , a well - known anti-piracy contractor ( see also Digiprotect , Logistep ) , acting on behalf of Metro Goldwyn Mayer ( MGM ) , the movie studio .
It called on F2S to " immediately remove or block access to the infringing material " .
On receiving the accusation , Euan 's first thought was that it was a hoax or phishing attempt .
But digging out details of his old F2S account revealed that the IP address fingered by BayTSP had indeed belonged to his line many months earlier and must have been reassigned .
" I was absolutely shocked , " Euan told El Reg .
" How could they get something so basic so wrong ? "
It seems Tiscali had not been updating the abuse system 's list of IP number assignments since it took over .
An F2S employee told Euan : " When I had a look at our systems it was clear that your account was closed on 03/03/08 and the IP that you were using was allocated to a new customer after that .
Our systems clearly show this so I am not 100 per cent sure how the abuse team got your name associated to the IP . "
A spokeswoman for Tiscali told El Reg :
Freedom2 Surf apologises for this error .
The email was generated by an automatic F2S abuse system managed externally .
This system is no longer in place and has very recently been brought in house as part of the integration of Pipex 's platforms with Tiscali .
BayTSP uses similar methods for identifying alleged download pirates to those being deployed by the BPI on behalf of the UK record industy , and by the law firm Davenport Lyons on behalf of a group of videogame publishers .
They simply monitor public BitTorrent networks and log the files being shared , an IP number , and timestamp .
A reverse DNS lookup can then identify the ISP providing the connection and an infringment notice generated .
The process has been automated as rights holders bid to turn the tide of illegal filesharing , and lawyers aim to create a new market in internet copyright enforcement against individuals .
Davenport Lyons has boasted it will use IP addresses to obtain the names and addresses of 25,000 UK broadband users via court order .
Rather than send an infringement notice to the ISP , Davenport Lyons ' targets will get a letter direct , demanding £ 300 to avoid being taken to court .
For Euan , that the allegations against him were baseless was obvious .
However , the fact that such an elementary mistake has been made so early in the government - backed rearguard action against downloaders is concerning .
Expect more of this , whether the errors are made at ISP level , or in the flawed ( pdf ) infringment identification process . ®
CLEAR !
I debated in hs for three years and damn if these kids are n't the sloppiest spreaders i've ever heard .
part of it is because half of them are sitting down .
Spreading is supposed to enable debaters to debate at the speed of thought , not the speed of normal speech .
When I was debating , though , I would only spread if I had a judge that I was pretty sure was a former debater .
By the way ... lots of colleges have policy debate teams that really work hard at building huge libraries of cases .
These colleges also offer hugely expensive summer debate camps — most popular are UMich and Dartmouth , but lots of state colleges run them , too .
If you want to catch a debate you can understand ( for those not gifted in the art of spreading ) just watch some Lincoln - Douglas debates .
Those fuckers can't spread for shit ( which , in my opinion , is why they are LDers ) .
If you want to pick up a dime bag or some acid , tho , stick with the policy / cx debaters .
I ’m not a big fan of the way big companies approach issues of copyright .
Which is to say , fuck those guys !
As a creator of original content the principles of copyright are important to me .
I ’d like to find some way to make money from what I do .
I get angry when someone flat out steals my work and makes money from it ( which has happened multiple times ) .
So why do n’t I like the actions of the big entertainment companies and their bought - and - paid - for political institutions around the world ?
Put simply , because their actions are nothing to do with protecting and enriching artists and everything to do with increasing their controls over consumer behaviour for their own enrichment .
Often when I say “ fuck copyright ” people will say that we need copyright so that artists can make a living .
I agree .
Sometimes people will go so far as to say some of the insane behaviour in the US like the introduction of the DMCA and the RIAA suing music fans are good things .
I ’m never sure if these people are naive or if they ’re fucking morons .
The big entertainment corporations do not give a shit about the artists who actually make them money .
Selling the works produced by creative artists is a massive profit centre for these companies .
Giving fair compensation to the artists is a cost centre .
These companies are frequently guilty of breaching contracts with artists who make them rich simply because they can get away with it .
I ’m not talking about them having some moral responsibility to make artists rich .
I ’m talking about them being legally responsible .
They routinely breach contracts because they ’re the ones with the lawyers and the artists are the ones with nothing .
They can fuck over an artist , use them up and dump them because there ’s always some other poor sucker eager to jump into their place .
And do n’t even get me started on the insanity of suing and criminalising customers .
Again , this is supposed to benefit artists .
So , given the hundreds of millions of dollars these companies have made from lawsuits that fuck over consumers , how much money have artists received ?
None , apparently .
It ’s getting to the point where some significant artists are considering suing .
If the Rolling fucking Stones ca n’t catch a break , what chance do you and I have ?
The thing that has gotten me pissed off about this all over again is news that Microsoft have decided to fuck over their customers to an extent that is in no way required by law in an attempt to suck up to big media companies .
Some of the provisions of the DMCA and other laws proposed around the world are outrageous .
But this act of bastardry is not even a requirement , despite the weasel talk coming out of Microsoft .
What sort of moron breaks functionality their customers want for no reason ?
Especially when there are alternatives available ?
It ’s as if they want to push consumers to free alternatives that are n’t encumbered with this bullshit .
Actually , I ’d like to think this is all because of some deep cover free software mole buried deep inside Redmond .
“ Hahahahaha ” the free software mole cackles diabolically .
“ The fools have put in restrictions that will drive more and more users away from Micro$haft products . ”
( Free software proponents ca n’t resist calling Microsoft “ Micro$haft ” . )
“ They are sowing the seeds of their own destruction without realising it ! ”
I would have a lot more respect for a company that was being duped by a double agent than I would for a company that purposely anally raped their customers this way .
Sadly , I strongly suspect it ’s the latter .
With this in mind , I visited the good folks at Despair.com to produce the following motivational poster
I think that says it all .
( Natural News ) Electronics and computer manufacturer IBM is being sued for causing cancer and birth defects in and around town of Endicott , New York. , where the company was founded .
Approximately 90 current and former residents of Endicott and nearby Union filed suit against the company in the New York Supreme Court , claiming that the IBM factory operating in Endicott from 1924 until 2002 released a " toxic plume " into the groundwater that also led to the contamination of the air and soil .
According to the lawsuit , this pollution led to property devaluation and damage , personal injury , and wrongful death , including congenital heart defects in children and kidney cancer in adults .
IBM " should have known that the volatile organic chemicals that [ it ] had wrongfully discharged into the air , soils and groundwater , and which had contaminated the groundwater beneath the Village of Endicott and the Town of Union , would remain volatile in the soil for substantial periods of time , exceeding decades , and would migrate , as vapors , into the homes , businesses , schools and churches located above the contaminated groundwater plume , " the lawsuit reads .
The plaintiffs allege that IBM polluted the area around the factory " with conscious indifference and disregard to the health and safety of the residents .
"
The factory , which IBM sold in 2002 , manufactured computers , typewriters , circuit boards and integrated circuits .
According to the lawsuit , the toxic chemicals used during this process were not properly treated or disposed of .
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages in compensation for injury to property and persons , as well as punitive damages .
At one time , IBM was facing more than 100 such pollution lawsuits , but all of them have since been either settled or dismissed .
In 2003 , the company defeated a lawsuit by two California employees who claim they had developed cancer due to chemicals they were exposed to at a semiconductor manufacturing plant .
A reader recently termed me " the contrarian 's contrarian " and I would have to agree , because I can't help turning the same skepticism I focus on the MSM and TPTB ( the powers that be ) on group - think contrarianism .
It is a human weakness that we seek simplistic answers to complex puzzles .
Astute correspondent U. Doran recently sent in a humbling list of common flaws in human thinking : List of Cognitive Biases .
On top of these potentially crippling natural biases toward group - think , self - delusion and fantasy , we have a literally endless stream of dramas in which some resolution is reached in two hours , an hour , or perhaps even 22 minutes ( the other 8 minutes of the programming slot being reserved for consumptive propaganda , i.e. adverts ) .
Consider the key features of all television drama .
Most importantly , there is always an explosive dramatic " problem " or obstacle .
The solution / resolution will either require explosions and violence , a tense stand - off , or some equivalent high - stakes emotional compression and release .
Settings which never seem to go out of favor are seething hotbeds of life - and - death drama : hospitals , courtrooms , criminal / police matchups , etc .
Even comedies and so - called " reality shows " follow the same script of ramped - up drama and cathartic resolution .
The only difference is the resolution is supposed to be humorous and touching ( some thin veneer of self - realization / self - knowledge is popular - -" awwww , see , he found out something important about himself " ) or some decision by other parties is imposed / announced : you win , you lose , you 're off the island , you 're guilty , you should n't have torn the heads off her Barbie Doll collection , etc .
If violence is not in the script , then sex is substituted as the grabber .
The only problem with this script is that it rarely maps real life .
One could argue that all human storytelling revolves around the same scripts -- the cliche is that all stories can be reduced to seven storylines , or even down to one : a stranger comes to town -- and there is a kernal of truth in this .
But never before have people spent 8 hours a day absorbing these scripts in visual form .
Around the flickering fire , you still had to imagine the scene in your own mind as the storyteller wove his / her tale .
Myths and " timeless stories " tend to focus on human weaknesses and obsessions -- warnings , if you will -- and on conflicts within characters .
There is a famous study which tracked changes in behavior of children in remote Canada after TV was introduced .
Violence in all settings increased dramatically , as did other anti-social behavior .
This has long been studied -- for instance : Children And TV Violence .
After watching lots of TV , children tend to :
become " immune " or numb to the horror of violence
gradually accept violence as a way to solve problems
imitate the violence they observe on television ; and
identify with certain characters , victims and / or victimizers
Perhaps we should look at the survivalist " contrarians " in light of the above .
Where did the " Rambo " scenario of one heavily - armed brave survivalist eradicating faceless " bad guys " who threaten his family come from ?
Did it come from any historical evidence , or has it been planted , like all good propaganda , deeply and unconsciously via thousands of hours of scripted violence - as - solution - to - your - big - problems ?
Even the most cherished American myths of " lone gunman wiping out evil bad guys " are false ; most gunshot wounds in the truly Wild West resulted from people shooting other people in the back ( ambush ) or accidents ( firearms accidents were far more common than duels or " cowboys and Indians " ) .
For a more realistic view of the West , take a look at the 1979 book ( apparently out of print ) Hanta Yo .
The entire SHTF ( dung hits the fan ) scenario on which so much survivalist thinking is based is likewise suspect .
First , the U.S. is the wrong society to be in if you 're looking for the collapse of social order .
Better to pick Russia or China , where fear of widespread social disorder is a key prop under any functioning government : just keep chaos at bay , and we 're fine with the rest of your policies , corruption , graft , etc .
The reason is that those nations experienced catastrophic social disruption in the early 20th century and people have good reason to fear it .
While New Orleans made for excellent TV - - all the elements of a " catastrophe script " were made to order , with governmental incompetence playing out a hackneyed " disaster flick " script like Towering Inferno -- the flooding in Iowa was not .
In fact , the rest of the nation has already forgotten about those thousands of homes which were inundated and ruined , and all the lives upended and the billions lost .
Why ?
The script was boring .
People saved what they could , helped each other out , got on with their lives , and government functioned as well or better as could be expected in trying times .
I know this is a huge , grave , staggering disappointment to many , but that 's the likely scenario in most of America .
Americans do n't really fear widespread social disruption the way other cultures do ; even if the government disappeared , their instinct is not to duct - tape extra ammo clips to their calves and run away from their neighbors because they expect them to form criminal gangs bent on pillaging and great violence .
In other words : the whole survival - via - violence is a script which bears an uncomfortably close resemblance to thousands of hours of TV programming .
Yes , looting does occur in urban America ; but is that the script everyone follows ?
If you live in one of the hardcore urban ghettos of the U.S. ( less than 5 % of us live there ) , you have historical evidence to back up your fear of mob looting .
But even then , where do the mobs go after the looting ?
They vanish .
The Iowa flooding aftermath has been ignored precisely because it did n't make for dramatic TV .
Think about it : how much of your thinking about New Orleans and the Iowa flooding is shaped not by experience or a deep knowledge of conditions and events , but by heavily edited / scripted TV , which exists for one reason and one reason only :
To conflate reality into a heavily dramatized script which attracts your attention long enough to sell you some products via shameless propaganda .
We all know what causes the slowdowns on the highway -- not the actual crash , or vehicles blocking lanes : it 's the " looky - lous " who slow down to look at the twisted metal and ambulance in the median strip .
Yes , this is human nature , for just like mating , mayhem draws our deepest interest .
But is this primal urge the best foundation for decision - making ?
Obviously not .
Can you scrape away the pernicious propaganda - influence of all the thousands of hours of TV you 've watched ?
It is n't easy .
Even beloved " nature " shows are scripted and pared down to the most dramatic events : the chimp mother dies , the other troop invades , the new Lion King kills the cubs of the previous king , etc .
It is amusing to note the way such shows play upon our sympathies .
When the show is all about the struggles of the cheetah mom and cubs to survive , we are rooting for the cheetah to bring down the prey to feed her poor starving cubs .
Then , in the next program , the focus is on the gazelle family , and we fear and loathe the horrible , wretched cheetah which threatens to kill the poor little adorable gazelle .
Regardless of the false perspective chosen , the key ingredient is killing and violence .
Most of life is boring -- chewing grass , sleeping , etc .
To get people to watch , you have to distill all the boring parts down to the dramatic scripts of mating or violence .
But how realistic is the worldview established by such relentless editing and scripting ?
How valuable are such scripts in real life ?
How much do they distort our expectations and " inner scripts " ?
The best propaganda , of course , is n't recognized as propaganda : it 's simply " the way things are " to the person who has absorbed the scripts unconsciously .
How much of our thinking is based on unrealistic planted scripts of drama , romance and violence ?
Thinking for oneself gets a lot harder when we realize virtually all of television is based on turning us into looky - lous so something can be sold to us : a product , an ideology , or even an entire worldview .

Wagons East — NATO oil trade route war
By J. Robbins
23 June 1999

One worldview of history is that wars are fought to achieve economic goals .
From this viewpoint , the 1991 Gulf War is seen as a conflict over who will control the vast oil reserves of Kuwait .
The UN goal of restoring the Kuwaiti feudal monarchy is seen as a political means to an economic end .
Could it be that the NATO war against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( FRY ) was really " about the economy , stupid ? "
At the beginning of the war , President Bill Clinton candidly admitted that : " If we 're going to have a strong economic relationship that includes our ability to sell around the world , Europe has got to be a key ....
That 's what this Kosovo thing is all about . ”
John Keegan , the eminent British historian , later concluded that he " sees the war as a victory not just for air power but for the ' New World Order . ' "
Sean Gervasi , first warned of the potential for NATO to serve as the military security force for this globalist New World Order while at the 1996 Prague Conference on the Enlargement of NATO .
His paper , “ Why is NATO in Yugoslavia , ” demonstrated that Yugoslavia stands at the crossroads of a oil trade and transportation route combining Emperor Charlemagne 's dream of a great European waterway with the fabled Silk Road .
The importance of joining the two trade routes was also summed up in 1997 by William Ramsay , US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Energy , Sanctions , and Commodities : " We think oil and gas pipelines , roads , railways and fiber optics can make this 21st century Silk Road a superhighway linking Europe and Central Asia . "
This optimism is based largely on reports by the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) that Caspian Sea oil reserves are estimated to 100 - 200 billion barrels .
Regional natural gas reserves are estimated to be three times larger with those of the United States .
In comparison , the Kuwait oilfields recaptured from Iraq during the Gulf War have been estimated to contain 94 billion barrels of oil .
US Energy Secretary Pena best conveyed the urgency of opening this route in a November 1997 visit to the Caspian Sea region .
He stated that " the next 12 to 18 months are a crucial period in Caspian development . "
On September 8 , 1998 the TRACECA ( Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia ) program was implemented at Baku to provide sustainable access to Trans - European and Trans - Asian transport networks .
The European Union next initiated the INOGATE program designed to promote the security of energy supplies and internationalize trade routes .
On April 24 , 1999 , the Silk Road Declaration was designed to " promote the effective use of the international transport corridor Europe — the Caucasus " .
Coincidentally , the first secure pipeline from the Azerbaijan Caspian Sea port of Baku to the Georgian Black Sea port of Suspa was ceremonially opened in December 1998 and the first oil tanker , destined for Spain , was loaded in March of 1999 .
Georgia has thus emerged as the beachhead for Western oil consortiums seeking to transport the vast oil reserves to European markets .
The excitement over exploiting these vast oil and gas reserves has been dampened by civil wars along the Russian pipeline route and congested freighter traffic through the narrow Strait of Bosporus .
Turkey , fearing an Exxon Valdez type oil disaster , also limited the number of oil tankers passing through the Bosporus .
The TRACECA program has planned oil pipelines between Bulgaria - Greece , Bulgaria - Macedonia - Albania , and Azerbaijan - Southern Turkey to circumvent the Bosporus bottleneck .
However , none of these routes solves the problem of how to economically transport oil to Germany and the surrounding Northern European countries and finished products to markets in the former Soviet Union .
The importance of Yugoslavia to this twenty - first century superhighway is evident from its position straddling the Danube along the Danube - Main - Rhine canal connecting the Black Sea with the North Sea .
Remarkably , Yugoslavia was the only country west of the Ural Mountains that was quietly , but deliberately , excluded from the TRACECA and INOGATE programs .
It is obvious that Yugoslavia was perceived as an island of nationalism in a sea of pan-European globalism .
Somehow Yugoslavia would have to be pacified and assimilated to ensure a safe economic climate for " free trade " !
This promotion of " free trade " by high interest loans in the 1980s , followed by IMF - ordered economic austerity measures was the root cause of the Balkan wars according to the Canadian economist Michael Chossudovsky .
The massive economic crisis from these economic policies , including the loss of approximately 2 million jobs by the end of 1980 , had ignited ethnic hatreds , exacerbated by authoritarian leaders , leading to brutal wars of ethnic cleansing by Serb , Croat and Muslim forces beginning in 1991 .
The Reverend Jesse Jackson once remarked in a presentation to 11 African heads of state at Liberville , Gabon , " They no longer use bullets and ropes .
They use the World Bank and the IMF . "
In reality , atrocities attributable in the Balkan wars , by Serb , Croat and Muslim forces were approximately proportional to their respective populations and had their roots in IMF policy .
Most people in the region never realized that the true " butchers of the Balkans " of the late twentieth century were the IMF and World Bank leaders who inflicted pain and suffering with a pen .
Undoubtedly , NATO leaders mistook the willingness of the President Slobodan Milosovic 's government to negotiate at the Dayton Accords , following a short NATO bombing campaign against the Bosnian Serb forces , for weakness .
The added ease of which Franjo Tudjman 's US and German trained Croat army was able to capture Krijana in Operation Storm , killing approximately 10,000 Serbs and ethnically cleansing some 250,000 Serbs , added to this misconception .
It is revealing that Clinton had welcomed Operation Storm , suggesting that it may open the way to a solution of the Yugoslav conflict .
The new NATO alliance mission : " NATO : Out of Area or Out of Business " apparently had its roots in a new White House strategy of international relations .
According to John Roberts , in his American Spectator article " Roots of Allied Farce , " this strategy was to " realign NATO and OSCE to deal with new security problems in Europe and urge military intervention under humanitarian guises . "
The tacit goal of pacifying the FRY was evident to anyone who bothered to read Appendix B of the Rambouillet ultimatum .
By signing , Yugoslavia would be submitting to occupation by 30,000 NATO troops , not only in Kosovo and Metahuji ( Kosmet ) , but also throughout Serbia and Vojvodina .
Morton Abramowitz , United States top advisor in Rambouillet , stated that : " Our intention was to get the UCK people to accept our plan and face Milosevic with an ultimatum (...)
The result was that we never really negotiated .
The contact group just begged UCK to sign , so we could put pressure on Milosevic . "
The expected refusal of the Serbs to relinquish sovereignty provided the justification needed for the immediate coalition bombing campaign !
The Reverend Jesse Jackson later judged that " a diplomacy with no diplomacy is no diplomacy ; that bombing and forcing an enemy to capitulate with no other dialogue is wrong . "
Apparently the bombing campaign was expected to result in the immediate capitulation of Yugoslavia rather than face the most powerful air force in world history .
NATO Commander General Wesley Clark went so far as to tell US Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham , " Duke , NATO only wanted to bomb one day and quit . "
Unfortunately , Clinton and his advisors did not consider that Slobodan Milosevic would choose to respond with the Switzerland military strategy of inflicting a Pyrrhic victory on the attacking forces .
The results of the NATO miscalculation are the tragic social costs and the economic price tag of rebuilding the Balkans .
The costs will continue to climb according to John Pike , a expert for the Federation of American Scientists .
He stated , " These people are also going to be involved in keeping the peace for years , as opposed to fighting the war for weeks . ''
The US Senate voted to prevent reconstruction funding to the FRY as long as Milosevic remained in power .
US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright confirmed this policy by stating , on June 11 , 1999 , that Yugoslavia would be left out of the Balkan reconstruction .
The logical aftermath of this war will thus involve an economic siege of the FRY until the ultimate installation of a leadership that is willing to relinquish sovereignty to Brussels .
Eventually , the assimilated Balkan economies could be reengineered under OSCE mandates , IMF and World Trade Organization assistance to meet the needs of globalistic economic interests .
Governments are likely to serve as real estate agents , as in the case of US Commerce Secretary Ron Brown 's ill - fated trip to Bosnia along with dozens of business leaders .
The planned deindustrialization of Serbia , Kosmet and Vojvodina , by the destruction of key national refinery , communication and transportation assets serves to reduce the sale price of the damaged assets .
The control of oilfields in Vojvodina , approximately 5 billion in mineral deposits and the second largest European deposit of lignite coal ( 17 billion tons ) , in Kosmet , are just secondary prizes .
In this geopolitical worldview , the peoples of the Balkans are just collateral damage in a war to safeguard the security of a recently opened oil trade route against a preconceived economic threat by the FRY .
A fitting slogan for this postwar New World Order campaign is " Buy up the Balkans and bring on the oil barges . "
The continued Eastward march of the New World Order and NATO security forces into the Caspian Sea region has already begun .
NATO is increasingly perceived as the cavalry for a great crusade of opening up the new oil frontier , while placing the " savages " on out of the way reservations .
Thus far the Western powers have failed to appreciate the dynamic complexity of the Balkan and Caspian Sea economic situations and the interrelationships of various groups .
The New World Order may ultimately fail to heed an old Russian proverb that roughly translates as " do not sell the hide of the bear until the bear is dead . ”
The three people talking in the hospital room were already stressed out from having to cope with a mysterious illness , and it did n’t help at all that they were having trouble communicating .
One of them was the patient , a small , timid man , sick with pneumonia caused by an unidentified microbe and with only a limited command of the English language .
The second , acting as translator , was his wife , worried about her husband ’s condition and frightened by the hospital environment .
The third person in the trio was an inexperienced young doctor , trying to figure out what might have brought on the strange illness .
Under the stress , the doctor was forgetting everything he had been taught about patient confidentiality .
He committed the awful blunder of requesting the woman to ask her husband whether he ’d had any sexual experiences that might have caused the infection .
As the young doctor watched , the husband turned red , pulled himself together so that he seemed even smaller , tried to disappear under his bed sheets , and stammered in a barely audible voice .
His wife suddenly screamed in rage and drew herself up to tower over him .
Before the doctor could stop her , she grabbed a heavy metal bottle , slammed it onto her husband ’s head , and stormed out of the room .
It took a while for the doctor to elicit , through the man ’s broken English , what he had said to so enrage his wife .
The answer slowly emerged : he had admitted to repeated intercourse with sheep on a recent visit to the family farm ; perhaps that was how he had contracted the mysterious microbe .
This episode , related to me by a physician friend involved in the case , sounds so bizarrely one of a kind as to be of no possible broader significance .
But in fact it illustrates a subject of great importance : human diseases of animal origins .
Very few of us may love sheep in the carnal sense .
But most of us platonically love our pet animals , like our dogs and cats ; and as a society , we certainly appear to have an inordinate fondness for sheep and other livestock , to judge from the vast numbers of them that we keep .
Some of us -- most often our children -- pick up infectious diseases from our pets .
Usually these illnesses remain no more than a nuisance , but a few have evolved into far more .
The major killers of humanity throughout our recent history -- smallpox , flu , tuberculosis , malaria , plague , measles , and cholera -- are all infectious diseases that arose from diseases of animals .
Until World War II more victims of war died of microbes than of gunshot or sword wounds .
All those military histories glorifying Alexander the Great and Napoleon ignore the ego - deflating truth : the winners of past wars were not necessarily those armies with the best generals and weapons , but those bearing the worst germs with which to smite their enemies .
The grimmest example of the role of germs in history is much on our minds this month , as we recall the European conquest of the Americas that began with Columbus ’s voyage of 1492 .
Numerous as the Indian victims of the murderous Spanish conquistadores were , they were dwarfed in number by the victims of murderous Spanish microbes .
These formidable conquerors killed an estimated 95 percent of the New World ’s pre-Columbian Indian population .
Why was the exchange of nasty germs between the Americas and Europe so unequal ?
Why did n’t the reverse happen instead , with Indian diseases decimating the Spanish invaders , spreading back across the Atlantic , and causing a 95 percent decline in Europe ’s human population ?
Similar questions arise regarding the decimation of many other native peoples by European germs , and regarding the decimation of would - be European conquistadores in the tropics of Africa and Asia .
Naturally , we ’re disposed to think about diseases from our own point of view :
What can we do to save ourselves and to kill the microbes ?
Let ’s stamp out the scoundrels , and never mind what their motives are !
In life , though , one has to understand the enemy to beat him .
So for a moment , let ’s consider disease from the microbes ’ point of view .
Let ’s look beyond our anger at their making us sick in bizarre ways , like giving us genital sores or diarrhea , and ask why it is that they do such things .
After all , microbes are as much a product of natural selection as we are , and so their actions must have come about because they confer some evolutionary benefit .
Basically , of course , evolution selects those individuals that are most effective at producing babies and at helping those babies find suitable places to live .
Microbes are marvels at this latter requirement .
They have evolved diverse ways of spreading from one person to another , and from animals to people .
Many of our symptoms of disease actually represent ways in which some clever bug modifies our bodies or our behavior such that we become enlisted to spread bugs .
The most effortless way a bug can spread is by just waiting to be transmitted passively to the next victim .
That ’s the strategy practiced by microbes that wait for one host to be eaten by the next -- salmonella bacteria , for example , which we contract by eating already - infected eggs or meat ; or the worm responsible for trichinosis , which waits for us to kill a pig and eat it without properly cooking it .
As a slight modification of this strategy , some microbes do n’t wait for the old host to die but instead hitchhike in the saliva of an insect that bites the old host and then flies to a new one .
The free ride may be provided by mosquitoes , fleas , lice , or tsetse flies , which spread malaria , plague , typhus , and sleeping sickness , respectively .
The dirtiest of all passive - carriage tricks is perpetrated by microbes that pass from a woman to her fetus -- microbes such as the ones responsible for syphilis , rubella ( German measles ) , and AIDS .
By their cunning these microbes can already be infecting an infant before the moment of its birth .
Other bugs take matters into their own hands , figuratively speaking .
They actively modify the anatomy or habits of their host to accelerate their transmission .
From our perspective , the open genital sores caused by venereal diseases such as syphilis are a vile indignity .
From the microbes ’ point of view , however , they ’re just a useful device to enlist a host ’s help in inoculating the body cavity of another host with microbes .
The skin lesions caused by smallpox similarly spread microbes by direct or indirect body contact ( occasionally very indirect , as when U.S. and Australian whites bent on wiping out belligerent native peoples sent them gifts of blankets previously used by smallpox patients ) .
More vigorous yet is the strategy practiced by the influenza , common cold , and pertussis ( whooping cough ) microbes , which induce the victim to cough or sneeze , thereby broadcasting the bugs toward prospective new hosts .
Similarly the cholera bacterium induces a massive diarrhea that spreads bacteria into the water supplies of potential new victims .
For modification of a host ’s behavior , though , nothing matches the rabies virus , which not only gets into the saliva of an infected dog but drives the dog into a frenzy of biting and thereby infects many new victims .
Thus , from our viewpoint , genital sores , diarrhea , and coughing are symptoms of disease .
From a bug ’s viewpoint , they ’re clever evolutionary strategies to broadcast the bug .
That ’s why it ’s in the bug ’s interests to make us sick .
But what does it gain by killing us ?
That seems self - defeating , since a microbe that kills its host kills itself .
Though you may well think it ’s of little consolation , our death is really just an unintended by - product of host symptoms that promote the efficient transmission of microbes .
Yes , an untreated cholera patient may eventually die from producing diarrheal fluid at a rate of several gallons a day .
While the patient lasts , though , the cholera bacterium profits from being massively disseminated into the water supplies of its next victims .
As long as each victim thereby infects , on average , more than one new victim , the bacteria will spread , even though the first host happens to die .
So much for the dispassionate examination of the bug ’s interests .
Now let ’s get back to considering our own selfish interests : to stay alive and healthy , best done by killing the damned bugs .
One common response to infection is to develop a fever .
Again , we consider fever a symptom of disease , as if it developed inevitably without serving any function .
But regulation of body temperature is under our genetic control , and a fever does n’t just happen by accident .
Because some microbes are more sensitive to heat than our own bodies are , by raising our body temperature we in effect try to bake the bugs to death before we get baked ourselves .
Another common response is to mobilize our immune system .
White blood cells and other cells actively seek out and kill foreign microbes .
The specific antibodies we gradually build up against a particular microbe make us less likely to get reinfected once we are cured .
As we all know , there are some illnesses , such as flu and the common cold , to which our resistance is only temporary ; we can eventually contract the illness again .
Against other illnesses , though - - including measles , mumps , rubella , pertussis , and the now - defeated menace of smallpox -- antibodies stimulated by one infection confer lifelong immunity .
That ’s the principle behind vaccination -- to stimulate our antibody production without our having to go through the actual experience of the disease .
Alas , some clever bugs do n’t just cave in to our immune defenses .
Some have learned to trick us by changing their antigens , those molecular pieces of the microbe that our antibodies recognize .
The constant evolution or recycling of new strains of flu , with differing antigens , explains why the flu you got two years ago did n’t protect you against the different strain that arrived this year .
Sleeping sickness is an even more slippery customer in its ability to change its antigens rapidly .
Among the slipperiest of all is the virus that causes AIDS , which evolves new antigens even as it sits within an individual patient , until it eventually overwhelms the immune system .
Our slowest defensive response is through natural selection , which changes the relative frequency with which a gene appears from generation to generation .
For almost any disease some people prove to be genetically more resistant than others .
In an epidemic , those people with genes for resistance to that particular microbe are more likely to survive than are people lacking such genes .
As a result , over the course of history human populations repeatedly exposed to a particular pathogen tend to be made up of individuals with genes that resist the appropriate microbe -- just because unfortunate individuals without those genes were less likely to survive to pass their genes on to their children .
Fat consolation , you may be thinking .
This evolutionary response is not one that does the genetically susceptible dying individual any good .
It does mean , though , that a human population as a whole becomes better protected .
In short , many bugs have had to evolve tricks to let them spread among potential victims .
We ’ve evolved countertricks , to which the bugs have responded by evolving counter - countertricks .
We and our pathogens are now locked in an escalating evolutionary contest , with the death of one contestant the price of defeat , and with natural selection playing the role of umpire .
The form that this deadly contest takes varies with the pathogens : for some it is like a guerrilla war , while for others it is a blitzkrieg .
With certain diseases , like malaria or hookworm , there ’s a more or less steady trickle of new cases in an affected area , and they will appear in any month of any year .
Epidemic diseases , though , are different : they produce no cases for a long time , then a whole wave of cases , then no more cases again for a while .
Among such epidemic diseases , influenza is the most familiar to Americans , this year having been a particularly bad one for us ( but a great year for the influenza virus ) .
Cholera epidemics come at longer intervals , the 1991 Peruvian epidemic being the first one to reach the New World during the twentieth century .
Frightening as today ’s influenza and cholera epidemics are , though , they pale beside the far more terrifying epidemics of the past , before the rise of modern medicine .
The greatest single epidemic in human history was the influenza wave that killed 21 million people at the end of the First World War .
The black death , or bubonic plague , killed one - quarter of Europe ’s population between 1346 and 1352 , with death tolls up to 70 percent in some cities .
The infectious diseases that visit us as epidemics share several characteristics .
First , they spread quickly and efficiently from an infected person to nearby healthy people , with the result that the whole population gets exposed within a short time .
Second , they ’re acute illnesses : within a short time , you either die or recover completely .
Third , the fortunate ones of us who do recover develop antibodies that leave us immune against a recurrence of the disease for a long time , possibly our entire lives .
Finally , these diseases tend to be restricted to humans ; the bugs causing them tend not to live in the soil or in other animals .
All four of these characteristics apply to what Americans think of as the once more - familiar acute epidemic diseases of childhood , including measles , rubella , mumps , pertussis , and smallpox .
It is easy to understand why the combination of those four characteristics tends to make a disease run in epidemics .
The rapid spread of microbes and the rapid course of symptoms mean that everybody in a local human population is soon infected , and thereafter either dead or else recovered and immune .
No one is left alive who could still be infected .
But since the microbe can’t survive except in the bodies of living people , the disease dies out until a new crop of babies reaches the susceptible age -- and until an infectious person arrives from the outside to start a new epidemic .
A classic illustration of the process is given by the history of measles on the isolated Faeroe Islands in the North Atlantic .
A severe epidemic of the disease reached the Faeroes in 1781 , then died out , leaving the islands measles - free until an infected carpenter arrived on a ship from Denmark in 1846 .
Within three months almost the whole Faeroes population -- 7,782 people -- had gotten measles and then either died or recovered , leaving the measles virus to disappear once again until the next epidemic .
Studies show that measles is likely to die out in any human population numbering less than half a million people .
Only in larger populations can measles shift from one local area to another , thereby persisting until enough babies have been born in the originally infected area to permit the disease ’s return .
Rubella in Australia provides a similar example , on a much larger scale .
As of 1917 Australia ’s population was still only 5 million , with most people living in scattered rural areas .
The sea voyage to Britain took two months , and land transport within Australia itself was slow .
In effect , Australia did n’t even consist of a population of 5 million , but of hundreds of much smaller populations .
As a result , rubella hit Australia only as occasional epidemics , when an infected person happened to arrive from overseas and stayed in a densely populated area .
By 1938 , though , the city of Sydney alone had a population of over one million , and people moved frequently and quickly by air between London , Sydney , and other Australian cities .
Around then , rubella for the first time was able to establish itself permanently in Australia .
What ’s true for rubella in Australia is true for most familiar acute infectious diseases throughout the world .
To sustain themselves , they need a human population that is sufficiently numerous and densely packed that a new crop of susceptible children is available for infection by the time the disease would otherwise be waning .
Hence measles and other such diseases are also known as crowd diseases .
Crowd diseases could not sustain themselves in small bands of hunter - gatherers and slash - and - burn farmers .
As tragic recent experience with Amazonian Indians and Pacific Islanders confirms , almost an entire tribelet may be wiped out by an epidemic brought by an outside visitor , because no one in the tribelet has any antibodies against the microbe .
In addition , measles and some other childhood diseases are more likely to kill infected adults than children , and all adults in the tribelet are susceptible .
Having killed most of the tribelet , the epidemic then disappears .
The small population size explains why tribelets can’t sustain epidemics introduced from the outside ; at the same time it explains why they could never evolve epidemic diseases of their own to give back to the visitors .
That ’s not to say that small human populations are free from all infectious diseases .
Some of their infections are caused by microbes capable of maintaining themselves in animals or in soil , so the disease remains constantly available to infect people .
For example , the yellow fever virus is carried by African wild monkeys and is constantly available to infect rural human populations of Africa .
It was also available to be carried to New World monkeys and people by the transatlantic slave trade .
Other infections of small human populations are chronic diseases , such as leprosy and yaws , that may take a very long time to kill a victim .
The victim thus remains alive as a reservoir of microbes to infect other members of the tribelet .
Finally , small human populations are susceptible to nonfatal infections against which we do n’t develop immunity , with the result that the same person can become reinfected after recovering .
That ’s the case with hookworm and many other parasites .
All these types of diseases , characteristic of small , isolated populations , must be the oldest diseases of humanity .
They were the ones that we could evolve and sustain through the early millions of years of our evolutionary history , when the total human population was tiny and fragmented .
They are also shared with , or are similar to the diseases of , our closest wild relatives , the African great apes .
In contrast , the evolution of our crowd diseases could only have occurred with the buildup of large , dense human populations , first made possible by the rise of agriculture about 10,000 years ago , then by the rise of cities several thousand years ago .
Indeed , the first attested dates for many familiar infectious diseases are surprisingly recent : around 1600 B.C. for smallpox ( as deduced from pockmarks on an Egyptian mummy ) , 400 b.c. for mumps , 1840 for polio , and 1959 for AIDS .
Agriculture sustains much higher human population densities than does hunting and gathering -- on average , 10 to 100 times higher .
In addition , hunter - gatherers frequently shift camp , leaving behind their piles of feces with their accumulated microbes and worm larvae .
But farmers are sedentary and live amid their own sewage , providing microbes with a quick path from one person ’s body into another person ’s drinking water .
Farmers also become surrounded by disease - transmitting rodents attracted by stored food .
Some human populations make it even easier for their own bacteria and worms to infect new victims , by intentionally gathering their feces and urine and spreading it as fertilizer on the fields where people work .
Irrigation agriculture and fish farming provide ideal living conditions for the snails carrying schistosomes , and for other flukes that burrow through our skin as we wade through the feces - laden water .
If the rise of farming was a boon for our microbes , the rise of cities was a veritable bonanza , as still more densely packed human populations festered under even worse sanitation conditions .
( Not until the beginning of the twentieth century did urban populations finally become self - sustaining ; until then , constant immigration of healthy peasants from the countryside was necessary to make good the constant deaths of city dwellers from crowd diseases . )
Another bonanza was the development of world trade routes , which by late Roman times effectively joined the populations of Europe , Asia , and North Africa into one giant breeding ground for microbes .
That ’s when smallpox finally reached Rome as the plague of Antonius , which killed millions of Roman citizens between a.d. 165 and 180 .
Similarly , bubonic plague first appeared in Europe as the plague of Justinian ( a.d. 542-543 ) .
But plague did n’t begin to hit Europe with full force , as the black death epidemics , until 1346 , when new overland trading with China provided rapid transit for flea - infested furs from plague - ridden areas of Central Asia .
Today our jet planes have made even the longest intercontinental flights briefer than the duration of any human infectious disease .
That ’s how an Aerolíneas Argentinas airplane , stopping in Lima , Peru , earlier this year , managed to deliver dozens of cholera - infected people the same day to my city of Los Angeles , over 3,000 miles away .
The explosive increase in world travel by Americans , and in immigration to the United States , is turning us into another melting pot -- this time of microbes that we previously dismissed as just causing exotic diseases in far - off countries .
When the human population became sufficiently large and concentrated , we reached the stage in our history when we could at last sustain crowd diseases confined to our species .
But that presents a paradox : such diseases could never have existed before .
Instead they had to evolve as new diseases .
Where did those new diseases come from ?
Evidence emerges from studies of the disease - causing microbes themselves .
In many cases molecular biologists have identified the microbe ’s closest relative .
Those relatives also prove to be agents of infectious crowd diseases -- but ones confined to various species of domestic animals and pets !
Among animals too , epidemic diseases require dense populations , and they ’re mainly confined to social animals that provide the necessary large populations .
Hence when we domesticated social animals such as cows and pigs , they were already afflicted by epidemic diseases just waiting to be transferred to us .
For example , the measles virus is most closely related to the virus causing rinderpest , a nasty epidemic disease of cattle and many wild cud-chewing mammals .
Rinderpest does n’t affect humans .
Measles , in turn , does n’t affect cattle .
The close similarity of the measles and rinderpest viruses suggests that the rinderpest virus transferred from cattle to humans , then became the measles virus by changing its properties to adapt to us .
That transfer is n’t surprising , considering how closely many peasant farmers live and sleep next to cows and their accompanying feces , urine , breath , sores , and blood .
Our intimacy with cattle has been going on for the 8,000 years since we domesticated them - - ample time for the rinderpest virus to discover us nearby .
Other familiar infectious diseases can similarly be traced back to diseases of our animal friends .
Given our proximity to the animals we love , we must constantly be getting bombarded by animal microbes .
Those invaders get winnowed by natural selection , and only a few succeed in establishing themselves as human diseases .
A quick survey of current diseases lets us trace four stages in the evolution of a specialized human disease from an animal precursor .
In the first stage , we pick up animal - borne microbes that are still at an early stage in their evolution into specialized human pathogens .
They do n’t get transmitted directly from one person to another , and even their transfer from animals to us remains uncommon .
There are dozens of diseases like this that we get directly from pets and domestic animals .
They include cat scratch fever from cats , leptospirosis from dogs , psittacosis from chickens and parrots , and brucellosis from cattle .
We ’re similarly susceptible to picking up diseases from wild animals , such as the tularemia that hunters occasionally get from skinning wild rabbits .
In the second stage , a former animal pathogen evolves to the point where it does get transmitted directly between people and causes epidemics .
However , the epidemic dies out for several reasons -- being cured by modern medicine , stopping when everybody has been infected and died , or stopping when everybody has been infected and become immune .
For example , a previously unknown disease termed o’nyong - nyong fever appeared in East Africa in 1959 and infected several million Africans .
It probably arose from a virus of monkeys and was transmitted to humans by mosquitoes .
The fact that patients recovered quickly and became immune to further attack helped cause the new disease to die out quickly .
The annals of medicine are full of diseases that sound like no known disease today but that once caused terrifying epidemics before disappearing as mysteriously as they had come .
Who alive today remembers the English sweating sickness that swept and terrified Europe between 1485 and 1578 , or the Picardy sweats of eighteenth - and nineteenth - century France ?
A third stage in the evolution of our major diseases is represented by former animal pathogens that establish themselves in humans and that do not die out ; until they do , the question of whether they will become major killers of humanity remains up for grabs .
The future is still very uncertain for Lassa fever , first observed in 1969 in Nigeria and caused by a virus probably derived from rodents .
Better established is Lyme disease , caused by a spirochete that we get from the bite of a tick .
Although the first known human cases in the United States appeared only as recently as 1962 , Lyme disease is already reaching epidemic proportions in the Northeast , on the West Coast , and in the upper Midwest .
The future of AIDS , derived from monkey viruses , is even more secure , from the virus ’s perspective .
The final stage of this evolution is represented by the major , long - established epidemic diseases confined to humans .
These diseases must have been the evolutionary survivors of far more pathogens that tried to make the jump to us from animals -- and mostly failed .
Diseases represent evolution in progress , as microbes adapt by natural selection to new hosts .
Compared with cows ’ bodies , though , our bodies offer different immune defenses and different chemistry .
In that new environment , a microbe must evolve new ways to live and propagate itself .
The best - studied example of microbes evolving these new ways involves myxomatosis , which hit Australian rabbits in 1950 .
The myxoma virus , native to a wild species of Brazilian rabbit , was known to cause a lethal epidemic in European domestic rabbits , which are a different species .
The virus was intentionally introduced to Australia in the hopes of ridding the continent of its plague of European rabbits , foolishly introduced in the nineteenth century .
In the first year , myxoma produced a gratifying ( to Australian farmers ) 99.8 percent mortality in infected rabbits .
Fortunately for the rabbits and unfortunately for the farmers , the death rate then dropped in the second year to 90 percent and eventually to 25 percent , frustrating hopes of eradicating rabbits completely from Australia .
The problem was that the myxoma virus evolved to serve its own interests , which differed from the farmers ’ interests and those of the rabbits .
The virus changed to kill fewer rabbits and to permit lethally infected ones to live longer before dying .
The result was bad for Australian farmers but good for the virus : a less lethal myxoma virus spreads baby viruses to more rabbits than did the original , highly virulent myxoma .
For a similar example in humans , consider the surprising evolution of syphilis .
Today we associate syphilis with genital sores and a very slowly developing disease , leading to the death of untreated victims only after many years .
However , when syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe in 1495 , its pustules often covered the body from the head to the knees , caused flesh to fall off people ’s faces , and led to death within a few months .
By 1546 syphilis had evolved into the disease with the symptoms known to us today .
Apparently , just as with myxomatosis , those syphilis spirochetes evolved to keep their victims alive longer in order to transmit their spirochete offspring into more victims .
How , then , does all this explain the outcome of 1492 - - that Europeans conquered and depopulated the New World , instead of Native Americans conquering and depopulating Europe ?
Part of the answer , of course , goes back to the invaders ’ technological advantages .
European guns and steel swords were more effective weapons than Native American stone axes and wooden clubs .
Only Europeans had ships capable of crossing the ocean and horses that could provide a decisive advantage in battle .
But that ’s not the whole answer .
Far more Native Americans died in bed than on the battlefield -- the victims of germs , not of guns and swords .
Those germs undermined Indian resistance by killing most Indians and their leaders and by demoralizing the survivors .
The role of disease in the Spanish conquests of the Aztec and Inca empires is especially well documented .
In 1519 Cortés landed on the coast of Mexico with 600 Spaniards to conquer the fiercely militaristic Aztec Empire , which at the time had a population of many millions .
That Cortés reached the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán , escaped with the loss of only two - thirds of his force , and managed to fight his way back to the coast demonstrates both Spanish military advantages and the initial naïveté of the Aztecs .
But when Cortés ’s next onslaught came , in 1521 , the Aztecs were no longer naive ; they fought street by street with the utmost tenacity .
What gave the Spaniards a decisive advantage this time was smallpox , which reached Mexico in 1520 with the arrival of one infected slave from Spanish Cuba .
The resulting epidemic proceeded to kill nearly half the Aztecs .
The survivors were demoralized by the mysterious illness that killed Indians and spared Spaniards , as if advertising the Spaniards ’ invincibility .
By 1618 Mexico ’s initial population of 20 million had plummeted to about 1.6 million .
Pizarro had similarly grim luck when he landed on the coast of Peru in 1531 with about 200 men to conquer the Inca Empire .
Fortunately for Pizarro , and unfortunately for the Incas , smallpox had arrived overland around 1524 , killing much of the Inca population , including both Emperor Huayna Capac and his son and designated successor , Ninan Cuyoche .
Because of the vacant throne , two other sons of Huayna Capac , Atahuallpa and Huáscar , became embroiled in a civil war that Pizarro exploited to conquer the divided Incas .
When we in the United States think of the most populous New World societies existing in 1492 , only the Aztecs and Incas come to mind .
We forget that North America also supported populous Indian societies in the Mississippi Valley .
Sadly , these societies too would disappear .
But in this case conquistadores contributed nothing directly to the societies ’ destruction ; the conquistadores ’ germs , spreading in advance , did everything .
When De Soto marched through the Southeast in 1540 , he came across Indian towns abandoned two years previously because nearly all the inhabitants had died in epidemics .
However , he was still able to see some of the densely populated towns lining the lower Mississippi .
By a century and a half later , though , when French settlers returned to the lower Mississippi , almost all those towns had vanished .
Their relics are the great mound sites of the Mississippi Valley .
Only recently have we come to realize that the mound - building societies were still largely intact when Columbus arrived , and that they collapsed between 1492 and the systematic European exploration of the Mississippi .
When I was a child in school , we were taught that North America had originally been occupied by about one million Indians .
That low number helped justify the white conquest of what could then be viewed as an almost empty continent .
However , archeological excavations and descriptions left by the first European explorers on our coasts now suggest an initial number of around 20 million .
In the century or two following Columbus ’s arrival in the New World , the Indian population is estimated to have declined by about 95 percent .
The main killers were European germs , to which the Indians had never been exposed and against which they therefore had neither immunologic nor genetic resistance .
Smallpox , measles , influenza , and typhus competed for top rank among the killers .
As if those were not enough , pertussis , plague , tuberculosis , diphtheria , mumps , malaria , and yellow fever came close behind .
In countless cases Europeans were actually there to witness the decimation that occurred when the germs arrived .
For example , in 1837 the Mandan Indian tribe , with one of the most elaborate cultures in the Great Plains , contracted smallpox thanks to a steamboat traveling up the Missouri River from St. Louis .
The population of one Mandan village crashed from 2,000 to less than 40 within a few weeks .
The one - sided exchange of lethal germs between the Old and New worlds is among the most striking and consequence - laden facts of recent history .
Whereas over a dozen major infectious diseases of Old World origins became established in the New World , not a single major killer reached Europe from the Americas .
The sole possible exception is syphilis , whose area of origin still remains controversial .
That one - sidedness is more striking with the knowledge that large , dense human populations are a prerequisite for the evolution of crowd diseases .
If recent reappraisals of the pre-Columbian New World population are correct , that population was not far below the contemporaneous population of Eurasia .
Some New World cities , like Tenochtitlán , were among the world ’s most populous cities at the time .
Yet Tenochtitlán did n’t have awful germs waiting in store for the Spaniards .
Why not ?
One possible factor is that the rise of dense human populations began somewhat later in the New World than in the Old .
Another is that the three most populous American centers -- the Andes , Mexico , and the Mississippi Valley - - were never connected by regular fast trade into one gigantic breeding ground for microbes , in the way that Europe , North Africa , India , and China became connected in late Roman times .
The main reason becomes clear , however , if we ask a simple question : From what microbes could any crowd diseases of the Americas have evolved ?
We ’ve seen that Eurasian crowd diseases evolved from diseases of domesticated herd animals .
Significantly , there were many such animals in Eurasia .
But there were only five animals that became domesticated in the Americas : the turkey in Mexico and parts of North America , the guinea pig and llama / alpaca ( probably derived from the same original wild species ) in the Andes , the Muscovy duck in tropical South America , and the dog throughout the Americas .
That extreme paucity of New World domestic animals reflects the paucity of wild starting material .
About 80 percent of the big wild mammals of the Americas became extinct at the end of the last ice age , around 11,000 years ago , at approximately the same time that the first well - attested wave of Indian hunters spread over the Americas .
Among the species that disappeared were ones that would have yielded useful domesticates , such as American horses and camels .
Debate still rages as to whether those extinctions were due to climate changes or to the impact of Indian hunters on prey that had never seen humans .
Whatever the reason , the extinctions removed most of the basis for Native American animal domestication -- and for crowd diseases .
The few domesticates that remained were not likely sources of such diseases .
Muscovy ducks and turkeys do n’t live in enormous flocks , and they ’re not naturally endearing species ( like young lambs ) with which we have much physical contact .
Guinea pigs may have contributed a trypanosome infection like Chagas ’ disease or leishmaniasis to our catalog of woes , but that ’s uncertain .
Initially the most surprising absence is of any human disease derived from llamas ( or alpacas ) , which are tempting to consider as the Andean equivalent of Eurasian livestock .
However , llamas had three strikes against them as a source of human pathogens : their wild relatives do n’t occur in big herds as do wild sheep , goats , and pigs ; their total numbers were never remotely as large as the Eurasian populations of domestic livestock , since llamas never spread beyond the Andes ; and llamas are n’t as cuddly as piglets and lambs and are n’t kept in such close association with people .
( You may not think of piglets as cuddly , but human mothers in the New Guinea highlands often nurse them , and they frequently live right in the huts of peasant farmers . )
The importance of animal - derived diseases for human history extends far beyond the Americas .
Eurasian germs played a key role in decimating native peoples in many other parts of the world as well , including the Pacific islands , Australia , and southern Africa .
Racist Europeans used to attribute those conquests to their supposedly better brains .
But no evidence for such better brains has been forthcoming .
Instead , the conquests were made possible by Europeans ’ nastier germs , and by the technological advances and denser populations that Europeans ultimately acquired by means of their domesticated plants and animals .
So on this 500th anniversary of Columbus ’s discovery , let ’s try to regain our sense of perspective about his hotly debated achievements .
There ’s no doubt that Columbus was a great visionary , seaman , and leader .
There ’s also no doubt that he and his successors often behaved as bestial murderers .
But those facts alone do n’t fully explain why it took so few European immigrants to initially conquer and ultimately supplant so much of the native population of the Americas .
Without the germs Europeans brought with them -- germs that were derived from their animals -- such conquests might have been impossible .

Amazon.com user reviews of The Holy Bible ( KJV )
We at FTP thought it would be amusing to compile some of the more interesting reviews of The Holy Bible from Amazon.com :
Frankly , I was disappointed .
I expected more from God.
Definitely not his best work .
" I find the plot hard to follow , the writing style is pretty rough and the characters lack emotional depth .
God turns out to be a pretty mean guy when he kicks Adam and Eve out of the garden for simply eating an apple and then tries to trick Abraham into killing his son ... just kidding !
He does do a good job of flooding the earth and killing most everyone which is kind of cool , but again , kind of mean .
The new testament stuff is better ...
Jesus is a pretty cool dude with a good message about loving people and turning the other cheek and all that ... but it seems to get lost in translation somewhere in the modern world . "
The Bible forms the basis for two of the world 's most popular religions , Judaism and Christianity .
I normally do n't recommend reading a book just based on popularity , but in this case the work has been so influential that it 's worth having a copy handy .
The main text is a compilation of stories that are mostly borrowed from Sumerian and Greek myths that were prevalent several thousand years ago .
These were assembled in a rather haphazard fashion to conform to various political and sociological agendas as they changed over the years .
The result is a challenging read , in parts contradictory and often repetitive .
In several places it 's just plain impossible to figure out what 's going on , but that 's to be expected from a work that has been so thoroughly edited , censored , translated , and rearranged .
Nonetheless , it 's worth reading , simply because it has had such an enormous influence on so many human endeavors , from literature to art to law .
As such , it provides a helpful context for a broader secular education in almost any field ( except science , math , or refrigerator repair / maintenance ) .
Furthermore , many of the stories are very engaging , even though they are written in a somewhat opaque , old - timey style .
Most people know the creation and flood myths , but some of the lesser known stories are really gripping too , as long as one does n't mind a lot of violence .
Like I said to a Gideon who was handing out bibles on my campus , " Hey , is n't that a beginner 's book ? "
I was being both insulting and sincere .
It 's a great starter book .
After which , by the time you 're around 12 , I recommend some Mark Twain , working your way up to Milton at around 17 , and then never looking back , except to read the Book of James to your war mongering Christian friends .
In fact , the Book of James is the only book in this ( heavily edited ) compilation that I really recommend for adult readers .
In that book , God ( if you believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God ) says that faith without works is meaningless .
For this reason , Luther thought the Book of James should be removed from the Bible .
Essentially , it completely contradicts the American Protestant claim that you can do what you want as long as you have faith .
( A recent study , for example , showed that Christians who took abstinence pledges were more likely to engage in anal intercourse because it was n't really sex than non-Christians . )
This kind of faith - without - works logic ( borrowed from Paul , who was a Roman and who , unlike James , had never met Jesus ) means , for instance , that a person can be a Christian and start wars .
Contrary to this doctrine , God writes in James that there is one and only one reason for war : Greed !
Not democracy , not ideology , just plain , pure and simple greed for wealth .
What 's remarkable about this is that you can make this claim to a Christian friend and they 're likely to call you a socialist ( because you 're invoking material determinism to explain the emptiness of ideology ) , but there it is , in black and white , in the very " Word of God . "
Good stuff , the book of James .
Far better than Job , where God is a raging a - hole and close , personal friend of Satan .
Genesis , a tale stolen from the early Sumerians , is fascinating in its deft metaphoric tracing of the development of earthly life and human culture .
The story of Samson is rousing entertainment ( if misogynistic ) .
The Song of Solomon is lyrical and steamy .
As for the rest , sorry , but this is just not a convincing collection .
First ,
God is a vengeful father who has no sense of proportion , demanding the slaying of not only a man who stole silk and gold from God ( what , exactly , did the omnipotent creator of the universe want with a bolt of silk and a wedge of gold , anyway ? ) .
Then , no wait , God is actually the universal embodiment of love , desiring only that the more - or - less sapient beings of Earth worship Him .
Sure .
If this , humorless , sexist , ethnocentric tome actually did represent the words of God , life ( and afterlife ) would not be worth experiencing .
If you 're looking for a worthwhile epic , read Homer or Ovid or Chaucer or Shakespeare .
Hell , even Tennyson is more fun .
If you 're looking for a life , look elsewhere .
Get a decent job .
Get laid .
Read a * good * book .
Do some charity work .
Learn another language .
Travel .
Take up a hobby .
Canvass for a worthy cause .
This disjointed collection of gibberish and ravings is no shortcut to salvation .
Maybe
God will strike me in the spleen with a lightning bolt .
That would teach me .
Most Christians that I know have never read The Bible .
I felt it my duty as an atheist to know what I was criticizing , and so I read it through ... then , I went on to read the Koran , the Bhaghavad - Gita and am about half way through The Book of Mormon .
The conclusion I 've come to is that books of this type are n't really about what 's inside of them ; they 're about the faith people have that there 's some sort of meaning to the universe and their lives , etc .
These books are symbolic -- something to have one one 's bookshelf ( or mantle ) as a means of proclaiming one 's belief .
The actual written material is besides the point .
After all , how could any Christian defend items such as God 's killing of a man for touching the ark of the covenant ( he was trying to save the ark from falling ) ?
Or the laws that no one would defend in western society today , proclaimed in the Pentateuch , such as stoning an adulterer to death ?
Or children being mauled by bears for making fun of a prophet 's baldness ?
In terms of religion alone , The Bible does n't present a particularly moral or desirable God .
He asks his followers ( like Joshua ) to slaughter their ' enemies ' man , woman and child , and floods the world killing all but a family , when angry .
I suppose the implication is that we are to worship him because he is very powerful and will do horrible things to us if we do n't .
That is n't my idea of morality .
But as I say , these things are besides the point to almost all Christians ; it is always a mistake to question them on what is inside the Bible because 99 % of the time they do n't know what is inside .
In terms of literature , there are a few gems for someone interested in old mythic stories or ancient writings .
Job , Esther , Matthew and John and some others will hold your interest .
But the work as a whole is dreary to get through , especially areas like Kings and Chronicles and the major prophets ( Isaiah , Jeremiah and the like who endlessly repeat themselves ) .
But , of course , if it 's literature you 're really interested in , there 's a lifetime 's worth that is light years beyond this .
And so , I give this two stars instead of one simply for the historical importance of The Bible , which is the most compelling reason I can think of for reading it .
It wo n't help you to understand Christians particularly , as they have n't read it .
It wo n't entertain you particularly , and will at times bore you to unconsciousness .
It wo n't lift your morality as such , as most of the " heroes " are fairly immoral / amoral which befits the fact that they worship an immoral / amoral deity .
It 's good to read because it looks good on your intellectual resume and also because it 's caused quite a splash , for one reason or another , over the last 2000 years .
In all ... whatever .
The Holy Bible tells the story of , well , everything .
It begins with the creation of All That Is , and ends with Judgment Day ( though it 's pretty different from the one they showed in " Terminator 2 " ) .
It 's split into two parts , one old and one new .
This makes it easier to get through , sort of like " Lord of the Rings " or " Harry Potter " books .
There 's all sorts of numbers to help you keep track of where you are , so you do n't have to worry about a bookmark .
The main character in the story is God , who made Earth and stuff .
He sets a bunch of rules that he wants people to follow .
At first , all the Angels do what he tells `em , but one gets fed up and quits .
He is punished to Hell ( it 's a real place , not a cuss word ) and turns into Stan , which is a pretty cool part .
God next creates the first people , Adam & Eve ( who have a catalog named after them now .
Have you seen it ?
It 's awesome ) .
They live in a garden and are all happy and such until Eve screws up and they get evicted .
Same kinda thing happened to my brother and his girlfriend .
You also meet God 's son Jesus , who comes from above and lives with human parents .
He goes around helping people , which is cool .
Come to think of it , whoever wrote the Bible should sue the guys who make that show " Smallville . "
It 's a total rip .
Whatever .
Anyhow , Jesus tries to be a teacher and show the world how to be good , but then bad guys show up and pound on him .
If you want , you can see that in Mel Gibson 's last movie , but it 's pretty brutal .
I do n't want to give away the ending , but in the book Jesus comes back to life to save the day .
He rocks .
There 's tons of other great characters , like : Job ( I 'd love to know what his first name is ) , Noah , Lot , Lot 's Wife , Zeus , Hermaphrodite , and the Four Horsemen of Calypso .
Overall , I 'd say the Holy Bible is definitely worth reading .
It 's really long and has some slow parts , but I liked it a lot better than " Ethan Frome . "
Cool trivia : the Holy Bible is the basis of Christianity , one of the world 's most popular religions !
Looking for a spooky tale to curl up to this Halloween season ?
Is there a glaring gap between your Stephen King and Anne Rice books on the shelf ?
Here 's the perfect horror novel to plug it with !
A supernatural thriller to the core , the monster in this book will thrill and chill you !
A demonic entity named Yahweh sets humanity up with the perfect trap : the Tree of Life .
Knowing they 'll eat the otherwise purposeless fruit , he slaps them with a generational curse that binds them to his malevolent will !
What follows is the most twisted tale of evil ever written !
Yahweh , egotistical and ragingly jealous , uses those under his control to rape and pillage cultures that do n't worship him .
Men , women and animals alike were slain in these bloodthirsty raids .
The only hope you had was being a virgin woman whom Yahweh encourages to be conquested [ Deuteronomy 21:10 - 13 ] , [ Deuteronomy 20:13 - 16 ] .
If you have a hard time reading about cruel animal and human sacrifices , perverted sexual references and the murder and abuse of children I suggest not picking this up .
This is a true tale of horror and our villain is far from tactful !
However , Yahweh 's not a transparent , homicidal maniac .
To be so would be far too predictable and I commend the author on his skillful character development .
What makes
Yahweh so fiendish is that he commits his violent acts under the veneer of love !
To fool humanity further he sent down a hippy version of himself and later set that person up to die , quenching his bloodlust once again .
But , that 's not where the horror ends !
I hate to give away the ending but it 's far too devious to go unmentioned !
In the end his cult followers will be sucked into an alternative dimension where they will toil and praise his ego to never - ending extents .
Those who choose not to accept his conditional , unconditional love will find themselves in a sadistic torture pit of his making .
What 's really neat about this work of fiction is you do n't even have to pay for it !
There 's many fan bases out there that will happily provide you with a copy !
This mish - mash of a book is extremely hard to comprehend , and through no fault of the reader .
I read it many times in my 28 - year career as a Born - Again , God-Loving , Believer and Christian .
The Bible was the foundation and framework from which I tried to understand the world .
As I learned and discovered new things about the universe , I found that what I understood about the Bible did n't always match what was happening in real life .
So , I changed my interpretation .
I decided that either science was wrong and the Bible was right ( and thus science needed to be silenced ) , or I understood the scripture incorrectly and needed to find a new interpretation to match my new knowledge .
Friends , do n't go there .
That is a rabbit that a logical - minded Christian could spend a lifetime chasing .
Finally , I realized that the problem was not me or my interpretation of the Bible .
The problem was the Bible .
An honest person who is not afraid to truly examine their beliefs can easily go online and do a search and find documentation of literally hundreds of internal contradictions and errors within the Bible .
It is little wonder that preachers can't agree among themselves what the correct interpretation of scripture is , when the Bible can't even agree with itself !
After a struggle with my faith , and many prayers for wisdom and understanding seemingly falling on deaf ears , I realized that I do not believe in God anymore .
In fact , I no longer believe in the supernatural at all .
Breaking the Christian mind - control conditioning of HELL was very difficult .
( And yes , those who have ever had doubts about their faith know that the conditioning is very real . )
But it is impossible to make yourself believe something out of fear alone .
And once your mind examines the situation logically , you begin to realize how irrational the fear is .
And with that , the fear is gone .
So for the Bible , I will say that many good things have come from it as far as people teaching that we should love each other and be good to each other .
Many bad things have come from it too , such as religious wars , the crusades , the Salem witch trials , and the offspring of Judaism called Islamic Terrorism .
Does the good outweigh the bad ?
I do n't know .
It depends on who you ask .
But I find it likely that even in the absence of Christianity , people will still believe in the basic principles of fairness , love , and being good to each other .
Indeed , this is the case in " non-Christian " nations as well as " Christian " ones .
Christianity does not have a monopoly on morality , or goodness .
The book itself is quite boring .
It is frankly a pain to read .
" God 's Word " is spiritual meat and bread according to Jesus .
And it is supposed to refresh you and bring you life .
Personally , I found it to be quite a drag .
And honestly it does n't get any better with repeat readings .
If anything , it just gets more confusing and more inconsistent the more you read .
Been there , done that , no thanks .
If you are reading this review , then you probably are a Christian already .
Well , good luck to you .
I am glad we live in a country where we are free to believe , or not as the case may be .
Please just remember that not everyone wants your way of life .
Nor do they want religion crammed down their throat .
You have been taught to believe that your way is the better way .
( The ONLY way , as a matter of fact . )
Well , good for you .
But it would be nice for the rest of us if you would just keep it to yourself .
Unfortunately that 's not what Christianity is all about .
So read the book , if you want .
After all , Christians are required to buy it once they have been brainwashed into the church machine .
It 's one of the unwritten conditions of being saved .
Once you have asked Jesus to forgive your sins and come into your heart so you can receive the free gift of salvation , you will find that there are all sorts of other requirements that you will need to fulfill to truly get that salvation .
Suddenly , it wo n't be so " free " anymore .
Buying a Bible is your first requirement .
So buy it cheap on Amazon.com .
Any book that starts off with two naked people and a talking snake has something going for it .
The continuity is a bit off ; there 's the story of Cain and Abel being the sons of Adam and Eve , who are the first man and woman , but then Cain goes off and gets married , and it 's never really clear where Mrs. Cain comes from .
The poetry and lyrical realism are very reminiscent of Shakespeare 's better works , but it does get episodic in places , especially in all the writings of the " prophets ; " where 's the connection to the main plot ?
The second half has a nice " Rashomon " feel to it with four different versions of the life of the main protagonist .
The political issues get a little muddy ; the author could have taken a cue from Michener in doing more research and laying it out clearly as to what the political climate was like .
He or she assumes the reader is familiar with the back - story of Israel in 4 B.C. , and that 's a pretty big leap .
All in all I enjoyed it ; the messages were pretty simple : do unto others etc. is a bit hackneyed , but it still comes across .
As far as fables and mythology goes , though , you might want to check out some of the works by Tolkien ; there 's a much stronger plotline there .
Not a bad book .
Contains some of my favourite literature ever .
As Mark Twain put it ' It 's full of interest , has noble poetry in it , some clever fables , some blood drenched history , some good morals , a wealth of obscenity and upwards of a thousand lies ' .
If I could bring 10 books to a desert island , I 'd bring 10 copies of the bible .
It is just that good .
While there are some nicely poetic parts such as Ecclesiastes , there are numerous flaws in character development throughout the book that are too glaring to give it a good review .
Most obvious of these is the God character 's completely unexplained personality shift between part I and part II .
How are we to understand him going from the a psychopathic Patrick Batemanesque divinity in the beginning to suddenly being a benevolent absent father figure in the second part .
While I 'm not a professional psychologist it seems that as mentally disturbed as God is in the first part , that the chance of him mending his ways in such a dramatic way would have been as believable as Stalin regretting murdering millions of people towards the end of his life .
Additionally it seems doubtful at best that a father with so many deep personality problems could raise such a socially well - adjusted son .
Obviously the father 's extreme violence would account for Jesus 's extreme passivity in the face of violence , but one would equally expect him to lash out murderously after the role model of his father at some point .
The fact that God pretty much disappears in the last half is never explained either .
Has he been arrested ?
Is he in rehab or an anger management program ?
We 're just never told .
Some may excuse the unbelievable character and psychological development on the book 's age .
To those individuals I would say read the Iliad and Odyssey .
Both were written in the same age and both have well - crafted characters with distinct development arcs who act in believable ways .
It 's unfortunate , but then few authors have the skills to out do Homer , especially in the ancient world .
This book is the product of a severely diseased mind .
Every human perversion and psychosis is analyzed in depth .
From all shades of prejudice , to sadism and incest , the worst of the human condition is proudly on display , married to a forceful ignorance which concludes that -
1 . All homosexuals should be executed .
2 . Blacks are merely slightly evolved monkeys .
3 . Women are responsible for all human sin and weakness .
4 . The world is a 6000 year old floating disk around which sea monsters patrol .
( Various copies of this book omit this statement , as it was proven wrong in the late 15th Century .
Unfortunately for the faithful , this book is the inspired word of their invisible friend who lives in the sky , whom they call " God " .
This God is incapable of speaking anything but the truth .
Thus to omit or change any statement from the original bible is to move against God , and imply that he is capable of being wrong , which throws the whole text out the window . )
5 . A man named Moses was given a tablet listing ten commandments , which govern human morality .
Sadly ,
God is plagiarizing the ancient Egyptians and their Book of the Dead here , which had essentially the same list , and was created much earlier than this Judeo - Christian work .
A decidedly low blow by God there , as the ancient Egyptians never had the Book of the Dead copyrighted , and can not sue him .
Please do the right thing and burn any copies of this book which you encounter , to inhibit the spread of this idealogical cancer .
And if you ever encounter someone who actually believes the depravities and impossibilities listed in this text , please beat them about the head with a large , blunt instrument repeatedly until they come to their senses .
Think of it as your Christian duty .
Put it right on the shelf with the rest of the fiction .
Sex , Violence , persecution , discrimination , racism , incest , murders aplenty ... this book has it all .
On top of that it 's hard to read because of the archaic use of language .
Written 50 years after the alleged death of Jesus .
Translated by just about anyone who wanted to .
REWRITTEN by every ruler who did n't like what the older version said .
Why does the bible have more sex than a daytime Soap ?
Because sex sells .
Christianity is a plagiarism of the sun god Mithra , a poorly written thought virus that was used by the Romans to control their slaves .
No first century historian confirms the existence of Jesus .
None of the Jewish or Roman historians living during the time in which Jesus was said to have lived wrote one word about him .
The birth , life , death , and resurrection of Jesus Christ is documented in only one source , the bible .
Now if there were other Jewish or even Pagan historical documents showing that Jesus really was around at the time in which he was said to have been around , you would have something .
But to date , NOBODY has been able to produce such a record !
You do n't believe bigfoot is real because you read it in a tabloid , do you ?
The bible is just like a tabloid .
It contains a lot of extraordinary hearsay evidence .
However , extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence .
Yes , I am an atheist , but not without careful consideration .
The bible is flooded with contradictions , but that 's not the main reason I refuse to believe in god .
There are more than 5,000 different gods out there and everybody has their own opinion to which one they want to believe .
As for me , rather than believing in comforting lies and hearsay evidence , I choose to follow that which can be proven and used in a clear state of truth .
I depend on science and research to find the answers & solutions for my life .
Instead of living on biblical fables and blind faith , I rely on true knowledge and my free will to accept life as it is .
The bible is hearsay evidence , much less a fairy tale .
I would strongly advise anyone to be more skeptical and do more research on things before taking them for granted .
The Bible contains farces that even an act of God cannot explain .
After the creation , God asks Adam to look over the animals and find one " suitable " for him ( Genesis 2:18 - 20 ) .
The all - knowing god is absolutely clueless as to what kind of partner Adam might desire .
Did he not already realize that he was going to make a woman for him ?
Is n't it also disgusting for God to propose that Adam should find an animal to be his sexual companion ?
The trinity is also bizarre .
First it was not mentioned in either the old or new testament .
Second no one can explained it correctly or credibly .
You just have to believe .
But when you compound it with errors and absurdities in the bible as well as recognizable fabrications , you can't just throw caution and logic and just believe .
We are told that God is one yet he is three or has three facets .
We are also told that the way to salvation is that Jesus died for us on the cross .
If so what happened to those God drowned or sent fire and stones on them .
When you ask members of clergy they tell you that Jesus died for them too .
Then salvation is not through Jesus .
Even so , why did God killed them for their sins when he was going to save through Jesus later on ?
Does n't make sense .
If God is not going to save them then it's not fair since the doctrine of accepting Jesus was not an option to then .
Did God just changed his mind and decided to change the path to salvation ?
then what kind of God is that ?
And when Mary was pregnant with God , who took care of the universe ?
Did Jesus exist before Mary was carrying him ?
If not then he is not the Alpha and therefore he is not God .
And if he exited before then how did be become a fetus and what did he do during his 30 years stay on earth before he started preaching ?
People say he was learning about people .
That 's bull .
An omnipotent omniscient God does n't know about His creation ?
The following quotes convey the Christian doctrine stating that Jesus came to Earth to voluntarily die for the sins of mankind , thus enacting the " ultimate sin atonement " and becoming the " Savior of the world . "
I Corinthians 15:3
For I delivered to you , it being most important , what I also received , that Jesus died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures .
Mark 10:45
For the Son of Man came not to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many .
I Peter 3:18 For Jesus also died for sins once for all , the righteous for the unrighteous .
However , one should question this tenet of faith upon evaluating Jesus ' state of mind prior to his crucifixion .
Hebrews 5:7 Jesus prayed with loud crying and supplications and tears to Him Who was able to save him from death , and he was heard because he feared .
Matthew 27:46
About the ninth hour J cried out with a loud voice : ' My God , my God , why have You forsaken me ? '
Luke 22:43
And there appeared an angel to him from heaven , strengthening him .
And being in agony he prayed more earnestly , and his sweat was as great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
Because this verse is excessively revealing , some editions of the New Testament omit it from the text , and have it in the footnotes
God sure sounds unhappy .
Maybe he should seek professional help for his anger .
Hell , it worked for me .
Oprah should really blow this one out of the water ...
OK , so maybe several thousand readers * were * fooled when they learned that A Million Little Pieces was n't entirely based on the facts of Frey 's struggle with addiction , and that some bits were fictionalised .
But , taken into account that millions upon millions of people have been duped ( and continue to be so ) over the veracity of The Bible & its claims as truth in light of historical accounts , I think that we 're better off with Frey 's editors ' decision to market his work as memoir vs. fiction .
Really !
And , in hopes of maintaining a realistic perspective here , it 's not like members of a pro-Frey faction swarmed down across the land , spilling over to foreign markets & distribution areas to enforce not only readership but acceptance of the content , putting to the sword those potential readers who could n't be , in good conscience , fans .
Wow , now there 's some harsh marketing !
Hark , is that the sound of thundering hooves I hear approaching ?
Woot !
It 's Anchor Press 's horseback crusades !
Run !
The factual problems with this volume center around the supposed accuracy of the storytellers , but even the least educated reader * must * not have been able to suspend their disbelief in order to swallow the hooey that some of the supposedly - real characters in the story lived to 700 years of age !
Now , really !
Unless that 's a typo with an extra zero at the end , I 'm not sure that a detail like that can be accepted as an infallible source with * any * historical merit .
I mean , it * was * the first book to be printed , so , you figure , in the amount of editions & reprints in the past 600 years there was plenty of time for fact - checking & careful editing .
It 's sloppiness like that which discredits the volume as a whole .
Historical fiction demands accuracy & supporting sources , and non-fiction requires a balance of alternative texts .
Unfortunately , the zealous fanbase has kept this work afloat for so long , who become more like apologists or defenders of the work without sufficiently addressing the problems of the work itself .
This is Pottermania , people !
No room for a scholarly debate .
I 'm sure to recovering addicts that Frey is godlike in his deliverance of succor to suffering masses of people wanting to come clean , but does his authorship entail deification ?
And , if so , does it follow that his word is always true & good ?
I think that , besides being a boring read with a lot of irrelevant details , The Bible 's problem is that it takes itself too seriously , which in turn influences its readers unduly .
To think that people would use it to gauge the total age of the Earth & come up with 6000 years as an acceptable answer succinctly demonstrates the danger in its flaws .
Those who enjoy that famous Christian lotus squat on their knees oughta know a few basics first about this Vatican sales brochure that once was a holy scripture .
You see , there exist such things as Codex Vaticanus , Codex Sinaiticus , and Codex Bezae , albeit locked deep in the Vatican dungeons known world over as the " Secret Library " .
Codices ?
No , these are n't the latest Microsoft 's video media codec plug-ins but the actual records on the many revisions made to this very ancient scripture .
Codex Vaticanus alone contains no less than fourteen thousand -- that 's 14,000 + -- revisions , modifications and omissions .
BTW , these have nothing to do with the translation , which , of course , introduces yet another few layers of ambiguity , as you can imagine , especially when we 're talking English , a language that gave up grammar altogether and adopted the most deserted vocabulary .
Coupled with the other codices , a simple calculation yields the shocking yet all that much more true fact that the book today contains no original text , thought , or even a remote idea whatsoever .
Although dramatically bound in a fear striking black hard cover , it contains no valuable link to what it 's claiming to be representing .
Seeking the word of God , one is better served by searching the Internet for the Coptic originals of the Gospel of Thomas and reading what Jesus himself had said , which BTW never made it into this version of bible at all .
How is it possible that Jesus ' , the very messiah upon whom the entire writ stands , own verbiage is left out of the " holiest " of books ?
Well , it 's no surprise , if you read it .
You see , Jesus himself was very much against individuals donating to organizations and bowing heads to popes , pontiffs , scribes , and other Catholic church reps .
Letting the truth out , may affect Vatican 's life of sin , and so they choose the way of G.W.
Bush and offer a lie after a lie than to give up their wealth .
Make no mistake , Vatican owns one third of EU land and about 1/2 of the US land .
It pretty much owns entire South America .
It makes more money than EU / USA combined and they produce nothing , except this bizarre reprint void of anything relevant to God , Jesus or the Holy Spirit for that matter .
The writers are very imaginative and weave some fascinating tales as the various authors take you through the mythology of Judaism and Christianity with some very colorful characters that keep your attention .
Some stories are violent , some are love stories , some are tales of loss , and others are down - right amusing .
One of my only complaints is there are some " gaps " that lack explaining ( some , such as the removal of Lilith from Genesis by the early Christians creates a problem about where Caine gets his wife from ) .
Another small gripe I had was up until Abraham , there was different gods guiding the Jews and they seems to " disappear " after Abraham makes his deal with Iehova ( I use the Latin spelling ) .
I do wish they said what happened to them after Abraham unified the Jews under Iehova .
In the New Testament I have a hard time liking Paul ( he comes across kinda hard and I disagree about his views on women ) .
Jesus is a really likeable guy who I would like to just hang out with .
The authors did a great job of making the Jewish Pharisees very treacherous and not wanting to give up the power that they have held for so long and had become corrupted by .
Obviously some of the details were lost over time and stories were edited and " re-fitted " to match ideology of religious leaders over time as well .
Like I said in the title , it 's very interesting , but has inconsistencies .
Apart from the leather , this book is n't really any good .
It lacks consistency .
Constant repetition yet also hypocrisy of previous chapters within the same sentence
It 's almost as if someone wrote this is some kind of a joke !
Also ,
It 's somewhat long .
This is mainly due to the repetition , and the " bonus chapter " of Psalms at the end which are thoughtful passages about sheep and other gentle wildstock .
I think this " extra " is aimed at the Welsh .
The Old Testament is generally more entertaining than the New there are a few events where the main protagonist " God " gets angry and knocks over a wall which kills 27,000 people .
Bit harsh I thought - But Entertaining .
But
When we get to the New Testament this book takes a sudden change and plot .
The new approach is to make the Book even more boring than before and to just have 10 identical chapters talking about " Jesus " -
The new main protagonist who is the son of the old one " God "
Less entertaining things happen such as not taking into account the need of food at a big Jesus seminar and then Jesus finding some fish to feed them and save the day .
And something about him entering an anorexic stage and walking on water .
I would skip this part .
I think A better name for this would have been " Testament Re-spawned - The Second Coming - New Generation " But The " New Testament " was somehow chosen instead .
With a combined 72 authors working on this book I was expecting a lot more for my £ 20 .
It 's simply full of incorrectly organized sentences , made - up words and boring events .
Also , when I found out half of this book ( the new bit ) can be found for free in hotels inside drawers made me very angry I feel like I 've been conned .
Anyway - I turned the leather into a decent wallet for Father 's day so all was not a loss .
Overall rating - 1/5
But not in a blasphemous / sac- religious way .
Ok , here we go with a review of perhaps the longest book ever !
Growing up I noticed that every house I have ever been to has had this book somewhere inside !
I grew curious but whenever I asked them about it they told me they never really read it .
" This is peculiar ! " I thought , " A book that everyone has but nobody reads ! "
Well , at one point I decided it was time , I picked up a copy , my house had one too of course and began to dig in .
" In the beginning , God created the heavens and the Earth . "
Wow , now when this author was told to start at the beginning he took it seriously !
I was immediately intrigued however , in school they told us that monkeys made the Earth or something .
I read on .
Well , turns out that God made , man and animals too , and just about everything else .
Except for computers and stuff I guess .
Well , Man gets off to a rough start and starts killing people right away .
They have sex with about anything and the world is falling apart .
So God has the only good man left build a huge boat and live in it with his family while God floods the Earth .
Things are n't much better after that , Man is still killing and having sex with stuff .
God enacts , plan 2 .
He reminds a guy in Babylon that there is only one God and man is worshiping statues instead of him .
So he tells the guy that if he leaves everything he has and goes to some far off place he will make them into a mighty race and will act as his ambassadors to Earth .
He figures what the hey and goes with it .
He settles in a land called Canaan .
A bunch of weird stuff happens but they live .
Ok I guess .
Until his descendants have one heck of a drought and can't live there anymore .
So they move to Egypt .
All is well and good because Egypt is rich and pretty much the height of civilization .
Think of it like America is today .
But the Egyptians find out early on that if they make the Jews ( God 's people ) do the work , they wo n't have to .
This at first seems like a good idea , but they picked the wrong people to mess with because they have the Creator on their side .
After a few hundred years of this a man named Moses tells them to leave and go back to their homeland .
They have a hard time doing this but , long story short they make it out of there and get back to their homeland .
After a 40 year freakout in the desert that is .
You see , Moses turned them on to some tablets that will change them forever .
God gives him Ten laws to live by .
And then a few hundred more .
I mean there are pages and pages of this book that has to do with these laws , what they can eat , what to do if they get sick , what punishments for breaking laws should be , and so on and so forth .
Moving on .
There 's a problem though .
Their homeland has been taken over by some mean dudes .
And I mean mean .
They are giants and they are keeping this land for themselves .
So the Jews form an army and get ready to kick some but .
They drive the johnny - come - latelys out on their kiesters .
Well , they set their government up so that these Judges rule everything .
The Jews do n't like this though , they want to keep up with the Joneses and have a King like everyone else .
God is like , " Hello , I 'm your king , remember ? "
But he gives in and has this Saul guy take charge .
Things are ok until Saul discovers that he pretty much rules the roost .
After all God said he could rule these people so he might as well have fun doing it .
Saul does such a bad job that they decide to get a new king .
So they say David is going to be their king .
So David is the king now and he is awesome .
He takes over the rest of the homeland , and makes the country pretty rich , he writes poetry and music , and well he can do it all .
He eventually kicks the bucket however , and Solomon takes control .
He 's okay at first , he builds them a huge temple .
But he starts marrying women like crazy from all over the world and they worship some crazy gods .
After that Israel , Canaan 's new name , is split into two .
The north decides they do n't want God anymore , but the south is still cool with him .
They both get taken over by Babylon anyway .
Babylon takes the Jews into Babylon , ( Where they came from ! ) and enslaves them .
Looks like it was out of the frying pan and into the fire .
God has some people talk to the Jews for him , prophets and the next few hundred pages are writings by these prophets about what the heck is going to happen to them .
The Jews eventually get back to Israel and are like , okay we are going to play by God 's rules this time .
The book then fast forwards a couple hundred years .
Rome owns Israel now and Israel is like it 's B*tch .
God is like , I told you I was going to send you a king that would make Israel powerful again so here goes .
He has Mary give birth to his Son and his Son is going to be the new King .
The king 's name is Jesus , he is pretty important because the next 4 chapters are about him .
And he is like , God told you I was coming and you thought I was going to save you .
Turns out I am going to save everybody , not by force though .
The Jews are like , it better be by force , these Romans are bugging the heck out of us .
But Jesus tells them to love their enemies and the he is going to die so that everyone , even the non-Jews can go to heaven .
The Jews are like , okay so this guy is n't our new King after all .
So he eventually is arrested and the Jews do n't want him and the Romans do n't know what to do with him so they kill him .
Jesus is like , I told you this was going to happen , do n't worry about it .
A few days later Jesus is back but just for a little bit , he tells the apostles it is up to them now , they have to spread his message of salvation so that everyone can be saved .
In the next book , the disciples are called Christians and they set up churches all over the place .
There is a Jewish guy named Saul that really hates Christians and kills them , but then he turns to God and realizes that Jesus was the king after all .
Most of the rest of this book is written by him and it is filled with how a Christan should live .
Things are n't over yet , there is still the shocking climax .
We 've been told what happened , now we are going to learn about what is going to happen .
The world gets worse and worse and Christians are being persecuted everywhere .
So Jesus is not going to take it anymore .
God and he begin to begin to start some havoc on Earth , nobody listens though because they no longer believe in him .
Before unleashing the wrath though , Jesus comes back to Earth to take his followers out , and then comes back to kick some butt .
He knocks this Anti-Christ guy out of office and becomes the king of Israel .
Things are going well until Satan comes back to take over Earth again .
Satan is mentioned throughout the book as well .
He is the Antagonist of the book and has been messing with God for some time now .
As a matter of fact he is in the very beginning of the book when man starts messing up , so God is like , I 'm sending someone to take care of you so keep it up and see what happens .
Anyway , Jesus finally shows Satan who is boss and throws him into an eternal fire along with the Anti-Christ guy .
God and him then destroy the Earth one last time and make a new one for the Christians , and the Jews I guess , to live .
Phew , that was not an easy review .
But it was not an easy book either .
It took about 4 years , reading on and off , to finish it .
I highly recommend it though .
While reading it I discovered that there are a lot of places that have banned the book , like public schools .
Especially Science classes because the teachers would give me really dirty looks when I brought it to class .
They would tell me that monkey 's made people , not God .
I do n't think God would lie about this though .
If the monkey 's made us it would be in this book .
Plus , if you have every seen a monkey , they do n't really look capable of doing anything really .
Long story short , check this book out .
It wo n't cost you anything because , as I said , every house comes equipped with one .
Upon close scrutiny , we discover that the content of KJ Bible is a compilation of historically and archaeologically unsupportable Myths such as Noah 's ark , Abraham , Joseph , David , Solomon , etc .
It should also be noted that the book contains considerable violence and barbarism , in both the Old Testament & New , and I would certainly not recommend this book to children or youth , where the killing , brutality and guilt - mongering in the Bible could certainly have a very negative , fearful , and detrimental effect on a young person 's development .
It also contains numerous self - contradictory passages and historically incorrect verses such as the statement in Daniel that erroneously refers to Belshazzar as being the son of Nebuchadnezzar , or in the NT , where the 10 - year gap in between the actual death of Herod in 4BCE and the actual rule of Quirinius in 6CE renders the gospel text historically impossible .
The Esoteric Mythology of the " virgin and child " was depicted in Egypt for millennia before appearing as a human literalization in the NT Religious Dramas .
In light of the fact that there is no extra-biblical evidence for a Jesus of Nazareth or the alleged events of " good Friday " ( although there were other prophets and zealots by that name operating at that time who could have been the model for the NT pseudepigraphic constructs ) , there are many who say that Jesus never existed , and IMO as per its content , this book has little value as a complete historical record .
There are a few good passages , such as loving your neighbor as yourself and other wise " sayings " , some of which are also present in more ancient religious texts .
As has been said , The Song of Solomon is certainly a decent piece of erotic literature , but as for the rest of it , I certainly do n't consider all of the incongruity in the Bible to be the " inerrant " " divinely inspired " " word " of any " perfect " God as per the claims of the content
(1) THE BIBLE collects together ' the Word of God ' as delivered to humankind .
It is fact that this ' delivery ' was confined solely to a highly localized community .
Somewhere about 1440 - 1450 CE , the printing press was invented .
The printing press therefore appeared nearly one and half millennia after ` Christ ' .
It took considerably longer until literacy was widespread .
Thus whole civilizations , communities , groups , nations , families , individuals , cultures on other parts of the Earth came and went without any opportunity whatsoever to know about this ` Christ ' and His so - called `redemptive message ' , `knowledge ' , `moral codes ' , `guidance as to life and conduct ' and so on .
Why does a ` God ' powerful enough to Create and Sustain the entire universe - all its content , its extent , its phenomena , its stupendous physical manifestations , communicate ` His Word ' to humankind in a manner that is , in terms of its mode and extent of communication , factually and manifestly indistinguishable from a local , parochial man- breathed myth left to spread through only - too - human means ?
Why are so very many people deserted by ' The Lord Jesus Christ ' - never remotely having the chance to know about ' The Christ ' , his `universal moral codes ' , his strictures , guidance , `redemptive purpose ' etc ?
Why does the ` Almighty ' communicate with such limited power ?
It is because this is a parochial man-created myth that spread merely through man-limited capability .
And Jesus just happens to appear in the very locality on Earth that was already surrounded by , and awash with , many similar deity myths .
These end up in The Bible .
' The Lord Jesus Christ ' is constructed from plagiarized and reheated god myths .
(2) Why does ' God ' ( supposedly : Omnipotent , Omniscient , Transcendent , Immanent , Creator ex nihilo , Eternal ) Create and Sustain people who are not His Chosen or His Elect and who He Knew would never be His Chosen or His Elect ?
(3) The entity that created and sustains the entire universe , including : super - giant stars , super - massive black holes , countless galaxies , neutron stars , red giants , super - nova , hyper - nova , stupendous physical , biological , chemical , geological phenomena , huge terrestrial and gaseous planets , and so on and so on , was obsessed with :
burning flesh , circumcision , sexual practices , Semitic rituals , pig meat , reciting tedious and elaborate lists of family names , incest , oxen goring men needing to be punished , the eating of blood and fat , the eating of shellfish , bodily discharges , beard trimming practices , hair length , crushed testicles , eunuchs , cloth garments ... the list is much longer and includes : a man who refuses to impregnate his widowed sister - in - law is put to death by The Lord [ GE 38:8 - 10 ] .
Universal ` Truths ' passed to man by ` The Almighty The Lord God ' ?
Or merely the parochial preoccupations of ancient Semitic tribes and scribes ?
Think about it .
(4) Time to grow - up out of this ` Harry Potter for adults ' product of cultural imagination and tribal human invention .

Advertisement Robots that can climb walls have been developed by scientists in the United States .
The robots can scale surfaces using the same principles behind electrostatic charges , which make balloons stick to ceilings after being rubbed .
Developed by a team in SRI 's Mobile Robotics and Transducers Programme , the machines are about the size of a remote - controlled car and have caterpillar tracks similar to those on toy tanks .
Inside these tracks are materials with electro - adhesive properties , which mean that when a current is applied , the tracks are attracted to the wall , preventing the robots from falling off .

More from Digital Planet " What we 've invented is a way to induce charges on the wall using a power supply located on the robot , " research engineer Harsha Prahlad told BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme .
" The robot carries with it positive and negative charges , and when the walls sees these charges it automatically generates the opposite charge .
The robot can then clamp onto those charges .
" In some ways it is similar to rubbing a balloon and sticking it on the wall , except we carry our own power supply and are able to control the adhesion . "
Insect robots
The robots can climb up and down a range of surfaces
The technology , called compliant electroadhesion , uses a very small amount of power and the robots can crawl at a speed of about one body length per second .
The robots are being touted for use by the military , for reconnissance , for service applications and as toys .
" It is very similar to how a toy tank works , with the two treads , " Mr Prahlad explained .
" There are positive and negative traces attached to the treads .
" We simply drive it , moving it like a conveyer belt . "
The team is now working on a way to apply their technology to more insect - like robots , to mirror the way that creatures such as flies are able to walk upside - down .
This will be done by putting electro - adhesive pads on the robot feet .
" We often think of electrostatic forces as very weak - but if you get very close , you can get very strong forces from this , " Mr Prahlad added .

In what appears to be an attempt to silence his critics , Memphis Police Director Larry Godwin has filed an interstate subpoena for discovery against the owner of the blog MPD Enforcer 2.0 , an anonymous website geared toward and run by current and former members of the Memphis Police Department .
The anonymous Google Blogspot site has , for the last four months , served as a sort of online water cooler where Memphis ' uniformed patrol officers can voice their anonymous discontent with the leadership of MPD , whoM they collectively refer to as " the 12th Floor . "
The MPD Enforcer 2.0 quickly became a clearinghouse of unreported or unpublished stories of interest to Memphis police officers , in part thanks to its name .
In the 1990s a paper version of the MPD Enforcer was circulated among Memphis Police by hand .
Later , during the dawning days of the internet , an online version appeared on the Geocities website .
Today , the MPD Enforcer 2.0 , written and maintained by a group of people with no connection to the original paper version of the Enforcer , enjoys new life on Google 's Blogspot website , where anyone within or without the MPD can publish whatever they like without fear of recrimination .
The only method of contacting the current administrator of the Enforcer 2.0 , who operates under the pseudonym Dirk Diggler , is via his AOL email address , and he agreed to an email interview with the Memphis Flyer under the condition that his identity remained secret .
Q : How did you find out about the subpoena ?
Was it through a friend , an email tip , a letter from AOL , etc ?
Director Godwin has filed a motion for discovery of the identity of Mr. Diggler under the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act , which has been made law in thirteen states , among them Tennessee and Virginia .
According to Channel 24 Eyewitness
News reporter Jeni DiPrizio , subpoenas have been sent to AOL , Google , and Zimbio , Inc. , but among the three , only AOL is based in a state where the law is applicable .
AOL is headquartered in Virginia , but Google and Zimbio are both based in California , and neither company has contacted Mr. Diggler about Director Godwin 's legal motion .
Under the law , the jurisdiction of the discovery state has the power to quash the subpoena , which in this case is the 20th Judicial Circuit of Virginia .
In a previous case , IPA vs. May , Judge Thomas D. Horne of the 20th Circuit issued a protective order on behalf of AOL on the grounds that the plaintiff had failed to furnish a " mandate , writ or commission " to the court under the UFDA as required by Virginia law .
To put it in layman 's terms , Director Godwin may face a long , tedious legal battle if he truly wants to publicly identify Mr. Diggler and his associates in court .
As the original Dirk Diggler might say , " You 're not the boss of me , Jack .
I 'm Dirk Diggler and I say when we roll . "
Opto -Isolator
2007 | Golan Levin with Greg Baltus / Standard Robot Company
Opto -Isolator ( 2007 : Golan Levin with Greg Baltus ) inverts the condition of spectatorship by exploring the questions : " What if artworks could know how we were looking at them ?
And , given this knowledge , how might they respond to us ? "
The sculpture presents a solitary mechatronic blinking eye , at human scale , which responds to the gaze of visitors with a variety of psychosocial eye - contact behaviors that are at once familiar and unnerving .
Among other forms of feedback , Opto - Isolator looks its viewer directly in the eye ; appears to intently study its viewer 's face ; looks away coyly if it is stared at for too long ; and blinks precisely one second after its visitor blinks .

We must reclaim the full range of blessings from his movement .
For Dr. King , race was in most things , but defined nothing alone .
His appeal was rooted in the larger context of nonviolence .
His stated purpose was always to redeem the soul of America .
He put one foot in the Constitution and the other in scripture .
“ We will win our freedom , ” he said many times , “ because the heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands . ”
To see Dr. King and his colleagues as anything less than modern founders of democracy  even as racial healers and reconcilers  is to diminish them under the spell of myth .
Dr. King said the movement would liberate not only segregated black people but also the white South .
Surely this is true .
You never heard of the Sun Belt when the South was segregated .
The movement spread prosperity in a region previously unfit even for professional sports teams .
My mayor in Atlanta during the civil rights era , Ivan Allen Jr. , said that as soon as the civil rights bill was signed in 1964 , we built a baseball stadium on land we did n’t own , with money we did n’t have , for a team we had n’t found , and quickly lured the Milwaukee Braves .
Miami organized a football team called the Dolphins .
The movement also de-stigmatized white Southern politics , creating two - party competition .
It opened doors for the disabled , and began to lift fear from homosexuals before the modern notion of “ gay ” was in use .
Not for 2,000 years of rabbinic Judaism had there been much thought of female rabbis , but the first ordination took place soon after the movement shed its fresh light on the meaning of equal souls .
Now we think nothing of female rabbis and cantors and , yes , female Episcopal priests and bishops , with their colleagues of every background .
Parents now take for granted opportunities their children inherit from the Montgomery bus boycott .
It is both right and politic for all people , including millions who are benign or indifferent toward the civil rights movement , or churlish and resentful , to see that they , too , and their heirs , stand with us on the shoulders of Rosa Parks , Medgar Evers and Fannie Lou Hamer .
Dr. King showed most profoundly that in an interdependent world , lasting power grows against the grain of violence , not with it .
Both the cold war and South African apartheid ended to the strains of “ We Shall Overcome , ” defying all preparations for Armageddon .
The civil rights movement remains a model for new democracy , sadly neglected in its own birthplace .
In Iraq today , we are stuck on the Vietnam model instead .
There is no more salient or neglected field of study than the relationship between power and violence .
We recoil from nonviolence at our peril .
Dr. King rightly saw it at the heart of democracy .
Our nation is a great cathedral of votes  votes not only for Congress and for president , but also votes on Supreme Court decisions and on countless juries .
Votes govern the boards of great corporations and tiny charities alike .
Visibly and invisibly , everything runs on votes .
And every vote is nothing but a piece of nonviolence .
SO what should we do , now that 40 years have passed ?
How do we restore our political culture from spin to movement , from muddle to purpose ?
We must take leaps , ask questions , study nonviolence , reclaim our history .
Now that Starbucks Corp. has disclosed the 600 locations it wants to shutter , a phenomenon is taking hold : the Save Our Starbucks campaign .
In towns as small as Bloomfield , N.M. , and metropolises as large as New York , customers and city officials are starting to write letters , place phone calls , circulate petitions and otherwise plead with the coffee company to change its mind .
" Now that it 's going away , we 're devastated , " said Kate Walker , a facilities manager for software company SunGard Financial Systems who recently learned of a store closing in New York City .
It is an unusual twist in the saga of Starbucks , one of the fastest - growing retailers of the past decade .
For years , Starbucks gained attention when a town did n't welcome it .
Independent coffee shops complained about the big- muscled competition , and residents bemoaned the erosion of local character .
But ever since Starbucks announced this month that it would close 600 stores by early next year , as its business struggles , the rallying cause has switched to saving these endangered locations .
Zen and the Art of Debugging C/C++ in Linux with GDB P : 19 jwwicks C/C++ Programs and Debugging in Linux
This tutorial will give you a basic idea how to debug a program in Linux using GDB .
As you are aware Visual Studio doesnt run on Linux so you have to use some of the tools provided on the command - line .
If you hate the command line tools , get over it since you re bound to be using them at some point in your career .
All commands in Linux ARE case sensitive so capital letters are different from lowercase letters .
If you need basic information about a command type command -- help at the shell prompt , where command is any Linux command and youll get a help screen .
Heres a basic list of commands youll get to know in Linux :
ls  Usage : ls [ OPTION ] ... [ FILE ] ...
List information about the FILEs ( the current directory by default ) .
Example : ls -l *.c
man  Usage : man [ OPTION ] ... [ COMMAND ] ...
Displays a manual page(s ) about a command
clear 
Clears the shell screen .
grep  Usage : grep [ OPTION ] ... PATTERN [ FILE ] ...
Search for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input .
Example : grep - i ' hello world ' menu.h main.c
apropos  Usage : apropos KEYWORD ...
Search for KEYWORD in commands .
Great for finding a command when you arent sure what it is .
Note : I had to change the makefile sections somewhat just so I could post so anytime you see GNU_COMPILER replace it with the appropriate command .
Creating a Project
In Linux youll use a shell of some sort , CShell or Bash etc to create projects .
For Windows based computers on a college campus youll probably use
Your instructor / administrator will give you logon information .
Once logged in , do a directory listing with the ls command .
For most college accounts there is only one directory initially and that is public_html .
In general it is a good practice to arrange your files on disk in some sort of directory scheme .
Note :
When creating directories in Linux uppercase letters ARE significant ; Projects is NOT the same as projects .
Create a directory called projects using the mkdir command like the following :
Change to the projects directory using the cd command .
Create a directory for this application using the mkdir command again and call it MyProjectName1 where MyProjectName1 is some descriptive name for the program you are working on .
For instance , if you are writing a program that computes income taxes type in MyTaxProgram or something similar .
Now change to this directory with the same cd command used previously .
At this point your screen should look like the following :
Now that we have a project directory well need to create a makefile to handle the building of our project once we get some source files created .
The makefile is just a text file like any other but it has some special commands inside it to build our executable .
To create a text file do the following :
1. Start you re favorite Unix editor , there are several , vi and emacs are the most widely used editors but pico / nano is a good basic editor available on most machines in college labs .
All the following examples use pico so the commands will be different if you are using a different editor .
Type pico at the command prompt and youll see the following screen :
2 . Press ctrl - O and save the file as makefile .
3 . Then add the following text to the makefile :
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers main.exe : Source1.cpp GNU_COMPILER
- Wall Source1.cpp -o main.exe Note :
The name Source1.cpp MUST match the name you 'll use for the source code file in the next section .
4 . Press ctrl - O again to save the changes to your makefile .
Creating a New Source Code File
If you are working on a new program , a new source code file must be created after the project directory has been created .
The steps below describe how to create the new source code file :
1. Start you re favorite Unix editor .
2. Press ctrl - O and save the file as Source1.cpp where Source1.cpp is some descriptive name for the program you are working on .
For instance , if you are writing a program that computes income taxes type in MyTaxProgram.cpp or something similar .
3 . Add the following text to your Source1.cpp file :
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers
////////////////////////// /// source1.cpp - /// Purpose : Some source code file /// /// Author : My Name /// Date : January 1st , 2xxx /// ////////////////////////
/// History /// INI 2xxx-01-01 v1.00.00 Initial release // Includes # include < iostream > # include < iomanip > using namespace std ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { int ret_val = 0 ; // holds return value for main program cout << " Hello World ... " << endl ; return ret_val ; }
Compiling my first Program
Now that we have our makefile and Source1.cpp files created all that s needed is to run the make utility to create our executable for testing .
1 . Get a directory listing of the current files in our project directory by using the ls command .
2 . Run the make command by typing make at the command prompt .
3. Messages from the compiler ( error messages , warning messages and a successful compile / build message ) will be displayed on screen .
4 . Get a directory listing of the current files in our project directory by using the ls command again .
Note : Notice the new file created by make called main .exe .
This is our executable .
Running a Program
Once the compile / build is successful , type the name of our executable at the command prompt to run it .
In this case our executable is main .
exe so type the following at the command prompt ./main.exe .
The following output should be displayed :
Lets add the following text to our code to make this program a little more interesting .
1 . Add the following text before main :
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers // Global constants and variables # define PRG_NAME " MyProjectName1 - v 1.0.00 " # define CPY_RGHT " Copyright © 2xxx - " #define AUTHOR " My Name " // function prototypes void show_copyright ( void ) ;
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers show_copyright ( ) ;
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers
///////////////////////// /// show_copyright /// Purpose : Show program name and copyright notice /// /// Parameters : None /// Output : couts PRG_NAME , CPY_RGHT and AUTHOR defines /// /// Returns : None /// SideEffects : None
////////////////////////
void show_copyright ( void ) { cout << AUTHOR << " 's " << PRG_NAME << endl ; cout << CPY_RGHT << AUTHOR << endl << endl ; return ; }
4. Now Compile / build and run the solution as you did before .
You should see the following screen :
Debugging a Program
It can sometimes be difficult to determine why a program does not run successfully .
A debugger allows a programmer to step through a program line - by - line to watch it execute and fail .
The values of variables can be watched as execution takes place as well .
GNU C++ has a debugger which can be used to step through a program .
It is important to note that the program must compile first .
Lets add some more code to our Source1.cpp file ( Note : this code has a logic problem in it to help you get used to debugging ) :
1 . Add the following code before main after the show_copyright function prototype :
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers char get_choice ( void ) ; bool is_valid_choice ( char ) ;
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers char choice ;
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers do{ cout << " Hello World ... " << endl ; choice = get_choice ( ) ; }while(!is_valid_choice( choice ) ) ;
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers
///////////////////////// /// get_choice /// Purpose : Check to see if user wants to continue /// /// Parameters : None /// Output : Prompts user to continue program /// /// Returns : char ch - Choice entered by user /// SideEffects : None ///////////////////////// char get_choice ( void ) { char ret_val ; char ch ; cout << " Do you want to continue ( 1 = Yes ) ( 0 = No ) ? : " ; cin >> ch ; ret_val = ch ; return ret_val ; } ///////////////////////// /// is_valid_choice ///
Purpose : Checks for valid yes or no entry to continue /// /// Parameters : char val - Current choice to continue /// Output : Displays an error message if an invalid choice is passed /// /// Returns : true if choice is valid and false otherwise /// SideEffects : None
//////////////////////// bool is_valid_choice ( char val ) { bool ret_val = true ; switch ( val ) { case 0 : case 1 : break ; default : ret_val = false ; cout << " Invalid choice : " << val << endl ; cout << " Please enter one of the following ( 0 or 1 ) : " << endl ; break ; } return ret_val ; }
6. Press 0 and instead of stopping the program like we asked , our program continues .
We have a bug here Watson .
Press Ctrl +C to stop executing the program .
Now well work on finding the bug in our code using the GNU debugger command gdb , but first we have to compile our program with some special code to enable debugging .
To do that well first need to create a directory named Debug and then modify our makefile to build our application with debugging information .
At the command prompt use the mkdir command to create a new directory named Debug .
Use the ls command to confirm that the directory was created and you should see a screen similar to the following :
Next open the makefile in your editor of choice , well use pico again .
Change the makefile so it has the following text in it :
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers main.exe : Source1.cpp GNU_COMPILER
- Wall Source1.cpp -o main.exe dbg_main : Source1.cpp GNU_COMPILER -g  Wall Source1.cpp o ./ Debug / main.exe make dbg_main and get a directory listing of the Debug directory using ls and you should have the following on your screen :
Now well run the GNU debugger gdb with the newly compiled application with debugging information in it .
Type gdb Debug / main .exe at the command prompt .
You should see a screen similar to the following :
At this point you are in the debugger and there are a number of command that can be used from here to help you figure out whats going on inside your program .
Heres a basic list of commands youll get to know in the GNU debugger :
help  Usage : help [ COMMAND ]
List information about the COMMAND
Example : help running or help breakpoints
list  Usage : list [ LINE or FUNCTION ] [ , ] [ LINE ] ...
Lists the lines in a file , 10 lines at a time
Example : list 1,100
break  Usage : break [ LINE or FUNCTION ]
Creates a breakpoint at a specified LINE or FUNCTION location
Example : break 100
run  Usage : run [ ARGUMENTS ] ...
Runs the currently loaded program with the specified ARGUMENTS .
Example : run - I hello world 
next  Usage : next
Steps through the next statement in the program .
step  Usage : step
Steps through one instruction only .
quit  Usage : quit
Quits the GNU debugger .
Breakpoints
A breakpoint tells the debugger to pause execution of a program until you tell it to continue .
In order to step through a program ( i.e. watch a program execute ) , a breakpoint should be set on the executable statement at which you want execution to pause .
To set a breakpoint on a statement , use the break command at the ( gdb ) prompt .
You specify either a function name or the line number of the executable to break on if you know it .
Determining where you want the breakpoint is a critical part of debugging .
Put your breakpoint too soon in the execution of the program and you waste time stepping through code that doesnt need to be debugged .
Put the breakpoint too late and you might just miss the bug altogether .
In our sample program above we have two possible places in our code that could be causing the problem .
Either the get_choice function isnt returning the proper value or the is_valid_choice function is nt correctly checking the value .
Let s set a breakpoint to check the return value of the get_choice function .
There are two possible places to check the value , one being inside the function itself or in the assignment statement in main .
Well set our breakpoint in main so we can check the return value .
First well use the list command to find the line we want in the executable .
In our example main starts at line 26 and ends at line 39 so the command list 26,39 will show those lines in the debugger :
Note :
Your line numbers may vary depending on how you create the source file .
Experiment .
In our example the line to set the breakpoint on is line number 35 .
So type in the command break 35 at the ( gdb ) prompt .
You should see a screen similar to the following :
Watching a Program Execute
Once a breakpoint is set , start the debugger by using the run command .
The program will begin to run but pause at the statement with the breakpoint prior to its execution .
For our sample you should see something like the screen below :
At this point you have a number of choices ( detailed below )
1 ) It is often helpful to know the value of a variable at a certain point in an executing program .
The debugger allows you to look at the contents of variables as a program executes .
Use the print command to display the value of an expression or variable .
2 ) If the current statement is a function call , Use the step command to go into the function to watch it execute .
3 ) Go to the next statement in the program by using the next command .
Lets use the print command to inspect the value of choice in our application .
Notice the value for choice in the window below is the char 0 or NULL .
Well be double - checking it in the next section once the get_choice function returns a value .
Since were not interested in stepping into the get_choice function well use the next command at the gdb prompt to execute the next statement in our program
Input and Output
As you may have notice output from our application appears in the gdb console window .
You should get a prompt asking
Do you want to continue ( 1 = Yes ) ( 0 = No ) , type in a 0 and hit [ Enter ] .
Now let s use the print command again on choice .
You should see a screen similar to the following :
Notice the change from before , 48 and 0 instead of 0 and \0  .
The 48 is the ASCII value for the character 0 , so the get_choice function is correctly returning a character value and choice is correctly storing that value .
By stepping through the program weve discovered our bug isnt in the get_choice function .
Since our next statement in the program is the other function we need to check , is_valid_choice , and we know that a valid character is stored in choice and the is_valid_choice function should just keep looping with no error message .
Use the step command to execute the is_valid_choice function .
Notice what happens to our console window .
This is nt correct since we know that the character 0 was passed in the variable choice to the function is_valid_choice by the following statement in main : }while (!is_valid_choice( choice ) ) ; .
So the problem has to be in the way in which is_valid_choice is checking the value .
So well use the step command to execute each statement in that function to find out where things are going wrong .
But first you have to step past a couple of the statements to get to the is_valid_choice function again .
Notice that the line number on the left hand side of the console window above is 34 .
That indicates the current statement .
In our example its the cout statement that displays the  Hello World  message .
Type next to execute this statement .
Type next to once again execute the get_choice function statement on line 35 .
In the console window type in 1 at the Do you want to continue prompt and then press [ Enter ] to continue the program .
Now type step to debug the is_valid_choice function .
Notice that the line number on the left side of the screen is at line 90 inside the is_valid_choice function and that the variable called val has the value passed in the actual parameter choice , ASCII 49 and  1 , from main .
Lets list the next 10 lines by typing list 90,100 at the ( gdb ) prompt .
Notice that line number 93 is the case statement for 1 .
Our program should execute line 93 since val has a  1  in it .
Type step twice more and notice that the line number jumps all the way to the first statement inside the default : section of the switch , line number 96 .
It should have hit the break statement in line 94 after seeing
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers case 1 : break ;
What You are Looking for
There are two ways in which a debugger is most helpful : 1 ) to verify statements are executed as expected , and 2 ) to verify that variables have their expected values .
Look at the case statement very carefully we seem to be comparing an integer 1 with the character  1 , which is 49 in ASCII , so our program is functioning correctly but our logic test is nt right .
Change the case statement in the is_valid_choice function to look for character data :
Expand | Select | Wrap | Line Numbers switch ( val ) { case ' 0 ' : case ' 1 ' : break ; make dbg_main and then restart the debugger with gdb Debug / main .exe .
Type break 35 to add the breakpoint again for the get_choice statement , then type run to begin the debugging session like before .
Type next and then type a 1 again when prompted and press [ Enter ] as you did before in the console window .
Type next again and notice that this time through , the application jumps to the end of the program , line number 38 , like it should .
Type kill at the ( gdb ) prompt to stop debugging the application .
There is still one more logic problem in this program and you should use the same techniques to find it .
( Hint : the program should continue printing  Hello World and asking the user to continue if the user enters a 1 at the prompt . )

This tutorial will give you a basic idea how to debug a program in Linux using GDB .
As you are aware Visual Studio doesnt run on Linux so you have to use some of the tools provided on the command - line .
If you hate the command line tools , get over it since you re bound to be using them at some point in your career .
All commands in Linux ARE case sensitive so capital letters are different from lowercase letters .
If you need basic information about a command typeat the shell prompt , whereis any Linux command and youll get a help screen .
Heres a basic list of commands youll get to know in Linux :  Usage : ls [ OPTION ] ... [ FILE ] ... List information about the FILEs ( the current directory by default ) .
Example : ls - l *.c Usage : man [ OPTION ] ... [ COMMAND ] ... Displays a manual page(s ) about a command 
Clears the shell screen . 
Usage : grep [ OPTION ] ... PATTERN [ FILE ] ... Search for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input .
Example : grep - i ' hello world ' menu.h main .c
Usage : apropos KEYWORD ... Search for KEYWORD in commands .
Great for finding a command when you arent sure what it is .
Note : I had to change the makefile sections somewhat just so I could post so anytime you see GNU_COMPILER replace it with the appropriate command .
In Linux youll use a shell of some sort , CShell or Bash etc to create projects .
For Windows based computers on a college campus youll probably use PuTTY .
If you 're already using Linux or some other variant of Unix then you 'll have your own favorite Telnet / SSH Client .
Once you start the PuTTY session youll get a screen similar to the following : Your instructor / administrator will give you logon information .
Once logged in , do a directory listing with thecommand .
For most college accounts there is only one directory initially and that is public_html .
In general it is a good practice to arrange your files on disk in some sort of directory scheme . :
When creating directories in Linux uppercase letterssignificant ; isthe same asCreate a directory calledusing thecommand like the following : Change to thedirectory using thecommand .
Create a directory for this application using the mkdir command again and call itwhere MyProjectName1 is some descriptive name for the program you are working on .
For instance , if you are writing a program that computes income taxes type in MyTaxProgram or something similar .
Now change to this directory with the same cd command used previously .
At this point your screen should look like the following :
Now that we have a project directory well need to create a makefile to handle the building of our project once we get some source files created .
The makefile is just a text file like any other but it has some special commands inside it to build our executable .
To create a text file do the following : 1 . Start you re favorite Unix editor , there are several , vi and emacs are the most widely used editors but pico / nano is a good basic editor available on most machines in college labs .
All the following examples use pico so the commands will be different if you are using a different editor .
Typeat the command prompt and youll see the following screen : 2 .
Press ctrl - O and save the file as3 .
Then add the following text to the makefile : : The name Source1.cpp MUST match the name you 'll use for the source code file in the next section .
4 .
Press ctrl - O again to save the changes to your makefile .
If you are working on a new program , a new source code file must be created after the project directory has been created .
The steps below describe how to create the new source code file : 1 . Start you re favorite Unix editor .
2 .
Press ctrl - O and save the file aswhere Source1.cpp is some descriptive name for the program you are working on .
For instance , if you are writing a program that computes income taxes type in MyTaxProgram.cpp or something similar .
3 .
Add the following text to your Source1.cpp file : 4 .
Press ctrl - O again to save the changes to your Source1.cpp file .
Now that we have our makefile and Source1.cpp files created all that s needed is to run the make utility to create our executable for testing .
1 .
Get a directory listing of the current files in our project directory by using thecommand .
2 .
Run the make command by typingat the command prompt .
3 .
Messages from the compiler ( error messages , warning messages and a successful compile / build message ) will be displayed on screen .
4 .
Get a directory listing of the current files in our project directory by using thecommand again . :
Notice the new file created by make called .
This is our executable .
Once the compile / build is successful , type the name of our executable at the command prompt to run it .
In this case our executable is main .
exe so type the following at the command prompt .
The following output should be displayed : Lets add the following text to our code to make this program a little more interesting .
1 . Add the following text before main : 2 . Add this call to the copyright function before the  Hello World  statement in main : 3 .
After main add the following function : Your Source1.cpp file should look like the following when you are done with all these changes : 4 . Now Compile / build and run the solution as you did before .
You should see the following screen :
It can sometimes be difficult to determine why a program does not run successfully .
A debugger allows a programmer to step through a program line - by - line to watch it execute and fail .
The values of variables can be watched as execution takes place as well .
GNU C++ has a debugger which can be used to step through a program .
It is important to note that the program must compile first .
Lets add some more code to our Source1.cpp file ( Note : this code has a logic problem in it to help you get used to debugging ) : 1 . Add the following code before main after the show_copyright function prototype : 2 .
Add the following in main : 3 .
Change the cout statement with  Hello World  to the following : 4 . Add the following functions after the show_copyright function : 5 . Build and run the solution as before and you should see the following screen : 6 .
Pressand instead of stopping the program like we asked , our program continues .
We have a bug here Watson .
Press Ctrl +C to stop executing the program .
Now well work on finding the bug in our code using the GNU debugger command gdb , but first we have to compile our program with some special code to enable debugging .
To do that well first need to create a directory named Debug and then modify our makefile to build our application with debugging information .
At the command prompt use thecommand to create a new directory named .
Use thecommand to confirm that the directory was created and you should see a screen similar to the following :
Next open the makefile in your editor of choice , well use pico again .
Change the makefile so it has the following text in it :
Now run make using the following targetand get a directory listing of the Debug directory usingand you should have the following on your screen :
Now well run the GNU debugger gdb with the newly compiled application with debugging information in it .
Typeat the command prompt .
You should see a screen similar to the following :
At this point you are in the debugger and there are a number of command that can be used from here to help you figure out whats going on inside your program .
Heres a basic list of commands youll get to know in the GNU debugger : 
Usage : help [ COMMAND ]
List information about the COMMANDExample : help running or help breakpoints 
Usage : list [ LINE or FUNCTION ] [ , ] [ LINE ] ... Lists the lines in a file , 10 lines at a timeExample : list 1,100  Usage : break [ LINE or FUNCTION ]
Creates a breakpoint at a specified LINE or FUNCTION locationExample : break 100  Usage : run [ ARGUMENTS ] ... Runs the currently loaded program with the specified ARGUMENTS .
Example : run - I hello world  Usage : nextSteps through the next statement in the program.step  Usage : stepSteps through one instruction only .
Usage : quitQuits the GNU debugger .
A breakpoint tells the debugger to pause execution of a program until you tell it to continue .
In order to step through a program ( i.e. watch a program execute ) , a breakpoint should be set on the executable statement at which you want execution to pause .
To set a breakpoint on a statement , use thecommand at the ( gdb ) prompt .
You specify either a function name or the line number of the executable to break on if you know it .
Determining where you want the breakpoint is a critical part of debugging .
Put your breakpoint too soon in the execution of the program and you waste time stepping through code that doesnt need to be debugged .
Put the breakpoint too late and you might just miss the bug altogether .
In our sample program above we have two possible places in our code that could be causing the problem .
Either the get_choice function isnt returning the proper value or the is_valid_choice function is nt correctly checking the value .
Let s set a breakpoint to check the return value of the get_choice function .
There are two possible places to check the value , one being inside the function itself or in the assignment statement in main .
Well set our breakpoint in main so we can check the return value .
First well use the list command to find the line we want in the executable .
In our example main starts at line 26 and ends at line 39 so the commandwill show those lines in the debugger : : Your line numbers may vary depending on how you create the source file .
Experiment .
In our example the line to set the breakpoint on is line number 35 .
So type in the commandat the ( gdb ) prompt .
You should see a screen similar to the following :
Once a breakpoint is set , start the debugger by using thecommand .
The program will begin to run but pause at the statement with the breakpoint prior to its execution .
For our sample you should see something like the screen below :
At this point you have a number of choices ( detailed below ) 1 )
It is often helpful to know the value of a variable at a certain point in an executing program .
The debugger allows you to look at the contents of variables as a program executes .
Use thecommand to display the value of an expression or variable .
2 ) If the current statement is a function call , Use thecommand to go into the function to watch it execute .
3 ) Go to the next statement in the program by using thecommand .
Lets use the print command to inspect the value of choice in our application .
Notice the value for choice in the window below is the char 0 or NULL .
Well be double - checking it in the next section once the get_choice function returns a value .
Since were not interested in stepping into the get_choice function well use thecommand at the gdb prompt to execute the next statement in our programAs you may have notice output from our application appears in the gdb console window .
You should get a prompt asking , type in aand hit [ Enter ] .
Now let s use the print command again on choice .
You should see a screen similar to the following : Notice the change from before , 48 and 0 instead of 0 and \0  .
The 48 is the ASCII value for the character 0 , so the get_choice function is correctly returning a character value and choice is correctly storing that value .
By stepping through the program weve discovered our bug isnt in the get_choice function .
Since our next statement in the program is the other function we need to check , is_valid_choice , and we know that a valid character is stored in choice and the is_valid_choice function should just keep looping with no error message .
Use the step command to execute the is_valid_choice function .
Notice what happens to our console window .
This is nt correct since we know that the character 0 was passed in the variable choice to the function is_valid_choice by the following statement in main : }while (!is_valid_choice( choice ) ) ; .
So the problem has to be in the way in which is_valid_choice is checking the value .
So well use the step command to execute each statement in that function to find out where things are going wrong .
But first you have to step past a couple of the statements to get to the is_valid_choice function again .
Notice that the line number on the left hand side of the console window above is 34 .
That indicates the current statement .
In our example its the cout statement that displays the  Hello World  message .
Type next to execute this statement .
Type next to once again execute the get_choice function statement on line 35 .
In the console window type in 1 at the Do you want to continue prompt and then press [ Enter ] to continue the program .
Now type step to debug the is_valid_choice function .
Notice that the line number on the left side of the screen is at line 90 inside the is_valid_choice function and that the variable called val has the value passed in the actual parameter choice , ASCII 49 and  1 , from main .
Lets list the next 10 lines by typingat the ( gdb ) prompt .
Notice that line number 93 is the case statement for 1 .
Our program should execute line 93 since val has a  1  in it .
Type step twice more and notice that the line number jumps all the way to the first statement inside the default : section of the switch , line number 96 .
It should have hit the break statement in line 94 after seeing
But it didnt for some reason .
There are two ways in which a debugger is most helpful : 1 ) to verify statements are executed as expected , and 2 ) to verify that variables have their expected values .
Look at the case statement very carefully we seem to be comparing an integer 1 with the character  1 , which is 49 in ASCII , so our program is functioning correctly but our logic test is nt right .
Change the case statement in the is_valid_choice function to look for character data :
After editing the code to correct the problem , save your changes , rebuild the program with the commandand then restart the debugger with .
Type break 35 to add the breakpoint again for the get_choice statement , then type run to begin the debugging session like before .
Type next and then type a 1 again when prompted and press [ Enter ] as you did before in the console window .
Type next again and notice that this time through , the application jumps to the end of the program , line number 38 , like it should .
Typeat the ( gdb ) prompt to stop debugging the application .
There is still one more logic problem in this program and you should use the same techniques to find it .
( Hint : the program should continue printing  Hello World and asking the user to continue if the user enters a 1 at the prompt . )
