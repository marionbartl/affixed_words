Spanish police are investigating the mysterious death of a British man who was found at his home with an arrow in his chest and his body partially eaten by his dog .
They said there were no other signs of violence , theft or forced entry at the home of the 53 - year - old man near the eastern town of Orihuela .
The victim 's flatmate found him on Monday lying on a bed with an arrow from a crossbow in his chest and the dog nearby .
An autopsy was being carried out to try and determine how the man died .

STOCKHOLM , Sweden ( CNN ) --
Four men behind a Swedish file - sharing Web site used by millions to exchange movies and music have been found guilty of collaborating to violate copyright law in a landmark court verdict in Stockholm .
A Pirate Bay server , confiscated by police last year , on display in Stockholm 's Technical Museum .
The four defendants -- Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi and Carl Lundstrom , three founders and one patron of The Pirate Bay -- were sentenced to one year in jail and also ordered to pay 30 million kronor ( $ 3.6 million ) in damages to several major media companies including Warner Brothers , Columbia , Twentieth Century Fox , Sony BMG and EMI .
The defendants are free without restrictions while they appeal the judgment .
The Pirate Bay allows users to exchange files including movies , music , games and software , but does not host the files itself .
It claims more than 3.5 million registered users .
The court case , which involved both a criminal case and a civil claim brought by the media companies , marks a key victory for anti-piracy campaigners , who had long targeted the Web site .
Should the perpetrators of Internet piracy be punished ?
Have your say
The year - long prison terms are for violating Swedish law , while the damages are compensation to the media giants in the civil case -- though the court ordered the men to pay just one - third of the 110 million kronor ( $ 13 million ) which the companies had asked for .
Friday 's verdict did not include an order to shut down The Pirate Bay site .
Its owners have consistently shrugged off legal threats and police raids , posting letters from entertainment industry lawyers on their Web site with mocking responses .
When Dreamworks studio demanded that the site act over file - sharing of Dreamworks ' movie " Shrek 2 , " The Pirate Bay threatened to sue for harassment and lodge a formal complaint " for sending frivolous legal threats . "
" It is the opinion of us and our lawyers that you are ... morons , " the response continued , suggesting that studio representatives perform a sexual act .
The response closed with an obscenity .
Site owners dismissed the effects of a police raid in 2006 , saying the site had been down longer on other occasions due to illness or drunkenness than when " the U.S. and Swedish government forces the police to steal our servers ... yawn . "
But Magnus Eriksson , who in 2003 co-founded the " loosely formed group of theorists , artists and programmers " that spawned The Pirate Bay , says there are serious issues at stake .
He does not think copyrighted material should be free for everyone , " but that it already is . "
" The control over what people communicate is lost and we have to adapt to this new state of things , " he said via e-mail .
" To monitor all communications , fight all new digital technologies and spread a culture of fear in what should be a free and open communication network is not a desirable option . "
Entertainment companies claim
The Pirate Bay has hurt their box office profits , part of an annual loss the Motion Picture Association of America claims to be about $ 6 billion a year worldwide .
" Hollywood studios are businesses .
They 're there to make money , " said association lawyer Thomas Dillon .
" It costs $ 100 million to make a feature film , so of course they 're quite keen to get some back .
So I do n't accept this argument that there 's some benefit to culture in allowing people to make copies of commercial films and getting them for free . "
Monique Wadsted , a Swedish lawyer for the MPAA , said The Pirate Bay was also harming individual artists .
A victory for the entertainment companies " will , of course , be for all authors all around the world , some kind of redress ... because what is going on now is actually a plundering of the author 's works , " she said via e-mail .
" If some authors find it good to market their products using file - sharing or whatever , they are free to do that , " she added .
" But that is not what is happening at the moment .
What 's happening at the moment is that authors ' and rights holders ' works are file - shared against their will and that is not acceptable . "
She argued that The Pirate Bay " is specifically tailored for copyright infringement . "
The prosecution claims the site provides a search engine that helps people find and download copyrighted material including movies , music and games -- in effect , enabling copyright theft .
The site 's supporters say they 're doing nothing wrong under Swedish law because the site does n't actually put the copyrighted material on the Web site .
Internet piracy and illegal downloading from peer - to - peer systems are some of the biggest piracy problems in Europe , the MPAA argues .
Internet piracy is growing at a faster rate in Europe than anywhere else in the world , the MPAA says , because of increased broadband use , weak laws , and lenient public perceptions .
Sweden 's official efforts to battle online piracy have been weak , the MPAA says .
Eriksson , the co-founder of the group that led to The Pirate Bay , says the MPAA 's argument that file - sharing hurts movie studio revenues is " nonsense . "
" Cinema is doing better than ever , " he said by e-mail .
" They only claim this because they calculate losses by looking at the number of downloads and imagining that all of them would have been a purchase if they had n't been downloaded first . "
Eriksson said what was at stake in the Swedish courtroom was the future of the Internet itself .
" The Internet revolution meant that we created a global network where any digital entity could connect and exchange information with any other , " he said .
" Anti-piracy efforts must be seen in the light of a counter - revolution against this that goes all the way to the very infrastructure of the net . "
He suggested that even if The Pirate Bay is convicted of facilitating making works public through its indexing service , which he does not expect , Internet piracy will not stop .
" The prosecution can't understand that The Pirate Bay is just one stratification of a social and technological change that is decentralized , " he said .
" Piracy does not have a head that you can cut off , and The Pirate Bay is just a technology allowing communication , a part of the Internet infrastructure . "
CNN 's Neil Curry in Stockholm , Sweden , and Mairi Mackay in London , England , contributed to this report .

A recent public - opinion survey reports the following findings :
Sixty - eight percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Sunday said that Bush ’s eight years in the White House were a failure .
. . .
Thirty - one percent said they consider Bush ’s presidency a success .
. . .
Only 3 percent of those questioned say Bush was one of the greatest presidents in the nation ’s history .
So , there you have it : approximately three in ten Americans either do n’t speak enough English to understand the word “ success , ” or they do understand the word , but they have not paid any attention to public affairs during the past eight years and , when polled , made a wild guess in response to the question .
As for the 3 percent who consider Bush to have been one of the greatest presidents , they would appear to be suitable material for the men in the white coats .
Bush successful ?
Bush great ?
At what , pray tell ?
Certainly not at anything for which one would wish him success or greatness .
Sun Microsystems has began the deployment of South Africa ’s largest supercomputer , a 27 Teraflop system that runs a suite of open source software .
The system is the second phase of a multi-million rand project that was awarded to Sun last year and will be housed at the Centre for High Performance Computing ( CHPC ) in Cape Town .
Stefan Jacobs , South and Eastern Europe systems practice solution architect for Sun , says that the operating systems used on the system will be a combination of Solaris 10 , Suse 10 and Red Hat 5.1 .
The applications that will be used , he says , “ will be mixed bag of open source scientific software , some purchased from ISVs and some locally developed by the researchers ” .
At the core of the system is a Sun SPARC Enterprise M9000 server with 64 SPARC64 VII quad - core processors , and a cluster of four Sun Blade 6048 modular systems .
These will be deployed in two stages .
Stage one consists of one Sun Blade 6048 modular system with 48 blades based on Intel Xeon E5450 processors , and stage two consists of three Sun Blade 6048 modular systems that house 144 blades based on the next - generation Intel Xeon processor , also known as Nehalem .
At the front - end , Sun will be providing the CHPC with its Visualization system which allows for users to assemble and view 3D models of their data .
The Open Storage solution is based on ten AMD Opteron - powered Sun Fire X4540 Open Storage servers , which provide 480 terabytes of data storage .
Hardware for the CHPC is being assembled in Scotland and the USA and will then be shipped to South Africa for installation and integration by local partners Eclipse Networks and Breakpoint .
The CHPC is used by a range of researchers in Africa working on things as diverse as energy alternatives , weather prediction and healthcare .
The CHPC is funded by the South African Department of Science and Technology , and managed by the Meraka Institute of the CSIR .

Scottish prisons have paid out £ 11 m in compensation for slopping out Millions of pounds of compensation being paid to criminals under human rights laws is " unacceptable " , Scotland 's justice minister has said .
So far £ 11 m has been paid to more than 3,700 prisoners after a judge ruled their human rights had been breached by slopping out their prison cell toilets .
In England and Wales there is a one - year time bar for such claims .
Kenny MacAskill wants the UK government to legislate to bring Scotland into line with the rest of the country .
A House of Lords ruling in October 2007 said claims in Scotland could date back to 2001 , when human rights laws became operational .
The anomaly has arisen because of the wording of the Scotland Act which established devolution - and included human rights provisions .
We have already seen too much public money having to be paid out to prisoners
Kenny MacAskill
Justice Secretary Only Westminster can change this and Scottish ministers have been urging their colleagues in London to act quickly .
Mr MacAskill told parliament £ 67 m had been set aside for payouts to this year .
" We have already seen too much public money having to be paid out to prisoners , some of whom have committed extremely serious and appalling crimes , " he said .
" We need to bring this situation to an end and the public quite rightly expects that we should do so as quickly as possible . "
He said changing the law would free £ 50 m for spending on other government priorities .
Constructive dialogue
In response , Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy pledged to help find a way to resolve the problem .
He said : " I do not want to see taxpayers ' money being used to pay damages unnecessarily to people who have committed the most heinous of crimes .
" I will work with the Scottish Government and Ministry of Justice to find a way of resolving this complex issue which would require a change to the Scotland Act . "
Labour justice spokesman Richard Baker said the issue should be pursued " constructively and collaboratively " with the Westminster Government .
" Nobody wants offenders receiving payment in this way , " he said .
Robert Brown , for the Liberal Democrats , pledged his party 's support but asked for details and correspondence to be made public .
Conservative justice spokesman Bill Aitken said his party was committed to dealing with the issue " as expeditiously as possible " .
Slopping out was the practice of using buckets as toilets in prison cells .
Although it has now ended , claims continue to be made , dating back up to eight years .
Mr MacAskill said 3,737 cases had been settled at a cost of £ 11.2 m .
A further 1,223 were being dealt with - an average of 200 new claims per month .

Monsanto Uprooted Germany Bans Cultivation of GM Corn
Germany has banned the cultivation of GM corn , claiming that MON 810 is dangerous for the environment .
But that argument might not stand up in court and Berlin could face fines totalling millions of euros if American multinational Monsanto decides to challenge the prohibition on its seed .
I ’ve made a video of an example using the Pyevolve ’s Interactive Mode in the middle of the evolution of a Genetic Algorithm .

The famously subversive US cartoonist Robert Crumb has announced the completion of his long - awaited take on the Book of Genesis .
The acclaimed satirist revealed on his personal website that he had finished the project , which is out this autumn , and which his UK publisher is predicting will " provoke the religious right " .
Four years in the making , Crumb worked from the King James Bible and Robert Alter 's translation to reinterpret the Book of Genesis , from the Creation via Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to Noah boarding his ark .
Back in 2005 in an interview at the New York Public Library recorded by Time magazine , Crumb , a hero of underground comics , talked about the difficulties of drawing God for the book .
" My problem was , how am I going to draw God ?
Should I just draw him as a light in the sky that has dialogue balloons coming out from it ?
Then I had this dream .
God came to me in this dream , only for a split second , but I saw very clearly what he looked like .
And I thought , OK , there it is , I 've got God , " he told interviewer Robert Hughes , Time 's art critic .
" He has a white beard but he actually ended up looking more like my father .
He has a very masculine face like my father . "
He had considered , he said , drawing God as a black woman .
" But if you actually read the Old Testament he 's just an old , cranky Jewish patriarch . "
The cartoonist , who now lives in the south of France , said that creating the book had been " a lot of fun " .
" It 's very visual .
It 's lurid .
Full of all kinds of crazy , weird things that will really surprise people , " he added .
According to his publisher , Jonathan Cape , Robert Crumb 's Book of Genesis is a " scandalous satire " which " presents a complex , even subversive , narrative that calls for a significant re-examination of both the Bible 's content and its role in our culture " .
It will be published simultaneously in the US and the UK on 19 October .
Crumb 's website said that now he 's finished the marathon project , he 'll be catching up on his correspondence and taking a trip to the US .
On his return , he 's planning to collaborate with his wife and fellow artist Aline Kominsky - Crumb on a new book .
The banking industry has also succeeded in working closely with Republicans to water down and then block a measure that would give bankruptcy judges greater authority to modify mortgages , including reducing principal payments .
Senate Republican leaders say they have the support of all 41 of their members  enough to kill the provision by making it impossible to get the 60 votes necessary to cut off debate .
Senate Democrats , hoping to resolve the impasse , have opened negotiations in recent days , but not with their Republican counterparts .
Instead , in an effort to divide the industry , the Democrats , led by Richard J. Durbin of Illinois , Charles E. Schumer of New York and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut , have been in talks with Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo , along with a group of credit unions .
The lawmakers ’ hope is that those institutions would exert pressure on Republican lawmakers and reluctant Democratic moderates .
Even if those negotiations are successful , the Democratic lawmakers are still likely to water down the bankruptcy bill further in the industry ’s favor .
Before the negotiations , Citigroup had been the only major bank to support the bankruptcy measure , often referred to as “ cram - down ” legislation because it would give judges the authority to dictate terms to lenders and investors who own mortgages bundled into securities .
“ The cram - down provision , if it became law , would raise the costs of all mortgages for everyone , ” said Edward L. Yingling , president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association .
“ It ’s a fact that if you undermine the value of the collateral by allowing cram - downs , you make the loans riskier and banks will price that risk accordingly by rates going up . ”
Supporters of the bankruptcy measure had been planning to tie it to another banking bill that the industry favors .
That legislation would make permanent the temporary increase in deposits guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , to $ 250,000 from $ 100,000 .
It would also increase the F.D.I.C. ’s credit line with the federal government to $ 100 billion , from $ 30 billion , thus enabling regulators to reduce a proposed special premium the banks will owe the F.D.I.C. later this year by more than 50 percent  a $ 7.7 billion savings .
In space , no one can hear you scream " Fire . "
Not that it'd matter , as few people could recognize a microgravity fire anyway .
This means space firefighting gear needs to be special .
NASA is on it .

First , a primer .
Fire in microgravity is n't the flickering kind that happened when you set the house ablaze with your chemistry set as a kid .
It 's actually spherical ( see image ) , and spreads around space stations , space shuttles or special projects like Orion faster than you can say " Hey , I did n't know NASA let us smoke on the space shuttle ? "
NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger got to experience space fire first hand in 1997 , when an oxygen candle aboard Mir caught fire and filled the space station with smoke .
" I did not expect smoke to spread so quickly , " Linenger said in an interview with Discovery .
" ( It ) was about 10 times faster than I would expect a fire to spread on a space station . "

So NASA , not wanting to roast its astronauts alive , has continued to research and fine tune a variety of next generation space fire - fighting systems .
A few prototypes work well , but they 're messy , coating the fire spheres and pretty much everything else in the vicinity with a fine mist , fog or " water foam " made up of a non -toxic oxygen - nitrogen mix .
The special extinguishers have actually been around for about a decade , but only recently has NASA noticed them , funded them , and started testing in microgravity experiments .
Previously , NASA 's main advice for astronauts in a dangerous fire - related situation was " abandon ship " ( seriously ) — an option which would be , obviously unavailable to an Orion crew on a Mars or Moon mission .

EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou has said a possible swine flu global epidemic , or pandemic , would not necessarily cause widespread deaths .
She said Europe was well prepared and there was " no need to panic " .
She was speaking after an emergency meeting of health ministers on ways to contain the virus , which has been confirmed in six EU countries .
The ministers rejected a French proposal for a continent - wide suspension on flights to Mexico .
After the talks in Luxembourg Ms Vassiliou said : " We are worried , but we are on top of things . "
She added : " The fact that we have been preparing ourselves in the EU for an event such as this for some years now , and the experience gained so far , puts us in a much stronger position . "
None of the dozens of cases of swine flu reported on the continent so far has been severe .
The health ministers agreed to work " without delay " with pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine .
Rejecting the French plan on suspending flights to Mexico - the main focus of the outbreak - they said it was up to member states to set their own policies .
Several countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have cancelled holidays .
Earlier the UN's World Health Organization ( WHO ) - which increased its pandemic alert to five on Wednesday - said it had no immediate plans for a further rise .
" We do not have any evidence to suggest that we should move to phase six today , or any such move is imminent right now , " said WHO Assistant Director General Keiji Fukuda .
In the latest developments :
The White House said a security aide who had helped arrange President Barack Obama 's recent trip to Mexico has become sick with flu - like symptoms
The Netherlands confirms its first case of swine flu , in a three - year - old boy recently returned from Mexico .
Cases have also been confirmed in Switzerland and Costa Rica
The number of confirmed cases in the US rose to 109 in 11 states
Japan reported its first suspected case of swine flu
Health Minister Oscar Ugarte said tests on Peru 's sole suspected case had proved negative , reversing an earlier statement
SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO
Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue
If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice
If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimise the risk of infection
Q&A : What is swine flu ?
In pictures : Swine flu concern Mexican economy squeezed by flu
The quest for a swine flu vaccine
In Mexico , the number of confirmed cases rose to 260 - up from 26 on Wednesday , something experts attributed to many laboratory results coming in .
The Mexican government increased the number of confirmed deaths from swine flu from 8 to 12 .
President Felipe Calderon has urged people to stay at home over the next five days .
The US has announced that it will buy 13 million new courses of antiviral treatment and send 400,000 of them to Mexico .
Meanwhile the WHO says it will now call the virus influenza A ( H1N1 ) rather than swine flu - which it says is misleading as pork meat is safe and the virus is being transmitted from human to human .
Egypt has begun a mass slaughter of its pigs , and Ghana is the latest country to ban pork imports as a precaution against swine flu .

BERLIN , Germany ( CNN ) --
A polar bear attacked a woman at Berlin Zoo Friday afternoon after she climbed a fence and jumped into its habitat during feeding time , police said Saturday .
The bear attacks the woman during feeding time .
One adult polar bit her several times after she plunged into the moat , police said .
Zoo workers tossed rescue rings toward the woman to hoist her out and distract polar bears swimming nearby , said Goerg Gebhard , a Berlin police officer .
At one point the woman fell back into the water and was grabbed by a bear before she was eventually hoisted to safety .
" They saved her life , " Gebhard told CNN .
The woman was severely injured and was being treated at a hospital , police said .
Watch polar bear attack woman »
It 's unclear why the woman entered the bear habitat , but police issued her a citation for trespassing .
Berlin Zoo is home to Knut , the first polar bear to be born there in over 30 years .
The bear became a huge talking point in Germany when his mother gave birth to him in December 2006 .

April 21 , 2009  -- Justin Esch and Dave Lefkow have re-invented what it means to be entrepreneurs .
The self - proclaimed " bacontrepreneurs " have catapulted their love of bacon into a successful business .
" Everything should taste like bacon ; that 's the motto , " Esch told ABC News .
Their business began as a joke over drinks .
During a lively discussion with friends about their common passion for bacon , the idea for Bacon Salt , a product mixing their two favorite flavors , was born .
Watch this story on " World News with Charles Gibson " TONIGHT at 6:30 p.m. ET .
The duo , who both had successful jobs at a technology company in Seattle , quit and began experimenting with different flavors of Bacon Salt .
" We took a bunch of bacon and poured in salt , " Esch , 30 , said .
" Turns out that 's disgusting . "
Once the recipe was perfected , Esch and Lefkow , 35 , introduced Bacon Salt , and hickory and peppered varieties , to the market last year .
With five employees and no marketing budget , they stormed sporting events coast to coast dressed as bacon and created buzz on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter .
" When we launched it out of my garage in Issaquah , in suburban Seattle , we had 800 orders in the first week , with no promotion , [ from ] 12 countries , 25 states , " Esch said .
" We ran out of Bacon Salt within six days . "
Within a year , their products have made it to the shelves of major grocery stores around the country and are sold around the world .
And despite the nation 's deep recession , the fun-loving startup keeps bringing home the bacon , raking in $ 1.4 million last year in profits .
Beth 's Café , a 24 - hour Seattle restaurant known for its greasy cuisine , caught on quickly , adding Bacon Salt into the mix of condiments on their tables .
" We always say everything 's better with bacon and that 's their motto , " said Chris Dalton , owner of Beth 's Café .
" It 's been excellent .
You can put it on almost anything .
It 's good on a turkey sandwich .
I like it on tater tots . "
The dedication to all things bacon has led to the launch of bacon - flavored sunflower seeds and the sandwich spread , Baconaise , which combines two of life 's more fattening flavors , bacon and mayonnaise .
Bacon Soap , Body Spray
In the Works
Surprisingly , bacon is not an ingredient in Bacon Salt or Baconaise .
The company says that the salt is low sodium , zero - calorie , zero - fat and vegetarian , bringing bacon 's flavor to the masses .
Plus , they 're certified kosher .
" I had been eating bacon and mayonnaise for six months , " Lefkow said .
" I would eat a slice of bacon and a spoon of mayonnaise .
That was definitely a fattening process .
Bacon
Salt has less than a quarter of the servings , so you can get bacon flavor in a salt format . "
Esch and Lefkow have plans to expand their bacon empire .
" We 've got tons of ideas , everything from beer to waffles , hot sauce , ketchup , " Lefkow said .
But they 're not limited to food .
They 're experimenting with a bacon - scented body spray , suntan lotion , even soap .
The recent hot seller on their Web site is bacon - inspired lip balm .
" We 've sold over 10,000 of them , " Lefkow said .
" People buy it by the dozen .
Some people say it 's the worst thing they have ever heard of ; other people said that 's the greatest thing ever . "
Operations Manager Shannon Carlston said the rush of orders can make the factory crazy at times .
" I 'm shocked and amazed , " she said .
" The [ lip balm ] , that 's just been crazy .
They love the feeling of having bacon fat on their lips , I guess . "
Lefkow said he has faith in the sustainability of their unlikely recipe for business success -- just add bacon .
" I do n't think there is any limit for what bacon can do , " Lefkow said .
" It 's the uber - meat . "
TROY , Michigan ( Reuters ) -
After months without access to fresh loans and facing persistent weak orders many U.S. small businesses , a prime source of jobs for the struggling economy , may be forced to close in coming months .

Business consultants and operators say there are growing signs that the double body blow of recession and credit crunch are taking a heavy toll on U.S. small businesses , defined as enterprises with 500 or fewer employees .
“ The situation has clearly worsened for many small businesses in the past few months , ” said George Cloutier , head of Orlando , Florida - based American Management Services Inc .
“ They have used every source of funding they know to stay alive .
They have maxed out their credit cards , they ’ve depleted their 401 ( k ) ( retirement plans ) and borrowed from family and friends , ” said Cloutier , an industry consultant .
Although people like Cloutier welcome recent measures from the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama to get credit to small businesses , they say it is not enough .
“ We ’re getting close to the breaking point , ” he said .
Small business is the backbone of the country ’s job market .
According to U.S. Census Bureau data , in 2002 the United States had 112 million workers on payrolls .
About 56.4 million of them , more than 50 percent , worked at small businesses .
The strain is worsening , leaving business owners like Tom Stephens and his wife Terry facing tough choices .
The couple formed educational software and equipment firm Edutronix LLC in 2001 .
Based in the Detroit suburb of Troy , Edutronix sells computer - aided design packages and cutting - edge products like three - dimensional printers to schools and colleges to “ prepare students for the jobs of tomorrow . ”
But last autumn , as Wall Street panic and job losses grew , Edutronix ’s orders dried up as customers feared budget cuts .
“ At the end of the third quarter it became clear that things were not going as expected , ” Tom Stephens said .
“ That left us with no choice but to make some necessary cuts . ”
With 2008 sales down 40 percent , Stephens cut three of the company ’s eight staff and nonessential expenses .
“ I ’m not going to wallow in despair because long term , the prospects for spending in education are great , ” he said .
“ It ’s just a matter of waiting this out . ”
Stephens also said he has not even tried to get a loan .
“ We have a great relationship with our bank , ” he said .
“ But all we have heard from inside and outside the banking community is that right now , everything is on hold . ”

According to a quarterly U.S. Federal Reserve survey of bank loan officers in January , 69.2 percent of respondents had tightened lending standards for firms with annual sales under $ 50 million , versus 74.6 percent in October 2008 .
That sounds like an improvement , but no respondents in either survey said they had eased standards .
That has n’t been seen since the Fed ’s July 2007 survey -- and then only 1.9 percent of respondents had done any easing .
Lack of credit has coincided with rising bankruptcies .
According to bankruptcy data and management company AACER , in 2008 there were nearly 65,000 U.S. commercial bankruptcy filings , compared with 43,000 in 2007 and 30,000 in 2006 .
For the first two months of 2009 AACER reported 12,300 bankruptcies , which AACER President Mike Bickford said should put 2009 on track for around 72,000 filings .
“ We expect a big rise in filings as the year goes on , ” he said .
“ March is going to be a very big month . ”
But Weldon Gibson , a consultant at the Lamar University Small Business Development Center in Texas , said the credit market has improved slightly in recent weeks .
“ It ’s going to be a struggle to get a loan , ” he said .
“ But independent banks are stepping up their lending , often only to specific sectors of the economy .
You just have to find them . ”
The Obama administration has taken steps to ease the pain .
The $ 787 billion stimulus package approved by Congress included $ 730 million for loans for small businesses .
On March 16 the administration also said it would buy up to $ 15 billion in loans made by banks and guaranteed by the Small Business Administration , plus guarantee SBA loans up to 90 percent -- up from the previous limit of 85 percent .
“ The action taken by the Obama administration is a positive development , but it is not the silver bullet that will solve everything , ” said Todd McCracken , head of the National Small Business Association , an industry group .
“ We have got to unfreeze the credit markets for small businesses .
Otherwise they wo n’t be able to invest to expand as stimulus money flows into the economy , ” he said .
“ If we do n’t fix the credit markets , the recovery will be strangled in the crib rather than flourishing , ” he added .

LUND , Sweden , March 29 ( UPI ) -- Police in Sweden say they 've arrested a man accused of showering unwanted affectionate attention on at least 17 women .
The man allegedly approached the women asking for road directions or for advice on buying a present for a 10 - year - old cousin or niece , reported TT , the Swedish news agency .

When the women replied , he would give them an enthusiastic hug , kiss them on the cheek and moan in their ear , TT reported , noting the alleged assaults occurred in the towns of Lund and Malmo during the last year .
The man , who was not publicly identified after his arrest Friday , was reported to be an exchange student who told police it was natural in his culture to kiss women on the cheek .
It was not immediately known if hugging and moaning were also part of the man 's culture .
Paramedic told heart attack patient to 'be quiet and clean up his own vomit '
A paramedic ordered a heart attack patient to be quiet and clean up his own vomit as he writhed in agony on a hospital floor , a disciplinary hearing heard .
Ambulance worker Colin Shields failed to carry out basic checks and did not recognise the tell - tale signs of a heart attack - mistaking the patient ’s symptoms for toothache .
A nurse at the hospital was stunned when she entered the room and found the man mopping up his sick with paper towels .
Failure : Colin Shields must now retrain if he wants to work in an ambulance again
Shield has now been given 10 months to retrain or face being struck off following a fitness to practise hearing by the Health Professions Council ( HPC ) .
The panel heard the victim , identified only as Patient A , dialled 999 because he was suffering severe jaw and lower back pain - classic symptoms of heart attack .
But when Shields arrived at his home in Manchester he failed to carry out even the most basic medical checks , and did not provide the patient - a diabetic - with any treatment .
It was only when Patient A demanded to be taken to hospital that Shields bundled him into the back of his ambulance and drove him to the nearby Manchester Royal Infirmary , the panel heard .
Shields did not ask about Patient A ’s medical history , so did not know he also suffered from high blood pressure and high cholesterol , making him a prime candidate for a heart attack .
Laura Napley , for the HPC , said : ‘ Mr Shields did not carry out any medical assessment of the patient , made him walk to and from the ambulance unaided and did not complete a patient report form .
‘ At the hospital , Patient A followed Mr Shields into a treatment room and was told to sit on the bed and wait for a doctor .
‘ Due to his intense pain , the patient said he preferred to lie on the floor .
‘ When he subsequently vomited , Mr Shields told him to be quiet and clean up the mess . ’
Doctors later found he had suffered a massive heart attack and was minutes from death when they started treatment .
The HPC , which regulates paramedics , accused Shields of repeatedly failing to assess Patient A ’s condition , measure his vital signs or provide him with treatment .
Shields admitted most of the allegations against him , saying he was ' distracted ' on the day of the incident , July 30 2007 .
He told the panel : ‘ My mind was n’t on the job .
My head was away with the clouds .
‘ I ’d had some bad news about my dad ’s health that day , so I really was n’t concentrating .
If I ’d been thinking straight , things might have been different .
‘ It ’s not an excuse , and I know I let the patient down . ’
Shields added : ‘ I did n’t know what was wrong with him .
I thought he had toothache .
‘ He just seemed rather noisy and boisterous while he was being sick . ’
The circumstances of Shields ’ negligence came to light after ambulance bosses took him to task over his incomplete patient report form , and interviewed Patient A and his brother .
The panel heard Shields - who has 25 years ’ experience as a paramedic - had received a warning and extra training in 2006 after failing to fill in crucial forms correctly .
Shields denied his fitness to practise was impaired .
However , in cross-examination he admitted he may not have recognised Patient A’s heart attack symptoms under any circumstances .
The HPC panel , sitting in central London , yesterday ruled he had demonstrated misconduct and incompetence , and that his fitness to practice was impaired .
Chairman Elspeth Metcalfe said : ‘ This was a very serious set of circumstances .
Fortunately , the patient in question did not come to any harm .
‘ But the story could easily have been very different , and so much more serious . ’
The HPC imposed a Conditions of Practise Order which requires Shields to complete three sets of paramedic training within 10 months if he wishes to continue in the profession .
An internal disciplinary hearing at North West Ambulance NHS Trust had earlier found Shields guilty of gross misconduct , and imposed a final written warning .
Unison officer Andy Gill , who represented Shields in the HPC fitness to practise hearing , said : ‘ He knows he acted improperly , and that he will be sacked if anything like this happens again . ’
MacRuby has been mentioned on this blog before .
It 's a reimplementation of Ruby 1.9 targeting the Objective - C runtime -- and now , targeting LLVM for immediately compiling Ruby code to native code .
Initial performance results running some of my benchmark show an interesting mixed bag .
For some , MacRuby 's new " experimental " branch performs very well , in some cases a few times faster than JRuby .
For others , performance is slow enough there must be something wrong .
And there 's a large number of my benchmarks that do n't even run , due to broken features they 'll be fixing over the next several months .
And yet , at least one Rubyist has already seen fit to declare MacRuby " the fastest Ruby implementation around " .
Really ?
When it 's crashing for about half the scripts I ran and extremely slow for many others ?
He bases this assertion on running the benchmarks MacRuby includes in its own repository .
Because MacRuby usually performs much better on those benchmarks than Ruby 1.9 , he has decided they 're now " the fastest Ruby " .
Do we have to do this hype dance every year ?
Look , I know I 'm biased .
I want JRuby to be the best Ruby implementation possible .
I want it to be fast , and if possible , the fastest .
I also want it to run existing Ruby applications and integrate well with Java libraries and applications and continue to be one of the best choices for running Ruby .
So I can understand that it sounds like I 'm throwing stones by pouring water on such a breathless proclamation as " fastest Ruby implementation around " .
But seriously guys ... have n't we learned anything ?
MacRuby 's experimental branch is just that : experimental .
Lots of stuff is fast , but lots of stuff is broken or slow .
I 'm sure the MacRuby guys are going to get everything resolved and working , and I 'll admit these early results drive me to work on JRuby performance even harder .
But I also know from experience that many of the missing features are exactly those that make Ruby performance a really difficult problem .
That 's why we 've always focused on compatibility first ( almost to a fault ) ; it 's really easy to paint yourself into a corner .
But this post is n't about MacRuby .
They 're doing awesome work , and I have no doubt at least some of the performance numbers will stick .
This post is about the evils of benchmarking , especially prematurely .
Around this time last year , MagLev ( Ruby based on the Gemstone VM ) posted some crazy benchmarks and shocked the Ruby world at RailsConf .
They had numbers even more stunning than MacRuby , running some simple numerical benchmarks orders of magnitude faster than either Ruby 1.8 or 1.9 .
Several Ruby bloggers immediately posted not just their enthusiasm , but their belief that MagLev had won the performance battle without ever firing a shot .
And I believe it was a great disservice to the MagLev team .
MagLev was , last spring , a very primitive and early implementation .
It could run some useful Ruby code , but the majority of the core classes had not yet been implemented and very little work had been done on compatibility .
Now we 're approaching a year later , and MagLev is still in development , still closed source , still at a private alpha stage of life .
Again , I 'll admit I 'm biased , so I need to state that I believe MagLev is also a really cool technology , at least as cool as MacRuby or JRuby .
In many ways and for many domains both of them are going to be more compelling than JRuby , and I have no illusions that JRuby will never get leapfrogged in performance .
But we need to remember a really important fact : these implementations are not done .
I could post blog entries with every experimental branch of JRuby I 've ever tested .
I could show you " fib " numbers 3 - 5 times faster than current JRuby and 10 times faster than Ruby 1.9 .
But honestly , what would be the point ?
I know it 's experimental , I know we need to get there in a careful , measured way , and I know that my best experiments may never be reflected in real - world , real - application performance .
And yet it seems like people just love to latch on to these early contenders , hyping them to death almost before they 're out of the starting gate .
Listen , people : Ruby is hard to implement .
Oh , it may look easy at a glance , and you can probably get 70 , 80 , or even 90 % of the way pretty quickly .
But there 's some crazy stuff in that last 10 % or 5 % that totally blindsides you if you 're not looking for it .
An early Ruby implementation has not run that last mile of Ruby implementation , and it takes almost as much work to get there as it does to run the first 90 % .
So let 's try to be adults about this and give new implementations time to actually finish before we whip the community into a frenzy .
Every time we go overboard in our declarations , we look like amateurs .
And as certain as I am that MacRuby is going to be a major contender for the " fastest Ruby " crown , I think we'd be wise to hold judgment until it and other young Ruby implementations are actually finished .
Sigh .
It must be that time of year again .
Another partially - completed Ruby implementation has started to get overhyped because of early performance numbers .
I just read this great blog post , Social Media and Charity : Philanthropy or Crass Opportunism and wanted to comment on it and hear from others .
Well I appreciate the author 's point , I think she 's commenting more about corporations being involved in social media on behalf of charities rather than charities themselves .
There are many other ways charities are involved with social media then just selling t- shirts on the Internet .
But it does raise the question ?
When does social media for your organization become less about connecting and more about marketing ?
Or is it intended as a marketing tool only ?
Since I 'm not every charity I can't answer that question on behalf of them but I do believe that social media can be used as more than just improving a brand .
I think it allows the opportunity to connect with donors and raise funds as well .
I have to say , I 'm not sure how I feel about this Feed America / Tide partnership .
On on hand , a lot of money has been raised for the organization , but on the other , Feed America is n't getting the opportunity to promote themselves .
The t- shirt is all about Tide and almost gives off a sense of bragging rights as if they need to shout to the world they are do - gooders .
So what do you think , good idea or misstep ?
And what do you use social media for ?
The interior of the National Ignition Facility 's target chamber , where researchers plan to use 192 giant lasers to ignite a pinpoint fusion reaction .
The service module carrying technicians can be seen on the left .
The target positioner , which holds the target fuel capsule , is on the right .
Lasershave usually represented weapons of mass destruction in movies such as " Star Wars , " but a newly completed facility has begun harnessinglasers to create a fusion reaction rivaling the power of a miniature sun .
TheNational Ignition Facility has already test - fired all 192 giant lasers atLawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California as part of this effort .
The lasers will eventually focustheir power on compressing and heating a single , pea-sized fuel capsule tomore than 180 million degrees Fahrenheit in order to trigger thermonuclearfusion .
" Oneof the major activities of the NIF is to explore the basics of fusion energy , buildinga miniature sun on Earth that could supply limitless , safe and carbon - freeenergy , " said Ed Moses , National Ignition Facility ( NIF ) program director .
Unlikenuclear fission reactions that split apart atoms inside existing power plants , fusion reactions create energy from atoms fusing togetherto form heavier atoms .
The reaction normally only takes place within intenselyhot environments , such as the heart of a star , but researchers have attemptedto recreate fusion in a way that would produce more energy than it takes tostart the reaction .
Just150 micrograms of deuterium and tritium , or less than one - millionth of a pound , can serve as the fuel for the NIF experiment .
But containing the high - temperatureplasma from a fusion reaction represents a special challenge — temperatures of 180 million degrees F and up would melt any known substance , apparently including the metallic arms of Spiderman villain ' Doc Ock ' in hisfictional fusion experiment from " Spiderman 2 . "
TheNIF 's laser - based approach uses an approach known as inertial confinementfusion ( ICF ) , which takes advantage of Newton 's Third Law about every reactionhaving an equal and opposite reaction .
Therapid , intense heating from the lasers makes the outer layer of the tiny fuelcapsule explode outward , and that compresses the remaining fuel inward andhelps trigger the fusion reaction .
Fusion burn consumes the cooler , outerregions of the capsule faster than the capsule can expand , which contains theresulting reaction .
Thisstands in contrast to previous approaches that have relied on magneticfields to contain the plasma from fusion reactions , such as Europe 's JointEuropean Torus project , although both could work .
" ICFis analogous to an internal combustion engine where micro-explosions ( as in acar engine cylinder ) are continuously occurring to produce energy , " Mosestold SPACE.com .
" Magnetic fusion is more like a turbine that iscontinuously burning fuel to produce energy . "
Seriousignition testing scheduled for 2010 would focus 500 trillion watts of power onthe pea-sized capsule containing deuterium and tritium fuel .
NIF has alreadyproduced 25 times more energy than any other existing laser system , and alsobecame the first fusion laser facility to break the megajoule barrier and create enough energy to power 10,000 100 - watt light bulbs for a second .
" Weplan to begin the first experimental shots of the ignition campaign inMay , " Moses said .

When launching a website , you can often forget a number of things in your eagerness to make it live , so it ’s useful to have a checklist to look through as you make your final touches and before you announce your website to the world .
This article reviews some important and necessary checks that web - sites should be checked against before the official launch — little details are often forgotten or ignored , but – if done in time – may sum up to an overall greater user experience and avoid unnecessary costs after the official site release .
Here is your website launch checklist :
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
Favicon
A favicon brands the tab or window in which your website is open in the user ’s browser .
It is also saved with the bookmark so that users can easily identify pages from your website .
Some browsers pick up the favicon if you save it in your root directory as favicon.ico , but to be sure it ’s picked up all the time , include the following in your head .
< link rel= " icon " type= " image/x-icon " href= " /favicon.ico " />
And if you have an iPhone favicon :
< link rel= " apple - touch - icon " href= " / favicon.png " />
Titles And Meta Data
Your page title is the most important element for SEO and is also important so that users know what ’s on the page .
Make sure it changes on every page and relates to that page ’s content .
< title > 10 Things To Consider When Choosing The Perfect CMS | How - To | Smashing Magazine < / title >
Meta description and keyword tags are n’t as important for SEO ( at least for the major search engines anyway ) , but it ’s still a good idea to include them .
Change the description on each page to make it relate to that page ’s content , because this is often what Google displays in its search result description .
< meta name =" description " content =
" By Paul Boag Choosing a content management system can be tricky .
Without a clearly defined set of requirements , you will be seduced by fancy functionality that you will never use .
What then should you look " />
Cross -Browser Checks
Just when you think your design looks great , pixel perfect , you check it in IE and see that everything is broken .
It ’s important that your website works across browsers .
It does n’t have to be pixel perfect , but everything should work , and the user should n’t see any problems .
The most popular browsers to check are Internet Explorer 6 , 7 and 8 , Firefox 3 , Safari 3 , Chrome , Opera and the iPhone .
Proofread
Read everything .
Even if you ’ve already read it , read it again .
Get someone else to read it .
There ’s always something you ’ll pick up on and have to change .
See if you can reduce the amount of text by keeping it specific .
Break up large text blocks into shorter paragraphs .
Add clear headings throughout , and use lists so that users can scan easily .
Do n’t forget about dynamic text too , such as alert boxes .
Do n’t just assume all your links work .
Click on them .
You may often forget to add “ http : // ” to links to external websites .
Make sure your logo links to the home page , a common convention .
Also , think about how your links work .
Is it obvious to new users that they are links ?
They should stand out from the other text on the page .
Do n’t underline text that is n’t a link because it will confuse users .
And what happens to visited links ?
Functionality Check
Test everything thoroughly .
If you have a contact form , test it and copy yourself so that you can see what comes through .
Get others to test your website , and not just family and friends but the website ’s target market .
Sit back and watch how a user uses the website .
It ’s amazing what you ’ll pick up on when others use your website differently than how you assume they ’d use it .
Common things to check for are contact forms , search functions , shopping baskets and log - in areas .
Graceful Degradation
Your website should work with JavaScript turned off .
Users often have JavaScript turned off for security , so you should be prepared for this .
You can easily turn off JavaScript in Firefox .
Test your forms to make sure they still perform server - side validation checks , and test any cool AJAX stuff you have going on .
Validation
You should aim for a 100 % valid website .
That said , it is n’t the end of the world if your website does n’t validate , but it ’s important to know the reasons why it does n’t so that you can fix any nasty errors .
Common gotchas include no “ alt ” tags , no closing tags and using “ & ” instead of “ & ” for ampersands .
RSS Link
If your website has a blog or newsreel , you should have an RSS feed that users can subscribe to .
Users should be able to easily find your RSS feed : the common convention is to put a small RSS icon in the browser ’s address bar .
Put this code between your < head > tags .
< link rel= " alternate " type=" application / rss+xml " title = " Site or RSS title " href = " link - to - feed " />
Analytics
Installing some sort of analytics tool is important for measuring statistics to see how your website performs and how successful your conversion rates are .
Track daily unique hits , monthly page views and browser statistics , all useful data to start tracking from day 1 .
Google Analytics is a free favorite among website owners .
Others to consider are Clicky , Kissmetrics , Mint and StatCounter .
Sitemap
Adding a sitemap.xml file to your root directory allows the major search engines to easily index your website .
The file points crawlers to all the pages on your website .
XML - Sitemaps automatically creates a sitemap.xml file for you .
After creating the file , upload it to your root directory so that its location is www.mydomain.com/sitemap.xml.
If you use WordPress , install the Google XML Sitemaps plug - in , which automatically updates the sitemap when you write new posts .
Also , add your website and sitemap to Google Search Console .
This tells
Google that you have a sitemap , and the service provides useful statistics on how and when your website was last indexed .
Defensive Design
The most commonly overlooked defensive design element is the 404 page .
If a user requests a page that does n’t exist , your 404 page is displayed .
This may happen for a variety of reasons , including another website linking to a page that does n’t exist .
Get your users back on track by providing a useful 404 page that directs them to the home page or suggests other pages they may be interested in .
Another defensive design technique is checking your forms for validation .
Try submitting unusual information in your form fields ( e.g. lots of characters , letters in number fields , etc. ) and make sure that if there is an error , the user is provided with enough feedback to be able to fix it .
Optimize
You ’ll want to configure your website for optimal performance .
You should do this on an ongoing basis after launch , but you can take a few simple steps before launch , too .
Reducing HTTP requests , using CSS sprites wherever possible , optimizing images for the Web , compressing JavaScript and CSS files and so on can all help load your pages more quickly and use less server resources .
Besides , depending on the publishing engine that you are using , you may need to consider taking more specific measures – for instance , if you are using WordPress , you may need to consider useful caching techniques to speed up the performance .
Back Up
If your website runs off a database , you need a back - up strategy .
Or else , the day will come when you regret not having one .
If you use WordPress , install Wordpress Database Backup , which you can set up to automatically email you backups .
Print Style Sheet
If a user wants to print a page from your website , chances are she or he wants only the main content and not the navigation or extra design elements .
That ’s why it is a good idea to create a print - specific style sheet .
Also , certain CSS elements , such as floats , do n’t come out well when printed .
To point to a special CSS style sheet that computers automatically use when users print a page , simply include the following code between your < head > tags .
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text /css " href= " print.css " media= " print " />
Download the Ultimate Website Launch Checklist !
Just recently Dan Zambonini has published a very detailed checklist that covers both the pre-launch and the post - launch phase of the web site life cycle .
Among other things his Ultimate Launch Checklist contains checks related to content and style , standards and validation , search engine visibility , functional testing , security / risk , performance and marketing .
The checklist is a very useful reference that may help you in your daily projects and will help you to prevent errors and mistake once the site is released .
You may also want to consider the Quick Usability Check List by David Leggett that highlight some of the more common problems designers should address on their own sites in a Usability checklist of sorts .
Not all of these items will apply to every website , these are just suggested things to look for in your own site design .
What other checks would you list ?
Make yourself a to - do list and keep it handy to check over before making any website live .
Are there any other points you would add ?

Australia 's telecom regulator , the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) , has the authority to blacklist Internet sites , authority used almost exclusively to address childhood sex pictures ( children 's rights groups do n't like the " child porn " label , which suggests a degree of agency that children involved in the practice do n't have ) .
But it also came to light recently that ACMA is willing to blacklist pages that simply list the censored websites , even though they contain no offensive images .
The Sydney Morning Herald noted today that ACMA 's blacklist even includes certain Wikileaks pages , including a list of Denmark 's censored websites ( 3,863 blocked ) .
The page is apparently included on the theory that a massive list of sites with " lolita " and " youngyoung " in the their domain names is basically an invitation to Australians who might not otherwise know where to go to get an underage fix .
If that 's true , ACMA will have to keep blocking .
Wikileaks also hosts the leaked blacklists from countries like Thailand ( 11,329 blocked ) and Finland ( 797 blocked ) .
All three of those lists are largely concerned with sex , but the size difference can be chalked up to the fact that Thailand appears to be banning all sorts of porn websites ( along with proxy services ) , while the Nordic countries are exclusively concerned with sexual images of children .
The ACMA blacklist will be used as the basis for the government 's nationwide Internet filtering system — should that system ever be put into place ( it 's currently facing serious opposition from ISPs and even from the Australian Senate ) .
For now , though , the blacklist can be used by ACMA to go after websites that link to the censored content ; those that do n't remove such links after a day or so face fines of $ 11,000 per day .
The blacklist itself is secret , as it is in most countries that censor content .
This angers some activists who believe that secrecy lends itself to abuse .
In Finland , for instance , a man who runs a website arguing that the blacklist approach is ineffective was called in for questioning last year after publishing " a list of a few hundred censored sites . "
His own site was then placed on the blacklist , which means that visitors from Finland are greeted by a message saying that the site they are trying to reach contains illegal images .
Those in favor of keeping the lists secret claim that publishing them is simply providing a centralized resource for those interested in child sex abuse , but without any real way to see what 's on the list or to challenge its contents , the list makers will always invite charges of incompetence or arbitrariness ( indeed , one Finnish site claims that most of the domains on the blacklist appear to be legal pornographic sites ) .
This was the case recently in the UK where the censorship list creator ( which is not a part of the government ) added a Wikipedia image of an old Scorpions album cover to its block list and later retreated after protests .
Right or wrong , the first worldwide rule of Internet censorship currently seems to be " you do n't talk about what 's being censored . "

THE HSR LIE GETS A FOX NEWS TWIST ….
Republicans and their adjunct outlets have been touting one specific lie above all others lately .
As the argument goes , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) inserted an $ 8 billion earmark in the stimulus package to build a high - speed rail connector between Las Vegas and Disneyland .
The claim is completely wrong , and there is no such spending project .
Yesterday , Fox News gave the story a twist , changing the details of the already - bogus claim to make a brand new lie .
Check out this exchange between Fox News ’s Megyn Kelly and Rep. Trent Franks ( R - Ariz . ) on the omnibus spending bill pending in the Senate :
KELLY : It ’s a super railroad , of sorts — a line that will deliver customers straight from Disney , we kid you not , to the doorstep of the moonlight bunny ranch brothel in Nevada .
I say , to the moonlight Bunny Ranch brothel in Nevada .
So should your tax dollars be paying for these kinds of projects ? [… ]
FRANKS : The majority leader of the U.S. Senate , Harry Reid has fought for this publicly and is committed to this project , even in the face of criticism … .
If this is something that is truly the priority of the majority leader of the US senate , it ’s pretty late in the day , Megyn .
I love the way Megyn Kelly adds “ we kid you not ” while blatantly lying to a national television audience .
But notice the evolution of the lie .
First , the non-existent project was in the stimulus bill ; now it ’s the omnibus .
First , the HSR was headed to Vegas ; now it ’s Carson City .
First , Reid was quietly sneaking this non-existent spending into law ; now he ’s fighting for it publicly in the face of criticism .
Republican hacks like Kelly and Franks are n’t just lying , they ’re getting their own lie wrong , screwing up the manufactured controversy that they helped create .
In an apparent attempt to win some kind of irony award , Kelly asked Franks about how to hold lawmakers accountable for made - up earmarks that do n’t exist outside Republican talking points and the GOP ’s cable news channel .
Ali Frick noted Frank ’s unintentionally hilarious response : “ Fortunately , people like yourself and Fox News are a tremendous help in that regard because they tell the people — you know , sunlight has a way of being an accountability all by itself . ”
Once in a while , I feel sorry for Fox News ’ audience .
Commodore Frank Bainimarama is a serial interferer in Fijian politics
By Phil Mercer
BBC News , Sydney
As Fiji 's armed forces strengthen their control over the troubled South Pacific archipelago , there are warnings the country risks further international isolation and economic hardship as democracy continues to fade .
A turbulent week has seen the military government that seized power in 2006 declared illegal by a panel of senior judges , which prompted an ailing president to tear up the constitution , sack the judiciary and reinstate army strongman Commodore Frank Bainimarama .
" The country 's about to fall off a cliff , " Professor Helen Ware from Australia 's University of New England told the BBC .
Like many people who lead coups , they do n't necessarily start off with bad motives
Professor Helen Ware

" They 're going to be in an impossible situation , they do n't have a constitution , or a legally constituted government or any obvious way of getting themselves back onto the straight and narrow . "
For almost a decade Commodore Bainimarama , an indigenous Fijian , has been a mighty figure in domestic politics .
As head of the country 's most powerful organisation , the military , he guided Fiji through the chaos of a nationalist uprising in 2000 , only to eventually turn on the man he helped to become prime minister in that uncertain post - coup period , Laisenia Qarase , a retired banker .
Ethnic tensions
The Qarase government , accused of dishonesty and of discriminating against Fiji 's ethnic Indian minority , was ousted by Bainimarama 's troops in December 2006 .
" I think he [ Cmdr Bainimarama ] is genuine in his views about both racism and corruption , " explained Prof Ware .
" Fiji 's always had a difficulty in balancing the rights of the native Fijians against the Indians who were originally brought in as indentured labourers .
" Like many people who lead coups , they do n't necessarily start off with bad motives . "
The army commander , a former UN peacekeeper , has repeatedly resisted international calls to set a timetable for fresh elections , insisting that before democracy is restored , he must cleanse a rotten political system and to create a fairer , multi-racial society .
To suggest that an election will be held in 2014 is nothing more than a sham
Stephen Smith
Australian Foreign Minister
But more than two years after becoming interim prime minister , Commodore Bainimarama 's plans appear vague and worryingly open - ended .
Critics will ask if such a forceful character would be able to hand power back fully to an elected civilian .
His close ally , President Ratu Josefa Iloilo , has indicated that the military administration will serve for another five years and that Fijians will not get the chance to choose their own destiny at the ballot box until September 2014 .
Australia 's Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said recent events had made Fiji even more of a diplomatic outcast .
" They further isolate Fiji from the international community , they run the very grave risk of Fiji 's economic and social circumstances further deteriorating and , of course , to suggest that an election will be held in 2014 is nothing more than a sham , " Mr Smith said .
Canberra expects
Fiji to be formally suspended from both the Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth .
However , Daryl Tarte , chairman of the Fiji Media Council , believes such steps would simply amount to gesture politics .
" I do n't think there is anything the international community can do , " he told the BBC News website from his home in the Fijian capital , Suva .
" This is something we have to deal with ourselves here in Fiji . "
Press curtailed
There is likely to be little , if any , public dissent against the country 's new order , but under emergency measures military censors have moved in to stop the press publishing stories that could cause " disorder " or " promote disaffection or public alarm . "
" It is tragic as far as the media is concerned , " said Mr Tarte .
" The Bill of Rights no longer exists and that means we no longer have the right freedom of speech and freedom of expression .
" The media are all being censored . "
Commodore Bainimarama has promised the people a " fresh start " , but Fijians will no doubt wonder where his authoritarian style is taking them and their fragile country .

Buried in the 150 pages of CIPAV spyware - related documents released by the FBI Thursday is a tantalizing nugget that indicates the bureau 's technology experts have more than one way to hack a suspect .
In early 2007 , FBI agents with one of the bureau 's International Terrorism Operations Sections sought hacking help from the FBI 's geek squads .
The agents were working a case in Pittsburgh , which is not described in the documents , and wanted to know " if [ a ] remote computer attack can be conducted against [ the ] target . "
The FBI 's Cryptographic and Electronic Analysis Unit , CEAU , responded with two options .
One of them was redacted from the released document as a sensitive investigative technique .
The other is described this way : " CEAU advised Pittsburgh that they could assist with a wireless hack to obtain a file tree , but not the hard drive content . "
Wi - fi hacking has featured prominently in some big cybercrimes , including the attack on TJ Maxx that exposed at least 45 million customer credit card numbers and other data .
In that case , Albert " Segvec " Gonzalez and associates allegedly cracked the retailer 's WEP key and used it to gain entry to the corporate network , where he planted packet sniffers to scoop up the data .
But this is the first evidence that the FBI is using the same tactics .
Presumably , suspects using one of the better encryption options — like WPA - 2 — are immune .
It 's not clear why the FBI said it could only obtain a file tree — a hierarchical list of directories and files .
It could be to avoid the risk of a judge later ruling that the search warrant was unconstitutionally over - broad , and consequently throwing out the evidence .
Or maybe the bureau 's hackers do n't want to consume all of a target 's bandwidth while copying his entire porn directory into the FBI van on the street .

Barack Obama has only been president for six weeks , but there is a surprising amount of ire , anger , even outrage that he has n’t yet solved the problems of the U.S. economy , that he has n’t saved us from the increasingly tragic devastation wrought by the clownish ideas of right - wing conservatives and the many long years of radical Republican misrule .
This intense , impatient , often self - righteous , frequently wrongheaded and at times willfully destructive criticism has come in waves , and not just from the right .
Mr. Obama is as legitimate a target for criticism as any president .
But there is a weird hysterical quality to some of the recent attacks that suggests an underlying fear or barely suppressed rage .
It ’s a quality that seems not just unhelpful but unhealthy .
Mr. Obama is being hammered  depending on the point of view of the critics  for the continuing collapse of the stock market , for not moving fast enough to revive the suicidal financial industry , for trying to stem the flood tide of home foreclosures , for trying to bring health insurance coverage to some of the millions of Americans who do n’t have any , for running up huge budget deficits as he tries to fend off the worst economic emergency since World War II and for not taking time out from all of the above to deal with  get this  earmarks .
Earmarks .
More than 4.4 million jobs have been lost since this monster recession officially got under way in December 2007 , and we ’ve got people wigging out over earmarks .
Folks , get a grip .
Some earmarks are good , some are not , but collectively they account for a tiny , tiny portion of the national budget  less than 1 percent .
A giant asteroid hit the Earth around 65 million years ago , but experts dispute the impact it had .
Molten droplets from the ancient asteroid impact were found just below the Cretaceous - Tertiary boundary – a geological layer of sediment linked with the extinction .
But soil samples from the 112 - mile wide crater show the impact predates the disappearance of the dinosaurs by about 300,000 years .
The latest research has been published in the Journal of the Geological Society .
Study author Professor Gerta Keller from Princeton University suggested that the massive volcanic eruptions at the Deccan Traps in India may be responsible for the extinction , releasing huge amounts of dust and gases that could have blocked out sunlight and brought about a significant greenhouse effect .
Supporters of the Chicxulub impact theory suggest the impact crater and the mass extinction event only appear far apart in the sedimentary record because of earthquake or tsunami disturbance that resulted from the impact of the asteroid .
But Professor Keller said : ‘ The problem with the tsunami interpretation is that this sandstone complex was not deposited over hours or days by a tsunami .
‘ Deposition occurred over a very long time period . ’
The scientists also found evidence that the Chicxulub impact did n’t have the dramatic impact on species diversity that has been suggested .
At one site at El Penon , the researchers found 52 species present in sediments below the impact spherule layer , and counted all 52 still present in layers above the molten droplets or spherules .
‘ We found that not a single species went extinct as a result of the Chicxulub impact , ’ said Professor Keller .
This conclusion should not come as too great a surprise , she says .
None of the other great mass extinctions are associated with an impact , and no other large craters are known to have caused a significant extinction event .
Land - based dinosaurs disappeared along with most birds and many groups of mammals in the Cretaceous - Tertiary extinction event

WASHINGTON 
In a major setback for business groups that had hoped to build a barrier against injury lawsuits seeking billions of dollars , the Supreme Court on Wednesday said state juries may award damages for harm from unsafe drugs even though their manufacturers had satisfied federal regulators .
The ruling could have significant implications beyond drug manufacturing .
Many companies have sought tighter federal regulation in recent years in part to shield themselves from litigation .
The court , by a 6 - to - 3 vote , upheld a jury verdict of $ 6.7 million in favor of a musician from Vermont whose arm had to be amputated after she was injected with an antinausea drug .
The drug ’s manufacturer , Wyeth , had argued that its compliance with the Food and Drug Administration ’s labeling requirements should immunize it from lawsuits .
Pharmaceutical companies were especially disappointed by Wednesday ’s decision .
Ronald Rogers , a spokesman for Merck , said , “ We believe state courts should not be second - guessing the doctors and scientists at the F.D.A . ”

Pressure groups see broadband investment as vital to the US economy US agencies in charge of more than $ 7bn ( £ 5 bn ) in grants for high - speed broadband networks have been urged to deliver the " best bang for the buck " .
The Free Press , which represents consumers , made the call ahead of a meeting where federal bodies will discuss how the grants should be spent .
The money is part of an overall $ 787bn package bill to stimulate the economy .
" It all hinges on getting the policy right to make sure the money is spent right " said the Free Press 's Ben Scott .
" We 're going into an extraordinary period where the government is directly investing in broadband infrastructure .
" This process of handing out $ 7bn , although there 's a great deal of urgency to get the money out the door , must fundamentally be data driven .
" We need to make sure the money is spent wisely , " added Mr Scott who likened this period to that of previous big public spending programmes involving electrification and the highways .
' Lighting - fast '
Technology companies , telecommunications service providers and other internet service providers will compete for the grant money through a bidding process .
On Tuesday , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , the US National Telecommunications and Information Administration ( NTIA ) and the Rural Utilities Service ( RUS ) are expected to hold the first of many public meetings over how to disperse the money .
US residents endure some of the slowest broadband speeds
The lions share , $ 4.7bn ( £ 3.3 bn ) , will go to the NTIA with the remainder of $ 2.5 bn ( £ 1.7 bn ) going to the RUS , an agency within the Department of Agriculture .
The agencies will concentrate on " unserved " and " underserved " parts of the country like small towns and rural areas .
The money will also be aimed at paying for " broadband education , awareness , training , access , equipment and support " in an effort to create jobs .
" It 's very important that they ( the grants ) go to economically viable commercial entities that are sustainable over the long term , " said former Representative Charles " Chip " Pickering , who represented a rural district in Mississippi and was an active member on the House Telecommunications Subcommittee
He championed public - private partnerships that " maximise the leverage " of stimulus funding .
" When we have competition we have much greater innovation and investment , " he said .
" Where we have a duopoly , we have seen reduced economic activity , reduced investment and reduced innovation . "
Both agencies are required by law to commit all the funding by the end of 2010 .
" The question of how fast we should move has been taken out of our hands by Congress , " said Markham Erikson of the Open Internet Coalition , an advocacy group representing tech companies like Google , Amazon and eBay .
" NTIA has to move by Washington standards in lighting - fast time , " he told the BBC in a conference call .
The coalition has sent a letter to the NTIA to urge it to " adhere to common - sense openness principles " which Mr Erickson said " has fed the engine of economic and job growth in the information , communications and technology sector for over a decade . "
' Need for speed '
While the NTIA and RUS is charged with the here and now to some degree , the FCC is tasked with drawing up a broadband strategy for the future .
A report at the end of last week by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation also looked further down the road to how the U.S. should spend future investments .
Broadband access is regarded as " long - overdue " in many areas
In its study entitled The Need for Speed : The Importance of Next - Generation Broadband Networks , the foundation called for broadband deployments with speeds of at least 50 megabits per second of Mbps .
The report noted that average broadband speeds to American residents is 5 Mbps compared to 63 Mbps in Japan and 49 Mbps in South Korea .
" This shows us that deploying next generation broadband networks will have profoundly positive benefits for consumers , businesses , academic institutions and society in general , " said ITIF President Robert Atkinson .
" Deploying next generation broadband to 80 % of US households that currently lack it can bring the needed economic stimulus by ensuring approximately two million American jobs , " he claimed .
Mr Scott of the Free Press backed the call for the government to fund high - speed networks and not just basic broadband .
He has proposed minimum speed requirements , affordable rates and a cost model showing effective use of taxpayer dollars .
" We 're concerned that stimulus dollars not be used to build obsolete networks .
We want to make sure that we 're not simply re-creating a digital divide by building a substandard network that then has to take another leap to catch up , " he said .

If this 7 - foot long model of the Mon Calamari flagship from Return of the Jedi— complete with integrated lighting — does n't impress you on first sight , consider this :
It uses 30,500 bricks valued at $ 5,500 .
Advertisement
The stunning Lego model — created by Thomas Benedikt — was created to scale from the official Lego Star Destroyer , which is an impressive 3,104 - piece beast on its own .
According to Thomas , the ship was almost impossible to recreate in Lego because of the difficulty of its surfaces :
There are no right angles at all .
On top of being difficult for creating the CAD plans , in a Lego model the curved surfaces make construction extra difficult .
After considering many building techniques , he decided to use studs joined by hinges , with transparent yellow studs to let the light from the star cruiser 's interior shine through .

The resulting model is beautiful , bigger than many apartments in New York , and the final effect when lit up is simply amazing , as you can see in this gallery .

A friend of mine from elementary school recently contacted me via Facebook and told me about this amazing CraigslistÂ listing she saw in South Carolina for Swedish antiques .
Thank you Faith , good eye !
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
My obsession of all things Swedish took me to Bennettsville , South Carolina , a small town not far over the state line .
Â
My friends Kristine and Kristin and I drove less than hour , where we met Melissa Mallette .
I had a lot of questions for Melissa before meeting her .
How did she get all of these amazing antiques from Sweden ?
How did she fall in to this specific niche ?
Why Swedish ?
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Melissa had over 60 pieces in her inventory ranging from the 1700s to early 1900s .
Casually arranged in her Victorian home built in the early 1900s , Melissa had a wide range of Gustavian Swedish goods ranging from linen pillows to massive secretaries .
Â Â Â Â Â
Melissa is a native of Canada and a traveling chef .
I ’m thinking she probably could ’ve told us some pretty colorful stories about her travels but during our visit the topic was mostly about antiques and home decor .
Over time Melissa developed a passion for Swedish antiques and that blossomed in to a business .
Â Â
Melissa has refinished and restored a lot of her pieces .
Â
She refinished the original hardwoods in her home and her big project right now is in her backyard .
Â
She wants to incorporate some of the Canadian culture back in to her life and so in order to do that she learned plumbing and carpentry to construct her own sauna .
I ’m impressed !
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
I was wondering how the perfect chalky white finish was achieved every time and Melissa explained that Old Fashioned Milk Paint was behind that magic .
Â Definitely worth checking out , Milk Paint is a chemical - free green paint .
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Key terms when searching for Swedish antique furniture :
Rococo
Biedermeier
Gustavian
Swedish country
Mora clocks
Gilt mirrors
rag rugs

Lenin 's statue was left with a gaping hole
One of Russia 's most famous statues of Vladimir Lenin has been bombed , leaving the Bolshevik revolutionary with a gaping hole in his rear .
The bronze statue , in the city of St Petersburg , was badly damaged before dawn on Wednesday , when the blast blew a hole in Lenin 's coat .
No -one was hurt in the attack , the motive for which was unknown .
The statue , outside the Finland Station , marks the Bolshevik leader 's return from exile in April 1917 .
" Today at 0430 [ 0030 GMT ] there was an explosion at the Lenin monument at the Finland Station in the city centre , " a spokesman for the Saint Petersburg branch of the Russian emergency situations ministry told the AFP news agency .
" As a result of the explosion a crater of 80 - 100 cm [ 31 - 39in ] appeared on the monument , " he added .
Lenin gave a speech at the railway station after his return from exile .
Later that year he would lead the revolution that overthrew the government and would take the Communists to power for more than 70 years .
St Petersburg was the cradle of the Russian Revolution and was renamed Leningrad after Lenin 's death in 1924 .
Lenin 's embalmed body remains on display in a mausoleum in Moscow .
Bo is a Portuguese Water Dog given to the Obama Girls as a gift by Senator Edward Kennedy ( D - MA ) .
This secret was slipped out over the weekend and to be honest , this is the one story everyone has been sniffing around for .
The identity of the first puppy -- the one that the Washington press corps has been yelping about for months , the one President Obama has seemed to delight in dropping hints about -- leaked out yesterday .
This despite White House efforts to delay the news until the big debut planned for Tuesday afternoon .
The little guy is a 6 - month - old Portuguese water dog given to the Obama girls as a gift by that Portuguese water dog - lovin ' senator himself , Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts .
The girls named it Bo -- and let it be noted that you learned that here first .
Malia and Sasha chose the name , because their cousins have a cat named Bo and because first lady Michelle Obama 's father was nicknamed Diddley , a source said .
( Get it ?
Bo . . . Diddley ? )
Bo 's a handsome little guy .
Well suited for formal occasions at the White House , he 's got tuxedo - black fur , with a white chest , white paws and a rakish white goatee .
Clearly , the identity of the dog was information too big to contain .
A mysterious Web site called First Dog Charlie published a picture of a Portie yesterday morning , complete with a Q and A with the dog , which it said was originally named Charlie .
The celebrity gossip Web site TMZ.com linked to the picture .
So much for the big White House unveiling .
For an Obama team that ran a famously tight - knit press operation during last year 's presidential election campaign , it was a sign of how tough it can be to keep a leash on information in Washington .
It 's not for lack of trying , though .
Bo 's story starts sometime around the Ides of March .
Word on the street was that the White House was going to plant a vegetable garden .
Health gurus had been pushing the Obamas to plant seedlings for months , hoping it would set a good example for children everywhere .
A Washington Post food reporter was making calls , probing , pushing .
But the White House was mum .
Word filtered out that the exclusive had been promised to the New York Times .
But the White House offered The Post , the newspaper that cracked Watergate , a mollifier : A puppy exclusive .
These kinds of arrangements get made all the time in Washington .
For a while , the puppy deal seemed to be holding up .
Sure , reporters here and there nipped at the story .
There were hints that the puppy was a gift .
There were reports that the Kennedys were involved -- but the senator 's press people professed no knowledge .
read more here ....
Bo , looks like my Havanese , Snoop , only with curly hair .
Congrats , Obama Family , you have named your pet , he has taken pictures with you , he is now an , love him and cherish him .
WHITE DWARF
WHITE DWARF -- Rusta , 3040 A.D. Orbiting a white dwarf star light years from Earth , Rusta is a remote outpost where night and day are forever halved .
It 's a mystical place where a giant wall splits the planet , it 's climate and it 's people .
As one half of the planet is bathed in eternal light , the other is sheathed in endless darkness .
These two sides are embroiled in a civil war but are on the verge of signing an historic peace accord .
Into this twisted world of Light Sider vs. Dark Sider lands Dr. Driscoll Rampart III on loan from Earth to fulfill a six - month internship with head medicine man and legendary Dr. Akada .
What the young doctor thought would be an easy six months in " the arm pit of the galaxy " would soon become the adventure of his life .
Donning a fresh , white , summer suit and dragging his golf clubs behind him , young Driscoll , fresh out of Columbia Med , is initially quite naive .
He dreams of a career on Park Avenue and figures he can carve out a well - heeled clientele by spending a year on the frontier accumulating charming stories designed to make the Manhattan society patients titter .
His foray into frontier medicine opens his jaded eyes to a surreal culture that blurs the line between utopia and dystopia .
The Rustians are retro-futurists .
Soldiers fight with muskets and crossbows .
Fashions span the medieval , Wild West and 1920s eras .
Transportation is via horses and carriages .
Kings reside in ornate castles .
And spiritual visions come in the form of the Two Ladies -- one dressed in white , the other in black -- who , legend has it , are forever separated by their loyalty to the single child each mother bore .
The legend says that each child became too possessive of their maternal affections and forbade their mothers from seeing each other .
Sundered , the two sisters died of broken hearts .
The great wall that sections the two halves of the planet was build to keep them apart and now separates their peoples still at war -- though on the eve of peace .
" The mythology is , " begins writer Bruce Wagner , " there were two sisters impregnated by the soul of the planet .
And they bore two children who were very possessive and who forbid them to see one another .
The Two Ladies died of broken hearts , and like Christ on our planet , they are the icon that rules people 's hearts . "
The realm of the Dark Side is ruled by King Joist with his a daughter , Ariel , at his side -- as well as a knight , Strake .
Strake romantically pursues the ever - elusive Ariel .
The decor is distinctly gothic .
This place of shadows resounds with the clinking of chain mail , the clash of swords and the haughty boasts and base treacheries of people who sport codpieces .
There are castles and dungeons and criminals ( and innocents ? ) forced to live in captivity for upwards of 500 years .
The Light side , meanwhile , has adopted a Western motif , replete with homesteads , stagecoaches and purple sagebrush .
This frontier 's major set is a medical center that resembles an early Mexican mission .
As only one face of Rusta is perennially orbiting it's white dwarf star , the entire surface is made habitable by orbiting , albeit decaying , Regulators .
Regulators are huge metallic orbs , which hang in the horizon and were left by some unknown entity 10,000 years ago to control planetary weather patterns .
After drawing the curtains tight from the never - ending light , Emma poured the last bit of hot spring water drawn from the well into her tub and stepped in .
She tried to be quiet , but her husband , Peter , ( James Morrison ) awoke anyway .
" I though you were sleepwalking , " he said , entering in his white long johns
" I 'm sleep bathing . "
" It 's after midnight , you know . "
" Yes , it 's so dry lately I can't sleep . "
" It 's those damn Regulators .
They 'll be servicing them soon , " Peter says as he takes the sponge from her hand and begins washing her upraised leg .
" I think the twins inherited your insomnia .
Bedtime stories are becoming novels . "
" Sweet girls .
Zuzu 's nervous about tomorrow .
The kids always tease her so . "
" Dr. Akada said he had a new medicine .
He seemed hopeful . "
" It just seems so cruel that the virus would attack one twin and not the other . "
" She 's a tough little girl , just like her mom . "
" And on top of everything else , the first day of school .
Do n't you remember what that was like ? "
" No , I do n't .
It 's a complete blank .
I 've forgotten a lot of things , " he teases .
" I really think you should help me remember . "
He leans in and kisses his wife , then blows out the illuminating candle .
Morning arrives on the lush Rusta .
Emma ties the ribbon on Zuzu 's bonnet and helps her frail figure onto the waiting buckboard -- for Zuzu is afflicted with a virus that has caused her , in all physical ways , to resemble a 70 year - old .
Zaza prods her sister , impatient to get to school .
As Peter calls the horses to move , the two sisters swing their heads back to say goodbye to their mother .
Unbeknownst to the two 12 year - olds , this will be the last time they will ever see her .
As Peter and the twins pull away , Emma hears a strange , ominous call in the near distance .
Not a forest creature , it is a Dark Side cultist gang coming through the Great Wall with a plan to violently inhibit the impending peace accord .
Light Side Marshalls chase the Dark Siders home .
They escape through a dragon's head shaped opening in the Great Wall .
They return home and report that not only were a wife AND husband slaughtered for the cause , but also a coachman -- his passenger wounded .
Their leader appears unsatisfied until the passenger of the coach is identified .
It is the graduated intern before Driscoll -- a man from earth , a past enemy .
The leader is pleased but can not stay to celebrate -- for Strake must return to his sovereign , King Joist , ruler of the Dark Side .
Driscoll wanders the halls of his new hospital .
He ventures into a small , white room and stands stunned .
The two lifeless bodies of Peter and Emma are lain on horizontal racks on the wall .
Their fixed - open , vacant , crystal - blue eyes are a reminder and a warning of the severity of the politics Driscoll has blindly stepped into .
Driscoll moves trance - like past them and backs out into an orderly who demands his assistance in the operating room .
Slowly recovering from his disturbed vision , Driscoll realizes that the emergency patient now dying on the table is the previous intern .
Despite Akada 's best efforts , the young doctor dies from his wounds .
Dr. Akada is Rampart 's mentor and a Dark Sider ex-patriot .
He was once imprisoned in " The Keep " for his aspirations to rule and for his ignorance of tolerance .
Reeducated and freed , Akada vowed to help people .
Nurse Shobanna assists him .
Driscoll seeks refuge outside , but the wind is up .
A child patient nicknamed Never meets him .
Never is an empathic shape - shifter whose powers are known to the Rustians as Proteus Syndrome .
He is a societal pariah to his wealthy parents as he morphs uncontrollably into anything from a boy - sized raven to a panther .
He can even change into the loved ones he finds in the minds of the people nearest in proximity to him -- including Driscoll 's recently deceased fiancé .
Never takes the form of a mysterious and beautiful woman that Driscoll recognizes and who speaks forlornly of " our son . "
Driscoll had a wife and son , but Driscoll caught a disease and passed it to them .
He recovered , they did not .
Driscoll forms an attachment to the abandoned Never and helps the boy get a handle on his physical disease by providing love and psychological grounding .
Also housed at the hospital now are the orphaned Zuzu and Zaza , twin 12 year - old daughters of Peter and Emma .
Zuzu 's virus needs monitoring .
Though Zaza does not share this affliction , she is housed in the villa - style house as well .
Elsewhere in this fantastical world dwells a fantastic , mythical character with tusks and horns -- a creature named Osh .
Osh is the warden of the Dark Sider King 's prison , The Keep .
His prime charge is Lady X , a beautiful " young " woman more than 500 years old who was convicted of having created a plague on Earth that killed billions -- though she pleads she is innocent .
She is kept alive by Osh 's ability to secrete a hormone that affords an entirely undesired immortality .
The only problem is that this big , lumbering beast is also in love with her .
In the Dark Side castle , King Joist and Strake find and interrogate the mercenaries who were responsible for the Light Side attack .
As Strake claims ignorance and abhorrence of their deeds in front of his sovereign , it becomes clear that he is not pursuing the interests of his King .
His secret command of the raiders is for his own , sordid profit .
Strake convinces the King 's doctor to drug the ruler , and together they insert a parasite into the King 's body as an inconspicuous method to kill him and then usurp his thrown .
Akada is sent for , but even he cannot save the ailing King .
Instead Akada takes his life to end the King 's imminent madness as the parasite moves into his head to consume his brain .
Afterwards , as Strake postures about ambition , Akada realizes Strake has caused this death .
But it is the Two Ladies in a dream who tell the King 's daughter Ariel , true heir to the thrown , that Strake is the murderer .
Ariel sends for Osh , who comes , personally , to escort Strake to the Keep .
Then bad new arrives at the hospital for Never .
His mother is unable to send for him as she had promised , and she adds that she may not even be able to visit for another year .
Feeling more alone than ever , the boy starts shifting uncontrollably .
Driscoll takes
Never into his arms and holds him until he stops , but , now weakened by the exertion , Never is still in critical condition with a raging fever .
Shobanna takes the twins and Driscoll to the Sea of Tears , a truly red sea also called the Blood of Rusta .
Together , according to tradition , they shout across the waters , calling Never 's name .
They call for him to return from his journey toward death .
Miraculously , this works .
They return to the hospital to find Never awake and recovering .
At The Keep , Strake endures his first taste of the immortality dreaded by all inmates .
Ariel , now Dark Side Queen , sits down with the Governor of the Light Side to sign their peace accord .
Afterwards , bedecked in a flowing , white gown complete with ornamental wings , Ariel joins Acada and Driscoll for a picnic by the Sea of Tears .
The once elusive Ariel is quite attentive to Driscoll .
Osh arrives with his beloved Lady X for whom he has risked death to grant her single wish to see the sun again .
Then Driscoll 's internship ends .
He packs his white suit and wistfully departs on the waiting stagecoach .
But Rusta 's call is too strong , and soon ...
Never is no longer alone .
Writer Bruce Wagner ( WILD PALMS ) attempts to fashion an allegory about the ignorance and prejudices of mankind , and it 's quite clever that within such traditional divisions most of the characters are patterned in shades of gray .
It 's a nicely ironic touch that Driscoll 's two mentors on the light side are played by black actors , even though he may not have written this with those specifics in mind .
In addition to Winfield , C.C.H. Pounder ( ER ) plays Akada 's head nurse , Nurse Shobanna .
Acada , is played by Paul Winfield ( STII : THE WRATH OF KHAN ) , who admits to having read science fiction while growing up in Watts .
" It was a great way to escape the daily drudgery of survival , to go to other worlds .
I read a lot ' til I got to college -- Asimov , Heinlein ....
Red Planet was a book I read over and over . "
Coppola hooked up his company , American Zoetrope , with Wagner , as he was a fan of WILD PALMS .
When asked how he got the suits at Fox to buy his premise , Wagner returns , " You just mention the name Coppola . "
" We presented it as a doctor show with an extreme twist .
I 've always wanted to do a doctor show .
I was also an enormous fan of LONESOME DOVE .
And the idea of commingling these things , particularly with Francis ( Coppola ) coming off DRACULA -- doing something very stylish -- I think this gave Fox something they really sparked to , a rather traditional story that is couched in a very unusual language and images . "
" I 'm not a huge sci - fi reader , but I am a fan of sci - fi illustrations -- floating cities and dragon - slayers .
At the end of the pilot there is a cliff , an overlook , and Lady X is wading into the Red Sea , and Osh is on the beach sitting with the horses in a carriage , and there are these eunuchs , called Davids , watching .
The image to me was just a lovely one .
As a child I would project myself into these kinds of images . "
Unlike other speculative shows , that all but dismiss the rather Earthly trappings of their alien landscapes , here there are a few rather oblique references to the Rustians and Earthlings having crossed paths , with rather disastrous results , some 500 years previous which compensate for the propensity toward an earth - like environment -- as well as piquing our interest into how the histories of the two worlds are intertwined .
" It 's a coming - of - age story .
Hopefully it will be fun .
It 's quite a different doctor show . "
Some material and quotes taken from a review from the Cabin Fever Entertainment , Inc. video cover box , a review by Andrew O. Thompson for Sci-Fi Universe magazine and interviews by Sheldon Teitelbaum , also for Sci -Fi Universe magazine .
A GRIM expression in a yearbook photo or family snapshot could mean more than just a passing bad mood .
It could also signal that the subject is more likely to get divorced than someone with a big smile for the camera .
Matthew Hertenstein and his colleagues at DePauw University in Greencastle , Indiana asked old boys and girls of the university to answer questions about their current sexual relationships and whether they had ever been divorced .
The team then looked up pictures of their volunteers in the university 's yearbooks and graded the degree of their smiles .
The less a person smiled , it turned out , the more likely he or she was to have been divorced over the course of a lifetime .
This research is a dramatic example of how “ thin slices ” of information can predict important aspects of people 's personalities .
In past studies , researchers have shown that with very limited information — less than half a minute of interaction , the viewing of a video clip or just a look at a photograph — people can make accurate predictions about others ' sexual orientation , socioeconomic status , teaching ability and personality .
Dr Hertenstein was following up research which had shown that the women who smiled most in their college photos were most likely to be married by the age of 27 , among other things .
He wanted to see if the same held , over the longer term , for divorce .
His study , to be published in Motivation & Emotion , looked at three groups .
The first , of 306 people , came from alumni of the psychology department .
The second group , of 349 , was recruited from general alumni .
The third , of 55 people , was recruited from the town .
( In the last case , people were asked to send in photos of themselves , but were not told that the study was about smiling . )
The researchers rated the photos of the subjects on a scale of two to ten .
They also asked their volunteers various questions , including whether they had ever been divorced .
The relationship between smiling and divorce also held up among townspeople , even though many sent photographs of themselves as children .
Facial expression predicted divorce even when the smile or frown was on a ten - year - old 's face .
A photograph that records a split second from a lifetime is a very thin slice indeed .
How could it predict a divorce decades in the future ?
The researchers suggest that the smiles are accurate indicators of personality .
The results should not be overstretched .
The never - divorced had their smiles rated on average at 5.9 , 5.9 and 5.2 out of 10 in each of the three groups , while the divorced scored 5 , 5.3 and 4.4 .
That is not a huge difference , but it is statistically significant .
On the other hand , comparing only the lowest - scoring people with the highest - scoring , the least - smiling were three times more likely than the biggest smilers to divorce .
Until the findings are replicated it is probably too early to choose a spouse based on a facial expression in a photo .
On the other hand , it would not hurt to smile for the camera yourself .
There 's little question that the latest Kindle 2 hardware is much improved over previous versions , but it still is n't quite an easily pocketable , ubiquitous device : it 's purpose - built for reading .
Although it 's portable , I 'll wager people are far more likely to have a phone on them at all times .
And that 's where Amazon 's new Kindle for iPhone app comes in .
" We are excited to bring the new Kindle application to Apple 's App Store and think customers are going to love how easy and fun it is to read their Kindle books on the iPhone and iPod touch , said Amazon Kindle vice president Ian Freed in a statement .
" Kindle for iPhone and iPod touch is a great way for customers to catch up on their current book wherever they are , like in line at the grocery store or between meetings . "
The application — a free download from Apple 's App Store — is simple to use and makes a great companion for Kindle owners .
But owning a Kindle is not a requirement .
Books can be purchased via Amazon 's Web - based Kindle Store and synced to an iPhone .
Despite the fact that the iPhone has a smaller , somewhat lower - resolution screen than the Kindle 's e-Ink hardware , reading on the iPhone can actually be quite enjoyable .
But it does have some serious usability caveats .
One you register your Amazon.com account , you can access all your previously purchased books .
First , you link to your Amazon.com account , so you 'll need to get one if you do n't have one already .
If you are a Kindle user , books you have already purchased will show up under " Archived Items , " and selecting books here will allow you to sync them to your iPhone .
Titles synced to your iPhone will show up in a list on the home screen .
If you have n't already purchased books , or you want to buy new ones , this is where it gets tricky .
There is no in - app capacity for purchasing books .
This may be due to a stipulation in Apple 's iPhone Developer agreement , which says that programs cannot provide additional content through distribution methods other than the iTunes Store without prior written consent from Apple .
Most other e-book readers for the iPhone that offer the option of purchasing books , like Stanza or eReader , get around this by routing users to an e-book store via an embedded WebKit view .
So far , this approach has n't been rejected by Apple .
Just because you can buy books via MobileSafari does n't mean you should .
But , it can be done — an unabridged copy of Stephen King 's The Stand is being sent to my iPhone via WhisperSync ?.
The current version of Kindle for iPhone is a little different .
Clicking on the " Get Books " button on the Home screen instructs users to got to Amazon 's Kindle Store via a computer for " the best shopping experience . "
And they are n't kidding ; while there is a link that will open the Kindle Store in MobileSafari , browsing and buying books this way is just plain frustrating .
The Kindle 's own integrated buying system is far simpler in comparison .
Apple presumably has this restriction in place so that developers do n't abuse the App Store system , giving away free apps on Apple 's dime and then selling content elsewhere .
Perhaps Amazon can build an iPhone - browsable version of the Kindle Store and display it via an embedded browser , or better yet , perhaps Amazon and Apple can come to some sort of agreement to allow in - app purchasing .
Reading , on the other hand , is pretty straightforward .
Books can be navigated via a hyperlinked table of contents .
Flipping from page to page uses the same swiping gesture as most other e-book readers for iPhone , though it does n't allow tapping on the edges like most of those others do .
Resting a finger on the screen will bring up a navigation overlay , which allows setting a bookmark , jumping to the table of contents or other bookmarks , changing the type size , and syncing your location within the book with your account .
There is also a slider that allows jumping ahead by arbitrary pages , and a button to jump back to where you were previously .
I 'm banking on The Stand lasting through several weeks of commuting .
The text is set pretty small , but it helps avoid large gaps and " rivers " due to the justified text .
While the other functions are fairly obvious , the syncing is quite handy if you move from Kindle to iPhone .
It will sync your last read page , as well as any new bookmarks , from one device to the other via your Amazon account .
So , if you were reading at home , say , and then later wanted to pick right back up where you left off while out and about , syncing makes that happen .
Visually , Amazon has done a pretty good job of making text readable .
Any books that have images will show those inline , and books formatted with color will display in color on the iPhone — something the Kindle 's black and white screen can't do .
The only major gripe we have here is that text is always displayed justified .
There is no option to display text ragged - right , which is generally far easier to read , especially with narrow columns of text .
The justifying leaves a lot of variable - width gaps between words , and it can make for some uncomfortable reading .
Moreover , there is very little control over how text is displayed .
Most other e-book readers allow for adjusting typeface , leading , justification , background color , and other settings .
Kindle for iPhone has one typeface , one ( less - than - ideal ) justification setting , a few type sizes , and little else .
Kindle for iPhone also does n't allow for landscape viewing .
These limitations likely reflect an effort to keep the reading experience somewhat similar to the Kindle itself , but I 'm not sure iPhone users will be able to overlook all of them .
Kindle for iPhone is a great addition to the stable of e-book apps available for the platform .
The competition will have a hard time keeping up with Amazon 's catalog of content , and for current Kindle owners it makes a great companion .
If Amazon can add a more control over text display and find a way to offer browsing and buying content directly from the app , it might become the go - to e-book reader for iPhone .
I visited the secret laboratories of Evil Genius Racing last week , to see what manner of madness they had cooking .
While there , I encountered a couple of track - car projects that presented quite a dilemma .
I was really hoping to take a look at their Black Ops 24 Hours Of LeMons racer , but I was only able to shoot the single photo you see here prior to being hustled away from the vehicle by a squad of Phone Police .
Still , it 's a clue !
The Black Metal V8 olvo was there , in the Evil Genius Purgatorial Parking Area .
There will be a new theme for the 302 - powered Volvo DL at the Goin ' For Broken race in Nevada ; more on that soon .
Here 's another potential LeMons car , though the EG says he can't quite bring himself to beat up such a solid , restorable 240Z , regardless of initial price tag .
Check out that custom instrument panel !
The previous owner of this car was celebrating National Day Of Slayer year - round !
Then there 's the World 's Nicest Fiat Spider , which is definitely be the most original early - 80s Fiat I 've ever seen .
Over in the shop , Evil Clint was doing some welding on a project that earns a big Jalopnik Stamp - O - Approval™ : a Mazda Miata with all - aluminum Chevrolet LS1 V8 , T56 6 - speed , and Lincoln Mark VIII 8.8 " IRS rear .
We recommend that all cars get their recommended daily allowance of Vitamin LS ; in the case of this Miata , the end result will be lighter than the Mazda - engined car .
How about 400 horsepower in a 2,300 - pound car ?
I thought that was pretty cool , but then I saw this ' 87 Porsche 928 on the Evil Genius dyno .
The engine is fairly close to stock and puts out a reliable 300 horsepower , which made the 3,700 - pound 928 go pretty well … but this car has been put on a ruthless diet .
Yes , there are many things a 928 really does n't need - things such as headlights , door guts , etc. - and all of them have been torn out .
With cage and a half - tank of fuel , it weighs just 2,850 pounds .
280 North has already made two major breakthroughs in building its web - based presentation app 280 Slides .
First , it created the Objective - C- like superset of JavaScript called Objective - J.
Then it re-implemented much of Apple 's popular Cocoa APIs in the web - oriented Cappuccino .
Now , its latest project , Atlas , represents perhaps a third breakthrough : a visual integrated development environment for building the next generation of desktop - like web applications .
" Atlas is designed to make it much easier to design , prototype , and build a Cappuccino application , " 280 North co-founder , Ross Boucher , told Ars .
" By removing the most tedious and repetitive code , and by making the design process visual like it should be , [ developers ] can be much more productive . "
But the power of Atlas is n't just that it lets a developer visually design the user interface , or manage the underlying " business logic " code .
" We 're also interested in exploring ways to improve the entire development process , including integrating the visual layout editor and code editor , and building in pre-built ' controllers ' that know how to talk to existing web services , " Boucher said .
Using these pre-built controllers , it 's possible to develop apps in Atlas almost completely by drag - and - drop .
For those with even a passing familiarity with Mac OS X development , let 's extend the Apple analogy a bit further .
Mac OS
X developers write code in Objective - C , using Cocoa frameworks , in Xcode , and design the UI in Interface Builder .
280 North envisions web app developers writing code in Objective - J , using Cappuccino frameworks , in Atlas , and also designing the UI in Atlas .
" Atlas is like Xcode and IB combined — and hopefully with some cool features that neither of them has , " said Boucher .
One of those cool features is the aforementioned built - in controllers that can connect to and interact with common web services , such as RSS , Twitter , Facebook , and more .
These controllers automatically expose their methods , bindings , and outlets , much like objects created in Xcode do when added to a project in Interface Builder .
Developers can connect UI elements to these controllers to accept input from the UI and then output results back to the UI .
You can see the power of this in action in a short demo video Boucher created in which he builds a simple RSS feed reader — very similar to NetNewsWire — in seven minutes , without once typing a single line of code .
In addition to the built - in controllers and several common data models , Atlas will integrate a way to easily share and reuse models and controllers that you or others have built .
Though many developers make reusable Cocoa code available in the form of a framework , " frameworks in Cocoa do n't usually come with IB plugins , " Boucher said , " so you ca n't use them directly in IB . "
Further , " there 's no obvious place to share frameworks in the Cocoa world .
We 'd like to learn some lessons from GitHub here and really make sharing code a priority .
We want to make it incredibly easy to make and share these kinds of components from right within Atlas — including a sort of integrated plug - in search mechanism . "
Of course , 280 North eats its own dog food — Atlas is itself a web app built in Cappuccino .
Slated for a summer release , not all the details have been ironed out just yet .
The format and mechanism for adding class plug-ins have n't been fully worked out yet .
How projects will be saved is still up in the air , too — it could involve one or a combination of local storage , cloud - based storage , or a local or remote git repository .
Boucher says these issues will be worked out before the final release .
With Atlas , 280 North is bringing its goal of making web app building easier for developers more familiar with building desktop apps .
With Interface Builder - like layout and drag - and - drop data classes , in some cases it might even be easier than desktop development .
And , since Atlas runs in your browser , you do n't have to leave your IDE to get a preview of how your app runs in a browser .
Depending on your project needs , it may even give desktop tools like Dreamweaver a run for its money .

Mourn for yesterday in the comments section below !
Friends , some former Ron Paul supporters are now being courted by " radicals " stressing a new revolution of working class Americans against Obama and his big business supporters .
www.resistnet.com is one of their biggest voices .
In truth , our heroic gun totin ' woodsmen are actually following Washington DC public relations firm Shirley & Bannister public affairs , a front group for the Bush family and the insurance industry .
The " tough guys " being organized into Milita units to march on Washington DC are being led by a front group funded by Westinghouse Corporation , Prudential Insurance , AETNA Insurance , the DuPont family , the Forbes family , McDonald Douglas , nuclear power plant builders and about a hundred groups made up of Washington lawyers and lobbyists .
What an embarassment .
Organizing all of this " libertarian protest " is the biggest client of all , The Republican National Committee .
The secret is out , you 've been had , duped , snookered and suckered .
I wonder when people get " tired " of being manipulated by the media , and the rich and powerful ?
The Patriotic Resistance
The network for idea - based resistance to Obama - led socialistic agenda this kind of reminds me of when Rumsfeld hired the DC groups to write the " news " for Iraqi newspapers , all propaganda all the time .
This site actually claims that Glenn Beck muddles their real message and that he is not helping them , WTF ?
These people are a match made in heaven or is that a match made on K street ?
The list I had posted here does not match their website
Here is the website for Shirley & Banister you should also click on the For media and read the articles they have posted there .
They are not shy .. I will say that for them .
The above is the client list for Shirley & Banister the same people who fund the Republican Party .
President Obama has enough real trouble in the world without the " wing nuts " being spoon fed pablum by " patriotic Americans " being whipped into a frenzy by people like these from the back rooms of Washington DC and New York , these are the same people pushing the idea that " President Obama is going to comfiscate their guns " and put everyone into " Fema detention camps " etc .
They also push the " Tea Party " idea quite fervently on this site .
At what point does " free speech " become " incite to riot " where does the line get drawn ?
They are not yelling the " building is on fire " but this comes awfully close .
Do these companies and groups that do business with Shirley and Banister really want to be associated with this type of work ?

( CNN ) --
A legal advocacy group sued the federal government Tuesday , seeking benefits for 15 gay and lesbian Massachusetts residents who wed after the state legalized same - sex marriage .
A lawsuit contends the federal government is denying benefits to Massachusetts same - sex couples .
Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders -- the same Boston - based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same - sex marriage rights in Massachusetts -- filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Boston on behalf of six couples and three men whose husbands have died .
The suit contends the federal Defense of Marriage Act denies them protections and benefits that heterosexual couples receive , including health insurance for federal employees , the ability to file as " married filing jointly " on federal income taxes and Social Security spousal protections .
Two other couples plan to file suit after they receive an anticipated rejection of their amended tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service , GLAD said .
President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996 .
It effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same - sex unions by defining marriage as " a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife " and a spouse as " a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife . "
GLAD 's suit addresses only Section 3 of the law , a portion that prevents the federal government from giving Social Security and other protections to same - sex married couples .
GLAD says there are 1,138 federal laws in which marital status is a factor .
Only Massachusetts and Connecticut allow same - sex marriage .
Vermont , New Jersey and New Hampshire allow civil unions .
One of the plaintiffs in the suit is Dean Hara , who was married to former U.S. Rep. Gerry E. Studds , the first openly gay member of Congress .
The two legally married in 2004 , a week after Massachusetts began issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples .
Studds , who by then had retired from politics , died in October 2006 .
" Gerry was a public servant for 27 years , worked hard for our country and paid as much into the system as anyone else , " Hara , 51 , said , according to the GLAD Web site .
" But after he died , I was treated differently than other surviving spouses .
Every federal employee counts on their surviving spouses having basic protections , but the federal government denies me those protections because of DOMA . "
Other plaintiffs include state trooper Sgt. Mary Ritchie and her spouse , Kathy Bush .
They said not being able to file federal taxes jointly denies them deductions afforded to heterosexual married couples .
" We work hard , pay taxes , volunteer and do our part for our community .
But the federal government still tells us we 're less of a family than other families in our neighborhood -- families Mary works to protect , " Bush said , according to the GLAD Web site .
Others named in the suit include a postal worker who has n't been allowed to add her spouse to her health plan , a widower who has n't been able to collect his spouse 's Social Security payments and a Social Security Administration retiree who is denied health insurance for his spouse .
The United States of America and several federal agencies are named as defendants .
All About Same - Sex Marriage • Massachusetts
Fans of the Lord of the Rings who have not yet had their fill of cinematic Middle - earth should make a date for Sunday 3 May at 4 pm ( UK time ) , when the internet and the Sci-Fi-London festival will simultaneously host the premiere of The Hunt for Gollum - a " film for fans by fans " knocked together for just 3,000 quid :
Hunt For Gollum - Trailer One
by HuntForGollum
According to the BBC , the film is set between The Hobbit and the Fellowship of the Ring , and " tells the story of Aragorn as he sets out to discover the truth about the Ring " .
Writer and director Chris Bouchard explained that , with the blessing of Tolkien Enterprises ( as long as the project was non-profit , natch ) , he set about recruiting a vast cast of volunteers - including 160 credited crew and 60 who worked on visual effects alone .
Regarding cash , Bouchard said : " The budget for Gollum all went on costumes props and various bits of equipment and food .
We nailed it right down to the bare essentials that we could n't get for free , or beg , borrow or steal . "
The director admitted that Peter Jackson 's visual feel for LoTR was " a big inspiration " , as the trailer shows , and described it as " an adventure for us to play in that world that he created " .
Bouchard did n't , though , enjoy New Zealand as a backdrop for Gollum , making do instead with Epping Forest , Hampstead Heath and North Wales .
The BBC has more from Bouchard here , the cast roster is here and the extended production team credits here . ®
Mr Katsav has previously said he wanted to prove his innocence Israel 's ex-President Moshe Katsav is to be charged with sex offences including the rape of a female former employee , the justice ministry says .
Justice officials say the testimony of the women involved is reliable .
Mr Katsav last year called off a plea bargain that would have seen him plead guilty to sexual misconduct but avoid more serious charges .
A spokesman for Mr Katsav , who quit his post in 2007 , says he now welcomes the chance to prove his innocence in court .
The charges relate to accusations by a number of women employees who worked for Mr Katsav while he was tourism minister and president .
The decision to indict him " was made after the attorney general and state prosecutor reached the conclusion that the complainants ' testimony was reliable and that there is sufficient evidence for an indictment " , the justice ministry said .
Justice officials have not said when the indictment will be formally filed .
' Witch - hunt '
The BBC's Tim Franks in Jerusalem says this has been a tortuous legal tale , already lasting nearly three years .
Women 's rights activists protested as Mr Katsav arrived at court last year Under the terms of the proposed plea bargain , prosecutors had agreed not to seek a jail term if Mr Katsav admitted to sexual harassment and indecent acts .
Part of the controversial plea bargain deal was for him to step down as president of Israel , a largely ceremonial role .
He was also supposed to pay damages to his accusers .
The deal was widely criticised in Israel for its leniency , our correspondent says .
But in a surprise move , Mr Katsav withdrew from the deal at a hearing last April , telling the court he wanted to fight for his innocence .
The former president has accused the Israeli media of mounting a politically motivated witch - hunt against him .
Originally , the police charged Mr Katsav with rape , sexual harassment and abuse of power .
Rape convictions in Israel carry a maximum sentence of 16 years in prison .
Mr Katsav was replaced as president by Shimon Peres .

As the Canadian government considers its next move on copyright reform , it would appear that the Canadian Recording Industry Association is readying a grassroots campaign to argue for a repeat of Bill C - 61 .
The following leaked email was widely distributed from an executive at one of the major record labels :
I 'm sure that all of you are aware of the current challenges that we have within our industry around copyright infringement .
What you may not know is that there is a lack of support within our government for laws that are currently in place NOT protecting copyright work .
Virtually every other developed nation in the world has taken one key step to keep peer to peer downloading under control : they have modernized their copyright rules for the digital age .
It is time Canada 's Parliament implement similar , long overdue reforms , in keeping with our country 's commitments under the 1996 WIPO Internet Treaties .
You can make a difference by understanding the current challenging situation , talking to your colleagues about it , and letting your MP know how you feel about this .
Below and attached is a Frequently Asked Question form that can bring you up to speed on the issues and other info that you may not be aware of .
Take a minute to review , and then please follow up by sending an email to your MP if you feel that music and these matters are important to you .
In addition to the email message , or as an alternative , please write a letter or call your MP and the Heritage and Industry Ministers .
The letter then lists the addresses for Industry Minister Tony Clement and Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore along with links to a series of supportive organizations and a non-functioning link to a Copyright FAQ that is currently hosted at Universal Music ( but indicating that the source is CRIA ) .
While the industry may face some challenges in generating a major grassroots campaign demanding a Canadian DMCA , more important is their planned Copyright FAQ which unsurprisingly tells only one side of the story .
There are no questions about the robust copyright collective system in Canada , private copying , the Songwriters proposal , the CMCC , the effectiveness of notice - and - notice to address online infringement , etc .
Instead , the FAQ states [ with commentary in brackets from me ] :
Copyright Reform FAQ
Q : What is Copyright ?
A : Copyright is the right held by the creator of a literary work , musical work , artistic work or software to decide how that work should be reproduced and made available to the public .
It is the foundation upon which the copyright industries – and the jobs they support – is built .
[ according to the Supreme Court of Canada , it is also a law that seeks to strike a balance between creators rights and users rights .
The effects of copyright extend well beyond just the " copyright industries . " ]
Q : Why is copyright important ?
A : Copyright is important because it provides the creator of a work with the same basic rights as an owner of physical property , including the right to determine the selling price and the right to protection from theft .
By protecting a creator ’s rights , copyright also promotes innovation and progress in science and the arts .
[ the balance is also important to ensure appropriate access , new creativity , and enough flexibility within the law to ensure new innovative business models ]
Q : What is piracy ?
A : Piracy is the unauthorized distribution or acquisition of a copyrighted work , such as commonly takes place through online peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file sharing and CD counterfeiting .
Piracy is akin to shoplifting – both involve taking property without authorization .
[ There is considerable literature highlighting the differences between copyright infringement and physical theft .
Further , Canadian law includes a private copying levy that raises doubts about whether there is any infringement taking place for personal , non-commercial downloading . ]
Q : Who does piracy affect ?
A : Piracy affects everyone including YOU – regardless of whether you work in a copyright - related industry .
Piracy undercuts sales , profits and tax revenues .
Investment in new creations is deterred , undermining innovation and artistic development .
All too often , businesses are forced to close and jobs are lost .
[ There has been little evidence in Canada about reduced investment due to the current copyright law .
Indeed , it is arguably the lack of flexibility within the Copyright
Act that has deterred new investment in new businesses , who have been unable to rely on a robust fair dealing provision .
Moreover , with the industry abandoning DRM , the claim that anti-circumvention legislation is crucial to new investment is just not credible . ]
Q : Does copyright piracy put your job at risk ?
A : Yes .
Canadians who work in the copyright - related industries have seen numerous job losses – from the artists who create music to truck drivers who deliver CDs and DVDs to retailers .
Since the advent of widespread P2P file sharing 10 years ago , retail sales of music have declined by more than half ; this has forced ongoing job reductions and slashed funds available for Canadian artist development .
It is not only the music industry that is affected .
For example , a Business Software Alliance study found that a reduction of software piracy in Canada by 10 % over the next four years could generate more than 5,200 high - skilled jobs and inject $ 2.7 billion into the economy .
[ Loss of jobs for truck drivers who deliver CDs and DVDs is about a move to digital distribution , not infringement .
Further , there is plenty of debate over the sources of declining CD sales , including an Industry Canada funded study that found a positive correlation between file sharing and music purchasing . ]
Q : Aside from jobs , how does piracy affect music in Canada ?
A : With much less money available today to invest in and support new artists , Canada ’s leading place in the music world is slipping .
As John Kennedy , the Chairman and CEO of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) pointed out recently , “ Canada is now punching below its weight ” on the world music stage .
As reported in Billboard , Kennedy “ noted that according to Nielsen Soundscan , only two of the Top 20 selling albums in Canada – Nickelback and Quebec ’s Lost Fingers – were created by domestic acts . ”
In addition , Canada has seen no significant new digital services introduced over the past year , in contrast with the flurry of innovations seen in other countries .
This undercuts the development of digital music here – badly needed at a time of declining CD sales .
Without a modern , robust copyright regime , companies are unwilling to invest in innovative new digital services in this country .
[ Digital music sales have grown faster in Canada than in the United States for each of the past three years .
Some services like the now - defunct SpiralFrog used Canada as the host for their pilot before launching in the U.S.
There is simply no evidence that the absence of anti-circumvention legislation is viewed as a major deterrent to launching new Canadian services .
With regard to investment in new artists , programs such as FACTOR play a key role in funding artists , not U.S. backed labels . ]
Q : Does piracy affect Canada more than other countries ?
A : Yes .
A 2005 study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) found that Canada ’s per capita rate of peer - to - peer downloading was the highest among OECD countries .
This directly reflects Canada ’s failure to modernize its copyright rules for the Internet age , unlike other developed nations .
Many countries in Europe , Asia and elsewhere implemented this basic step several years ago .
[ While the OECD study showed Canada as slightly higher per capita use than the U.S. , it made no conclusions about infringing activity , particularly given the legitimate uses of P2P and the existence of the private copying levy in Canada .
Moreover , the copyright reform advocated by CRIA focuses on protecting digital locks , not addressing P2P activity . ]
Q : What was Bill C - 61 ?
A : Bill C - 61 was copyright reform legislation introduced in Parliament last year .
It set out to modernize Canada ’s Copyright Act to accommodate today ’s digital technologies , and to address the widespread piracy of copyrighted works .
The bill , which died on the Order Paper when an election was called , would have brought Canada ’s copyright rules closer in line with those of other developed nations .
Its passage would have signaled to Canadians that Internet piracy is unacceptable under law .
[ Bill C - 61 also would have created enormous problems for consumers , educators , librarians , researchers , artists , and millions of Canadians who would suffer a loss of rights over their personal property and restrictions on their ability to create and interact with digital media . ]
Q : Is copyright reform costly to implement ?
A : No .
In fact , copyright reform can be implemented at no cost to taxpayers – in sharp contrast with recent government measures to stimulate the economy .
[ While there may be limited cost to government , the cost to consumers and innovative businesses facing new restrictions would have been very significant . ]
Q : What about the concerns raised by bloggers ?
A : Some bloggers and academics argue against copyright reforms , citing such concerns as lawsuits and privacy considerations .
But these arguments are without merit .
For example , on lawsuits , the major labels in Canada have stated clearly that there is no intention to sue fans .
It is simply not an issue .
On privacy , Canadian law already offers strong protections , and there is nothing in copyright reform that would affect that .
[ " Bloggers and academics " do not argue against copyright reforms , but rather against DMCA - style , unbalanced reforms .
There is support for a fair , balanced approach that does not eliminate fair dealing in the digital environment and that addresses ongoing consumer concerns with the current law .
Fears about lawsuits and privacy are only a small part of the concerns , which extend to education , consumer rights , research , free speech , and creativity .
Moreover , concerns over privacy are not limited to bloggers and academics , but also include privacy commissioners . ]
Q : Do artists support copyright reforms ?
A : Yes .
ACTRA and AFM Canada , leading organizations that represent tens of thousands of Canadian artists , fully support copyright reform .
Their support is based on the best interests of their members .
To see what some artists have to say , click here .
[ But many artists do not .
The Canadian Music Creators Coalition , which includes some of Canada 's best known musicians , argue against these reforms .
Moreover , the Songwriters Association of Canada has argued for a different approach on P2P and acknowledged that reforms based on protecting DRM are bound to fail . ]
Q : Why has the Canadian government been so slow to reform copyright rules ?
A : Given the explosion of piracy in Canada , the lost jobs , the success of copyright reforms passed by many other countries years ago , and our government ’s longstanding but unfulfilled international treaty commitments , the delays defy explanation or excuse .
As IFPI ’s John Kennedy recently said at Canadian Music Week ( as reported by Billboard ) : “ The lack of interest in intellectual property by the Canadian government is truly astonishing . ”
What is clear is that the Canadian government needs to hear from voters like you that further delays are unacceptable .
Your local MP needs to know that your patience is running out , and that legal reforms are needed now to stem job losses and provide new opportunities for Canada ’s music industry .
[ The long Canadian process reflects many things , some political ( string of minority governments ) and some substantive .
It is the substantive doubts about DMCA style reforms that are most relevant , since they reflect the view – shared by the creator of the DMCA – that the policies have been a failure .
What is unacceptable are not the delays , but rather caving to pressure to enact reforms that would cause harm to millions of Canadians while doing virtually nothing to support Canadian artists . ]
Q : What can I do to help ?
A : Contact your Member of Parliament to let them know that you think copyright is important and to ask that they prioritize the passage of appropriate copyright reform legislation .
It will take you no more than a minute or two to send an email to your MP , and just a few more minutes to write a letter .
Ask family , friends and colleagues to do the same .
[ We agree on this .
My 30 Things You Can Do remains relevant ( albeit a bit outdated for contact information ) – Canadians should contact their MPs and urge them to ensure that any new reforms strike the right balance . ]
When my partner and I had our wedding ceremony seven years ago we did it in a church .
We stood in front of a preacher and said our vows before our friends , some family , and our God .
Despite the religious trappings of our ceremony , I do n't believe that same - gender marriage is ultimately a religious issue .
Ironically , since my partner and I cannot be married in the eyes of the secular state , a church wedding is the only option currently available to us .
Those who shout , " It 's Adam and Eve , not Adam and Steve ! " and claim the creation story as their basis for a religious , heterosexuals - only , marriage rite , need to brush up on their history .
My brother made this argument to me once until I asked , " Who was the scribe in the garden ? "
He stared at me and changed the subject .
Adam and Eve is but one story of creation – all religions have one and not one of them comes from an eyewitness who was there taking notes .
Marriage is read back into the story of Adam and Eve , but marriage was occurring long before the story was finally written down .
That means society created marriage – not God .
The original purpose of marriage has changed over the millennia .
The one thing it did n't have originally ?
Religion .
Marriage was invented for the proper distribution of property – meaning land and other chattel which included the women involved in the marriage .
Marriages were for the convenience of the men , not the women .
Marriages were arranged to enlarge property holdings – to join two or more families who wanted to enlarge their wealth .
Love had little , if anything , to do with these unions .
Marriages prevented just any old bastard from coming along and asserting rights to the property of a man he may claim to call " daddy . "
The early church knew that marriage was a man-made , civil institution and wanted little to do with it , according to EJ Graff in What is Marriage For ? ( p 195 ) :
When asked , some priests might come by and say a blessing as a favour , just as they 'd say a blessing over a child 's first haircut .
No one considered marriage sacred , as celibacy was : marriage was one of those secular and earthbound forms rendered unto Caesar .
It was n't until 1215 that the church declared marriage a sacrament and set up a system of canon law around it .
So do n't be fooled by those who claim God invented marriage – it took centuries for the church to put its claim on it .
It 's certainly true that historically marriage has always been between men and women .
But , before 1967 in the United States , marriage was only between men and women of the same race .
In the world of the ancient Hebrews , marriage was often between one man and many women .
Marriage has changed over the centuries , as it should , since marriage was created to fill a societal need – not a religious one – and marriage must adapt to society 's ongoing needs .
Marriage serves society , not the other way around .
A new need has arisen in our time – the need for legal , governmental recognition and protection of two people of the same gender .
Religion has absolutely nothing to do with that .
Space shuttle Discovery roars off Launch Pad 39A on the STS - 119 mission atop twin towers of fire that light up the sky after sunset at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
Liftoff was on time at 7:43 p.m. EDT on March 15 , 2009 .
CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla . - A Japanese astronaut is usheringhis country into the realm of endurance spaceflight as Japan ?s first long - termresident on the International Space Station after rocketing into space aboardNASA 's space shuttle Discovery late Sunday .
Koichi Wakata , a veteran spaceflyer with the JapanAerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) , is riding toward his new orbital home for the next three months , where he willserve as an Expedition 18 flight engineer .
" This mission is a giant leap for the Japanesemanned space activity program , " JAXA vice president Yukihide Hayashi saidthrough a translator at briefing here at NASA ?s Kennedy Space Center afterlaunch .
" It will accumulate valuable knowledge and experience for thefuture Japanese space and aviation program . "
Wakata was one of seven astronauts , led by commander LeeArchambault , to launch aboard Discovery 's STS - 119 mission tonight .
The spacecraft lifted off in a purple twilight sky at 7:43 p.m.EDT ( 2343 GMT ) from the seaside pad here .
" I 've seen a lot of launches ?
this was the mostvisually beautiful launch I have ever seen , " said NASA shuttle launchdirector Mike Leinbach .
" It was just spectacular .
When the orbiter and thetank and boosters got up into the sunlight , that had just set about 10 minutesprior , it was just gorgeous . "
The shuttle lifted off to " perfect " weatherconditions , U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Barrett of the 45thWeather Squadron said .
About two hours before Discovery 's liftoff , shuttleweather officers upgraded the forecast from an 80 percent to 100 percent chanceof favorable weather conditions for launch .
The launch went smoothly , in contrast to a series ofglitches that have kept Discovery grounded for more than a month past itsoriginal launch date .
" I think when we work a little extra hard to get tothe launch I think it 's even a little sweeter when the launch actuallyoccurs , " said Bill Gerstenmaier , NASA ?s associate administrator for spaceoperations .
" I think this just worked out really wonderful . "
A small fruit bat that fell asleep on the side of the shuttle ' sexternal tank this morning apparently held on throughout Discovery 's liftoff .
" We had a bat that was on the side of the externaltank , " Leinbach said .
" We characterize him as unexpected debris , andhe 's probably still unexpected debris somewhere . "
Discovery is carrying a huge girder to complete the spacestation 's backbone truss , and the final set of solar arrays to power theorbital outpost .
After dropping off Wakata at the station , Discovery will ferryhis predecessor , NASA astronaut Sandra Magnus , home .
The nation of Japan will be following this missionclosely , eager for their countryman to live onboard the space station and useits largest laboratory , the Japanese - built Kibo module , which was installedlast May .
" So many Japanese people are very , very happy andwatching Mr. Wakata 's successful flight , " Hayashi said .
" The meaningof this mission for the Japanese people is that this marks the very firstlong - stay mission by the Japanese astronauts .
It is very , very meaningful forthe Japanese manned space program . "

So ends one of the confessions on a website where people addicted to the computer game World of Warcraft seek support .
Known to be particularly habit - forming , World of Warcraft launches players on elaborate adventures in a virtual universe , often in the company of buddies that they meet inside the game .
In some cases , players become so invested in their virtual lives that they lose jobs , stop showering , or rig up impromptu " toilets " near their computers .
Dr. Jerald Block , a psychiatrist in Portland , Ore. , specializes in treating those who 've spent years living as warlocks , ogres , or spaceship commanders .
He believes that psychiatry needs to do a lot of catching up in order to understand why people get stuck in games like Warcraft .
One problem :
Most therapists have no idea what a " guild " is or what it means to hit Level 60 .
Because of this language barrier , many gamers wind up begging for help in online support groups rather than seeking out mental health professionals .
Recently , Block published an editorial in the American Journal of Psychiatry arguing that " Internet Addiction " should become a new diagnostic term .
IDEAS : Describe the people who walk into your office .
What does a computer compulsion look like ?
BLOCK : Some people come in for trouble with Internet porn .
But the computer gamers tend to be harder to treat .
People feel a lot of shame around computer games .
Whereas , it 's socially acceptable to have a porn problem .
IDEAS : You can't be serious .
You mean your clients are more ashamed of ...
BLOCK : ... playing World of Warcraft than looking at porn .
Yes .
IDEAS : Why ?
BLOCK : As a society we understand that porn is something people do , and you can see a psychiatrist and get treated for it .
But gaming is hard to describe to anyone else .
So these people can't explain their situation to friends .
In fact , it 's hard to give you an example of what my clients talk about , because gaming is enormously complicated .
IDEAS : Well , give it a try .
BLOCK : OK , there was a man engaged in a game called Eve Online .
He was one of the most powerful characters in the universe of this game .
He had played for years and accumulated great wealth ; he would have been worth about $ 17,000 if he sold his character and all his virtual assets on eBay .
Well , within the game someone took out a contract on his life .
And in the span of one night , this guy lost thousands of dollars , lost his alter ego , and was betrayed by everyone he knew in this world .
Until November , Lisa Traina had a classic New York glamour job : organizing private parties in the Art Deco opulence of the Rainbow Room .
Now she spends 10 - hour shifts walking down gritty sidewalks trying to persuade homeless people to go to the Bowery Mission for food and shelter .
“ I worked at the top of the world , ” she said .
“ And the next day you ’re working down on Broadway and saying to somebody , ‘ Let me show you where you can get a bowl of soup for the night . ’ ”
After being laid off , Ms. Traina , 50 , enlisted in the growing army of the newly unemployed that have been marching into the offices of nonprofit organizations since the recession hit , looking to do some good , maybe network a little or simply fill the hours they used to be at the office .
They have searched for tasks on volunteernyc.org  which last month had 30 percent more visitors than in February 2008  and forced New York Cares , an umbrella organization , to add extra new - volunteer orientations at a Whole Foods Market downtown that quickly booked solid an unheard - of three weeks in advance .
In Philadelphia , Big Brothers Big Sisters has seen a 25 percent increase in inquiries from potential mentors over this time last year .
And the Taproot Foundation , a San Francisco - based organization that places skilled professionals in volunteer positions , had more people sign up on one day earlier this year than in an entire month a year ago .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In another sign of just how far the U.S. auto industry has fallen , this is likely to be the first year since 1945 when the number of new cars bought will be less than the number of cars turned in to the junk yard .
Auto industry research firm R.L.
Polk is forecasting a drop in total auto registrations for the first time since car plants were busy turning out tanks for World War II .
This time it 's economic distress and tight credit keeping purchases down .
There could be nearly a 4 million vehicle drop in the number of registrations during the 12 - months ending June 30 , the period during which Polk tracks those figures .
That 's 1.6 % of the total fleet of cars and light trucks that had been on the road as of July 1 2008 , just before the bottom fell out of the new car market .
There were about 14 million cars taken off the road in the 12 months ending last June .
During the same period auto sales fell 7 % in the face of high gas prices , but still came in at 15.3 million .
But with sales now down to about a 10 million annual sales pace , a decline in the number of vehicles on the road is almost inevitable .
The automakers think this could be a sign that the worst may almost be over .
With sales falling so far below the number of vehicles being scrapped , there is pent - up demand that should help lead to at least a modest rebound in sales in the months or years ahead .
Mike DiGiovanni , the head of sales analysis for General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , said earlier this month that people driving older and older cars will eventually find that they need to replace them -- and this could lead to a modest rebound in sales .
" It 's going to eventually be a pressure point that will lift the industry , " he said .
But others think that the fact that auto sales outpaced those junked for so many years means there was an excess supply of vehicles on the roads .
Dave Goebel , a consultant for Polk , does n't buy that the drop in the number of vehicles on the road is a sign of pent - up demand .
Instead , he thinks it is further bad news for the battered industry .
Goebel said extra vehicle purchases in recent years were driven by increases in consumers ' wealth during the housing boom and bull years for the stock markets .
Before those bubbles burst , it was easier for families to justify having more cars , either for teen drivers or for weekend use .
" Now people have decided we 've got to get back to basics .
We have three cars in the driveway .
We need to go back to having two , " he said .
Joe Barker , head of North American sales forecasting at auto consultant CSM , agrees that people will be getting by with fewer cars in the coming years .
He said the increased level of job losses this year is not only making it harder for people to buy a car , it also is reducing the need for new vehicles .
" As unemployment keeps rising , there are fewer people who need transportation for work , " he said .
Barker added that with economic uncertainty and credit being as tight as it is , many potential buyers will continue to sit on the sidelines .
" The trend we 'll likely see for the next 12 - 18 months is a greater mix of buyers with the necessity to buy , rather than just the desire to buy , " he said .
Still , Barker does agree with DiGiovanni that there is some pent - up demand building for cars , even though it may not be enough to lift auto sales in the near term .
His firm is forecasting only 9.7 million new car sales this year , but thinks that sales could rise as high as 14 million vehicles in 2011 due to replacement demand .
Barker said even if more car owners looking to get rid of an old vehicle buy a used car instead of a new one , that will help lift new car sales down the road .
That 's because increased demand for used cars would lift their value .
And that could lead some car owners , especially rental car companies , to sell older vehicles in order to buy new cars .
But even with this pent - up demand , DiGiovanni said he is not expecting sales to return to levels from earlier this decade anytime soon .
" Cars were a bubble just like the housing market was a bubble , " he said .
" That 's going to depress demand in subsequent years . "
M ARCUS A NNIUS V ERUS was born in Rome , A. D. 121 , and assumed the name of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus , by which he is known to history , on his adoption by the Emperor T. Aurelius Antoninus .
He succeeded to the imperial throne in 161 , and ruled till his death in 180 .
His reign , though marked by justice and moderation at home , was troubled by constant warfare on the frontiers of the Empire , and Aurelius spent much of his later years in the uncongenial task of commanding armies that no longer proved irresistible against the barbarian hordes .
1
M. Aurelius was educated by the orator Fronto , but turned aside from rhetoric to the study of the Stoic philosophy , of which he was the last distinguished representative .
The “ Meditations , ” which he wrote in Greek , are among the most noteworthy expressions of this system , and exhibit it favorably on its practical side .
His own precepts he carried out with singular consistency ; and both in his public and his private life he was in the highest degree conscientious .
He and his predecessor are noted as the only Roman emperors who can be said to have ruled with a single eye to the welfare of their subjects .
2
During his reign
Rome was visited by a severe pestilence , and this , with reverses suffered by his armies , threw the populace into a panic , and led them to demand the sacrifice of the Christians , whom they regarded as having brought down the anger of the gods .
Aurelius seems to have shared the panic ; and his record it stained by his sanction of a cruel persecution .
This incident in the career of the last , and one of the loftiest , of the pagan moralists may be regarded as symbolic of the dying effort of heathenism to check the advancing tide of Christianity .

The White House has finally stopped denying that bankruptcy may be inevitable for General Motors ( GM ) and the other car makers .
Hopefully , with a good debtor - in - possession deal , it can save the tens of billions the previous administration shoveled down Detroit 's maw .
FT : The White House said it was still considering a request from GM and Chrysler for billions of dollars of more federal aid but refused to rule out bankruptcy for the companies .
“ Whether the auto industry as we have it now is exactly what we have in a year is something I think is going to be determined by a lot of different factors , ” said Robert Gibbs , White House press secretary .
GM on Friday sought to push back against reports that it had become more open to filing for bankruptcy , insisting that “ restructuring the business out of court remains the best solution ” .
Doubts about GM ’s future were heightened on Thursday when the company acknowledged in a regulatory filing that it might not be able to avoid bankruptcy even with more government support .

GM , meanwhile , says that when its auditor said it might go bankrupt , it did n't really mean it .
Apple has apologized for breaking Perl with its latest Mac OS X security update , saying it will distribute a solution to the problem with a future update .
In a note to The Reg and a post to the Apple support forums , Senior Apple programmer Edward Moy apologized for " the unforeseen problems that the 2009 - 001 security update has caused " with Perl .
After the release of 2009 - 001 in mid-February , developers from across the web complained that after installing the update , many of their Perl scripts quit running .
" I 've just done the update using Software update and just about everything I look at is working , except that perl seems to have gone almost AWOL , " said one Mac OS X user , with a post to the support forum .
" I 've seen it pop up occasionally in the Activity Monitor , but when I try to run perl scripts from the command line or the cron jobs that ran flawlessly before the update , nothing happens .
Period . "
One IT consultant even went so far as to say " Because of these kinds of problems , I stopped recommending Apple Servers to my enterprise customers . "
According to one blogger , the problem only occurs if you 're running Leopard ( Mac OS X 10.5 ) , you 're using the Perl distro that comes with the OS , and you 've updated the distro via CPAN ( Comprehensive Perl Archive Network ) , a widely - used collection of existing Perl modules .
Apple 's
Moy says the problem is due to the way Perl orders its module directory search path : the system Perl directory comes before site - specific directories ( e.g. / System / Library / Perl/5.8.8 ) .
" This means that if you try to update a module in the system perl directory by installing it in a site - specific directory like you normally would any other perl module , the search path order would result in the old module being found first , " he writes .
" So , the only way to do this kind of update is to directly overwrite the module in the system perl directory . "
In other words , using CPAN to update Perl modules tweaks the system directory , and if you 've installed Apple 's latest security update , this could cause a problem .
Some system Perl modules use both a Perl ( . pm ) file and a binary ( . bundle ) file .
With many of these modules , Moy says , Apple 's new security update installs the original versions of . bundle files ( complete with security fixes ) without updating their matching .pm files ( security fixes were required ) .
So , when a newer version .pm file tries to load an older version . bundle file installed by the 2009 - 001 security update , your get a failure .
At this point , the only solution is to reinstall the affected module .
But Moy says
Apple is hard at work on a broader fix , and the company intends to include such a fix with a future software update . ®
On Friday , the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung ( SZ ) leaked a bombshell – a confidential report by Bafin , the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority , found that German banks were sitting on over 800 billion euros in toxic assets .
Just three months ago , the reports coming out suggested the problem was only half as large , 400 billion euros .
This new account has been all over the news in Germany because Germans are becoming quite frightened about the health of their banking system and are angry because the German economy was largely absent from the bubbles of the past decade .
Germans are beginning to ask quite openly why banks like Commerzbank and the state - owned land banks as well as institutions like Hypo Real Estate are being rescued with taxpayer money .
This is a debate now ongoing in a number of countries , the U.S. , the U.K. and Ireland most prominent among them .
In an election year in Germany , this issue is sure to have an impact .
The account in SZ reads as follows ( my translation ) :
Giant Billion euro risk :
The financial crisis has hit German banks far harder than was previously known .
Loans and securities in problem areas add up to 816 billion euros , according to a Bafin paper made available to the Süddeutsche Zeitung .
The financial crisis has hit German banks significantly harder than was previously known .
This news comes from an internal study from the Financial Supervisor Bafin .
The paper first gives an overview of which loans and securities institutions own in the problem lines of business .
Their risk adds up to 816 billion euros .
Particularly affected are HRE , several Landesbanken Bank and Commerzbank .
At Commerzbank alone , according to the Bafin study available to the Süddeutsche Zeitung , there are securities and loans worth 101 billion euros affected by the financial crisis .
This includes 49 billion euros from the balance sheet of the acquired Dresdner Bank .
Commerzbank is , thus , similarly affected by the financial crisis as the Land Bank of Hamburg and Schleswig - Holstein , HSH Nordbank , for which Bafin tallies 105 billion euros .
In Westdeutsche Landesbank with 84 billion euros and the Landesbank Baden - Württemberg with 92 billion euros , the supervisors see risks of a similar magnitude .
Much better are Deutsche Bank with 21 billion euros , as well as Postbank and Hypovereinsbank with five billion euros each .
The worst according to the Bafin paper , prior to nationalization , is Hypo Real Estate ( HRE ) , which holds 268 billion euros in problem assets .
Banks back out bill Most of the 17 listed banks reject the figures as misleading .
“ We do not know who put the figures together and they cannot be verified , ” said a spokesman for Commerzbank .
HSH Nordbank said the bank auditors and Rescue Fund Soffin of HSH had sufficiently and adequately accounted for losses .
Other institutions have referred to figures in their annual reports or that they had secured the facilities .
Commerzbank has received state aid of 18.2 billion euros to date .
In its annual report the Bank itself had broken down risks and pointed to other “ significant liabilities ” that threatened different areas of the securities and credit business .
However , among banks , investors and supervisors it is still controversial as to which paper can be understood as junk .
A Bafin spokeswoman said to SZ , that the figures do not deal with actual or potential losses .
The data also could not be used “ to draw conclusions about the creditworthiness of banks . ”
Study of great significance
The internal study is of great importance for the government .
The calculations by Bafin flow into the plans for the establishment of so - called Bad Banks — repository institutions for problem assets .
According to the plans of the Ministry of Finance , only about one third of the assets listed in the document will come into question for removal into a bad bank .
The government wants , with the help the Bad Banks , to restore the function of financial markets and lay the foundation for a rebound .
The figures from Bafin , are , therefore , no surprise for the government .
Even in the documents that Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück had sent Chancellor Angela Merkel weeks before for the preparation of the banking summit on Tuesday , there was talk of 853 billion euros of potentially vulnerable assets .
These figures from the beginning of the year , are no longer deemed up - to - date .
The paper cites a new measurement date , the 26th of February .
This account should make clear how shaky many of Germany ’s financial institutions are .
Moreover , it is not altogether obvious which markets are deemed ‘ toxic . ’
German banks have a lot of residential real estate - related paper .
But they also have assets related to the imploding European commercial property market and the Eastern European property markets .
I suspect that the problem is even larger than is mentioned here .
If you recall , there was a big dust - up in February over a leaked EU document which suggested there were 16.3 trillion in toxic assets amongst European banks .
In my view , the Europeans have their heads in the sand regarding the magnitude of the problem .
The banking situation is much worse on the continent than its citizens are led by government to believe .
In any event , Bafin is now seeking to obtain prosecutions for the damaging leak .

In my previous essay about proteins - as - design - material , I noted :
This all raises some interesting questions .
For example , without proteins , and their manufacturing process , what becomes of the blind watchmaker ?
Without proteins , and the latent functions contained within , might not the blind watchmaker exist as the impotent , crippled , blind watchmaker with no one to notice its existence ?
If so , how much credit does the blind watchmaker really deserve ?
The vast and immense Tree of Life is a protein - dependent output .
Point to some evidence of evolution and I ’ll point to the proteins that underlie it .
Without proteins , would there be a Tree of Life 3.5 billion years after the RNA world took root ?
How do we know ?
If we believe so , would the Tree be as immense and vast as it is today ?
A life form composed of nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and lipids would suffice for the purposes of the blind watchmaker .
But could the blind watchmaker turn this material into something that is analogous to an Ash tree filled with squirrels , beetles , and birds ?
Look at it this way .
What do we need for the blind watchmaker to exist ?
A finite , changing world , something that replicates , and imperfect replication .
The first and the third are givens due to the fabric of Nature .
The second is more iffy .
In living cells , proteins play the key role in replicating things ( they replicate the DNA , they divide the cell , and coordinate both ) .
But if we entertain the notion of an RNA world , the proteins are not needed for replication ( then again , proteins are not needed for chemical reactions to take place ) .
But what the proteins do is amplify and enhance this replication property , and thus enhance the blind watchmaker ’s abilities .
What ’s more , the same molecule that enhances replication also opens up a whole vast world of phenotypes not available to the blind watchmaker earlier .
You can almost think of proteins are a form of tech material designed to exploit and prop up the blind watchmaker .
And maybe even give the blind watchmaker a little guidance .
LIMITING A DESIGNER
To what degree is the design of a designer constrained by his / her building material ?
For example , imagine that we enlisted the service of the worlds most creative and brilliant engineers and tasked them to design a space craft that will carry men to Mars and back .
Now , let ’s add one constraint – the only material available to the designers is concrete .
Would these brilliant designers be able to meet the design objective ?
Or consider the computer .
Today ’s computers are more sophisticated than computers from the 1950s , allowing people to design programs that allow you and me to communicate with great ease and little cost .
Why is it that programmers seem to be able to do more with computers today than they could in the 1950s ?
Is it because today ’s designers are smarter than yesterday ?
Have new laws of nature been discovered ?
Or does it have something to do with an observation from Hartwell et al .?
An early stored - program computer ( left ) , built around 1950 , used vacuum tubes in logic circuits , whereas modern computers use transistors and silicon wafers ( right ) , but both are based on the same principles .
While I myself am not an engineer , I do know that without the right building materials , I can not design a tree house .
I do not that without the right seeds , I can not design a garden .
Designers are limited and constrained by the building material ( and tools ) that are available to them .
Since natural selection can act as a designer - mimic , it too would share this feature and be subject to similar limitations .
SUMMARY
Let me now summarize some of the observations I have made with my recent focus on proteins and their role in the success of evolution .
Consider the following :
1 . The entire Tree of a Life is a protein - dependent output .
Evidence for evolutionary processes is evidence for a protein - dependent phenomenon .
This calls into question any attempt to extrapolate evidence of this protein - dependent phenomenon to protein - less evolution .
2. Proteins are amazingly diverse building material , capable of performing an immense array of functions .
We know of no other building material that is as versatile .
3 . The immense versatility of proteins is coupled to a single manufacturing process known as translation .
When you couple this with point # 2 , this speaks of an astounding elegance .
4 . There is very no evidence to support the notion that protein - less evolution would be as successful as protein - dependent evolution .
5 . Since designers are limited by their building material ; evolution ( as designer - mimic ) is likewise limited by its building material .
This consideration reinforces the importance of taking a closer look at evolution ’s dependence on protein activity .
ANALYSIS AT A HIGHER RESOLUTION
Since we have been talking about proteins , let ’s back up to say a few things about their building blocks – the amino acids .
Below is a figure of an amino acid .
Note the central carbon atom and how it is covalently bonded with four different groups .
Three of these four groups are always the same in every amino acid used by life : the amino group ( orange box ) , the carboxyl group ( blue box ) , and the hydrogen atom .
The R signifies the side chain , which differs for each amino acid .
Life uses 20 different amino acids , as shown in the table below :
In essence , this is the palette of amino acids that are available to the blind watchmaker .
The different amino acids are broken into different groups because of the chemical properties of the side chains .
Those in orange are the hydrophobic ( oily ) amino acids .
They will be found mostly inside the core of a globular protein as they are most useful in determining the basic shape of the protein surrounded by water .
The others are hydrophilic and can be used to decorate the surface of the protein , allowing for specific interactions with other proteins and molecules inside the cell .
The purple group is negatively charged , the blue is positively charged , and the green is uncharged .
Now I have just argued that the blind watchmaker , like all designers , is limited by the building material that is available .
So we need only ask ourselves a simple question – what if we cut down on the diversity of this palette ?
What if the blind watchmaker only had one member from each color - coded group to work with ?
What if the blind watchmaker had only the amino acids found in any particular color - coding ( only hydrophobics or uncharged hydrophilics , for example ) ?
What of the blind watchmaker only had three amino acids to work with ?
Say arginine , valine , and glycine ?
Or leucine , proline , and aspartate ?
Etc .
Could the blind watchmaker still produce a biosphere as diverse and resilient as that which exists with such scaled down palettes ?
I doubt this very much .
After all , we could continue the thought experiments down to a single amino acid .
Say that only glycine is available .
If all proteins were simply chains of glycine , functional diversity would be gone , as they only thing that would differentiate the polypeptide chains is their length .
Those who would deny that the blind watchmaker is limited by its available building material would be in the absurd position of arguing a palette with one single amino acid would be just as useful as the current pool of 20 amino acids .
Of course , this raises an equally interesting consideration , namely , what if the palette contained many more amino acids , say 30 or 40 ?
Would the blind watchmaker be any more successful ?
Would life contain adaptations and structures that have never been seen on this planet ?
Let ’s now proceed from amino acids to proteins .
To make a protein , we simply covalently link individual amino acids together via a peptide bond .
The figure below shows the formation of a peptide bond .
I ’d like to draw your attention to two things .
First , note that the carboxyl group of one amino acid reacts with the amino group of the second amino acid to form the peptide bond ( highlighted in the orange box ) .
This creates a dipeptide with differing ends .
At the N - terminal end , there is a free amino group and the C- terminal end has a free carboxyl group .
This simply means we can attached a third amino acid to the C- terminal end of the dipeptide with the very same reaction .
And if we can add a third , we can add a fourth .
Etc .
Thus , the structure of the amino acid is perfectly poised to create a growing chain whose length would be determined by factors other than amino acid structure .
We can thus begin to catch a glimpse of one reason why proteins are so versatile , as the relative ease of construction is coupled to an ability to vary the length .
But let us now consider something that is even more interesting .
Notice the two R groups , R1 and R2 .
These represent the side chains of each respective amino acid that we have already briefly discussed above .
What you should notice is that side chains do not participate in the linking of amino acids .
On the contrary , they simply stick out as appendages on the backbone chain of amino and carboxyl groups .
And because they do not participate in this linkage , it means that the sequence of side chains is not chemically determined by the process of polymerization .
In essence , it is programmable .
These exact same themes are represented in nucleic acids , RNA and DNA .
In these cases , the building blocks are more complex and known as nucleotides .
Above is a figure of a nucleotide , showing its three parts : the pentose sugar , a phosphate group , and the nitrogenous base .
The nitrogenous base is the analog of the amino acid ’s side chain , only this time there are four types : uracil ( U ) , guanine ( G ) , cytosine ( C ) , and adenine ( A ) in RNA and thymine ( T ) , guanine ( G ) , cytosine ( C ) , and adenine ( A ) in DNA .
The nucleotides are linked together into a chain through interactions between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the sugar of an adjacent nucleotide .
We ’ll call this covalent bond the sugar - phosphate bond and the resulting chain is shown in the following figure :
Notice that as with proteins , the ends are different .
The top end contains a free phosphate group and is called the 5 ’ end ( because that phosphate group is bonded to the 5 ’ carbon of the sugar ) .
The bottom end with the exposed sugar is called the 3 ’ end .
To grow the strand , we need to attach a fourth nucleotide to the 3 ’ end .
Thus , the structure of the more complex nucleotide is perfectly poised to create a growing chain whose length would be determined by factors other than nucleotide structure .
But notice also the way the nitrogenous bases mimic the R groups of amino acids : they do not participate in the formation of the sugar - phosphate bond .
On the contrary , they simply stick out as appendages on the sugar - phosphate backbone .
And because they do not participate in this linkage , it means that the sequence of nitrogenous bases is not chemically determined by the process of polymerization .
In essence , it is programmable .
Thus , what we have is a profound conceptual similarity between two unrelated molecules .
It is this similarity in basic format that will allow the nucleic acids to encode the amino acid sequence of a protein .
We ’ve seen that a protein is formed by covalently linking amino acids , yet in a fashion where the diverse side chains do not participate in this binding .
This frees them to function elsewhere .
So what do the side - chains do ?
In short , they interact with each other .
Through electrostatic interactions , they fold most proteins into a compact , globular shape and it is the shape that is at the very heart of protein function ( if you disrupt the shape , you disrupt the function ) .
What I ’d like to do now is impress upon you the very brilliance of this design , as it goes a very long way in explaining why proteins have been so useful for evolution .
What you have here is a strategy that links subunits by covalent bonds , but the folding , and thus function , is determined by forces much weaker than covalent bonds .
As Joachim Pietzsch notes ,
the folding of a protein is not a chemical reaction , with a bond breaking here and a new one forming there .
It is more like the weaving of an intertwined molecular pattern , the stability of which is defined by innumerable forces between atoms .
In his classic book , Chance and Necessity , Jacques Monod explores the implications in more detail as he explores the difference in activation energy when forming covalent bonds and noncovalent bonds :
Simplifying somewhat , and specifying that we are now considering only those reactions occurring in aqueous phase , we may say that the average amount of energy absorbed or liberated by a reaction involving covalent bonds is on the order of 5 to 20 Kcal per bond .
For a reaction involving noncovalent bonds only , the average amount of energy would be between 1 and 2 Kcal .
This considerable difference partially accounts for the difference in stability between covalent and noncovalent chemical constructs .
The essential , however , lies not there but in the differences in the so - called activation energies brought into play in the two types of interactions . [….]
Now - and this is the crucial point – in general : a .
The activation energy of covalent reactions is high ; their speed is therefore very slow or zero at low temperatures and in the absence of catalysts ; while b.
The activation energy of noncovalent reactions is very low if not zero ; they therefore occur spontaneously and very rapidly , at low temperature , and in the absence of catalysts .
The result is that structures defined by noncovalent interactions can attain a certain stability only if they entail multiple interactions .
Furthermore , noncovalent interactions acquire a notable amount of energy only when atoms lie a very short distance apart , practically “ touching ” one another .
Consequently two molecules ( or areas of molecules ) will be able to contract a noncovalent association only if the surfaces of both include complementary sites permitting several atoms of one another to enter into contact with several atoms of the other .
If we now add that the complexes formed between enzyme and substrate are of noncovalent nature it will be seen why these complexes are necessarily stereospecific : they can form only if the enzyme molecule has a site “ complementary ” to the shape of the substrate molecule .
So what does all this mean ?
We link amino acids together in a process that will depend on catalysts ( explaining why proteins depend on the molecular machine known as the ribosome for their origin ) .
This speaks to stability .
But what is stably linked together ?
A pattern of side chains that has the potential to spontaneously adopt a three - dimensional shape that is , in essence , programmed by the sequence .
The one - dimensional “ virtual world ” codes for the emergence of a three - dimensional world , where form becomes function .
And it does so in a way that imparts both specificity ( the need for multiple interactions ) without determinism ( the whole system is dynamic , thus flexible , thus responsive ) .
With building material like this , the blind watchmaker could not help but be a success !
But let ’s next turn back to DNA , the other biological molecule that shares some rather deep conceptual similarities with proteins .
Could proteins and DNA be “ a match made in heaven ? ”
We ’ve seen that the logic of protein structure entails the covalent linkage of a pattern of noncovalent interactions .
This is how we encode a three - dimensional reality in one - dimensional terms .
And all of this was made possible by the fact that amino acids are linked together in a way where their side chains were not involved in the linkage and thus served more like appendages .
But we have also seen this very logic is at play when it comes to the formation of a chain of nucleotides .
As with the side chains of amino acids , the nitrogenous bases can interact with each other through noncovalent forces causing the nucleotide chain to fold into a three - dimensional structure .
This is what happens with a lot of RNA and explains its ability to function as a catalyst .
But let ’s turn to DNA .
With DNA , two nucleotide chains , running in opposite directions , form the well - known double - helix .
The thymines on one strand hydrogen bond with the adenines on the other strand , while the guanines hydrogen bond with the cytosines .
But it ’s more than this .
If we look down the end of the DNA double helix , we ’d see something similar to the picture shown below .
You can notice one set of base pairs highlighted in white .
But as the two strands wind around each other , note how the base pairs stack on each other ( the inner circular structure ) while the sugar and phosphate groups surround them .
This is because the bases are hydrophobic and are thus shielded from the water by the surface sugar / phosphates .
And what this means is that it is hydrophobic forces that drive the two strands together , where the hydrogen bonds simply add an additional layer of stabilization coupled to specificity .
The same logic thus applies when forming the double helix of DNA and the folded protein .
Both are linear molecules , where a particular sequence is connected together by covalent bonds .
Both have appendages that that interact with each other via a pattern of noncovalent forces .
Hydrophobic forces collapse a protein into a compact structure and other electrostatic forces impart further stability and specificity .
Hydrophobic forces drive the double helix together and other electrostatic forces impart further stability and specificity .
Globular proteins have a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic surface .
The DNA double helix has a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic surface .
And perhaps most remarkable is that Monod ’s observation equally applies to both :
The result is that structures defined by noncovalent interactions can attain a certain stability only if they entail multiple interactions .
Furthermore , noncovalent interactions acquire a notable amount of energy only when atoms lie a very short distance apart , practically “ touching ” one another .
Consequently two molecules ( or areas of molecules ) will be able to contract a noncovalent association only if the surfaces of both include complementary sites permitting several atoms of one another to enter into contact with several atoms of the other .
In essence , this is variation on the same logical theme .
Same story ; different play .
The main differences are twofold : 1 . ) The pattern of “ touching ” in the DNA molecule is what codes for the pattern of “ touching ” in a protein ; 2 ) the sequence of bases on one strand of DNA are complementary to the other strand , meaning the pattern of “ touching ” in the DNA molecule also “ codes ” for efficient replication .
As I write in my book , The Design Matrix :
The fact that DNA exists as a double helix of two nucleotide chains foreshadows the manner in which the structure of DNA is perfectly suited for replication .
To replicate DNA , all you need to do is unwind the two strands and then use each strand as a template for the synthesis of a new , complementary strand .
In one molecule , there are two perfect solutions for two design problems — coding the machinery of life and perpetuating the information across time .
A more beautiful molecular expression of the form - function relationship would be hard to imagine .
Seen from this vantage point , the very structure of DNA is evidence that indicates life was designed to reproduce .
The differences thus complement the similarities and become one .
But what happens when the protein theme meets the DNA theme ?
What happens when the proteins “ touch ” the DNA ?
Let ’s look more closely at the building blocks of DNA – the nucleotides .
Notice that it is more complex than an amino acid , where three complex chemical groups are covalently linked together .
And unlike amino acids , nucleotides are not recovered in Miller - Urey type experiments .
In fact , Robert Shapiro , professor emeritus of chemistry and senior research scientist at New York University , notes :
And no sample of a nucleotide , the building block of RNA or DNA , has ever been discovered in a natural source apart from Earth life .
Or even take off the phosphate , one of the three parts , and no nucleoside has ever been put together .
Nature has no inclination whatsoever to build nucleosides or nucleotides that we can detect , and the pharmaceutical industry has discovered this .
What is also remarkable about nucleotides is that it is possible to connect the sugar , phosphate group , and nitrogenous base together to form different structures .
In their book , The Mystery of Life ’s Origins , Thaxton et al. calculate there are 45 different isomers of the above nucleotide .
And when it comes to forming a dinucleotide , shown in the figure below , Thaxton et al. calculate 720 different ways of connecting things together .
Yet life only uses the particualr arrangements as shown in the above figure .
This particular “ arbitrary ” arrangement that is not readily produced by Nature has a remarkable implication when it comes to forming the double helix and the pairing of bases on opposite strands .
Once again , let ’s look down the double helix , where we can see one base pair highlighted in white .
As a consequence of the asymmetric arrangement of groups in the two nucleotides , note that the distance from one edge of the double helix to the other edge is greater just above the base pairs than it is just below the base pairs .
It might be easier to see this if we just focused on one base pair , as in the figure below
Note that the greater distance is called the “ major groove face . ”
Because the two strands of DNA wind around each other , we can think of these base pairs as rotating as we move downward .
This means that the double helix will have asymmetrical grooves on opposite sides – a wider one known as the major groove and a more narrow one known as the minor groove .
We cannot see the grooves by looking down the axis of the DNA but we can see them when looking at DNA along it ’s length as seen in the figures below .
All of this means is that the sequence of nitrogenous bases are more accessible in the major groove .
In fact , there are very common DNA - binding protein motifs known as zinc fingers , leucine zippers , and helix - turn - helix that bind to the DNA by “ touching ” the bases within the major groove .
So let us now turn to the proteins .
There are two basic rudimentary folds that occur – the alpha helix and the beta sheet .
Let ’s focus on the alpha helix since it is the fold from the various DNA binding proteins listed above that binds the major groove .
A figure of an alpha helix is shown below :
This helical structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds ( the dotted lines ) between the C=O group of one amino acid and the N - H group of the amino acid four subunits downstream ( as more easily seen in the figure below ) :
There are a few things to note about the alpha helix .
Although side chain identity can influence whether or not an alpha helix is formed , it forms largely by the same groups that are involved in the peptide bond .
Second , short peptides do not normally form alpha helices , which means this is a fold that will effectively emerge from larger chains of amino acids .
Third , note that the side chains extend outward from the helix , in contrast to the way the nitrogenous bases point inward in the DNA helix .
Below shows a figure where the outward pointing side chains ( in green ) are more easily seen ( especially c and d ) :
Thus , as a consequence of amino acid structure , proteins will not only form folded structures using the same rules that form the double helix of DNA , , but they will form a cylindrical structure whose appendage ( side chains ) seem to be well - matched for scanning and binding to the winding major groove along the double helix .
That is , the pattern of outreaching side chains can reach into the major groove and interact with the pattern of base - pairs inside the wide crevice of the major groove .
But how well matched is the alpha helix and major groove ?
According to this article :
alpha helices have particular significance in DNA binding motifs , including helix - turn - helix motifs , leucine zipper motifs and zinc finger motifs .
This is because of the structural coincidence of the alpha helix diameter of 12Å being the same as the width of the major groove in B - form DNA .
Why think it is merely a coincidence that the alpha helix diameter and the width of the major groove are the same ?
On the contrary , it simply enhances and extends the inherent rationality and complementarity that lies behind these two crucial biological molecules – a match made in heaven .
The game development manager at Square Enix 's new Los Angeles studio admits the company has ' fallen behind ' with multiplatform development , as it attempts to create new U.S. developed games for a Western audience .
Hinting at the development of a new game at the studio , Fumi Shiraishi told tech website Ars Technica that it would be part of a " Western niche " category and that " There is no point in making another FPS .
" Shiraishi described the new studio as " a different approach entirely ...
We 're not trying to make a game with a Western looking main character and with blood and gore , " he said .
Square Enix has shown strong interest recently in appealing to the Western markets -- in addition to forming the new Los Angeles studio , it 's also made a bid to acquireholder Eidos .
" Square Enix is n't necessarily shifting , it 's more of a growth , " said Fumi Shiraishi .
" The stuff [ games created by Square Enix in Japan ] does what it is supposed to do ... but the Japanese market is n't growing .
" Compared to recent comments from Square Enix president and CEO Yoichi Wada , Shiraishi was more reserved discussing the decline of the Japanese market and the difficulty of appealing to Western consumers .
"
We 're not deliberately focusing on the North American audience , " he said .
" We 're just trying to make a good game . "

Chris Daniels Full - Court Buzzer Beater PGE Turow vs. AZS Koszalin Polish Basketball Playoffs : Video
This amazing full - court buzzer beater comes to us from Poland , where PGE Turow Zgorzelec and AZS Koszalin are in the middle of a Polish League Playoffs Quarterfinals series , with PGE Turow currently holding a 2 - 0 lead .
In Game 2 , former Georgia Bulldogs star Chris Daniels grabbed a rebound on an opponent ’s shot at the end of the 3rd quarter , took a few steps , then hurled the ball down the court just before the buzzer sounded .
Daniels ’ shot went off the backboard and right through the net , much to the delight of the PGE Turow crowd .
After the game Chris Daniels was interviewed for the PGE Turow website .
Keep in mind that this interview was translated from English to Polish to English .
Interviewer : Fans gathered in the hall witnessed incredible show .
Lots przechwytów , effective action , charges , or popisowych applications .
The highlight was a projection of the Lord throughout the playground !
Chris Daniels :
It was incredible feeling .
Released the ball from the hands , and looked like summer .
I did not know whether to hit on all the trash .
Every man has debated that at some point .
As for describing Daniels ’ shot as “ a projection of the Lord throughout the playground , ” that is definitely the best description of a full - court buzzer beater ever .
PS : In case you were wondering what Tyus Edney is up to , he is one of Chris Daniels ’ teammates on PGE Turow .

The parable of the wiki Posted by Louis Brandy on 27 April 2009
Once upon a time , in a cubicle right next to mine , lived a developer .
This developer was tasked with building a bare - bones CRM for our company 's internal use .
This was not an ambitious project .
We wanted to be able to put in basic contact information , keep copies of all the pdfs and other various legal agreements , and so on .
This is the type of project that your average web framework lets you hammer out in a day .
In fact , I think with Rails scaffolding , you could have built it inside an hour , and had it polished up and ready to use inside of two days .
If the story ended there , it would n't be very exciting , would it ?
Once it was built , there was this one tiny feature that would have made it a lot better .
And so it was asked , of our developer , if we could find an easy way to let people write little notes about what 's happened .
Ah , notes , said the dev .
That would be easy .
So he decided to make a note database , and let people tack in little notes .
Simple text box , add it into the database , no problem .
Maybe , he thought , it should show who posted the note ?
Yes , it should .
But we do n't really have a proper log in system .
It looks like we need one .
What about editing or deleting notes ?
What if someone were to screw up ?
What happens to the " authored by so - and - so " when someone else edits it ?
Ugh .
Screw it .
This was going to be more work than it was worth .
How about we just allow one gigantic text box and let people edit it all they want .
That 's simple .
Ugh , we need to sanitize this input to keep people from screwing up the page .
Oh , but , what if someone wants to add a link ?
They are definitely going to want to add links .
We are going to need to add some markdown to this .
But , still , what if someone accidentally wipes out the entire text box and saves it ?
No one wanted to be restoring text boxes from database backups ...
After about two days of this game , I heard the words burned into my memory , " God dammit , I just reimplemented a wiki " .
Except for the colorized diffs , I noted .
Turns out the moment you want a community note repository , all the natural problems associated with it lead you inexorably toward wikidom .
It strikes me that there is a larger lesson to be drawn here , as well ( ignoring the one about feature creep ) .
Popular solutions to popular problems are popular for a reason .
Early on in the process , a full fledged wiki might have been deemed too heavyweight .
However , once you start looking deeply , you begin to notice all those devils in all those details , and suddenly you need all those features .

Complex new legislation will take a lot of unpicking to prove , police say New laws making it a criminal offence to have sex with prostitutes controlled by pimps may be too complex to work in practice , police have warned .
The legislation , which is due to come into effect later this year , aims to protect women forced into the trade .
Gloucestershire Chief Constable Dr Tim Brain said he feared the complexity of the law may make gaining evidence hard .
He said his concern was getting enough evidence " to merit a suitable number of prosecutions to act as a deterrent " .
Dr Brain , the lead on prostitution for the Association of Chief Police Officers of England , Wales and Northern Ireland , said the legislation was " quite complex " .
' Rapists , psychopaths '
" It will take a lot of unpicking to prove and therefore I am concerned that the deterrent effect the government was hoping to bring about will be lessened because the legislation is so complex , " he said .
The government 's planned change to the law in England and Wales aims to protect women forced into the trade by traffickers and pimps .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith launched the new legislation with an unequivocal message , saying " there will be no more excuses for those who pay for sex " .
For the first time ministers have the " punters " in their sights .
They 're acting anonymously , I 'm acting anonymously because there is something very wrong in what we are doing "
Prostitute client " John "
Prostitute users face clampdown
At present it is not illegal to pay for sex .
Under the new legislation a man will face prosecution if he pays for sex with a woman who is being " controlled for gain " by someone else .
And in court he will not be able to argue he did not know the woman was being controlled because ignorance is no defence .
Dr Brain said : " The idea that men should be responsible and have a wider knowledge of the harm they can cause by paying for sex in these circumstances is an absolutely sound principle .
" Our concern is around gaining sufficient evidence to merit a suitable number of prosecutions to act as a deterrent . "
But what about those this legislation is aimed at - the men who have sex with prostitutes ?
One man in his 60s called " John " , who has been using prostitutes for most of his marriage , told the BBC the new law may deter some men but not him .
' It 's frightening '
When asked if he would ask a woman if she was being controlled , he said : " I would n't expect her to tell the truth because it is n't a trade where the truth is always there .
" They 're acting anonymously , I 'm acting anonymously because there is something very wrong in what we are doing , so not telling the truth is only part of the story . "
At a brothel in the south east of England with 50 women on its books , four women who were ready to see clients told the BBC they were all working in the sex trade voluntarily .
Andrea , who runs the business , said the new legislation would keep customers away and could force her to close and the women to work on their own .
" If the girls are working on their own they are open to danger , " she said .
" They are one phonecall away from a rapist , a psychopath , muggers , anything ... people know these women have cash on them .
It 's frightening . "
While the women at Andrea 's brothel say they are there from choice , there are many others forced to work in the sex trade who do not have a voice .
The Home Office says more than 160 victims of sex trafficking were rescued by police in a six - month period last year .
" We know there are many more women involved in prostitution who are being exploited in a number of ways , " a spokesman said .
The bill also includes tougher controls on kerb crawlers .

This monster to be used in the new Star Trek movie , was created by the same guy that designed the Cloverfield Monster , with one small twist .
The Cloverfield Monster was scary , at least scarier then what his Star Trek Monster looks like .
Even if I wore boots I would n't be shaking in them .
Instead of being scarred I might mistake this Star Trek monster as a large genetic mistake of a flower , the kind that was in Pink Floyd 's The Wall .
Star Trek is scheduled to be released in Theatres May 8 , 2009 .

OBAMA POSITIONING FOR BACK DOOR GUN CONTROL
By Chuck Baldwin
April 24 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
On his recent trip to Central America , President Barack Obama did more than cozy up to Marxist dictators ; he also signed onto an international treaty that could , in effect , be used as backdoor gun control .
It appears that Obama wants to use international treaties to do what congressional legislation is not able to do : further restrict the right of the American people to keep and bear arms .
Obama is using the oft - disproved contention that " 90 % of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States " as the stated basis of his support for the international treaty he is promoting .
The treaty is formally known as the Inter - American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms , Ammunition , Explosives and Other Related Materials ( CIFTA ) treaty .
The Bill Clinton administration signed the treaty back in 1997 , but the U.S. Senate has never ratified the treaty .
Obama intends to change that .
To date , 33 nations in the western hemisphere have signed the treaty .
The U.S. is one of four nations that have yet to ratify it .
According to one senior Obama administration official , passing the treaty is a " high priority " for the President .
If ratified , the treaty would require the United States to adopt " strict licensing requirements , mark firearms when they are made and imported to make them easier to trace , and establish a process for sharing information between national law enforcement agencies investigating [ gun ] smuggling . "
Senator John Kerry , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee promises to " work for its [ the CIFTA treaty 's ] approval by the Senate . "
Should the Senate ratify CIFTA , Americans who reload ammunition would be required to get a license from the government , and factory guns and ammunition would be priced almost out of existence due to governmental requirements to " mark " each one manufactured .
Even the simple act of adding an after - market piece of equipment to a firearm , such as a scope or bipod , or reassembling a gun after cleaning it could fall into the category of " illicit manufacturing " of firearms and require government license and oversight .
In addition , CIFTA would authorize the U.S. federal government ( and open the door to international entities ) to supervise and regulate virtually the entire American firearms industry .
Making matters worse is the fact that , as a treaty , this Act does not have to be passed by both houses of Congress , nor is it subject to judicial oversight .
All Obama needs to do in order to enact this unconstitutional and egregious form of gun control is convince a Democratic - controlled Senate to pass it .
Obviously , the United Nations , from its very inception , has been one of the world 's most ardent gun control proponents .
As anyone who has ever driven by the U.N. building in New York City knows , a huge statue of an American - made revolver with its barrel twisted in the shape of a pretzel greets every visitor .
The CIFTA treaty is one of the U.N. 's pet projects in order to achieve this long - held ambition .
Of course , Obama is a longtime liberal radical when it comes to the Second Amendment .
As a senator , he voted against the Second Amendment at every opportunity .
He has never seen a piece of gun control legislation that he did not support .
And as I have said before in this column , gun control is high on the list of priorities for the newly elected President Barack Obama .
For Obama to intimate that 90 % of the firearms used by Mexican drug cartels come from the United States reveals either a truly dishonest and deceptive mind or a totally misinformed and naïve one .
Many studies have thoroughly debunked the 90 % myth , including one by William La Jeunesse and Maxim Lott in a recent Fox News report .
According to these researchers , the real number is closer to 17 % .
According to La Jeunesse and Lott , Mexican drug cartels , which control billions of dollars , obtain the overwhelming majority of their guns from the Black Market , Russian crime syndicates , South America , China , Guatemala , and even from the Mexican army .
In fact , Mexico is a virtual arms bazaar : AK - 47s from China ; fragmentation grenades from South Korea ; shoulder - fired rocket launchers from Spain , Israel and former Soviet bloc dealers ; assault weapons from China ; and explosives from Korea - - just to name a few sources .

In addition , according to Mexican Congressman Robert Badillo , more than 150,000 Mexican soldiers have deserted in just the last six years .
The vast majority of them took their weapons with them , including the standard issue M - 16 assault rifle made in Belgium .
And please do not forget that corruption within the Mexican government is rampant .
Many news sources have covered stories of how drug cartels bribe Mexican officials .
An article in the New York Times last year reported , " One of Mexico 's most notorious drug cartels made huge cash payments to officials in the Mexican attorney general 's office in exchange for confidential information on anti-drug operations . . . the cartel might have had an informant inside the American embassy . "
The Mexican drug cartels control a multi-billion dollar enterprise that has more than enough resources to obtain planeloads of weapons from all over the world .
For Obama to assert that 90 % of the Mexican drug cartels ' firearms come from the United States is a bald - faced lie !
Again , either Obama is stupid and naïve or he is deliberately lying to the American people in order to " sell " the CIFTA treaty to the U.S. Senate .
I think we all know that Mr. Obama is anything but stupid and naïve .
Read more about the CIFTA treaty here .
In addition to the CIFTA treaty , liberal Chicago Democrat Congressman Bobby Rush has introduced H.R. 45 in the House of Representatives .
This bill is anything but subtle .
It is an in - your - face gun control bill that would make " Mr. Gun Control , " the late Senator Howard Metzenbaum , shout Hallelujah .
H.R. 45 would require a federal license for all handguns and semiautomatics , including the ones you already possess .
It would require handgun and semi-auto owners to be thumbprinted at a police station and sign a certificate that the gun will not be kept in a place where it could be used for the defense of the gun owner 's family .
Read more about H.R. 45 here .
In all likelihood , H.R. 45 is probably a long shot at passing both houses of Congress , albeit gun owners should never take any proposed gun control bill for granted .
The CIFTA treaty , however , is much more dangerous due to its subtlety and subterfuge , the less cumbersome process of passage , and the fact that it makes U.S. gun owners subject to international gun control laws .
All in all , freedom in America is on the Obama White House chopping block .
And this much is certain : if the American people do not retain the right to keep and bear arms , every other freedom we hold dear will quickly disappear as well .
Moreover , if we do retain the right to keep and bear arms , it will only be because enough of us -- and our state and federal legislators -- resist the tyrannical gun control machinations of Barack Obama .
And that means defeating the CIFTA treaty and H.R. 45 .

Subterrenes
Nuclear powered tunnelling machines .
Hollow earth and tunnel system
Since the 1950 ’s , the US Government has had nuclear powered tunneling machines .
They were patented in the 1970's ( US Patents # 3,693,731 ) .
As it burrows through the rock hundreds of feet below the surface , the Subterrene heats whatever stone it encounters into molten rock , or magma , which cools after the Subterrene has moved on .
The result is a tunnel with a smooth , glazed lining , somewhat like black glass , which is also apparently strong enough that it does n’t even require reinforcing of the walls .
It was featured in OMNI magazine , Sept 1983 , p80 .
I happened to see a picture of ( what I assume is ) one of these machines in a UFO magazine , but at $ 15 , I was n't going to ( let alone could n't afford to ) buy it .
Then I was visiting a friend and he showed me the wierdpics.com website , and lo and behold , there was the picture .
Hmmm , what would the US airforce be doing tunneling deep under the ground ?
So , with the above picture and the US Patent Office patent , I think that adds up to incontrovertible evidence that these things are real .
And further to that , it is highly likely that the claims of underground bases and tunnels across America ( if not the world ) are indeed true .
Here 's a pic of one photographed in Denmark .
It appears that there is a high probability then that an tunnel now exists under the Atlantic Ocean connecting America to Europe .
For those of you aware of the difficulties encountered in the Burnley tunnel being constructed in Melbourne , Australia , just think , we could have been driving under the Yarra years ago if they used this machine .
And none of these delays caused by leakages due to cracks which are the direct result of a large corporation trying to save money and constructing a cheap tunnel instead of doing it the correct way ( double layered as per the Sydney Harbour tunnel ) .
From http://www.wic.net/colonel/!subdril.txt ( now defunct site due to the Colonels death ) .
SUBTERRENE
Robert Salter , of the RAND Corporation , has suggested building a subway from New York to Los Angeles magnetically levitated above the tracks .
The trains would zip through the evacuated tunnels at speeds faster than an SST , crossing the country in less than one hour .
Building such a train presents no special technological problems , but the cost of tunneling from coast to coast would .
To be economically feasible , engineers would have to develop a new way to dig .
The federal government 's Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory , in New Mexico , however , may have an answer to this challenge .
Called the Subterrene , the Los Almos machine looks like a vicious giant mole .
The beauty of the Subterrene is that , as it burrows through the rock hundreds of feet below the surface , it heats whatever stone it encounters into molten rock , or magma , which cools after the Subterrene has moved on .
The result is a tunnel with a smooth , glazed lining .
For power , the Subterrene can use a built - in minature nuclear engine or even a conventional power plant .
NOTE : I have seen this machine , and watched it in action .
Normal rate of speed is approximitly six and one / half miles per hour depending on Type of rock , sand etc

UNDERGROUND BASES AND TUNNELS by Richard Sauder , Ph.D. ,
Adventures Unlimited Press
Nuclear Subterrenes
The nuclear subterrene ( rhymes with submarine ) was designed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , in New Mexico .
A number of patents were filed by scientists at Los Alamos , a few federal technical documents were written -- and then the whole thing just sort of faded away .
Or did it ?
Nuclear subterrenes work by melting their way through the rock and soil , actually vitrifying it as they go , and leaving a neat , solidly glass - lined tunnel behind them .
The heat is supplied by a compact nuclear reactor that circulates liquid lithium from the reactor core to the tunnel face , where it melts the rock .
In the process of melting the rock the lithium loses some of its heat .
It is then circulated back along the exterior of the tunneling machine to help cool the vitrified rock as the tunneling machine forces its way forward .
The cooled lithium then circulates back to the reactor where the whole cycle starts over .
In this way the nuclear subterrene slices through the rock like a nuclear powered , 2,000 degree Fahrenheit ( Celcius ? ) - earthworm , boring its way deep underground .
The United States Atomic Energy Commission and the United States Energy Research and Development Administration took out Patents in the 1970s for nuclear subterrenes .
The first patent , in 1972 went to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission .
The nuclear subterrene has an advantage over mechanical TBMs in that it produces no muck that must be disposed of by conveyors , trains , trucks , etc .
This greatly simplifies tunneling .
If nuclear subterrenes actually exist ( and I do not know if they do ) their presence , and the tunnels they make , could be very hard to detect , for the simple reason that there would not be the tell - tale muck piles or tailings dumps that are associated with the conventional tunneling activities .
The 1972 patent makes this clear .
It states :
" .. ( D ) ebris may be disposed of as melted rock both as a lining for the hole and as a dispersal in cracks produced in the surrounding rock .
The rock - melting drill is of a shape and is propelled under sufficient pressure to produce and extend cracks in solid rock radially around the bore by means of hydrostatic pressure developed in the molten rock ahead of the advancing rock drill penetrator .
All melt not used in glass - lining the bore is forced into the cracks where it freezes and remains ... " " ...
Such a ( vitreous ) lining eliminates , in most cases , the expensive and cumbersome problem of debris elimination and at the same time achieves the advantage of a casing type of bore hole liner . "
( US Patent No. 3,693,731 , 26 Sep 1972 )
There you have it : a tunneling machine that creates no muck , and leaves a smooth , vitreous ( glassy ) tunnel lining behind .
Another patent three years later was for :
A tunneling machine for producing large tunnels in soft rock or wet , clayey , unconsolidated or bouldery earth by simultaneously detaching the tunnel core by thermal melting a boundary kerf into the tunnel face and forming a supporting excavation wall liner by deflecting the molten materials against the excavation walls to provide , when solidified , a continuous wall supporting liner , and detaching the tunnel face circumscribed by the kerf with powered mechanical earth detachment means and in which the heat required for melting the kerf and liner material is provided by a compact nuclear reactor .
This 1975 patent further specifies that the machine is intended to excavate tunnels up to 12 meters in diameter or more .
This means tunnels of 40 ft. or more in diameter .
The kerf is the outside boundary of the tunnel wall that a boring machine gouges out as it bores through the ground or rock .
So , in ordinary English , this machine will melt a circular boundary into the tunnel face .
The melted rock will be forced to the outside of the tunnel by the tunnel machine , where it will form a hard , glassy tunnel lining ( see the appropriate detail in the patent itself , as shown in Illustration 41 ) .
At the same time , mechanical tunnel boring equipment will grind up the rock and soil detached by the melted kerf and pass it to the rear of the machine for disposal by conveyor , slurry pipeline , etc .
And yet a third patent was issued to the United States Energy Research and Development Administration just 21 days later , on 27 May 1975 for a machine remarkably similar to the machine patented on 6 May 1975 .
The abstract describes :
A tunneling machine for producing large tunnels in rock by progressive detachment of the tunnel core by thermal melting a boundary kerf into the tunnel face and simultaneously forming an initial tunnel wall support by deflecting the molten materials against the tunnel walls to provide , when solidified , a continuous liner ; and fragmenting the tunnel core circumscribed by the kerf by thermal stress fracturing and in which the heat required for such operations is supplied by a compact nuclear reactor .
This machine would also be capable of making a glass - lined tunnel of 40 ft. in diameter or more .
Perhaps some of my readers have heard the same rumors that I have heard swirling in the UFO literature and on the UFO grapevine : stories of deep , secret , glass - walled tunnels excavated by laser powered tunneling machines .
I do not know if these stories are true .
If they are , however , it may be that the glass - walled tunnels are made by the nuclear subterrenes described in these patents .
The careful reader will note that all of these patents were obtained by agencies of the United States government .
Further , all but one of the inventors are from Los Alamos , New Mexico .
Of course , Los Alamos National Lab is itself the subject of considerable rumors about underground tunnels and chambers , Little Greys or EBEs , and various other covert goings - on .
( It may also be that the some of the tunnels are made by these machines , while other subterranean tunnel systems were made by other civilizations , both ancient and modern .
-- SW )
A 1973 Los Alamos study entitled " Systems and Cost Analysis for a Nuclear Subterrene Tunneling Machine : A Preliminary Study " , concluded that nuclear subterrene tunneling machines ( NSTMs ) would be very cost effective , compared to conventional TBMs .
It stated :
" Tunneling costs for NSTMs are very close to those for TBMs , if operating conditions for TBMs are favorable .
However , for variable formations and unfavorable conditions such as soft , wet , bouldery ground or very hard rock , the NSTMs are far more effective .
Estimates of cost and percentage use of NSTMs to satisfy U.S. transportation tunnel demands indicate a potential cost savings of 850 million dollars ( 1969 dollars ) throughout 1990 .
An estimated NSTM prototype demonstration cost of $ 100 million over an eight - year period results in a favorable benefit - to - cost ratio of 8.5 . "
Was the 1973 feasibility study only idle speculation , and is the astonishingly similar patent two years later only a wild coincidence ?
As many a frustrated inventor will tell you , the U.S. Patent Office only issues the paperwork when it 's satisfied that the thing in question actually works !
In 1975 the National Science Foundation commissioned another cost analysis of the nuclear subterrene .
The A.A. Mathews Construction and Engineering Company of Rockville , Maryland produced a comprehensive report with two , separate , lengthy appendices , one 235 and the other 328 pages .
A.A. Mathews calculated costs for constructing three different sized tunnels in the Southern California area in 1974 .
The three tunnel diameters were :
a ) 3.05 meters ( 10 ft . ) ;
b ) 4.73 meters ( 15.5 ft. ) ; and
c ) 6.25 meters ( 20.5 ft. ) .
Comparing the cost of using NSTMs to the cost of mechanical TBMs , A.A. Mathews determined :
" Savings of 12 percent for the 4.73 meter ( 15.5 ft. ) tunnel and 6 percent for the 6.25 meter ( 20.5 foot ) tunnel were found to be possible using the NSTM as compared to current methods .
A penalty of 30 percent was found for the 3.05 meter ( 10 foot ) tunnel using the NSTM .
The cost advantage for the NSTM results from the combination of :
( a ) a capital rather than labor intensive system ,
( Reducing the number of personnel required is especially important in black budget projects for security reasons .
-- SW ) and
( b ) formation of both initial support and final lining in conjunction with the excavation process .
( Leaving a glass - like lining , which could be * air - tight * , allowing the use of high - speed , superconducting mag - lev trains operated in a virtual vacuum in a tunnel deep underground .
-- SW )
This report has a number of interesting features .
It is noteworthy in the first place that the government commissioned such a lengthy and detailed analysis of the cost of operating a nuclear subterrenes .
Just as intriguing is the fact that the study found that the tunnels in the 15 ft. to 20 ft. diameter range can be more economically excavated by NSTMs than by conventional TBMs .
Finally , the southern California location that was chosen for tunneling cost analysis is thought provoking .
This is precisely one of the regions of the West where there is rumored to be a secret tunnel system .
Did the A.A.
Mathews study represent part of the planning for an actual covert tunneling project that was subsequently carried out , when it was determined that it was more cost effective to use NSTMs than mechanical TBMs ?
Whether or not nuclear subterrene tunneling machines have been used , or are being used , for subterranean tunneling is a question I cannot presently answer .
If you should happen to know , contact me with the relevant proof .

Hi all ,
In regards to the underground boring machines I have a story to tell .
In Nov. of 1992 I went to work at the Engineering office of the Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory in Waxahachie , TX. , which is about 30 miles south of Dallas .
While there I helped design the Matching Section and RF Drive Loop Assembly of the Linear Accelerator used to focus the Proton Beam for there travel down the 50 mile oval .
When I started working there they had already started there boring under the ground .
I never was able to get out to the hole but saw pictures of it and talked to people who worked down there .

Space shuttle Discovery touches down on Runway 15 at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to complete the 13 - day , 5.3 - million mile journey on the STS - 119 mission to the International Space Station on March 28 , 2009 .
This story was updated at 8:45 p.m. EDT .
With thesuccessful landing Saturday of the space shuttle Discovery , NASA is gearing upfor its next mission : Saving the Hubble Space Telescope .
As Discoverytouched down at NASA ?s Kennedy Space Center in Florida to end a successfulmission to the International Space Station , engineers were priming its sistership Atlantis for a planned May 12 launch to overhaul Hubble in an 11 - daymission fraught with risk .
? I thinkthe only thing that beats a beautiful orbiter landing like this is the nextlaunch , ? said NASA ?s deputy shuttle program manager Leroy Cain after Discoverylanded at the spaceport in Cape Canaveral , Fla .
?
So we ?re looking forward tothat as well .?
Atlantis ispoisedto roll out to its seaside Pad 39A launch site on Tuesday .
A separate spaceshuttle , the Endeavour orbiter , is being prepared to serve as a rescue shipshould Atlantis suffer critical damage that would prevent the spacecraft fromsafely returning its seven - astronaut crew back to Earth .
Riskymission
In order toreach Hubble , Atlantis will fly in an orbit that has a higher than normal riskof orbital debris strikes for NASA shuttles , about a 1 - in - 185 chance .
NASA ? ssafety guidelines call for a maximum risk of a 1 - in - 200 chance , but officialssaid that they are weighing that risk against ways to offset it for the Hubbleflight .
They are also studying the risk of new debris caused by the Feb. 10 crash of two satellites in an orbit above Hubble's .
? We havesome more discussions to have in terms of mitigations that we already plan toput in place and some other things that we might consider , ?
Cain said .
Commandedby veteran spaceflyer Scott Altman , Atlantis ?
STS - 125 mission to Hubble is expected to extend the iconic orbital observatory ?
slifespan through at least 2013 or later .
Astronauts plan to perform fiveback - to - back spacewalks to add a new camera , replace gyroscopes and batteries , add a docking ring , as well as perform tricky repairs on equipment that wasnever designed to be fixed in space .
The missionhas been delayed since October 2008 , when a part on Hubble unexpectedly failed , prompting engineers to begin assembly a spare and add the new repair to theupcoming mission .
It is the fifth and last service call on Hubble by shuttleastronauts .
Twoshuttles , two launch pads
NASA spaceoperations chief William Gerstenmaier told reporters that the agency hasofficially decided to usetwo separate shuttle launch pads , Pad 39A and Pad 39B , for Atlantis and itsrescue ship .
The extralaunch pad and shuttle are required because Atlantis and its crew of sevenastronauts would not be able to seek refuge aboard the International SpaceStation if their spacecraft suffered critical damage and could not return toEarth .
The Hubble Space Telescope flies in a higher and different orbit thanthe station , so Atlantis would not be able to reach the outpost , NASA has said .
The stationcan serve as a safe haven for shuttle missions like Discovery ?s STS - 119 flight , which boosted the outpost to full power by delivering its final solar arrays , since the orbiters can return to the outpost after undocking if required .
NASA wasinitially considering using a single launch pad , Pad 39A , to launch Atlantis , as well as its rescue ship - if needed - in order to allow extra time formodifications to Pad 39B .
That pad is being converted to launch NASA ?s new AresI rocket and Orion spacecraft , with the first testflight Ares I - X slated for July .
Gerstenmaiersaid work crews were able to make substantial headway modifying Pad 39 B , including erecting new lightning masts and an access level on the pad ?s fixedsupport structure .
With that work complete , NASA officials felt it best use the launch pad to support the Hubble rescue plan .
? We thinkit ?s more of a normal plan to have the orbiter out at the pad , ?
Gerstenmaiersaid .
?
It gives us a little bit more robustness from a crew standpoint .?
Using bothlaunch pads will likely mean a few weeks of delay for the Ares I - X launch test , which was slated for July 11 , Gerstenmaier said .
Endeavouris currently expected to move from its processing hangar to NASA ?s cavernousVehicle Assembly Building on April 10 to meet its external fuel tank and twinsolid rocket boosters , NASA officials said .
That shuttle would then roll out tothe second launch pad on April 17 , they added .
NASA plansto launch up to nine more shuttle missions before retiring its three - orbiterfleet in 2010 .
One missionis reserved to upgrade Hubble in May , while the others are aimed atcompleting the International Space Station and , if funding is available , deliveringthe $ 1.5 billion Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) physics experiment to theorbiting lab , Gerstenmaier said .
Since leaving office earlier this year , former Vice President Dick Cheney has been making the rounds of friendly news organizations , most recently on March 15 .
Explaining the Bush Administration ’s course of action after September 11 , he said :
Once you go into a wartime situation and it ’s a strategic threat , then you use all of your assets to go after the enemy .
You go after the state sponsors of terror , places where they ’ve got sanctuary .
You use your intelligence resources , your military resources , your financial resources , everything you can in order to shut down that terrorist threat against you .
This , of course , comes only a month after his now - famous February 2009 interview with Politico , during which he claimed that Obama ’s foreign policy decisions had led to a “ high probability ” of a terrorist attack sometime in the next few years .
While in office , Cheney was a leading , if not the leading , advocate for the use of torture and other illegal methods against terror suspects .
Presumably he thinks that since Obama has abandoned these methods , America is less well equipped to handle the still - present terrorist threat .
Cheney is making George W. Bush sound reasonable .
When asked if he supported or opposed Obama ’s policies , W. had this to say : " I love my country a lot more than I love politics , " Bush said .
" I think it is essential that he [ Obama ] be helped in office . "
Condoleezza
Rice also turned her nose up at Cheney ’s recent comments .
She said that all Americans , including former administration officials , “ owe them [ the Obama administration ] our loyalty and our silence . ”
It takes a lot to make Bush and Rice , two architects of the Iraq War , sound wise and magnanimous , but there you have it ; Cheney managed it .
Cheney is certainly entitled to his opinions .
But what ’s less clear is why he keeps trying to make his case , nearly two months after he left office and at a time when most Americans are fixated on the recession and not national security .
Cheney is n’t giving these interviews out of deeply felt patriotism .
He ’s not trying to do Obama a favor by telling Americans that Obama is making America less safe , and he surely does n’t believe that anyone in the Obama administration is going to listen to him .
And not too many Americans believe him anymore , either .
If not patriotism , then what ?
Insanity ?
No , I do n’t think Cheney is insane .
Quite the opposite , in fact .
Cheney was a successful civil servant under three administrations , so I think anyone who doubts his competence and rationality , however dark his reasoning might be , seriously underestimates the man .
It seems clear that Cheney is trying to protect himself from future criminal charges and / or war crimes tribunals .
It ’s no secret that Cheney authorized torture ; he admits it .
It ’s also no secret that torture and other illegal acts were accepted as official administration policy .
Previously secret White House memos drafted by the infamous John Yoo are steadily being released by the Obama administration .
Those memos indicate how broadly the Bush administration interpreted its powers .
That leads us to the present situation .
On the one hand you have what appear to be illegal activities — possibly even war crimes — that were explicitly approved by administration officials .
And on the other , you have an Obama administration that is n’t going to engage in a Nixon - esque cover - up to protect government officials .
And yet , Obama is unwilling to convene a commission to further investigate what went on .
The reason for the President ’s reluctance , I think , is that Obama does n’t want there to be the appearance of political retribution .
Even those who hated what the Bush administration did would raise their eyebrows at efforts to exact political revenge .
Conceivably , however , if the political furor regarding the Bush administration ’s alleged acts died down , Obama , or the next president , could convene a bipartisan tribunal .
But as long as the issue is politicized , such a tribunal would n’t be taken seriously and could n’t hope to be effective .
By relentlessly taking to the airwaves , Cheney is re-politicizing issues that should be strictly legal ones .
And as long as the issue of law - breaking remains political , and not legal , in nature , Cheney and his cohorts Donald Rumsfeld and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez can rest easy .
By becoming the voice and face of the Bush administration ’s wrongdoings , Cheney is gambling , so far correctly , that Obama wo n’t have the political guts to pursue him .
Cheney does n’t have to delay for very long .
He ’s 68 years old and has a history of heart troubles , so if he can delay an investigation by a decade or so , there ’s the chance that he might no longer be around to endure the humiliation of a trial and conviction .
And with Cheney and others gone , would there be the political and societal will to pursue an investigation ?
Like many others , I think that America needs a thorough investigation into what went on during the Bush administration .
Not as political retribution , but as national catharsis .
Here ’s hoping that Cheney ’s gamble is the last political act of a fearful , disgraced man .
Let Cheney speak , but let ’s not listen .

LaDonna tends to St. James because he can't tend to himself .
St. James , sixty - six , a former high school football star and onetime Nascar driver , is severely disabled and disfigured .
There 's a two - inch hole in the heel of his swollen left foot , and he is confined to a wheelchair .
He has no nose , only a red , raw , exposed septum , surrounded by narrow openings .
At the top are three tiny magnets designed to hold in place a crude silicone prosthesis , which is constantly falling off .
His right eye is gone , replaced with glass .
The skin on his face droops like candle wax because so many bones around his cheeks and eyes were broken .
His mouth , which has been completely reconstructed , is stuck in a frown .
On his left hand , his index , middle , and ring fingers are stumps .
His right hand is much worse .
He has a misshapen hunk of flesh for a thumb , which appears as if it were lumped onto his wrist with clay .
His index and middle fingers are gone ; his ring finger and pinkie are immobile .
But St. James 's crying has nothing to do with his physical condition .
He 's crying because of news he and LaDonna recently received about what really can only be called their boy .
At first , St. James and LaDonna were reluctant to speak about all that 's happened to them .
LaDonna prefers not to talk to outsiders about their life because , she says , they are so often misunderstood .
To begin to understand , you have to go back to early 1971 , when West Covina 's " monkey trial " captivated this small California city about twenty miles east of Los Angeles .
St. James and LaDonna Davis were in court , found in violation of a city ordinance against harboring a wild animal — a young chimpanzee they 'd kept in their home nearly from birth .
The chimp , named Moe , rode to the courthouse shotgun in St. James 's jet - black 1932 Ford roadster .
Dozens of spectators lined up outside the Citrus municipal courthouse to catch a glimpse of the Davises and their monkey .
St. James was a tall , handsome mechanic and race - car driver .
His young wife , LaDonna , was a sun-kissed blond with wholesome good looks .
Holding St. James 's hand , Moe , decked out in a checkered shirt , white trousers , and shoes , entered the courthouse to cheers .
Inside , he shook hands and waved to his supporters .
He kissed the court reporter and jangled the keys of the bailiff .
St. James and LaDonna both made impassioned pleas to the court .
" Moe is like a son to us , " LaDonna said .
" He would n't hurt anyone , and so far as we 're concerned , he 's a member of the family . "
The trial was a sensation .
Journalists fawned over
Moe in person and in print , and the outcome was never in doubt .
Prosecutors dropped the case , and Judge Jack Alex 's assessment of the chimp , delivered to a packed courtroom , echoed in newspapers all the way to Texas .
" From what I 've observed of Moe outside and in the courtroom , " the judge said , " he does n't have the traits of a wild animal and is , in fact , better behaved than some people . "
He 's a member of the family .
That 's something plenty of people say about their dog or bird or even a cow in the barn .
But with St. James Davis and his wife , LaDonna , that sentiment grew into a singular kind of devotion , into a singular kind of love , into a singular kind of family .
And how that came to be , and what that ultimately would mean for them , is a singular kind of story .
It 's a story at once understandable and incomprehensible , at once comic and tragic , at once familiar and utterly bizarre .
After all , what kind of family takes a wild animal and invests it with humanity ?
From the moment St. James returned from a trip to Africa with Moe in 1967 , the chimpanzee was the center of the couple 's life .
Moe was tiny , barely a foot long .
His body was covered in brown hair , except for his pink face , ears , hands , and feet .
His ears , the size of large clamshells , stuck out a couple of inches from his head .
But it was his deep brown eyes and what St. James and LaDonna thought they saw in them — wonderment , innocence , comprehension — that moved them the most .
Scenes from their life together are like scenes from the life of any young family with a small child .
It 's a Saturday night in 1970 , and St. James is sitting on the couch next to Moe , who is sucking down a vanilla shake .
LaDonna is in the kitchen , cleaning up after their dinner of beef stew and vegetables .
Moe , four years old , was hungry after a day in the park , and he wolfed down his plate .
Now he 's clapping his hands because St. James has just turned on his favorite cowboys - and - Indians show .
LaDonna joins her boys on the couch .
In two hours , they 'll all be on the floor sleeping , their bodies linked at the arms .
Then there was the first trip to the dentist .
When Moe was about two , St. James took him to a veterinary specialist to have a crooked front tooth pulled .
As the doctor prepared a shot , St. James stroked Moe 's tiny arm and concentrated on keeping him distracted .
He spoke to him softly : " What are you looking at , Moe ?
Are you trying to see out the window ? "
Just before the doctor plunged the needle into Moe 's forearm , St. James gripped him tightly .
Moe let out a yelp but fell asleep in seconds .
St. James never left the room during the forty - five - minute procedure .
As soon as they got home , St. James carried Moe to the couple 's bedroom .
He gently placed Moe , still in his T - shirt and plastic diaper pants , on his chest so the sleeping chimp could feel him breathing .
They remained in bed together that way for more than six hours until Moe , groggy and glassy - eyed , finally woke up .
LaDonna spent hours with Moe every day , essentially trying to home - school him .
She would sit beside him in the living room , coaching him as he played with Erector sets or colored with crayons .
She was stunned by how thoughtful Moe appeared to be .
He stared at the page , sometimes rubbing it with his hairless palm , before putting crayon to paper .
Whenever Moe motioned for a new color — sticking out his hand palm up — LaDonna offered a few and asked Moe to think about which one he wanted : " Do you want this green one ?
Or would yellow be better ?
Think about it , Moe. Think . "
Moe had his own bedroom , complete with a bed , a large closet where his clothes were kept — the Davises dressed him in plaid button - down shirts , blue jeans , and even dinner jackets and trousers on formal occasions — and a bureau with his toys on top , though of course Moe preferred to sleep with St. James and LaDonna .
When he got too big — by age six he weighed about fifty pounds — St. James would carry
Moe back to his bedroom after he fell asleep .
Hours later , the couple would awaken to Moe at the foot of their bed , climbing back in .
From the beginning , Moe 's demeanor surprised St. James and LaDonna .
He was gentle and well - behaved .
Moe seemed to take pains to avoid scratching anyone with his flat , sharp fingernails .
He was affectionate and loved to hug and kiss , throwing his hairy arms around St. James 's neck often .
And when he wanted St. James to sit down next to him , he'd bound over and softly push on the backs of his knees .
There was one bright day about 1973 .
For nearly half an hour , St. James and Moe had been frantically running back and forth , trying to catch falling leaves underneath a massive maple tree in the park .
St. James , exhausted , lay down on the grass .
" I need to rest , Moe . I can't run like you anymore . "
Moe , with all the energy and insistence of a seven - year - old boy , grabbed his hands , pulling him along .
They played for a while more before ending up in a heap on the grass again .
St. James looked at Moe and asked him a question : " What are you going to be when you grow up , Moe ? "
St. James and LaDonna had n't planned to keep Moe forever .
In truth , there never really was a plan .
At first , St. James thought he'd drop
Moe off at a zoo , but he says they all turned him away .
In time , it became clear that there was no way the couple was going to part with the chimpanzee .
So St. James and LaDonna kept Moe and raised him in their home .
They taught him how to eat with a fork , use a toilet , even , they say , how to crudely write his name .
Over the next thirty years , the Davises ' devotion to Moe would push the boundaries of human love .
It would also test the limits of that love .

Moe in cage
" Okay , then , now you 're talking , " St. James says after I offer to help him with his car .
We 'd been sitting outside his mother 's old home for a couple of hours , and it had become clear that St. James was far more concerned with getting work done on his car than talking about his life .
Zooming ahead in his motorized wheelchair , he leads me to the driveway , where the wooden frame of a 1923 Franklin is resting on a table .
It 's shaped like a six - foot - long tuning fork and is covered in rusty bolts and nails .
St. James is giddy .
His condition has kept him from working on the car for three years , so LaDonna has taken over the labor .
Having another pair of hands is priceless to him .
On his instructions , I pick up a hammer and start prying out some of the decaying bolts .
A half hour later , holding a yellow angle grinder , I 'm smoothing out a section of the gray fender as St. James provides an excruciatingly detailed real - time tutorial : " Okay , turn your thumb toward your nose .
Now drop your elbow two inches and press the machine against the metal .
You do n't have to be gentle . "
Watching from a few feet away , LaDonna is laughing .
She 's thin and pretty at age sixty - five .
Guided by her husband , she has taken apart the Franklin over the past three months .
Now she 's rubbing epoxy on the fender with a piece of cardboard .
St. James is less patient with her .
" LaDonna , what are you doing ? " he says as she applies the epoxy .
" It 's dripping all over the place . "
LaDonna does n't get flustered .
She knows he 's just frustrated .
After St. James commands her to pull out an extension cord , she laughs .
" I can do that , " she says , " because I love you so much . "
Later , over some In - N - Out burgers that we eat sitting around the Franklin , the couple begins to tell the story of their lives .
And , as it often does with St. James , it comes back to cars .
St. James and LaDonna were high school sweethearts in West Covina .
They dated for a few years before St. James reluctantly agreed to get married .
He was obsessed with cars and worried that marriage would put a wedge between him and his hot rods .
By 1966 , everything was in place for their wedding at a small brick church in West Covina , but St. James never showed up .
Instead , he spent the afternoon under the hood of one of his cars while LaDonna was left alone in the church before all their friends and relatives .
The following week was the worst of St. James 's life .
The story of the jilted bride became the talk of the neighborhood .
The entire town , it seemed , had turned against him .
When he saw the ad in the paper , he knew he had found his way out : A merchant ship was looking for deckhands for an around - the - world voyage , all expenses paid .
St. James had never been on a boat , but he did n't care .
What happened over the next several months altered the course of St. James 's life .
It is impossible to know for sure how he ended up with a baby chimpanzee .
The tale he tells strains credulity in places , but he recounts it passionately , in vivid detail .
By now , its facts are beyond any proof or evidence besides St. James 's earnest telling .
In any case , it seems to be what St. James has come to believe .
It goes like this :
The ship suffered damage off the coast of Africa , forcing it to come ashore in Tanzania .
Days later , while following a group of Tanzanians he befriended on a hunt , St. James witnessed a band of poachers slaughter a female chimpanzee just after she gave birth .
He returned the next day , found the helpless newborn chimp alive , and began caring for him .
St. James jumped ship , and for a period of several weeks and perhaps months , he provided for the animal , foraging for food , nurturing him with fruits , bird eggs , and rainwater as he searched for a way home .
St. James lost weight .
The chimp 's fingernails left him riddled with sores .
His ordeal finally ended when a tall villager , who called the chimp Mogambo , took St. James to German missionaries , who eventually secured him a flight bound for Los Angeles .
Moe sat on his lap on the plane .
He behaved like a prince .
By the time St. James stepped off the plane into the warm air outside Los Angeles International Airport , he was a changed man .
His imposing frame had wasted away .
His cheeks were hollow .
Gaping sores covered his face and neck .
And in his arms there was no luggage , only a baby chimpanzee .
Waiting for St. James inside the terminal was his mother , Estelle .
LaDonna was there , too , and she was seething .
She had n't seen him since the day before he left her at the altar .
St. James hugged his mother .
He and LaDonna locked eyes but did n't exchange words .
She was waiting for him to start explaining , and she had no idea what to make of the tiny monkey at his side .
St. James and LaDonna left the airport that day not knowing if they were ever going to speak again .
St. James brought the infant chimp to his mother 's home in West Covina .
He was tiny , about a foot long , and more playful than the most rambunctious child .
Then there were those big , brown eyes .
Estelle fell for him immediately .
LaDonna 's mother , who happened to be Estelle 's close friend , began coming over .
She , too , was captivated by Moe .
In time , LaDonna 's mom started dragging her daughter over to play with the chimp .
Like everyone else , LaDonna soon fell in love with Moe .
It was n't long before she also fell back in love with St. James .
The wedding , on June 6 , 1970 , was a modest affair , held at LaDonna 's parents ' home in West Covina .
Moe was St. James 's best man .
The four - year - old chimp , dressed in a tight - fitting black tuxedo , walked down the aisle holding hands with the flower girl as she tossed rose petals on the floor .
At the reception , Moe scampered from table to table , stealing sips of champagne .
When one of the guests , a friend of LaDonna 's mother 's , began sharing her glass with him , the chimp clung to her for the rest of the night .
Moe got drunk and pissed all over her pale yellow dress , which everyone in the room thought was about the funniest thing they 'd ever seen .
As St. James told his friends ,
Moe was the " bond between us two . "
That bond would only deepen with news they received less than a year into their marriage .
The couple had talked about having a large family , maybe as many as five children , and LaDonna had gone for a routine OB - GYN visit .
St. James was sitting in the waiting room with LaDonna 's mother when a doctor approached with a solemn expression .
The doctor told them that LaDonna had cancer and needed a hysterectomy .
She was in the exam room , crying .
LaDonna left the hospital with her mother and did n't come home .
She refused to see St. James .
She was overcome with guilt and began talking about a divorce , but St. James would have none of it .
" We already got a kid , " he reassured her .
They spent hours and hours on the phone , talking it through .
After five weeks , he convinced LaDonna that not having children should not drive them apart .
Moe would remain the couple 's only child .
So it was that an unconventional household began to transform into something truly different , even for southern California .
Over the next three decades , the Davises lived what they considered a near - perfect life .
They brought Moe along with them everywhere — to shopping malls , restaurants , weekend trips to the beach .
The couple bought a three - seat bike and rode around town with Moe in the middle .
And the chimpanzee , who developed a fondness for cheese burritos and coffee , took his meals with the couple at the kitchen table .
In time , as Moe grew , so did his notoriety .
Already an honorary citizen of West Covina — he 'd earned that distinction at the time of the trial —
Moe attended ribbon - cutting ceremonies and fundraisers , once manning a kissing booth at an Actors and Others for Animals event in Burbank with Doris Day and Lucille Ball .
The Davises fielded dozens of TV and movie requests for Moe .
He appeared in episodes of Sesame Street , Reading Rainbow , BJ and the Bear , and Bowling for Dollars and had bit parts in movies , including the 1975 comedy Linda Lovelace for President .
St. James , meanwhile , gained notoriety of his own .
Though he still earned most of his living through the auto - body shop he and LaDonna owned , St. James competed on the Nascar circuit , with Moe often appearing at his side for racing events .
The Davises ' feelings for Moe deepened as his behavior became more complex .
According to biologists , chimpanzees are humankind 's closest genetic relatives on earth .
The subtlety of Moe 's expressions and emotions could be uncanny .
There was the time with the peanut - butter - and - jelly sandwich .
Moe was obsessed with peanut - butter - and - jelly sandwiches .
Standing on a chair at the kitchen table , he 'd always make one for himself and then one for St. James .
One day , when he was about nine , there was n't enough peanut butter for a second sandwich .
Moe tried to cover up by overloading St. James 's bread with jelly .
But St. James reached for Moe 's sandwich , throwing him into a tantrum .
Moe stomped his feet and made gagging noises .
He stormed out of the kitchen , found LaDonna in her bedroom , and dragged her into the kitchen .
Indignant , he pointed at the sandwich , pointed at St. James .
Finally , St. James capitulated and offered Moe the good sandwich .
The chimp shook his head and refused to eat it .
As he matured , Moe began to understand no and yes .
He knew that shaking one 's head up and down meant okay and side to side meant disapproval .
Eventually , he developed his own form of sign language .
He 'd cross his arms over his chest and tap his shoulders to signal he wanted a hug .
He 'd motion as if he were turning a steering wheel back and forth when he wanted to go for a ride .
Moe 's playfulness continued through his teens and twenties .
One night in 1984 , the eighteen - year - old chimp methodically prepared his bed of multicolored blankets inside his cage in the backyard before bounding into the kitchen to give LaDonna a goodnight kiss .
She handed him a flashlight and a cup of hot chocolate .
Holding one in each hand , Moe carefully walked back into his cage and sat down .
He grabbed one of the blankets , draped it over his head , and began flicking the light on and off , on and off .
LaDonna could hear her boy making laughing noises as she headed for her bedroom .
By this point , of course , Moe looked nothing like the baby monkey who held hands with the flower girl at their wedding , a rascal straight out of Curious George .
He stood four feet tall , weighed roughly 130 pounds , and was covered in deep black fur .
Over the years , St. James had gone to the library and studied chimpanzee behavior .
He had learned what foods they eat and what their habits were .
And he'd also read that no matter how docile they were when young , chimpanzees could turn aggressive as they grew older .
" We had a really good relationship , " LaDonna says .
" There was no tugging and pulling .
Everybody kind of understood everybody .
It was a lot of harmony , a lot of happiness , a lot of fun . "
The Davises say they never saw aggressive behavior from Moe , even as he began to age .
And it 's true that Moe never harmed the couple .
" He was just such a happy little guy , " LaDonna says .
They 're still sitting near the car .
The sun is setting , but now St. James can't stop talking .
His hands are flying through the air as he talks about Moe .
" Listen closely now : I 've told this story to very few people , " he says more than once .
He talks over LaDonna frequently .
She barely seems to notice .
She 's hunched forward , her elbow on her knee , her face in her palm - clearly lost in the past .
Still , a huge smile spreads across her face when St. James taps me on the knee and says : " I used to tell people , ' My son is thirty years old , and he still wants to live at home . ' "
But what happened later in their lives is difficult for the Davises to discuss .
The details force them to pause often .
LaDonna buries her face in her hands .
At times , she shakes her head and keeps her eyes fixed on the ground .
St. James stares off into space .
He can't get through the next few minutes without breaking down several times .

St. James Davis after chimp attack
The unraveling of the Davises ' near - perfect life began on a hot day in August 1998 .
Moe was about thirty then , with broad shoulders , thick arms , and long fangs .
A welder who was repairing Moe 's cage accidentally left a piece of equipment turned on and gave the chimp an electrical shock , spooking him so intensely that he bolted out of the house .
Moe did n't return immediately .
The police were called , and they closed the street .
By the time the standoff ended , Moe had dented a police car , injured an officer 's hand , and scratched an animal - control agent .
A year later , on September 2 , 1999 , a visitor came to meet Moe .
The woman was told not to put her hand in his cage , but she did anyway .
Moe bit the tip of her finger .
Afterward , the Davises argued that Moe mistook her long red-painted fingernails for his favorite candy , licorice .
To the city , why Moe bit the woman did n't matter .
Now a mature ape and packing the upper - body strength of four or five grown men , Moe was too dangerous to remain at the Davises ' home , West Covina officials decided .
A team of officers arrived at about 2:00 p.m. the following day .
Police cars swarmed the street trailed by ambulances and fire trucks .
Officers cordoned off the streets surrounding the Davises ' home .
Moe was inside his cage when two cops arrived at the front door .
St. James confronted them .
" Where 's your court order ? " he demanded .
" Where 's your warrant ?
Get out of here ! "
A fiery argument broke out , and St. James was wrestled out of his house while cops and animal - control officers , some armed with dart guns , swarmed inside .
Moe screamed as one dart , then a second , pierced his stomach .
His shrieking turned into gagging noises as he furiously banged on his cage with his hands and feet .
St. James was on his knees on the front lawn , bawling , when Moe , unconscious and bleeding from the stomach , was carried out of the house and tossed into a horse trailer .
The Davises were broken .
They cried for hours , and they could n't sleep .
The community rescued them .
Four days after Moe 's removal , St. James checked his mailbox and found it filled with notes , cards , and a petition , titled " Citizens to Bring Moe Home . "
Within days , more than eight thousand people had signed , and many put yellow ON BOARD WITH MOE signs in their car windows .
Scores of people stopped by the house .
Even more honked in support as they drove by .
A single phone call punctured the Davises ' brief optimism .
It came nine days after Moe was taken , and it was from the operator of the facility Moe had been taken to — the Wildlife WayStation in the foothills of the Angeles National Forest , a 160 - acre refuge for exotic animals .
The woman on the line called to ask St. James a brutal question :
Have any arrangements been made for when the chimp dies ?
Moe had n't eaten since he arrived and was n't expected to live much longer .
The Davises rushed to the facility with a vet in tow .
They found Moe splayed on the floor of his tiny cage , covered in his own stool .
His eyes were vacant .
He was too weak to acknowledge them .
The vet injected Moe with a drug that perked him up immediately .
The court battles stretched for years .
Gloria Allred , a high - profile civil - rights attorney , took the Davises ' case pro bono .
The couple filed a due - process suit against the city as they fended off criminal charges once again for harboring a wild animal .
Animal - rights groups got involved .
The petition grew longer .
In a span of five months , more than twenty - four thousand people signed it .
St. James and LaDonna visited
Moe every week , all the while clinging to the hope that they would someday be reunited .
The visits sustained them , though they were also heartbreaking .
Moe started doing better after the couple installed a new cage complete with a TV three months after he arrived .
But the Davises — who were not permitted to come close enough to touch him during their fifteen - minute visits — could see the pain in Moe 's eyes .
He 'd signal that he wanted a hug .
He 'd put his hands up and turn an imaginary steering wheel .
He wanted to go home .
After extensive negotiations , in 2004 the couple succeeded in getting Moe transferred to Animal Haven Ranch , a private sanctuary near Bakersfield where they could visit him without restriction .
The sanctuary , tucked into rolling hills just a few miles south of Lake Isabella , was a home for exotic animals dumped mostly from zoos and circuses .
Its owners , Virginia and Ralph Brauer , had seven primates in all , but everyone agreed Moe , now thirty - eight — approaching elderly for a chimp , his flat brown face rimmed with gray — would remain alone in a specially built cage during his first few years there .
The arrangement was a dream compared with the Wildlife WayStation .
The Davises made the two - and - a - half - hour trip every week , delivering new toys for Moe and food for the other primates as part of the arrangement .
They 'd arrive early and spend all day with their boy , playing with him inside his cage .
On March 3 , 2005 , St. James and LaDonna drove to the sanctuary to celebrate Moe 's thirty - ninth birthday .
They left home early , around 7:00 a.m. , in a car filled with toys , presents , balloons , and a white - frosted sheet cake with raspberry filling .
After arriving at Animal Haven about 10:00 a.m. , St. James hopped out of the car and headed straight for Moe with a carton of chocolate milk in his hand .
Moe was going mad — clapping his hands and hooting happily .
LaDonna set the cake down on a picnic table , cut two slices , and handed them to St. James .
St. James handed one to Moe through the bars of his cage , and the animal 's eyes went wide as he devoured his piece .
LaDonna savored the moment .
The family had been through so much over the last six years .
Moe was finally at a place where he seemed content and where the couple could spend as much time with him as they wanted .
If they could n't ever live together again , this seemed like the next best thing .
St. James and Moe were kissing each other .
The moment was beautiful .
Perfect almost .
Out of the corner of her eye , LaDonna suddenly noticed a large form about forty feet away .
It was a chimpanzee , a young adult male , somehow out of his cage , and he was glaring at her .
The chimp held her gaze for a moment , and then charged .
St. James rushed to his wife .
The animal barreled into LaDonna 's back , knocking her into St. James .
She wrapped her arms around her husband 's neck , but the chimpanzee locked his jaws around the thumb of her left hand .
With a single , ferocious jerk of his neck , he tore it off .
St. James threw his hysterical wife under the picnic table and pushed her further underneath as the chimp tried to pursue her .
LaDonna was screaming commands — " No ! Stop ! Sit ! " — in a desperate bid to stop him .
The remaining cake was on the table , still in its box , but the chimp did n't go for it .
Instead he went after St. James .
As St. James confronted the chimp , the six - two former running back turned to find a second chimp — also a male , this one older and bigger — bearing down on him as well .
With both hands , he pushed the bigger animal .
Both chimps pounced .
One of the animals grabbed him in a bear hug before chomping into the bone above his right eyebrow .
He then stuck his finger in St. James 's right eye , gouging it out .
The same animal clamped his teeth onto St. James 's nose , biting it off , as the other chimp chewed away at St. James 's fingers .
In the melee , one of the chimps dug in his claws and ripped the skin off the right side of St. James 's face , causing it to flop over and cover his left eye , temporarily blinding him .
One of the primates sunk his teeth into St. James 's skull .
He then closed his jaws on St. James 's mouth , ripping off his lips and most of his teeth .
St. James tried to put one of his hands down the animal 's throat , but the chimp just kept chewing on it and chewing on it , and he could n't get it out .
St. James fell to the ground , no longer able to defend himself , and for at least five minutes , the mauling continued as he lay helpless .
One of the chimps gnawed on his buttocks and bit off his genitals .
They ravaged his left foot , leaving it shredded .
Blood poured from his body , and LaDonna was screaming .
It looked as if they were eating him alive .
Finally , LaDonna 's screams drew the owners ' son- in - law , Mark Carruthers , who came running armed with a . 45 - caliber revolver .
After struggling to find a clean shot , he opened fire on the younger primate .
The shot had no apparent effect , and Carruthers raced back to his house , a few dozen yards away , to reload with more - powerful ammunition .
When Carruthers returned , he focused on the older male , the prime aggressor .
Kneeling down , he shot him once in the head from close range .
As the animal fell to the ground , the younger chimp began dragging St. James 's mutilated body down a hill leading away from Moe 's cage .
Dirt filled St. James 's lungs and seeped into his bloody openings .
For the briefest of moments , LaDonna looked toward Moe .
He was sitting in the corner of his cage , frozen , seemingly stunned .
The lone chimp continued tearing at St. James 's limp body with his teeth until Carruthers caught up to him and shot him once in the chest , ending the attack .
St. James , lying facedown , felt the lifeless animal fall on his back .

An investigation later found that the chimps had escaped from their cage after one of the sanctuary 's owners failed to lock two of its three doors .
Animal behaviorists suggested the chimps ' aggression could have been caused by a number of factors , including jealousy over the attention the Davises lavished on Moe , an innate desire to defend their territory , or abuse they may have suffered at the hands of humans in the past .
Despite the ferocity of the attack , when the paramedics arrived , St. James was still conscious .
His face and body , however , were mutilated beyond recognition .
Where his mouth , lips , and nose had been there was only a bloody hole .
Where his right eye had been there was a pit .
Where his fingers had been he had only stumps or simply gaps .
" I had no idea a chimpanzee was capable of doing that to a human , " Kern County fire captain Curt Merrell , who was among the first on the scene , told the Los Angeles Times .
" It looked like a grizzly - bear attack . "
LaDonna kept repeating the same five words as St. James was loaded into an ambulance : " Do n't you die on me . "
She held on to his arm until the vehicle reached the main road , where St. James was lifted into a helicopter and rushed to a nearby hospital .
After arriving at Loma Linda University Medical Center , St. James was immediately put into a medically induced coma .
He would remain unconscious and in critical condition , and LaDonna rarely left his bedside .
St. James underwent dozens of surgeries .
LaDonna was in agony for him .
And — how could it be otherwise ? — she also worried about Moe .
She visited Moe the day before Mother 's Day .
And when doctors temporarily woke St. James up for the first time , in May , his first question was : " How 's Moe ? "
The couple 's dusty blue Dodge minivan has just pulled up near the Franklin on this Wednesday afternoon .
LaDonna hops out of the driver 's seat and rushes over to the side door .
She hauls out St. James 's wheelchair and places it on the ground just outside the passenger door .
After opening it , she links her arms under St. James 's armpits and grabs him around the back .
Grunting in pain , St. James slides his body so his legs are hanging out the door .
He then places his arms on LaDonna 's shoulders .
On the count of three , LaDonna hoists his massive frame out of the car , her thin body enveloped by his .
Teetering under St. James 's weight , she somehow guides him into the chair .
A few minutes later , St. James is sucking on a cherry ice pop as he describes how the attack has changed his life .
LaDonna is hovering over him with a cloth to wipe away the red slush spilling out of his mouth .
" I ca n't do anything on my own anymore , " St. James says , " except sit around like a potted plant . "
Three years after the attack , St. James is completely dependent on LaDonna .
He can not bathe himself , go to the bathroom , or even eat without her help .
He still has no teeth and limited control of his mouth .
His vision in his remaining eye is blurry .
His swollen , punctured left foot remains in grim condition .
The Davises were awarded $ 100,000 after the city settled their original due- process suit , but St. James says he does n't have enough money to afford a special boot for his mangled foot .
( The couple decided not to sue the ranch where they were attacked because it had no liability insurance . )
Doctors are now recommending amputation because he has contracted the MRSA superbug .
" They say if the MRSA activates while the wound is open , they probably could n't amputate the foot fast enough to save his life , " LaDonna says .
It 's not until later in the day that St. James starts crying .
It 's a loud , whooping wail .
His tears have nothing to do with what happened to him , though .
He never complains about the attack or how it left him .
He 's just begun talking about something that happened more recently — something that happened to Moe .
The phone call came around 11:00 a.m. last June 27 .
LaDonna answered .
On the other end of the line was Tammy Maples , co-owner of Jungle Exotics , a business that houses animals and rents them to the entertainment industry .
Moe had been transferred to Jungle Exotics ' sixty - acre sanctuary in the San Bernardino Mountains eight months earlier .
Just two days before the call , the couple had made the forty - five - minute drive to see their boy , a weekly ritual that , despite everything , they resumed in 2007 , when St. James was finally able .
Although the compound is on such uneven terrain that it prevented his wheelchair from approaching Moe 's cage , the trips were still the highlight of St. James 's week .
On this visit , they brought Moe a hairbrush and an old computer keyboard .
And they discussed their plans for their aging chimpanzee , chief among them installing solar panels on his facility , which would allow him to watch TV .
It would also enable the Davises to set up a video camera and monitor , so they could interact with him every day .
Maples 's voice on the line was shaky .
LaDonna was so stunned by what she heard that she asked Maples to repeat it .
" I want to let you know I went by Moe 's facility , and he 's not in it . "
" What do you mean he 's not in it ? " LaDonna said .
Moe , Maples said , had disappeared .
The couple sped to the ranch .
They were met by Joe Camp , Maples 's partner , who told them Moe had somehow broken off six steel welds from the cage , allowing him to open a sliding door and escape .
By the time St. James and LaDonna saw the enclosure , it had been repaired and cleaned .
LaDonna was perplexed .
The cage was spotless .
There were no blankets , there was none of Moe 's stool .
It was as if he had never been there .
She wanted to see his stool , how he had slept the night before .
She wanted to see what his thinking was .
A frantic search began .
For weeks , Jungle Exotics workers and volunteer searchers combed the dense brush around the facility on foot and in 4x4 vehicles .
St. James and LaDonna drove through the hills in their mini-van calling out for Moe .
Bloodhounds were brought in .
Helicopters flew overhead .
The search was a media sensation locally and drew national and international press attention as well .
The couple waited for news - and worried .
A month went by and still no trace of Moe was found .
The search was officially called off last July 31 .
Camp remains baffled as to how Moe escaped .
On the day of his disappearance , Moe 's enclosure was cleaned as part of the daily routine , he says , and his cage was repaired so quickly because he expected the chimp to be found within hours .
" We were hoping he 'd wander back in .
That 's what they usually do , " Camp says .
After
Moe inexplicably managed to break through the cage 's welds , workers spotted him hopping over a security fence before disappearing into the hills , Camp says .
" This was an animal that liked to be around people .
The mystery is why this animal left and where he went .
Or did somebody find him and move him off — we do n't know . "
St. James 's phone rings as LaDonna is rummaging through the garage for a pair of pliers .
It 's a call for her from a friend , and within seconds it 's clear she 's being asked about Moe .
After several months , there has n't been a single sighting of the chimpanzee .
The couple has received calls constantly since Moe went missing .
That 's the word they use : missing .
LaDonna protests the use of the word escape .
" We do n't know what happened , " she says .
St. James and LaDonna refuse to speculate about what led to Moe 's disappearance .
But with Moe gone , St. James is painfully lonely .
The two were so close , there was no room for anyone else except LaDonna .
Neighbors fascinated with the chimp stopped coming by years ago , and St. James 's racing days and the camaraderie they brought are long over .
" I can talk for days about Moe , " he says .
" I just miss him so much .
I 've never loved anything as much as I loved Moe . "
" We have n't heard anything new , " LaDonna , pacing in the driveway , tells her friend on the cell phone .
" Not a thing .
Oh , no , no , no , this is n't something that 's going to be unsolved .
It 's going to be solved . "
St. James and LaDonna expect to see their boy again .
The fruitless search convinced them Moe did not slip off into the woods .
Chimpanzees are social creatures .
Even in the wild , they are unlikely to venture off alone , St. James and LaDonna both explain , an assessment shared by primatologists .
Something else must have happened .
What exactly , they do not know .
But they 're convinced that Moe is alive somewhere .
" He was brought up to use his brain , " LaDonna says , " to always make decisions . "
Now it 's as if she 's talking to Moe : " There are lots of things here .
I want this tool , but maybe you do n't want that tool .
Or maybe I 'm going to eat this , but maybe you do n't want that .
There 's choices here , Moe .
Make the choice you want .
Think about it .
Think .
Do you want a yellow crayon or do you want this green one ? "
She pauses .
" I 'm hoping that wherever Moe is , he 's making good choices for himself . "
Much of the Davises ' lives today revolve around caring for St. James — getting him to doctors ' appointments , looking into new procedures , and simply negotiating the world given his physical difficulties .
Progress is slow but continuing .
By the end of the year , St. James hopes to have a new mouth and a fully formed left hand .
He 'll need to have his upper lip surgically reconstructed , then prosthodontists will outfit him with a special set of dentures so he can eat more easily and speak more clearly .
And doctors have already designed prosthetic fingertips for the three stumps on his left hand , which St. James hopes to be wearing in a matter of months .
St. James wants to one day work on his cars again .
His right hand presents more of a problem , though , since on that hand most of his thumb is gone and two fingers are missing entirely .
And of course , what 's also missing is Moe .
What became of Moe we simply can't know .
But what 's left in his place , as painful as the vestige of a lost limb , is the Davises ' singular devotion .
After all the years St. James and LaDonna shared with Moe and everything they 've endured , how could he be gone forever ?
How could they not someday see their boy again ?
A Clarification and a Correction
The article above includes the Davises 's account of their chimp , Moe , in the days after authorities seized him and placed him in an exotic - animal shelter .
The couple say his health quickly deteriorated , and he required their intervention to survive .
The operator of the facility , the Wildlife WayStation , disputes that version of events , and the story should have pointed this out .
The same article incorrectly reported that the Davises decided against suing a different animal shelter , Animal Haven Ranch , where St. James sustained grave injuries .
The Davises have indeed filed a personal - injury suit against the shelter in Kern County , California , Superior Court .
Trial is pending .

Time Lapse of Completing a Conceptis Maze-a- Pix
It was only early February this year when we told you about this very neat YouTube video titled Speed Drawing Madonna with Link - a - Pix and already we have another entertaining video to share here .
Time Lapse of Completing a Conceptis Maze - a- Pix is a 3 - minute music video by Joshua Christensen .
Other than being an avid fan of logic puzzles known as mrjoshua17 on conceptispuzzles.com , Christensen ( 31 ) is a pharmacist from Farmington , New Mexico , USA and loves playing with his time - lapse camera that can take a picture – such as those shown here - every second and then replay them at 15 frames - per-second .
Just like they used to do in those old animation films until computers came .
According to Christensen the making of the video took 45 minutes : " I love the Conceptis website and mostly do the Link - a - Pix and the Fill - a - Pix puzzles since I can do them on - line .
But my favourite ones are the Maze - a - Pix puzzles .
I print out all weekly Maze - a - Pix and Dot - a - Pix puzzles and do them when I can , so I also made this little video . "
The music is a song named Magilla by Phish from their album A Pictures of Nectar .

CONCORD , N.H. , April 29 ( Reuters ) - New Hampshire ’s Senate passed a bill on Wednesday that would legalize same - sex marriage after an amendment was added that prohibits polygamy and marriage of family members , among other measures .
Governor John Lynch has not indicated if he will veto the bill , which passed the Senate by a vote of 13 - 11 and would make New Hampshire the fifth state in the nation where gay marriage is legal .
But the Democrat has expressed opposition to it .
It has already passed the state ’s House of Representatives .

Fermentation vessels : Buckets Vs. Better Bottles Vs. Glass Carboys Vs. Plastic Water Bottles Vs. Corney Kegs
Cheap
Readily Available
Opaque , which prevents skunking
Easy to modify if they are n't pre-drilled for an airlock
Light weight
Built in handle
Wide opening makes cleaning a breeze
Wide opening also makes sanitation a breeze .
Spray it with sanitizer , then just flip it upside down to drain
Unimpressive looking
Lids often seal poorly .
While this is n't a bad thing for people who know what they 're doing , it often scares the new folk when they do n't see their airlock bubbling
Plastic scratches easily , which can harbor bacteria
Opaque , so you can't see the beauty of fermentation
Some use gaskets instead of drilled stoppers .
These gaskets love to fall into the beer when an airlock is added .
Ca n't use a wort wizard with a bucket
Even with careful handling and proper care , a bucket wo n't last you a lifetime
If you do get an infection ( which is uncommon , borderline rare with proper sanitation ) you 'll most likely have to throw away any plastic equipment to prevent further batches from becoming infected .
Generally they have a lot of headspace .
This is n't a problem for primary fermentation , as CO2 will displace the air in your bucket .
It can , however , pose a problem if you 're using it for a secondary .
You can boil a few thousand marbles to sanitize them , then rack your beer on top of that .
Seems like more hassle than it 's worth to me , but I do n't usually secondary
Less expensive than glass carboys
Transparent , so you can watch the fermentation
Firm seal with a cheap stopper , so you can be sure to get that happy music out of your airlock
Wider mouth than glass carboys .
You can insert a seriously massive blowoff tube .
Light weight .
Easier to move and cheaper to ship than glass carboys .
Also easier to sanitize than glass carboys if you use the Llama method of 1 gallon of water , Star San , and shaking the **** out of it for a few minutes
Has a handy indentation on the underside .
This makes aeration a breeze if you stick a tennis ball underneath and just spin it like mad
Looks pretty cool compared to a bucket
Can come with a built in racking set up
Easier to drain Star San out of .
If you fear the foam , you can flip it upside down over the sink and give it a few gentle squeezes .
That puffs most of the foam out
Nearly indestructible .
Edwort made a nice video on Youtube about how tough they are .
The racking modification easily doubles the price
More expensive than buckets
Transparent , which can allow light in .
Easily remedied by draping a dark t- shirt over the BB
Cannot handle negative pressure .
You can still use a wort wizard with them , but you have to burp them a few times
Made of plastic , which can become scratched if you try to use a carboy brush on them
Only available in 3 , 5 , and 6 gallon sizes .
If you 're making a big beer , and using a 6 gallon primary BB , you can expect a decent blow off .
If you 're using a 5 gallon BB for primary for just about any beer , you can bet on blow off 90 % of the time
If you make a post about how much you love better bottles on HBT , someone will inevitably chime in about oxygen permeability
If you do get an infection ( which is uncommon , borderline rare with proper sanitation ) you 'll most likely have to throw away any plastic equipment to prevent further batches from becoming infected .
Any plastic gear you use will eventually need to be replaced .
Sorry , but it just wo n't last forever
You can find them anywhere
Cheap
Less expensive than glass carboys
Translucent , so you can watch the fermentation
Firm seal with a cheap stopper , so you can be sure to get that happy music out of your airlock
Light weight .
Easier to move and cheaper to ship than glass carboys .
Also easier to sanitize than glass carboys if you use the Llama method of 1 gallon of water , Star San , and shaking the **** out of it for a few minutes
You can drill a hole and install a bulkhead to create a racking modification similar to that used with better bottles
Some of them have built in handles
Some are n't made of # 1 or # 2 plastic , making them unsuitable for our purposes
IMHO , they look cheaper than the buckets
If you do get an infection ( which is uncommon , borderline rare with proper sanitation ) you 'll most likely have to throw away any plastic equipment to prevent further batches from becoming infected .
Translucent , which can allow light in .
Easily remedied by draping a dark t- shirt over the bottle
Made of plastic , which can become scratched if you try to use a carboy brush on them
Cannot handle negative pressure .
You might still be able to get away with a wort wizard if you burp it as with a BB
Any plastic gear you use will eventually need to be replaced .
Sorry , but it just wo n't last forever
Does have higher oxygen permeability , so you might not want to bulk age in a water bottle for more than a few months
They just plain look awesome .
If you 're going for the mad scientist look , glass is the way to go
They can be cleaned with a carboy brush .
You can scrub the crap out of them without fear
Can handle negative pressure , if you use a wort wizard
With proper care , they can outlive you
Transparent , so you can watch the fermentation
You get a great seal , so your airlock will bubble away happily
Most any homebrew store will have tubing that fits straight into the neck for a pretty big blowoff tube
Most any homebrew store will sell accessories specifically made for glass carboys .
Carriers , caps , blow off tubes , etc ...
Drop it once , and it's a dead carboy
Many people have had to go to the hospital because of glass carboys .
Gotta be careful with these things .
See this : Broken Glass Carboy Horror Stories Compendium
Most expensive fermenter on this list
Heaviest fermenter on this list .
Makes cleaning and aeration harder , and makes shipping much more expensive
Recently glass carboys have seen a huge degradation in manufacturing quality .
We 've seen a few break for what seemed like no reason
just thought I 'd take the time to clear up a few common newbie issues about which product is better .
Just so we 're clear , for 99 % of these issues , both options work equally well .
It 's usually just a matter of preference , so I thought I 'd assemble a list of pros and cons of the most frequently asked about products .
( Please note that this list does not include conical fermenters .
Odds are , if you are willing to invest that kind of money , you probably already know the sweeping benefits of a conical .
That , and I 'm poor , and can't afford a conical , so I have no experience there . )
Pros:Cons : Pros:Cons: Pros:Cons:Pros:Cons:Pros:1 .
No glass carboys to break .
2 . No delicate plastic surfaces to scratch and consequently harbor bacteria .3 .
No UV worries .
4 . Very tolerant to temperature .
5 . Convenient carry handles .
6 . Interchangeable vessels / streamlined process .
I can ferment , age , bottle and serve from all the same containers .
7 .
Not finicky to sanitize , I can use whatever product I want .
8 . Dented cornies can be hammered back out with a rubber mallet .
9 .
Can be stored sanitized and pressed with a little CO2 more or less indefinitely , thus I can brew anytime without having to check if the primary is clean .
10 .
All one container type .
I usually wait until I have three or four ( used , rinsed ) backed up before I bother breaking out the OxyClean .
11 .
Since I can harvest yeast out of cornies I am somewhat less interested even in conicals .
12 .
Can tolerate spunding valves / pressurized primary ferments .
13 .
Carboy brush is quaint reminder of bygone era .14 .
Cornies tolerate sharpie marker labels directly on bare steel , cleans up easily with hot water , OxyClean , green scrubber .
Just to the side of the black post in case of drips ... Cons : 1 . More expensive than buckets , more expensive than carboys .
Cheaper than conicals though ;-) 2 . O-rings are less durable than glass .
3 . Several parts to keep track of , organizational skills required .
4 . Multiple surfaces means cornies are less forgiving of marginal sanitation pratices .
BCHL Hockey Player Tries To Fight Everyone On The Ice Including The Referee
Total Pro Sports – During a British Columbia Hockey League ( BCHL ) , Doyle Cup Regional Championship game between the Vernon Vipers and the Grande Prairie Storm a melee ensued after Storm enforcer Elias Grossmann elbowed Vipers ’ forward Bryce Kakoske into the boards with 26 second left in the game .
Storm ’s Elias Grossmann was looking for someone to fight as his team was about to lose the game 6 - 2 to the Vipers .
But the only problem was that Grossmann who had lost his mind , skated around the rink trying to fight any Viper he could get his hands on .
“ Grossmann lost his cool trying to pick a fight with the other Vipers on the ice , who , realizing Hockey Canada ’s one - fight rule was in effect ( meaning they ’d miss the next game ) , declined . ”
Grossmann also got tangled up with the referee and at one point was fighting him off to get to the other Vernon Vipers players that were still on the ice .
But somehow the refs regained control of the enforcer and escorted him off the ice .
“ As Grossmann was being forcibly escorted off the ice by Liefke , he spat in the linesman ’s face .
Referee Andrew Guest handed the former Penticton Vee a match penalty . ”
This is why some fans of the game want fighting removed from hockey because if this was in a parking lot , Elias Grossmann would have been charged .
So we want to hear what you think about fighting in hockey , video after the poll .

A friend of mine asked me to help her with creating a portfolio website for a friend of hers , who is an artist .
The site will be somewhat similar to QuickHoney 's web site :
It will be Javascript based , relatively simple in terms of layout , and self maintainable , i.e. the artist will be able to add and update the website without the need for HTML programming .
The site will be hosted on a cheap , no - frills shared web host .
On the server , it will consist of static files .
The portfolio data set - Projects , descriptions , dates - will be stored in JSON formatted files .
Manipulation of the data set will be done with a special Javascript application for content management .
The site will contain various media data : Photos , MP3 audio tracks , videos hosted by a video hoster .
Some parts of the content management tasks cannot be performed by Javascript in the browser :
Image manipulation , in particular rescaling .
Provide information about MP3 audio tracks
Fetching video information from the video hoster
Uploading data to the web hoster
These tasks require some program that runs outside of the browser ; obviously , they are performed by a http server running on the artist 's box .
My first impulse was to implement these functions in Common Lisp .
Image manipulation is easy , using Edi Weitz ' excellent CL - GD library .
MP3 information should be easy enough to read using Peter Seibel 's code from Practical Common Lisp .
Parsing information from the video hoster would be easy , as that information is available both in XML and JSON formats , and Gilbert Baumann 's and David Lichteblau 's Closure XML Parser which I enjoy to use a lot .
Lastly , uploading data to the web host should be possible using CL - FTP which I had not used before .
Exit Common Lisp
I spent a few evenings hacking CL - FTP so that it fits my library set and trying to find a sufficiently complete MP3 parsing library , played with dumping images so that startup times would be short .
In between , I played with jQuery , HTML and CSS to get the user visible parts of the site into shape .
Sadly , I made much better progress and had a lot more fun hacking Javascript than fooling around with Common Lisp and incomplete libraries .
At one point , I decided that I need to make more progress and that I should reconsider my strategy for the CMS server .
I decided that my second choice for the CMS server language would be Javascript .
I 'd rather write both client and server in Common Lisp , but that is not how the world looks like .
Enter Javascript
I spent a few hours shopping for server - side Javascript solutions .
The open source Javascript based web servers are either based on the SpiderMonkey or the Rhino Javascript implementations , both by the Mozilla foundation .
SpiderMonkey is written in C , thus extending it requires libraries using the C calling convention .
Rhino is written in Java , and it gives Javascript applications direct access to libraries written in Java .
As I am developing on Windows , but the artist is using a Mac , Rhino looked a lot more attractive .
After looking at some project web pages picked from the Wikipedia entry on Server - side Javascript , I decided to give Axiom Stack a spin .
I chose it because it is a real Javascript framework ( using Prototypes , not mimicking classes ) , has easy - to - follow getting started documentation , provides for persistent objects similar to the BKNR datastore and has active support .
My application is not quite typical for applications implemented with Axiom Stack .
Usually , the server would be used by the site 's users , too .
My server manipulates the static files that make up the web site , and is basically a slave to the CMS application that runs in the browser .
Thus , I am not using Axiom Stack 's persistent object store in this application .
Enslave Java
I have never developed a very friendly relationship to Java , despite the fact that when I chose to use it for one reason or another , I had no trouble with it .
Java is great , as long as someone else writes code in it .
Being able to call Java from Javascript is really nice , though , as there are so many libraries out there .
In Rhino , Java libraries can be just used .
Thus , as Axiom Stack has no " native " MP3 reading facilities , I grabbed a Java MP3 library off the net and used that :
importPackage ( Packages.de.vdheide.mp3 ) ; function sound_list ( ) { var dir = '../../../ files/sound/' ; return MochiKit.Base.map ( function ( filename ) { var pathname = dir + filename ; var mp3 = new MP3 File ( pathname ) ; return { filename : filename , title : id3.getTitle ( ) , length : mp3.getLength( ) } } , ( new axiom . SystemFile( dir ) ) .list (/\.mp3$ /i ) || [ ] ) ; }
Hacking away
The functioncan be used to import a Java package into the current name space .
Java objects can be instantiated like Javascript object using theoperator .
Strings and numbers returned by Java can be handled like any other Javascript object .
I particularily like the fact that what you see above really is all code that is required to use a Java library .
No interface generator or mapping layer is needed .
At the same time , I can continue to use MochiKit , which is a Javascript library that I like for its nice functional programming abstractions .
Since I have solved my server problem , I have made great progress with the application .
Switching between client - side and server side programming is really easy now .
No more procastinating because the other side 's mindset does not happen to be there .
No more accidential typing of " the other " syntax .
Though I must say , I 'm glad to have a Lisp job , too ! :)
COLUMBUS , Ohio 
In wide - ranging remarks here , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg defended the use of foreign law by American judges , suggested that torture should not be used even when it might yield important information and reflected on her role as the Supreme Court ’s only female justice .
The occasion was a symposium at the Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University honoring her 15 years on the court .
“ I frankly do n’t understand all the brouhaha lately from Congress and even from some of my colleagues about referring to foreign law , ” Justice Ginsburg said in her comments on Friday .
The court ’s more conservative members  Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas  oppose the citation of foreign law in constitutional cases .
“ If we ’re relying on a decision from a German judge about what our Constitution means , no president accountable to the people appointed that judge and no Senate accountable to the people confirmed that judge , ” Chief Justice Roberts said at his confirmation hearing .
“ And yet he ’s playing a role in shaping the law that binds the people in this country . ”

A NESL file can be loaded , translated to lisp and compiled into an object file , so that subsequent loads of the file will be significantly faster .
This version has been tested on Allegro Common Lisp , CMU Common Lisp and gcl , with most testing being done on Allegro .
It is expected to run on Kyoto and Lucid common lisps , and on clisp .
Although we have done a reasonable job testing it , it is likely not to be as robust as the VCODE version .

Overall the VCODE - based sequential implementation of NESL is very reliable and we have found few bugs in the past year , even though we have had many users .
The Cray C90 version is also quite reliable .
The MPI version is a little less stable , largely because MPI implementations are changing at a rapid rate .

TORONTO - The Maple Leafs are going to aggressively pursue a top NHL entry draft spot , perhaps even the No. 1 position , says GM Brian Burke .
Going into the draft lottery Tuesday night , Toronto was seventh in the selection order and could move up a maximum of four spots if it wins the weighted draw .
Burke intends to be wheeling and dealing before the top teen talent is dispersed in Montreal with an eye on landing highly touted forward John Tavares .
" We 'll immediately attempt to move up , " Burke said during a news conference Tuesday morning .
" We 're going to talk to everyone between us and the first pick and see what the landscape is .
" We 're going to see what it costs and we 're going to try and move up . "
Anybody on his roster , with the exception of standout rookie defenceman Luke Schenn , might go in a package that would be required to get a higher position .
" No player is untradeable , " said Burke .
" Wayne Gretzky got traded . "
Burke has a history of draft coups , most notably the ones that landed him Chris Pronger when he managed the Hartford Whalers and maneuverings that procured the services of the Sedin twins for the Vancouver Canucks .
So , teams will be ready for his spiel this time .
" I do n't think we 're going to sneak up on anyone , " he said .
" They 've seen that movie . "
He would n't necessarily need the No. 1 spot to draft Tavares , he said .
" I 'm not confident every team has John Tavares as No. 1 , " said Burke .
Toronto finished 12th in the Eastern Conference for the second year in a row and has n't been in the playoffs since 2004 , but that was long before Burke was handed the reins .
There were some positive developments this season , he said .
The development of " our young guns " was encouraging and the recent signings of top U.S. college prospects Christian Hanson and Tyler Bozak provides talent depth .
Pitches have been made to land defenceman Matt Gilroy of the NCAA - champion Boston Terriers and free - agent Swede Jonas Gustavsson , who Burke considers the top goalie outside the NHL .
Burke also says he 'll be active in seeking unrestricted free agents once they become available July 1 .
Vesa Toskala , who played in pain much of the season , should be fit enough in the autumn to retain the No. 1 goaltending job , says Burke .
Gustavsson would be backup if the Leafs land him .
" The goal for next year is to make the playoffs , " Burke said .
" If that 's not the goal of every GM , they should get out of the business .
" We 're building here to win a championship and the first step is to make the playoffs . "
The Leafs might have qualified for the post - season had they won some of the close ones they dropped during the winter , he said .
" If we had better goaltending and found a way to win those games , we'd be right there , " Burke said .
" We could have traded Luke Schenn this year and made the playoffs " but that would n't have been in the team 's long - range interests .
Burke said he and head coach Ron Wilson have progressed in their attempt to end the " culture of entitlement " some players feel when they play for the Leafs .
" Anyone who thinks he's on this roster because he has a contract is sadly mistaken , " he said , adding a mention that the buyout option kicks in July 1 .
Burke , as he has in the past , stressed that his only concern is to bring the Leafs a championship .
" I want to make the playoffs and have a parade here , " he said .
" I have no ego involved in this .
" I 'm not trying to put any personal stamp on the team .
I just want to win . "
There remains no timetable to select a captain , he added : " This is the Toronto Maple Leafs so that decision has to be made with great care . "
Wilson said he expects to have a fitter team next season that wo n't get worn down by opponents as was often the case this past season .
Workout regimens have been distributed .
" We have a system in place where we 'll be able to monitor everyone 's progress on a week - to - week basis , " he said .
Toronto had the league 's worst goals - against average .
Goaltending , injuries and conditioning were to blame , said Wilson .
Like Burke , he backed Toskala .
" I 'm confident Vesa is going to bounce back next season , " said Wilson .
It was clear that Wilson expects Burke will be making numerous personnel changes this summer .
" This environment is going to change and I expect it to be changing rapidly , " he said .
Wilson picked the previous team he coached , the San Jose Sharks , to win the Stanley Cup .
Adding Rob Blake and Dan Boyle to their power play was a big boost .
" They have to find a way to score 5 - on - 5 and if they can do that they should be able to win the whole thing , " Wilson said .
Dick Severance studied martial arts from 1955 till 2009 .
He originally studied and taught Japanese Go Ju Ryu Karate for 24 years , and operated a karate dojo for many years in Palm Bay , Florida .
One day , in 1979 , Dick received a flyer in the mail from Larry Beaver , who operated a Karate dojo in Atlanta , GA along with Stephen Hayes ( now Bud Malmstrom 's school ) .
Steve was living in Japan and was teaching a seminar while visiting the US .
This was the first U.S. dissemination of the art he was studying in Grandmaster Masaaki Hatsumi 's dojo in Japan .
Dick attended that seminar and since then , he has become one of a handful of Ju Go Dan ( fifteenth - degree black belt ) instructors under Grandmaster Hatsumi , and has been traveling across the country , studying and teaching this incredible art , Budo Taijutsu .
Dick Severance was a craftsman of fine Custom Training Tools used by martial arts practitioners around the world .
Dick was a veteran of the US Navy , where he was trained as a mineman and underwater swimmer .
He was an avid scuba diver , snorkeler and swimmer and shared this expertise with many students through the years .
The dust and gas in this portion of the Orion ’s cloud glows green with the light of nearby stars .
Here young stars gobble up surrounding material , some of which is cast into space in jets .
These jets can be seen near the top of the image as small pink arcs , knots , and filaments .
This view of the nebula combines images taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope ( Image : UKIRT / JAC / Spitzer Telescope )
This jet ( red ) is speeding from a busy star - forming region in Orion ’s cloud .
The wisps and knots visible here are all associated with young stars , which appear orange in this image .

Dozens of high - speed jets of gas in a crowded stellar nursery have been traced to the stars from which they emanate .

The well - known Orion nebula , which sits some 1300 light years from Earth , is just a small portion of a much larger stellar nursery ( see map ) .
This entire “ molecular cloud ” spans a region on the sky as wide as 20 full moons but is largely obscured by gas and dust .
Now observations at a range of wavelengths have cut through this interference to reveal some of the violent activity in the cloud .
This activity includes jets of gas that stretch for millions of kilometres away from young stars .
Magnetic fields slingshot material around the stars outwards , creating the dramatic structures .
An international team of astronomers compared 10 - year - old infrared observations of the cloud with new data taken with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope in Hawaii , the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope , and a radio telescope called IRAM .
They measured the speeds and directions of stellar jets in the cloud , tracing most of the 110 or so jets they found to specific young stars .
“ Measuring the speeds and directions of the jets is essential to pinpoint the driving sources , especially in such crowded regions , ” says team member Dirk Froebrich of the University of Kent .
The images were released on Monday at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society in the UK .

So Phorm , the web - shaping privacy - invading ad- mongers and previously purveyors of evil bastard spyware , have taken their “ really , we ’re not evil ” astroturfing campaign to the next level , with a truly bizarre website called Stop Phoul Play .
The Phorm - owned site tells us that , actually , far from compromising our browsing privacy they just want to make things better and safer for everyone .
Best of all , it ’s fronted with a letter from Phorm ’s lackey - in - chief Simon Davies ( of Phorm - paid privacy consultancy 80/20 Thinking and Privacy International who recently wanted to shut down Google ’s Streetview service ) which uses quite remarkable language .
While the site itself uses terms like “ privacy pirates ” to describe campaigners from NoDPI , a group vocal in their opposition to Phorm , Simon Davies goes on to not - so - obliquely suggest that the NoDPI campaign is less motivated by privacy concerns but by influence – or indeed money – brought to bear on the matter by Phorm ’s competitors .
The site does a brilliantly hamfister Derek - Draper - esque job of attempting to smear a campaign respresenting a valid concern .
It ’s distasteful for so many reasons ; first off , the use of the hyper - paranoid conspiracy - wingnut term ” privacy pirates ” to describe privacy campaigners with a very valid complaint is ludicrous its subtle implications ; we have all been told , after all , that “ pirates ” are part of a global network of evil which , amongst other nefarious activities , supports international terrorism and paedophilia , through the pirates ’ distribution of copyright material .
The implication by Mr Davies that “ there ’s a possibility by any standards in the real world that they are also taking money or advice from them or that they have some other vested interest ” is more than a little disingenuous , given that this is exactly the position he found himself in when he was consulting for Phorm through 80/20 while campaigning on other privacy issues through Privacy International .
Brilliantly , Phorm ’s Phoul Play outburst has been picked up by the FT ’s Paul Murphy and Neil Hume in their Alphaville Markets Live session for today , with Hume and Murphy calling the site “ pixelated rage from [ Phorm ’s ] CEO Kent Ertugrul ” and saying that it “ looks like Ertugrul might have lost the plot … not really the sort of thing the CEO of a listed company should be doing .
You know this is a huge sell signal , when companies get this aggressive with their critics and the press ” .
It ’s also worth taking a look at Phorm ’s hugely amusing animated presentation explaining how Phorm works .
It ’s a combination of millinery and “ instant data incenerators ” apparently ;
Phorm puts a “ hat ” on your “ unique ID number ” ( which absolutely and definitely can’t ever be traced back to you or anything personally identifiable like IP address ) before tossing the webpages you ’ve viewed into their “ instant data incenerator ” .
One of the best things about the presentation is the first screen , which includes a logo for their adware technology “ Open Internet Exchange ” in the bottom left of the screen , sort of in the place you might expect to see an endorsement from another company .
In this context , I wonder how much of a coincidence it is that “ Open Internet Exchange ” sounds a bit like good things such as the Open Rights Group ?
I ca n’t help feeling that the positioning of the brand logo with no real context is misdirection on their part , in the hope that people will just see “ Open Internet ” and think “ oh , well that must be a good thing , and look !
Phorm is endorsed by these Open Internet folks ” .
Edit :
After his comment below , I found this great post on Jamie Dowling ’s blog about why probably Phorm is not anonymous after all :
Do you still believe that the claims of companies like Phorm when they say nothing identifiable is recorded by their ( still to be proven legal ) DPI product “ Webwise ” ?
I never have .
This confirms my beliefs and affirms my position as an opponent of Phorm and any peddler of DPI technology to snoop on ISP customers .
In their paper “ De- Anonymising Social Networks “ , Arvind Narayanan and Dr Vitaly Shmatikov from the University Of Texas at Austin present a method by which supposedly “ anonymous ” data can be turned back into identifiable names and addresses .
This is a very disturbing development .
The main lesson of this paper is that anonymity is not sufficient for privacy when dealing with social networks .
There ’s also a great rundown on the issues surround Phorm in his post “ A Few Facts About Phorm for Newcomers “ .
What did they have in Russian shops during the Soviet Era when all the shops in Russia belonged to the state and the state was the only merchant ?

The irony of increasing jail time for gang members is that it actually increases the number of members in gangs and the number of gangs .
Many gangs were started and all are expanded by recruitment in jail .
I learned first hand why a person would feel compelled to join a gang while imprisoned .
In my few days in Kamloops Regional Correction Centre for cannabis trafficking I found that well over half the 38 inmates on my range belonged to one of 2 gangs .
They basically run the block by controlling the phones , the gym , the yard , and any trustee positions .
Anyone not in a gang will find themselves constantly challenged and intimidated .
I saw a 19 - year - old being pressured to fight by an inmate who , I was warned , is “ cold ” .
This 19 - year - old had no choice but to seek protection from one of the established prison gangs .
I ’m afraid to know what this kid would be expected to do in return for his “ protection ” .
And what happens in prison does n’t necessarily stay in prison .
The gang organization carries on outside the prison as well .
A guard warned me that if I felt endangered and opted for protective custody ( PC ) that my life would be worth “ shit ” inside and outside the prison .
PC usually means the person is a snitch and the word will get around .
Most established gang members have absolutely nothing to fear when going to prison .
Since they run the place they are well protected .
Increased prison time is definitely not a deterrent for them .
Gangs are fueled by the demand for substances which the government has prohibited as we learned during alcohol prohibition .
Bill C - 15 would finance gangs and aid in their proliferation making Canada more dangerous for all of us .

I invited Abdullah Almalki to breakfast in Ottawa but he only took coffee .
And while I wolfed down my all - English breakfast in the Chateau Laurier Hotel ( beloved of Churchill and Karsh of Ottawa fame ) , he sipped gingerly at his cup with much on his mind .
Snooped on by the Canadian secret service and then tortured in Syria while the Canadian authorities did nothing for him – save supplying his perverted torturers with questions – he had much to think about .
A carbon copy of Binyam Mohamed , the British resident who had his penis cut up while the Brits sent questions to his perverted Moroccan torturers .
In Abdullah Almalki 's case , he was n't renditioned .
He simply flew into Damascus to see his Syrian family , got banged up in the city 's secret police headquarters and was then beaten into submission , not much different from an even more famous case – that of Maher Arar , who was a Canadian citizen and got renditioned to Damascus by the Americans while the US authorities sent questions to his perverted Syrian torturers .
Arar has received apologies from US senators – though not from the war hero George Bush ( battle honours : the skies over Texas during the Vietnam conflict ) -- and compensation from the Canadian government .
The details of each case are shockingly similar .
Tim Hancock of Amnesty International has supplied similar information on Khaled al - Maqtari , a Yemeni man , who was apparently threatened with rape and beaten in chains by his perverted American torturers .
Western nations simply assisted the perverts by providing them with pages of questions while their citizens / residents lay in agony , wishing they had never been born .

In the case of Abdullah Almalki , four interrogations by the Canadian " secret service " ( its acronym – CSIS – inspires more laughter than fear ) preceded his departure from Canada and the collapse of his business and subsequent residence in Malaysia .
He and his wife had run an electronic components export business in Ottawa which prompted CSIS 's suspicions .
Was he sending funds or components to " terrorists " ( the quotation marks are , of course , obligatory since CSIS was not worried about the " terrorists " who run the Syrian secret service and who were later to torture Abdullah Almalki on Canada 's behalf ) .
For months , he was held in a secret service hellhole in Damascus and whipped with steel while the Syrians acted upon a Canadian letter to them ( dated 4 October 2001 ) which stated that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were suggesting that Mr Almalki was linked through association with al - Qa'ida and engaged in activities that posed an " imminent threat " to the public safety and security of Canada .
Readers who doubt this outrageous letter to the Syrian dictatorship can check page 400 of the Iacobucci report which was drawn up with government assistance after Almalki 's release .
The RCMP – the famous Mounties – also sent letters to Canadian government liaison officers in Islamabad , Rome , Delhi , Washington , London , Berlin and Paris , identifying Almalki as an " important member " of al - Qa'ida .
For more information , you must read Kerry Pither 's brilliant account , Dark Days : The Story of Four Canadians Tortured in the Name of Fighting Terror , which is scandalously unavailable in Britain .
The purpose of setting out these awful accounts is not to piss on Canadians .
Canada is a great and real democracy , albeit weighed down with too much political correctness .
I once remember an immigration officer at Toronto airport explaining to an Asian visitor that he was n't to allow himself to be interrogated by the police without a lawyer and that he was free to speak and move wherever he wanted in Canada .
The finest immigration guy in the world , I thought to myself .
The lads and lasses at the Heathrow immigration desks do n't come up to that standard .
No , I do n't think Canada as a nation is to blame for all this .
But the West is .
For it is our public servants in government and our secret service thugs who have been in league with all these perverted men around the world .
Indeed , even when Almalki was freed from his Syrian prison , Canadian embassy officials in Damascus would not allow him to stay in their building and ordered him out when the embassy closed at 4 pm .
One of them reportedly later told Almalki that Canada regularly gave passports to the families of leading Syrian officials .
Can this be true ?
I do know that the Syrians quite recently complained mightily to the Americans as well as the Canadians .
First , the West sent its prisoners to be tortured in Damascus – and then complained that Syria abused human rights !
Quite so .
Bashar Al - Assad has put a stop to quite a lot of torture in Syria and now that President Obama is sending his cohorts to woo the Syrians , they presumably wo n't be called on to do America 's ( or Canada 's ) dirty work any more .
But I want to know why those complicit in Almalki's torture – the letter writers , the composers of questions – cannot be tried in court .
They are , at the least , accomplices to human rights abuses .
So are the Brits who went to question tortured men in Guantanamo .
Even more so are the American perverts who indulged in their own torture in Afghanistan and Iraq – and yes , I have noted that our dear President Obama is allowing the illegal detention of prisoners at Bagram in Afghanistan to continue .
But what else would you expect from a man whose secretary of state , Lady Hillary , far from going to the Palestinians whose homes were going to be destroyed by the Israelis in Jerusalem and denouncing this outrage , said merely that the home demolitions were " unhelpful " .
So , in the long term , is torturing prisoners .
Abdullah Almalki drove me to Ottawa airport in the snow after our breakfast , admitting that he was still too mentally broken by his months of Syrian torture to find employment .
CSIS does n't follow him any more as he says it used to before he left Canada for Asia and then the the hell of Syria .
No one tailed our car .
No one says any more that Almalki is guilty .
On the other hand , no one will say he is innocent .
But there are an awful lot of men in Western governments who should be in the dock .
They wo n't be , of course .
And oh yes – just in case you missed it – Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has just admitted that Canadian troops in Afghanistan are not going to win a military victory there .
Just think .
All that torture – for nothing .
IN ONE policy area , at least , there is good news for President Barack Obama : his pledge to find alternative energy sources to wean America off its dependence on foreign oil is already being put into action .
Last year America ramped up wind - power capacity to 25 gigawatts ( GW ) , overtaking the previous leader , Germany , according to new data from the Global Wind Energy Council .
America added 8.4GW of installed power in 2008 , more than any other country .
China is also investing heavily in wind power , nearly doubling its capacity for the fourth year running .
Global capacity grew by 29 % last year , the highest annual increase for six years .

The last time we checked on on Czech politician Vaclav Klaus , the NYT was freaking out that a guy who did n't subscribe to Western European liberal orthodoxy was set to assume the EU Presidency .
You know , he did n't necessarily believe that more regulation was the answer to the crisis , and he was even a global warming skeptic .
Whether you agree with him or not , you have to admire a politician that 's obviously not interested in pandering .
Members of the European Parliament booed and walked out during his most recent speech to the body .
Klaus said that the economic downturns are like a flu : if you do n't cure it , it takes 7 days .
If you do , it takes a week .
He was also surprised that Bastiat 's famous fictitious petition from the 19th century - a request by candle producers who wanted to be protected by the government against an unfairly advantaged competitor , the Sun - became real in the EU 's decision from November 2008 to add 60 % tariffs on Chinese candles .
Quelle horreur .
We can see why they had to walk out .
The UK Government is now considering the mass surveillance of all user communications on social - networking sites .
The EU Data Retention Directive , which directs UK Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) to store its customers ' names , addresses , IP address , user IDs and all email and Internet telephony communications for a year apparently are n't enough for Home Office Security Minister Vernon Coaker .
He suggests that communications like those on social - networking sites as well as instant messaging should also be monitored .
Harvesting And Storing All Internet Communications
Speaking at a meeting of the House of Commons Fourth Delegated Legislation Committee , Coaker said that social - networking sites similar to Facebook , MySpace and Bebo are not covered by the EU Data Retention directive , so the government is looking at what they should do about the Intercept Modernisation Programme ( IMP ) .
( Source : parliament.uk )
The EU Data Retention Directive requires all Internet Service Providers to store customer traffic data for a year , starting March 15 , 2009 .
The IMP was proposed by the government last year to use mass monitoring of traffic data as an ' anti- terrorism ' tool .
( Source : zdnet.co.uk )
Intrusive and Potentially Perilous Deep Packet Inspection
The Internet Modernisation Programme intends to use deep packet inspection -- which can be very intrusive -- to monitor the web communications of all UK citizens and store all that data in a centralized government database .
More information on the IMP can be found from ZDNet UK website .
( Source : zdnet.co.uk )
Previously the UK Government had insisted that intercepting communications was vital , hinting that social - networking sites may be monitored .
Now that data may be harvested and stored .
Deep packet inspection involves intercepting and examining the contents of all data packets flowing over a network .
The UK government 's intention to use it raises numerous privacy and security issues and implementing it can be costly .
Opposition to the plan has been fierce .
We 've highlighted some of the problems with mass surveillance in the past .
Without proper safety measures and security precautions in place , endeavors like this oftentimes end up being fishing expeditions that are grossly misused .
More on the UK government 's plan can be found in the article from Zdnet UK .

A los 86 años y tras haber sufrido una descompensación , murió ayer al mediodía el notable epistemólogo y filósofo Gregorio Klimovsky .
Estaba internado en el Hospital Italiano y su esposa y su único hijo sólo se limitaron a dar la noticia de su fallecimiento .
Klimovsky era considerado uno de los mayores especialistas en epistemología de Latinoamérica de la actualidad .
Estudió matemáticas en la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales de la Universidad de Buenos Aires , donde llegó a Decano .
Fue profesor emérito de dicha universidad y director del Departamento de Humanidades de la Universidad Favaloro .
Como estudiante y docente , Klimovsky adhirió a la Reforma Universitaria y fue un activo promotor de sus principios .
En 1966 , luego de la Noche de los Bastones Largos , fue despedido de la Universidad junto a otros importantes catedráticos .
Su labor desbordó ampliamente el campo de la matemática cuando comenzó a abarcar disciplinas como la ética y la metodología de la investigación científica .
Es entonces cuando se lo comienza a considerar - a partir de su labor en el Colegio Libre de Estudios Superiores - como uno de los iniciadores de la lógica y la filosofía de la ciencia en Argentina .
Fue Profesor de matemáticas en la Universidad Nacional de Rosario y en la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas de la UBA ; de Lógica matemática en el Centro de Altos Estudios en Ciencias Exactas ( CAECE ) ; de Filosofía , Epistemología y Ética en el Instituto de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México , ( UNAM ) y la Universidad de la República ( Uruguay ) .
Comprometido con la realidad social , en 1984 fue designado miembro de la Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas ( CONADEP ) , que presidió el escritor Ernesto Sábato .
En 1986 recibió el Premio Konex de Platino en el área de la Lógica y Filosofía de la Ciencia y tres años después el Premio de la Asociación Internacional Psicoanalítica a los aportes más significativos hechos a ése campo , por una profunda investigación acerca de la fundamentación epistemológica del psicoanálisis .
En 1996 recibió el Premio Konex de Brillante como la personalidad más importante de las Humanidades Argentinas en la década 1986 - 1995 .
En esa misma oportunidad obtuvo el Konex de Platino en Lógica y Teoría de la Ciencia .
En abril de 2005 , Klimovsky fue declarado ciudadano ilustre de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires .
" ¡ Es que yo soy porteñazo !
Nací a 2 cuadras del Obelisco , en Carlos Pellegrini 629 " , solía decir orgulloso .
" La mía era una familia judía muy culta .
Mi madre era maestra y llegó a ser directora de escuela .
Mi padre , relojero al igual que mis dos hermanos mayores .
Teníamos una biblioteca fenomenal .
Yo la había regalado al Instituto Científico Judío que funcionaba en la sede de la AMIA y con el atentado se destruyó " , contaba .
Estaba casado desde hacía más de 50 años con Tatiana Scheiner Sastre y tenía un único hijo , que es ingeniero especialista en informática .
Entre su obra publicada se cuentan " La Teoría de Conjuntos y los Fundamentos de las Matemáticas " de 1993 , " Las Desventuras del Conocimiento Científico " , de 1994 y lo más reciente , además de sus artículos periodísticos fueron " Epistemología y psicoanálisis 1 y 2 " , de 2004 .
Sus artículos científicos han sido reproducidos por las más importantes revistas especializadas del mundo y a través de su trayectoria se convirtió en un hombre de consulta para las nuevas generaciones de la ciencia .
En el ámbito académico , la muerte de Gregorio Klimovsky dejará un vacío difícil de llenar y la comunidad científica argentina extrañará la sabiduría con que aportaba sus comentarios a cada nuevo descubrimiento o a las polémicas sobre el desarrollo de técnicas y conceptos novedosos .
( Reuters ) -
The global recession manifests itself in big and small ways , most gloomy , some quirky and often reflecting the inventive human spirit .
Here is a look at some signs of the times .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
* The crisis has brought a disastrous holiday season for many retailers , who depend on the frenzy to buy Christmas presents to push them into the black for the year .
For its window display , a shop in London adapted a classic World War One recruiting poster in which a steely - eyed mustachioed general points at passers - by above the words “ Your Country Needs You . ”
The new admonishment is : “ Shop , Damn It , SHOP . ”
* If your pockets are almost empty and you want a decadent holiday meal , what about lobster ?
In Boston , fish merchants are selling 1 - 1/ 4 pound ( 0.6 kilogram ) lobsters for $ 5.99 a pound , 33 percent down on last year .
“ Usually it ’s very expensive right now , ” said John Mulkerrin , sales manager at James Hook & Co , a Boston fish merchant that sells about 50,000 pounds ( 23,000 kilograms ) of lobster each week .
Lobstermen in Maine , source of much of the U.S. catch , are not so happy .
Prices at the harbor are down by over 40 percent .
Canadian lobster processors , who typically buy much of the catch , found themselves unable to get credit .
They had relied on Icelandic banks , which ran out of money .
* The Irish government , driven partly by a rise in aggressive panhandling as people struggle to get by , is reforming its begging laws .
Begging is set to become an offense when it is accompanied by harassment or intimidation .
Justice Minister Dermot
Ahern said of the visible increase in begging : “ There is some evidence that this is just not for begging sake , because of extreme poverty , it ’s because to a certain extent a fairly substantial income can be garnered from it . ”
* As many as 4,000 patients were expected to converge on the 50 offices of Comfort Dental in Colorado for free cleaning and fillings in what was expected to be a record turnout for the company ’s annual Christmas Eve offer of free dental care for the poor .
“ This will be our 25th year of doing it , but it will be far and away our busiest , ” Norton said .
“ We ’re seeing quite a few people losing their jobs , losing their insurance , anticipating some belt - tightening . ”
* An Overland Park , Kansas , school teacher , Kim Hahn and her husband are forgoing traditional Christmas gifts and instead paying for each other ’s medical bills .
“ We maxed out our insurance , ” said Hahn .
“ For Christmas , my present to my husband is to pay for his root canal .
His present to me is to pay for my colonoscopy .
How romantic . ”
* With capitalist Washington forced to buy shares of major banks to stop them going bust after years of loose regulation , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who grew up in Communist East Germany , was quoted in Focus magazine telling her Cabinet the following joke : “ What ’s the difference between Communism and Capitalism ?
Answer :
The Communists nationalized all the companies first -- and then ruined them . ”
* Big , really big , news from Tokyo .
Kyodo news agency said a tour of sumo wrestlers to London planned for next October is being canceled after sponsors balked at the costs , which had risen by about 60 percent because of the rising yen .
* America ’s most popular television show , “ American Idol , ” will not next year hold the charity special “ Idol Gives Back , ” which raised $ 120 million , mostly from the 30 million viewers , in 2007 and 2008 .
“ With what ’s happening in the world , I personally do n’t think it feels right to be telling people who ’ve got problems with mortgages etc. that they ’ve got to start donating money to charities when they have enough problems at home , ” “ American Idol ” judge Simon Cowell said .
* In the gloom of financial distress , what little indulgence are YOU never , ever going to give up ?
The New York Times asked six of its writers to describe in the Sunday Style section the one little spice in their life they would cling to :
They chose : A seat at the Christmas performance of Tchaikovsky ’s ballet The Nutcracker , a glass of fine single malt Scotch whisky , the pleasure of sending out a high quality , hand - written Christmas card , a freshly shucked oyster , a day at the beach and starting the day with two cups of Coca Cola at the neighborhood MacDonalds .

' Get a good lawyer , ' attorney tells former Bush official John Byrne
Published : Monday March 30 , 2009
Print This Email This After a former Bush official responded to a lawyer who 's suing him for alleged torture at Guantanamo Bay , the lawyer has fired back in kind .
Douglas Feith , former undersecretary of defense under President George W. Bush , is accused by Spanish human rights lawyers of providing legal cover to Bush policies under which detainees were tortured .
The lawyers want to try a number of Bush officials -- among them former Bush Attorney General Alberto Gonzales -- in Spanish court .
Feith fired back in an interview Sunday , saying , " the charges as related to me make no sense . "
" They criticize me for promoting a controversial position that I never advocated , " Feith added .
In response , Gonzalo Boye , one of the lawyers filing the complaint , advised Feith to get a " very good lawyer . "
 I would recommend that Mr. Feith first of all read the complaint , and secondly that he get a very good lawyer ,  Boye said .
 If he is so sure of what he is saying  then the address of the national court is # 22 Genova Street , second floor . 
The five others accused -- David Addington , former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney ; Jay Bybee , one of the authors of a now - infamous Bush " torture memo ; " William Haynes ; John Yoo , one of the architects of Bush 's ' enhanced interrogation ' policy ; and Alberto Gonzales , Bush 's ex-Attorney General -- have all declined comment on the charges .

Advertisement Gordon Brown 's government has suffered a shock defeat in the Commons on its policy of restricting the right of many former Gurkhas to settle in the UK .
MPs voted by 267 to 246 for a Lib Dem motion offering all Gurkhas equal right of residence , with the Tories and 27 Labour rebels backing it .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg called the government 's position " shameful " .
Immigration minister Phil Woolas told MPs new proposals would be published before Parliament 's summer recess .
In a statement , he said : " This government respects the will of the House of Commons . "
He added that all outstanding applications for UK residence by Gurkhas would be dealt with by the end of May .
Mr Brown 's first significant defeat as prime minister came despite last - minute concessions being offered to rebel Labour MPs .
' Immense victory '
The Commons vote is not binding , but it represents an embarrassment for the government .
It comes at a time when Mr Brown is facing criticism over other issues , including his reform plans for MPs ' expenses , which will also go to a vote on Thursday .
It is the biggest Commons victory achieved by the Liberal Democrats since their formation two decades ago , and is the first time a government has lost an opposition day debate since James Callaghan in January 1978 .
The real worry for Gordon Brown and his whips is that this could merely be the warm - up for Thursday 's vote on expenses
BBC's Gary O'Donoghue
Defeat spells trouble for Brown
In quotes : Reaction to vote
In full : The Labour rebels Nick Robinson 's blog Bloggers ' reaction
There were shouts of " resign " as the numbers were announced .
The Lib Dems said 28 Labour MPs had voted for their motion - although that is thought to include one Labour MP who voted both for and against the motion .
After the vote Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron joined actress Joanna Lumley , who has been campaigning on the issue , and Gurkhas outside Parliament .
Mr Clegg said : " This is an immense victory on a series of fronts : for the rights of Gurkhas who have been waiting so long for justice , a victory for Parliament , a victory for decency . "
He added that it was " the kind of thing people want this country to do " .
Uncomfortable episode Mr Cameron said it was " embarrassing " for the prime minister because his efforts to strike a " shoddy deal " with Labour rebels had failed .
He added : " Today is a historic day where Parliament took the right decision .
The government have got to come back with immediate proposals so that the Gurkhas can have an answer . "

Among Labour MPs voting for the Liberal Democrat motion were home affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz , ministerial aide Stephen Pound and former cabinet minister Andrew Smith .
Mr Pound said he had resigned as a parliamentary private secretary to vote against the government .
Labour MP Martin Salter , chairman of the Parliamentary group on Gurkhas ' rights , abstained .
He told the BBC he refused to support the government but wanted to acknowledge the concessions made .
' Major changes '
He added : " It is the amount of abstainers that did it .
Comparatively few Labour MPs actually voted for the Lib Dem motion but an awful lot of people sat on their hands as a way of showing their determination to finish this issue . "
Some 36,000 former Gurkhas have been denied UK residency because they served in the British army before 1997 .
Ministers had introduced new rules allowing more soldiers to settle here based on long service , medals received , and those injured in battle .
Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg said the policy should be changed quickly The Home Office said that new rules would allow about 4,300 more to settle , but the Gurkha Justice Campaign said it would be just 100 .
Defending the policy at prime minister 's questions earlier , Gordon Brown said : " Since 1997 we have taken the first action to give justice to the Gurkhas .
" During that period of time the first ever Gurkhas to have rights of settlement in Britain has been agreed and 6,000 have now applied successfully and come into the country . "
He said they had created equal pay and pensions for the Gurkhas and doubled the pensions of people staying in Nepal .
But he said : " We have got to balance our responsibilities to those who have served our country with the finance that we need to be able to meet these obligations - and not base our offer on money we cannot afford . "
Ms Lumley said the campaigners were " elated " as they had expected to lose the vote .
" When it came through we saw it on the screen and I can't tell you the sense of elation , " she said .

Awesome :
Some highlights :
About once a month , this guy steps up and starts browbeating the President of the United States because they lost the election .
I think that Dick Cheney wants this country to get hit again for political gain ... I think Cheney is that mean .
We got hit on your watch .
You were in the briefings back then .
Now Hannity , that must have been a really tough interview for you .
Is this the best thing the conservative movement can come up with , Dick Cheney once a month going out there , rearing his ugly personality and his hatred for the country ?
Deep inside Russian countryside there is a place with a strange object .
It ’s made solely of wood and is called “ The Half - Bridge of Hope ” .
It looks like a wooden bridge from one side of hill to another which suddenly finishes on its half .
It has no any logical meaning or practical purpose , just stands in one of numerous Russian villages as an art object , made of wood as everything other around it .
Around this “ bridge ” there are some other strange structures were built later , also solely from wood .
This one is called “ an icicle generator ” , so it generates different sorts of icicles in the winter .
< br
And this one is “ The Tower ” made of wood and hay .
Some say it resembles the Eiffel Tower of Paris .
And sometimes different temporary structures are being built and then burned down .

Kong train operator MTR  which will submit on Tuesday its bid to run Melbourne 's train system for the next 15 years  ran 99.9 per cent of its trains within two minutes of their scheduled time last year .
MTR ( Mass Transit Railway ) is 76 per cent owned by the Hong Kong Government and runs one of the world 's most modern metro systems .
It also has one of the world 's most successful smartcard ticketing systems , the Octopus card .
It is impossible to compare Melbourne 's train system , largely laid out in the late 19th century , to Hong Kong 's system , started in 1975 with two lines and since expanded to nine .
The 211 - kilometre system carries 3.4 million passengers each weekday .
Melbourne 's 372 - kilometre system carries about 350,000 each weekday .

Jack Cafferty says Michelle Obama understands that the White House is the " people 's house . "
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
I think I am developing a crush on America 's first lady .
Michelle Obama is more compelling than her husband .
He 's good , but she 's utterly fascinating .
Mrs. Obama has blown away the stale air in a White House musty from eight years of the Bushes .
It 's like the sun came out and a fresh spring breeze began wafting through the open windows .
It 's the people 's house , and Michelle Obama totally gets it .
So much so that she has taken to inviting people in from the streets to see her home .
Nice touch -- one completely lacking in her recent predecessors .
Watch her when she visits a local school and you see the warmth and affection she instantly triggers in people .
Kids are pretty much totally honest with very good BS - detectors .
If they sense you 're a phony , forget it .
But around the first lady , they want to hug her and laugh with her and tell her stories .
You can see the same qualities these kids recognize in her daughters .
She is the consummate mother as evidenced by the poised , polite smiling children she and her husband are raising .
I have four daughters , and trust me -- they do n't turn out like the Obama children without devoted parents .
New to the Washington neighborhood , Michelle Obama has taken it upon herself to go around and introduce herself to the people in the various agencies of government .
When 's the last time a first lady did that ?
I do n't ever remember it before .
And during her visits she listens rather than lectures .
And people respond to her .
She was raised on the south side of Chicago by blue - collar parents .
She went to Princeton University , and Harvard Law School .
But in many ways she 's still a kid from the south side of Chicago , and that 's what makes her special .
She knows exactly who she is .
The Obamas bring a humanity and humility to their tasks which sets them far apart from the run -of - the mill phonies who populate Washington .
It 's exactly what the doctor ordered for this wounded nation .
Michelle Obama 's unassuming , but dead - on , sense of style has the fashion press gushing all over itself .
Her arms are becoming the stuff of legend .
Who appears sleeveless on the cover of Vogue , let alone in front of a joint session of Congress while her husband delivers one of the most important speeches of his life ?
And the reviews were rave .
Cindi Leive , the editor of Glamour magazine gushed , " Oh my god !
The first lady has bare arms in Congress in February at night ! "
If she keeps it up , Seventh Avenue will soon stop making women 's clothes with sleeves .
Ok , I admit it .
When it comes to the first lady , I 'm smitten .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jack Cafferty .

I wanted to explore the recent history of natural gas prices and try to see what patterns existed and if those patterns could help us predict future prices .
In this article I lay out an argument that the price spike of 2001 led to the price spike of 2003 .
And that our recent spike of 2008 will lead to another spike in 2010 ( possibly made worse by the credit collapse ) .
This is a guest post by Jon Freise , a software engineer living in Minneapolis , Minnesota USA , and member of the Twin Cities Energy Transition Working Group dedicated to shifting away from fossil fuels .
Price Cycles and Volatility
Jeff Vail has been posting some very interesting theoretical pieces on price cycles and asking if we are going to see more volatile prices going forward .
Here are three of his articles :
Mechanics of Future Oil Price Volatility ( A Flubber Cobweb )
Predator - Prey Dynamics in Demand Destruction and Oil Prices
Oil Demand Destruction
After reading Jeff ’s pieces I was uncertain what I believed about volatility , so I started gathering data by creating a history of the last decade ’s natural gas prices .
There have been 4 major price spikes .
I believe that 2 of these were caused by a spike dip spike pattern .
One I believe was caused by Hurricanes Katrina & Rita .
( I do n’t have enough data to estimate how the first one was caused )
Figure 1 shows the spike dip spike pattern .
The way it works is that the first spike encourages drilling .
The extra production causes a price collapse , and drilling stalls , causing an inventory shortage and the next price spike .
A Missing Piece Found : Minimum Production Cost
Nate Hagens wrote an article about the major natural gas producer Chesapeake cutting capital expenditures .
The Marginal Btu - The Return of the Red Queen ?
Nate discusses how the cost of producing natural gas had been rising as fast as or faster than the price charged .
He found Figure 2 ( Exhibit 8 ) , which I feel is key to understanding the decision making going on inside the natural gas producers .
Figure 2 . Credit Suisse Producer cost structure estimates .
Studying the System Components
Natural Gas production is a complex dynamic system with surprising behaviors .
Even experienced operators have been placed in jeopardy by unexpected and volatile price swings .
Being a novice to the field I fell back on the advice found in the book “ Thinking in Systems ” .
Author Donnella Meadows recommends
“ If possible , find or make a time graph of actual data from the system … ” and “ Starting with the behavior of the system forces you to focus on facts , not theories .
It keeps you from falling too quickly into your own beliefs or misconceptions , or those of others . ”
What I am going to present next is a series of graphs showing a time line of all the factors I could find about natural gas production over the last 8 years .
I want to give you a chance to study the data yourself before I bias your views with my interpretations .
Ask yourself : “ why did this drilling trend suddenly reverse ? ” and “ how does this price peak match up with the storage graph ? ” or “ how did producers handle falling prices in this case ? ”
Editor 's note :
If you find this frustrating , fast forward to " Interpreting the Data " , just before Figure 9 .
In Figure 3 I plotted well head price plus the drilling rate and Credit Suisse ’s estimate of North American Natural Gas Breakeven value together because it seemed logical that drilling will slow or stop if it is not profitable .
Following the orange drilling line from left to right , in Figure 3 , you can see it reverse trend as price falls below the breakeven cost in July 01 .
Figure 3 .
Well head price , breakeven production cost , and active drilling rig count plotted against each other .
( I want to mention that one factor we do n’t have is the maximum flow rate of currently operating wells .
Drilling will be increasing this flow rate and depletion will be lowering it .
I want to mention it here , because it is worth plotting in your head the increase in flow rate following just behind the Figure 3 drilling rate ) .
Inventory is a useful indicator of how well supply and demand are matching .
Figure 4 shows the EIAs “ Weekly Lower 48 States Natural Gas Working Underground Storage ” plotted against Well head price and the Breakeven Cost .
How low or high storage is relative to time of year gives a pretty good idea of why prices are high or low .
Notice how low prices in July of 02 match with high levels of storage .
Figure 4 .
Well head price , drilling cost , and gas in storage compared .
Figure 5 shows the natural gas consumption by each sector .
Drilling gives some idea of production , and Figure 5 Consumption gives a picture of demand .
Storage and price should be showing the balance between supply and demand .
Figure 5 . Natural Gas Consumption by Sector allows estimating temperature and price impacts on demand by sector .
Figure 6 .
Trend lines showing Industrial gas usage falling while electrical generation using natural gas grows .
Figure 6 is included to make clearer that Industrial consumption is on a long term decline trend as natural gas gets more expensive .
Electrical generation from natural gas is growing even faster however .
Electrical generation shows quite a bit of volatility itself .
Hurricane Damage
It would be a mistake to leave out some estimate of the damaging impact of Hurricanes .
Figure 7 shows a 10 year history of gas shut ins from hurricanes up to 2005 .
And Figure 8 updates this by providing data for 2008 Hurricanes Gustav and Ike .
Figure 7 ( labeled 2 - 3 ) .
From [ EES 2005 ] showing the shut in volume of hurricanes .
Figure 8 .
Shows shut in production from Gustav and Ike .
Figure 8 is graphed on the same scale as Figure 7 for easier comparison of impacts to Katrina .
You now have a large amount of raw data .
I recommend taking some time to look it over and form your own opinions as to why the price spikes and dips form .
Afterwards , continue on for my interpretation .
Interpreting the Data
Here are my views on how the price spike of 2001 turned directly into the price spike of 2003 .
The short story is that the price spike of 2001 encouraged producers to increase drilling .
They went too far and caused prices to collapse .
Unable to make a profit on new drilling operations , producers scaled back rapidly .
Too rapidly .
Flow rates were cut , inventories plunged and prices spiked again .
Figure 9 .
Shows my interpretation of how the 2001 and 2003 price spikes are related .
In Figure 9 at arrow 2 , the drilling rate increased .
I think this was a fatal mistake .
Prices were still well above the breakeven point but they were heading sharply downwards .
At the arrow 5 natural gas producers faced the same choice but instead prudently lowered the drilling rate .
This prevented another deep overshoot in 2004 and stopped the spike dip spike cycle from repeating again .
It has been conjectured that producers being more conservative in risk taking will increase volatility .
In Figure 9 we find evidence for and against this theory side by side .
At arrow 2 producers were not conservative enough , and caused volatility by not cutting back .
At arrow 4 producers were too conservative and did not start drilling soon enough and thus increase volatility .
Figure 10 has the needed view of storage levels to better understand the price movements .
Figure 10 .
Shows how storage and price interacted during the 2001 and 2003 price spikes .
What is very interesting about Figure 10 is that storage in the winter of 01/02 and 02/03 both reached about the same high levels .
Just by looking at storage as a measure of match between supply and demand would not be sufficient .
What is not shown is that maximum flow rate was much lower in 02/03 because of the prior cut in drilling rate .
By spring of 2003 the natural gas storage was badly depleted and prices were spiking .
Since we do n’t have a graph of maximum flow rate , we are still missing a critical piece of information to model this system .
( Suggestions on producing such a graph ? )
Producers Regain Balance
After the 2001 price spike , producers mistakenly increased drilling too much and collapsed the price .
They did not repeat that mistake in 2003 .
In Figure 9 arrow 5 you can see that they lowered the drilling rate and thus were able to prevent as deep an overshoot .
Figure 10 shows that inventory did not fall as far in April 04 as they had in April 01 or April 03 .
So by not over producing and then over cutting , producers were able to stabilize inventories and prevented the spike dip spike cycle .
It was a near thing .
A few Bcf less storage and the cycle could have repeated .
The natural gas producers managed to balance the market for nearly a year and a half .
Figure 9 shows prices were hovering just over the cost of production from 04 to 05 Inventories rose in 05 and that might have started another oscillation in 2006 , but the arrival of Hurricane Katrina never gave it the chance .
Katrina Restarts the Oscillation
Hurricane Katrina struck at the end of August 2005 , doing tremendous damage to the natural gas infrastructure .
Katrina was followed quickly by Rita .
Figure 11 shows that natural gas prices spiked far above the 2001 and 2003 levels .
Producers were actually quite slow to increase drilling during this spike .
It was clearly unexpected .
Drilling did start to pick up , but by then prices were falling back towards a rapidly rising break even cost .
Looking at Figure 12 shows that inventories never really fell despite the amount of gas shut in , so it is possible that a fair amount of the spike was fear related or because gasoline costs were spiking .
Figure 11 .
Showing the Hurricane impacts of 2005 and 2008 .
Figure 11 shows that producers were also slow to respond to the drop in prices .
They just kept increasing the drilling rate while inventories remained high and prices were falling .
Prices could not be stabilized above break even .
From July 06 to Jan 08 drilling rates and prices struggled to balance , both jumping from month to month .
Prices began to move up in January of 08 .
Figure 12 shows that inventory would drop to a rather low level by April 08 .
Prices continued to rise back to Katrina level highs .
Figure 12 also shows that part of this price movement may have been natural gas following oil prices to record highs , because the storage inventory levels never fell as far as in 2001 and 2003 .
Figure 12 .
Showing annotated storage movements during the last 2 years and how inventory in 08 compared to 01 and 03 .
Our Current Situation
In September - October the banking sector collapsed and the economy with it .
Inventory levels rose above the 5 year average and prices fell rapidly .
Producers scaled back drilling as soon as prices passed the break even point and drilling rates are now falling faster than any time this decade .
Figure 13 .
Our current drilling rate and price situation annotated and compared to the situation after the 2001 price spike .
Despite the rapid fall in drilling rate , inventories are above the 5 year average and the EIA reports that Northeast spot prices have dipped below $ 5.00 per MMBtu .
This is far below the $ 8.15 breakeven costs estimated by Credit Suisse for 2008 .
Figure 14 .
EIA Natural Gas Storage report showing inventories rising above the middle of the 5 year average .
Gustav and Ike both struck the Gulf of Mexico natural gas production .
The total natural gas taken off line was less than Katrina & Rita and the outages did not last as long .
Those impacts did nothing to stop inventories from filling and prices from falling .
Clearly domestic on shore production had over produced by quite a large margin .
The Perfect Spike Setup
We are now living through another perfect spike dip spike pattern .
The 2008 price spike encouraged over production .
High inventories will suppress prices .
The drilling rate will continue to be cut back which will eventually cut maximum flow rate .
By the time prices recover enough to restart drilling , it will be far too late to build up enough new wells to meet winter demand .
Inventories will fall and prices will spike once more .
Look at Figure 13 and the way prices finally crossed breakeven in mid 2003 on the ramp up to the next high peak .
It was not soon enough to stop the price spike .
I expect this event again .
The only question is how fast the decline in inventories will happen .
It took two years from the spike in 2001 to setup the spike in 2003 .
The last price spike was late 2008 , so if the frequency of the pattern holds we may see the next spike in Q1 2010 .
Future Investigations
It would be worth examining depletion rates and seeing if there is some relation between the natural gas price oscillation period and rate of depletion .
Part of what may be causing spikes is that rapid depletion rates are cutting flow rates faster than companies have experienced in the past .
That mismatch may be the cause of undershooting on drilling levels .
Clearly we have moved from a period of relative price stability into a period of great chaos .
Could increasing depletion rates be the underlying reason ?

Young people have done a good job of integrating technology into their lives , but they are also the ones who are most concerned about being overconnected .
This finding is part a new report from the Pew Internet & American Life Project , The Mobile Difference , which discusses how different groups of American adults treat the latest trend in connectivity .
While 61 percent of the adult population is perfectly fine accessing the Internet through a stationary PC , the remaining 39 percent is active in adopting mobile connectivity .
Pew breaks the latter chunk into five groups : Digital Collaborators , Ambivalent Networkers , Media Movers , Roving Nodes , and Mobile Newbies .
There 's little variation in the percentage breakdown of these groups — Roving Nodes makes up the largest at nine percent of the adult population — though their favorite ways of using technology while on - the - go vary .
For example , Digital Collaborators have the most tech assets ( PDAs , cell phones , laptops , MP3 players , etc. ) out of the five groups , and use those assets to both work and share their creations with others .
Media Movers are more likely to create " information nuggets , " like digital photos , and pass them on right away .
Roving
Nodes get the most out of basic applications , like e-mail and texting , and " find them great for arranging the logistics of their lives . "
Ambivalent Networkers , however , are distinct in that Pew says they have folded mobile devices into every aspect of their social lives .
Texting , social networking , entertainment — you name it and this group is doing it with mobile devices of some sort .
They 're significantly less likely to watch traditional TV on a daily basis than the rest of the adult population ( 24 percent , versus 79 of all adults ) , though they do watch TV shows on on non-TV devices more than any other group .
Additionally , 66 percent of this group performs at least one non-voice activity on their cell phones per day , the highest of all the groups , and 91 percent of this group relies on their cell phones for all of their calls .
Despite this heavy reliance on technology , Ambivalent Networkers — primarily 20 - somethings , and 60 percent male — did n't actually " like " this level of availability as much as everyone else .
Only 31 percent strongly agreed that they liked being so accessible , compared to the sample 's average of 47 percent and near the bottom for all groups .
More than half of Ambivalent Networkers agreed that taking a break is definitely a good idea , which was ( surprisingly ) ten percentage points above the average from other groups .
This group undoubtedly feels the effects of too much access more than other groups because of their tendency to use technology for every aspect of their lives .
A 2007 study from Digital Life America revealed that BlackBerry owners felt chained to work , though they still felt that smartphones allowed them more freedom and flexibility .
Ambivalent Networkers are likely the same types of people — they realize the power of technology to let them manage their lives , but they also know that being " always on " can lead to serious burnout if they do n't unplug every once in a while .
Google has unveiled a new beta version of its Chrome browser , which is purportedly twice as fast as the previous version and adds some needed new features .
Did you think Google would let let Apple have all the St. Patrick 's Day glory ?
Not a chance .
On the same day that Apple announced its new iPhone 3.0 OS , Google unveiled a new beta version of its Chrome browser .
Google promises that the updated beta is much faster than its predecessor : " almost twice as fast when compared to our original beta version , " Brian Rakowski , a Google product manager , wrote in a blog post .
The updated Chrome also includes some new features , including autofill , full - page zoom , auto - scroll , and new drag tabs .
Want to see two tabs side - by - side ?
Drag one of the tabs out to the side of the screen and the update Chrome will auto - fit both windows .
Chrome will now remember the text you enter into Web sites for future visits .
You can erase saved data via the " clear browsing data " on the Tools menu or shut off the feature completely via the " minor tweaks tab " under the Tools and Options menus .
To get full - page zoom , select Page Menu and Zoom .
" Whereas text zoom only affects the text on a webpage , full - page zoom scales everything on the page , including images , " Google said .
Auto - scroll , meanwhile , will kick in by clicking the center button on your mouse .
" As you move your mouse , the page automatically scrolls according to the direction of the mouse . "
" Getting on the beta channel means your version of Google Chrome will regularly get updated with new speed enhancements , features , and bug fixes before most users see them , " Rakowski wrote .
" We 're doing our best to quickly churn out new features as they are available rather than saving them up for occasional major releases .
Riding the beta channel is a great way to let us know about what 's working and what 's not , but do n't be surprised to find some rough edges . "
Google on Tuesday also launched a blog devoted entirely to Chrome .
Google released Chrome in September 2008 .
As of February 2009 , it had captured 1.12 percent of the market behind Internet Explorer , Firefox , and Safari , according to data from Net Applications .
Having a good program manager is one of the secret formulas to making really great software .
And you probably do n’t have one on your team , because most teams do n’t .
Charles Simonyi , the brilliant programmer who co-invented WYSIWYG word processing , dated Martha Stewart , made a billion dollars off of Microsoft stock and went into space , first tried to solve the Mythical Man Month problem of organizing really big software teams by creating one super duper überprogrammer writing the top - level functions , while handing off the implementation of the lower - level functions to a team of grunt junior - programmers as needed .
They called this position program manager .
Simonyi is brilliant , but this idea , not so much .
Nobody wanted to be a grunt junior programmer , I guess .
For more on the history , read William Poundstone ’s How Would You Move Mount Fuji ?
Jabe Blumenthal , a programmer on the Mac Excel team in the late 80s , recycled the title for a different job .
He had noticed that software development was getting so complicated that none of the programmers had the time to figure out how to make software that was either usable or useful .
The marketing team was ranting and raving about customer needs and nobody had time to talk to them or translate their MBA - speak into actual features .
There was a lot of product design stuff that took a lot of work : talking to users , running usability tests , reviewing competitive products , and thinking hard about how to make things easier , and most programmers just did n’t have the time ( nor were they particularly good at it ) .
Blumenthal took the title “ Program Manager , ” but reinvented the job completely .
What does a program manager do ?
Henceforth , a program manager would :
Design UIs
Write functional specs Coordinate teams Serve as the customer advocate , and Wear Banana Republic chinos
On small products , you might just have one program manager , but on larger products , you would probably have more than one .
Each can be responsible for some subset of the features .
A good rule of thumb is that it takes about one program manager for every four programmers .
If you ’re having trouble dividing up the work , one approach I learned from Mike Conte is to divide up the product according to user activities .
For example , Twitter could be divided into four user activities :
Registering and getting started Posting messages and reading replies Configuring your account Searching for news
My first program management assignment at Microsoft was on Excel , working on the user activity called “ customization , ” i.e. , scripting and macros .
The first thing I had to do was figure out what customers needed , which I did by talking to as many customers as I could until I started to get kind of bored because I kept hearing the same thing .
I spent a lot of time talking to the development team to figure out what would be possible and reasonable to implement in a single 18 month release , and I spent a lot of time talking to the Visual Basic team to see if they could supply a compiler , code editor , and dialog box editor that could be used in Excel for our macro language .
I also had to talk to Apple , which was developing their own universal macro language called AppleScript , and the other application teams at Microsoft , mainly Word , Access , Project , and Mail , who generally did whatever Excel did .
Most of this process consisted of talking .
Meetings , email , phone calls .
I am scarred for life from this , and now cower in my office in fear that the phone will ring .
The second step was writing a vision statement : sort of a broad document that said , this is how Visual Basic would work in Excel , this is what some sample macros would look like , these are the major pieces we would need to build , and this is how it would solve customers ’ problems .
When that did n’t generate too many objections , I started working on a much more detailed spec , which explained , down to the smallest detail , how everything looked to the user .
This was a functional spec , not a technical spec , which means , all it talked about was what the user saw , not how it was implemented .
( Read all about functional specs here . )
A program manager does n’t care how the development team implements things internally .
As I sent chapters of the spec to Ben Waldman , the development lead , he and his team sat down and figured out what they had to do internally to make it work .
They came up with a rather brilliant and very compact table that mapped the object - oriented interface I was defining onto internal Excel functions , but that really was n’t my business .
I did n’t know too much about Excel internals and did n’t really know how things should be implemented .
Truth be told , I did n’t know anything about anything .
Fresh out of college , I did n’t have enough experience to develop the code , test the code , write the documentation , market the product , or do the usability tests .
Luckily , Microsoft had seriously experienced gurus in each of those positions , who taught me everything I know today , and who did the real work of producing an awesome product .
For example , I knew that users would want to copy the value of a spreadsheet cell into a variable :
x = [ A1 ]
had to work .
The trouble was that a cell could hold a number or a string , but Basic was early bound … you had to DIM x as an Integer , Float or String before you could use it .
Basic had to get some kind of dynamic types , but I was n’t smart enough to figure out how to do that .
Did n’t matter .
Tom Corbett , a programmer on the Visual Basic team , figured out how .
And thus Variants and IDispatch were born , and Basic became a dynamic language with what you kids now call “ duck typing ” .
The point being , my job was n’t necessarily to solve problems , it was to figure out what customers needed and make sure that programmers figured out how to solve them .
Once the spec was finished and the development team got down to work , I had two responsibilities : resolving any questions that came up about the design , and talking to all the other teams so that the developers did n’t have to .
I met with the testers explaining how things were supposed to work and helping them plan how to test everything .
I met with the documentation team , making sure they understood how to write a good tutorial and reference for Excel Basic .
I met with localization experts to figure out a localization strategy .
I sat down with marketing to explain the marketing benefits of VBA .
I worked with usability experts to set up usability tests .
A program manager does go to a lot of meetings , but does n’t produce much other than that written spec , which is why as a twerp fresh out of school I was still able to do the job .
You do n’t have to be a 14 - year veteran programmer to work as a program manager ( in fact , with 14 years of programming experience , you might know too much to be a good user advocate . )
Conflict
Lacking a program manager , your garden - variety super - smart programmer is going to come up with a completely baffling user interface that makes perfect sense IF YOU’RE A VULCAN ( cf. git ) .
The best programmers are notoriously brilliant , and have some trouble imagining what it must be like not to be able to memorize 16 one - letter command line arguments .
These programmers then have a tendency to get attached to their first ideas , especially when they ’ve already written the code .
One of the best things a program manager can add to the software design process is a second opinion as to how things should be designed , hopefully one that is more empathetic to those DOUBLE SUPER UNSMART USERS with their pesky mental feebleness requiring that an application be usable without reading the man page , writing a custom emacs - lisp function , or translating numbers into octal in your head .
A good program manager will come with her own ideas for how the UI should work , which might be better , or worse , than the developer ’s idea .
And then there ’s a long debate .
Typically , the program manager wants something simple and easy to understand for the users , featuring a telepathic user interface and a 30 ″ screen that nonetheless fits in your pocket , while the developer wants something that is trivial to implement in code , with a command - line interface ( “ what ’s so unusable about that ? ” ) and Python bindings .
One of the most monumental debates I remember from the Excel 5 project was between a developer who wanted pivot tables to float on the drawing layer above the spreadsheet , and the program manager , who insisted that pivot tables live right in the cells on the spreadsheet .
This debate went on for a really , really long time , and eventually , the program manager prevailed , but the final design came out much much better than any one individual ’s design would have been .
To make sure that the debate happens respectfully and on a rational basis of facts , it ’s absolutely critical that the program managers and developers be peers .
If developers report to the program manager , at some point during the debate the program manager is going to get sick of the whole thing and just say , “ OK , enough talking , now we do it my way . ”
When they ’re peers , this can never happen .
It ’s a little bit like courts of law : we do n’t allow a lawyer for one side to be the judge , and we work on the theory that the truth is most likely to be uncovered through a process of debate between equals .
The debate can only be a fair one if neither side has an unfair advantage .
This is an important point , so if you were daydreaming about Sally in 11th grade , wondering where she is now , snap out of it .
She ’s a biotherapist in Scottsdale , and a Republican .
Now pay attention .
Programmers can’t report to program managers which means , among other things , that the development lead , or the CTO , or the CEO , ca n’t be the person who writes the specs .
The number one mistake most companies make is having the manager of the programmers writing the specs and designing the product .
This is a mistake because the design does not get a fair trial , and is not born out of conflict and debate , so it ’s not as good as it could be .
I learned this the hard way .
At Fog Creek Software , I did a lot of the program management myself , and it was a constant battle to remind people that they were supposed to argue with me when I said wrong things .
We ’re not a big company but we are finally big enough to have real program managers now , Dan and Jason , and the programmers love arguing with them .
Of course , when programmers are peers of the program managers , the programmers tend to have the upper hand .
Here ’s something that has happened several times : a programmer asks me to intervene in some debate he is having with a program manager .
“ Who is going to write the code ? ” I asked .
“ I am … ”
“ OK , who checks things into source control ? ”
“ Me , I guess , … ”
“ So what ’s the problem , exactly ? ” I asked .
“ You have absolute control over the state of each and every bit in the final product .
What else do you need ?
A tiara ? ”
You see , it turns out that this system puts the burden on the program manager to persuade the programmer , because at some point , the program manager runs the risk that the programmer will give up and just do whatever the heck the programmer feels like .
Thus , being effective as a program manager means you have to ( a ) be right , and ( b ) earn the respect of the programmers so that they concede that you ’re right .
How do you earn this respect ?
It helps , as a program manager , to be pretty good at coding yourself .
This is unfair .
Program managers are n’t supposed to write code .
But programmers tend to respect programmers a lot more than non-programmers , no matter how smart they are .
It is possible to be an effective program manager without being a coder , but the burden of earning the respect of the programming team will be higher .
flip the bozo bit v.
Decide that someone is a clown , and stop listening to them .
The other way to earn the programming team ’s respect is to demonstrate intelligence , open - mindedness , and fairness in any debates that come up .
If a program manager says dumb things , the programmer might flip the bozo bit on them .
If a program manager becomes personally or emotionally attached to a certain way of doing things , to the point at which they ’re being unreasonable , they ’re going to lose a lot of credibility … both sides , but especially the program manager , need to be emotionally detached from the debate and willing to consider new evidence and change their opinions when the facts merit it .
Finally , if a program manager is seen as playing politics , having private meetings with the boss or trying to divide - and - conquer to win a debate instead of debating on the merits , they ’re going to lose a lot of trust of the programmers .
And when a program manager loses the programming team ’s trust , it ’s over .
They ’re not going to be effective .
The programmers are going to tune them out and do whatever they want anyway .
This leads to worse code and wasted time , since not only are you paying an ineffective program manager a salary , but that ineffective program manager is calling meetings and soaking up everybody else ’s time even though they ’re not really making the code any better .
Specs ?
Really ?
That ’s so unagile
There are so many development organizations where specs are a monument to mindless bureaucratic paperwork that entire movements sprung up organized around the idea of not writing specs .
These people are misguided .
Writing a functional specification is at the very heart of agile development , because it lets you iterate rapidly over many possible designs before you write code .
Compared to code , a written spec is trivial to change .
The very act of writing a specification forces you to think through the design you thought you had in your head , and helps you see the flaws in it quickly so that you can iterate and try more designs .
Teams that use functional specifications have better designed products , because they had the opportunity to explore more possible solutions quickly .
They also write code faster , because they have a clearer picture when they start of what ’s going to be needed .
Functional specifications are so important one of the few hard and fast rules at Fog Creek is “ No Code Without Spec . ”
The exact form the functional specification takes may vary .
All a functional specification has to do is explain how the program will behave .
It does n’t say anything about how the code will work internally .
You start at the highest level : a vision statement , no more than one page explaining the gist of the new feature .
Once that ’s nailed down , you can develop storyboards … mockups of the screens showing the user ’s progression through the application , with detailed notes showing how they work .
For many types of functionality , especially UI - heavy functionality , once you have these storyboards , you ’re done .
That ’s your spec .
Jason Fried , you can go now .
To learn how to write good functional specifications , read my four part series .
If you want to see a typical spec I wrote , you can download the full Fog Creek Copilot spec .
For more complex functionality with hidden behavior that ’s not expressed in the UI storyboards , you ’re going to want more details written down .
In any case , the very act of writing down a spec helps you discover problems , conflicts , and design issues long before the first line of code is written , so when you do write the code , you have far fewer unexpected issues popping up which might force a rewrite or , worse , a suboptimal design .
How do you learn to be a Program Manager ?
Mostly , becoming a program manager is about learning : learning about technology , learning about people , and learning how to be effective in a political organization .
A good program manager combines an engineer ’s approach to designing technology with a politician ’s ability to build consensus and bring people together .
While you ’re working on that , though , there are a few books you should read :
As far as I can tell , Scott Berkun ’s book Making Things Happen is the only book that ’s been written that pretty much covers exactly what a program manager has to do , so start with that .
Scott was a program manager on the Internet Explorer team for many years .
Another big part of the program manager ’s job is user interface design .
Read Steve Krug ’s Do n’t Make Me
Think , then my own book User Interface Design for Programmers .
Finally , and I know it sounds cheesy , but Dale Carnegie ’s 1937 book How to Win Friends & Influence People is actually a fantastic introduction to interpersonal skills .
It ’s the first book I make all the management trainees at Fog Creek read , before anything else , and they always snicker when I tell them to read it , and love it when they ’re done .
( From the diaries -- kos )
Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances , for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities .
Anton Scalia
Bush v. Gore
December , 2000
Fellow diarist Libertarian Friend notes that some of the asylum dwellers over at the National Review are experiencing intermittent flashes of rationality , which have led some of them to doubt the wisdom of the GOP 's strategy of tying up the Minnesota Senate race until hell freezes over or the Obama Administration is overthrown by the Glenn Beck militia movement , whichever comes first .
Ramesh Ponnuru runs up the white flag :
If [ Coleman ] keeps up the fight , he is likely to lose , unnecessarily deprive Minnesota of a second senator , end his political career seen as a sore loser , and hurt his party in a state that is eager for this fight to be over .
Ponnuru does n't mention it , but I can't help but wonder whether the prospect of Norm Coleman before the Supreme Court , a highlighted copy of the 14th Amendment in hand , does n't have something to do with his ( and Powerline 's Scott Johnson 's ) sudden conversion to cheese - eating surrender monkeying .
Maybe I 'm wrong , maybe it was the electroshock therapy .
But I 've suspected for some time that conservatives would eventually have serious reservations about where Norm and his mouthpieces are trying to take them .
Maybe it 's finally dawning on some of them that making a federal case out this election contest risks a long - term disaster for the GOP -- one that would completely outweigh the short - term benefits of depriving the Democrats of their 59th vote .
After all , what Norm is threatening to do -- if he can't get his way in state court -- is to demand that the US Supremes go storming through the equal protection door they opened just a crack , and then promptly tried to close again , in Bush v. Gore .
But if we 're really going to start vigorously applying the 14th Amendment to how votes are cast and counted in this country , then a whole bunch of GOP - friendly election realities are going to be open to constitutional challenge .
How , for example , is it " equal " for poor and urban precincts to have 1/5th the number of voting machines per capita as wealthy surburban ones ?
Is it " equal " for election officials to routinely deny elderly , undereducated or inexperienced voters the assistance they need to understand complex , confusing and / or poorly constructed ballots ?
Is it " equal " for prosecutors to aggressively pursue registration fraud cases against ACORN , while generally ignoring those against GOP - leaning groups ?
Can you say " disparate impact " ?
How about " protected class " ?
You really can go on and on with this -- which is precisely why Scalia and company tried so very hard to make their power grab a " good for one use only " ticket .
But now Norm is putting their handwork at risk .
And who knows ?
By the time his case reaches the US Supremes , maybe there will be a few new faces on the bench , liberal faces , faces that would n't mind at all taking Scalia 's legal legerdemain and shoving it right back up his runty ass .
Sigh .
A guy can dream , ca n't he ?
Back here in the real world , the US Supremes probably would n't come within a country mile of granting Norm cert , not unless it's to take a nail gun to that equal protection door .
But does the Republican Party really want to take that risk ?
Clearly , Norm is down with it -- that is , if he can remain one step ahead of the FBI .
His patrons and benefactors in wingnut fantasy land and the House and Senate Republican caucuses ( ah , but I repeat myself ) also appear blithely unconcerned .
( Who could have imagined leading GOP politicians would be so clueless and short sighted ? )
But maybe , just maybe , some of the party 's " thought leaders " are having second thoughts .
2008 was supposed to be a banner year for Hyundai .
The company predicted a huge sales jump and promised a new flagship .
And then 2008 actually happened .
Sales were , well , you can guess that one .
From a sales and PR point - of - view , the new , V8 - powered Genesis was well received .
From a sales perspective , not to much .
Still , as one Hyundai Marketing VP put it , “ if [ consumers ] are n’t forced to reconsider us , they wo n’t . ”
To paraphrase Elvis , perhaps we ought to give Hyundai a little more time .
Meanwhile , the comparison between Hyundai and a young Toyota seem to have faded from view .
In fact , you could make the case that Hyundai is more GM than Toyota .
Well , if not you , me .
Perhaps one of the biggest similarities between GM and Hyundai : a disfunctional relationship with its organized labor .
Actually , the comparison leaves the GM - UAW relationship looking downright touchy - feely .
In 2006 alone , Hyundai lost 118,293 vehicles worth $ 1.75 b due to strikes and walkouts alone .
When it refused to pay year - end bonuses of 1.5 times the monthly pay ( even though the production goal was n’t met … due to strikes and walkouts ) workers ( wait for it ) walked out .
Hyundai caved a few days later , with bosses calling the bonus as a “ fresh deal ” and “ an opportunity to clearly recognize that appropriate remuneration can only come after workers achieve the goals . ”
But Hyundai management is well - trained by now .
Their notoriously militant union has held a strike every year since 1987 .
Except for 1994 .
Maybe NAFTA scared them for a year .
In any case , if the brand that was launched by Rodney King wants to join the Toyotas of the world , something will have to be done about its labor relations .
But Hyundai management does n’t have much moral high ground from which to fight .
The antics of President Chung Mong - koo would make Blagojevich blush .
Mong - koo was convicted on $ 100 m embezzlement and bribery charges–and then freed on the grounds that he could “ contribute to the company and the national economy one last time . ”
Although his son Chung Eui-sun has left the top spot at Kia , he ’s still considered the dynastic heir apparent to his headline - grabbing father .
Kia was supposed to provide an opportunity for Eui-sun to prove himself .
That has n’t panned out .
High steel prices in Asia and union turbulence have played merry hell with Kia ’s thin profit margins .
“ Kia ’s profitability this year and its longer - term competitiveness depend largely on labor flexibility , ” says Stephen Ahn of Woori Investments .
His theory : it will be better for Eui-sun to keep his hands clean .
With another Hyundai strike looming and some serious coming to terms with economic reality ahead , he may be right .
So Eui-sun will stay on as head of Kia ’s overseas operations , busying himself with successful Slovakia operations and a giant factory under construction near West Point , Georgia .
While basking in the glow of Kia ’s new products , from the current Euro Cee ’ds to their forthcoming cousins , the Soul , Forte / Spectra and YN .
But even on the product front , more symptoms of “ Big Company Syndrome ” loom for the Hyundai conglomerate .
If the Genesis got people thinking differently about Hyundai , a super - Genesis will bring in the few remaining skeptics , right ?
That seems to be the thinking behind the Equus , the troublingly named , packed - with - technology , S - Class fighter .
The car will clock - in with a reported price tag north of $ 95 k .
Luckily for Koreans , recent rumors of a stateside debut for the Equus means grey - market imports a la Genesis can begin .
Even at a lower price , the Equus reeks of “ Big Company Syndrome . ”
Whereas the Genesis adds least some enthusiast rear wheel - drive panache to the Hyundai brand , the Equus is a staid limousine .
Its owner ( Chung Mong - koo ? ) will likely never stray from the back seat , as he or she is shuttled from payoff to “ political fundraiser . ”
More importantly , a $ 96 k car in the midst of an economic downturn does n’t say anything positive about the Hyundai brand that the Genesis does n’t .
A budget S - Class is one thing , a Hyundai Maybach is another .
And that ’s before you start on the name .
In reality , Hyundai is letting Kia take over as the purveyors of cheap and cheerful .
And as the “ junior brand ” picks up its game with the Forte and Soul , Hyundai is chasing the American brands with SUVs , Crossovers and RWD offerings .
Product overlap between the two brands , a coming labor confrontation and untimely upmarket ambitions by Hyundai may be enough to take some shine off the Hyundai - Kia juggernaut .
Moody ’s is eyeing a credit rating cut for Hyundai - Kia , as a weak Won kept things from getting too nasty in 2008 .
This year will be tougher still .
Influenza A( H1N1 ) - update 5
29 April 2009 - The situation continues to evolve rapidly .
As of 18:00 GMT , 29 April 2009 , nine countries have officially reported 148 cases of swine influenza A / H1N1 infection .
The United States Government has reported 91 laboratory confirmed human cases , with one death .
Mexico has reported 26 confirmed human cases of infection including seven deaths .
The following countries have reported laboratory confirmed cases with no deaths - Austria ( 1 ) , Canada ( 13 ) , Germany ( 3 ) , Israel ( 2 ) , New Zealand ( 3 ) , Spain ( 4 ) and the United Kingdom ( 5 ) .
Further information on the situation will be available on the WHO website on a regular basis .
WHO advises no restriction of regular travel or closure of borders .
It is considered prudent for people who are ill to delay international travel and for people developing symptoms following international travel to seek medical attention , in line with guidance from national authorities .
There is also no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of well - cooked pork and pork products .
Individuals are advised to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water on a regular basis and should seek medical attention if they develop any symptoms of influenza - like illness .

The amount of U.S. money spent on the Iraq war will surpass the cost of Vietnam by the end of the year , making it the second most expensive military conflict in American history , behind World War II , according to Pentagon figures provided Friday .
If Congress approves the supplemental funding request submitted this week by the Obama administration , the cost of the war will rise by $ 87 billion for 2009 , including a previous supplement approved during the Bush administration .
Added to the amount spent through 2008 , it would mean the Iraq war will have cost taxpayers a total of about $ 694 billion .
By comparison , the Vietnam War cost $ 686 billion in inflation - adjusted dollars and World War II cost $ 4.1 trillion , according to a Congressional Research Service study completed last year .
In Vietnam , U.S. forces at their peak had up to three times as many troops at any one time as in Iraq and suffered 58,000 deaths , more than 13 times as many as have died in Iraq .
There are two broad reasons for the added expense of the Iraq war : people and equipment .
Advertisement
The Iraq war is the second - longest modern war ever fought with an all - volunteer U.S. force , behind the smaller - scale effort in Afghanistan .
Volunteer forces are more expensive because of the higher salaries and related costs needed to retain people .
“ This is a volunteer military , which is pretty unusual in an extended war , ” said Stephen Biddle , a military historian at the Council on Foreign Relations , a think tank .
“ And people cost more . ”
U.S. officials in Iraq also have relied heavily on private contractors , used to protect diplomats and defend bases , transport provisions and staff essential services such as providing food .
A Congressional Budget Office report last year estimated there were 190,000 contract workers employed by U.S. agencies in Iraq -- more than the number of U.S. military personnel at the peak of the buildup in forces in 2007 , about 160,000 to 170,000 troops .
The salaries earned by the contractors were far higher than those of soldiers .

Medical care in Iraq has also been expensive , Biddle noted .
Combat doctors have been able to save soldiers , sailors and Marines who in earlier conflicts would have died .
Both the initial treatment and long - term care are costly .
“ Certainly many , many more people who get hit by enemy fire live through the experience , and I suspect that treating someone who survives is more expensive than having them die , in dollar terms , ” Biddle said .
The cost of the Iraq war has also been driven up by the equipment used .
The roadside bombs and sandstorms of Iraq have destroyed very expensive , often high - tech equipment at far more rapid rates than the military expected .
U.S. forces are fielding some of the best and most sophisticated forces of any military .
But all of that high - tech equipment is more expensive than the hardware used in previous conflicts .
Advertisement
War costs have also been driven up because the Pentagon has used post - Sept. 11 funding to modernize U.S. forces .
For instance , the budget request sent to Congress this week would replace lost F - 16 and F - 15 fighters with four of the far more expensive F - 22s , at a cost of $ 600 million .
Questions remain over the accuracy of comparing the costs of wars across decades , and scholars warn of the potential for distortion .
“ The world has gotten steadily more expensive , ” said Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for International and Strategic Studies , a think tank .
“ How do you relate the cost of an old Sherman tank to a modern M1 tank ? ”
But Cordesman agreed that the Iraq war has been very expensive , and in some ways has cost more than it should have .
Advertisement
By trying to do reconstruction projects while fighting a war , U.S. officials wasted millions of dollars , Cordesman said .
Similarly , the failure to build up the Iraqi army and police quickly enough allowed the security situation to grow ever worse in the early years of the war , he said .
Although the cost of the war in 2009 will shrink compared with 2008 , the cost of the Afghanistan war has begun to increase .
The U.S. spent $ 34 billion in Afghanistan in 2008 .
This year , the Obama administration , which is sending additional forces to the country , plans to spend $ 47 billion .
Military analysts believe Iraq war costs will continue to decline and the Afghanistan war costs will increase .

President Obama intends to withdraw most U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of August 2010 , but that plan would leave 35,000 to 50,000 in the country in largely supportive roles .
Under a security agreement with Iraq , the U.S. is supposed to withdraw all of its forces by the end of 2011 .
But Biddle said that agreement could be renegotiated .
“ The pace of cost reductions will be driven by the drawdown , ” he said .
“ If all Americans are out of Iraq by 2011 , it will cost zero .
But I am not sure that is written in stone . ”

From the spring of 1918 to the early months of 1919 , the Spanish flu pandemic ravaged the world , killing an estimated 50 million to 100 million people .
It came in three waves , with the last wave being the most deadly .
This flu was unusual in that it was both extremely deadly and seemed to target the young and healthy , being particularly deadly to 20 to 35 - year - olds .
By the time the flu had run its course , it had killed upwards of five percent of the world 's population .
Included below is a fantastic collection of pictures from the deadly 1918 Spanish flu pandemic , including tent hospitals , people wearing preventative masks , a sick child , no spitting signs , and much more .

The documentary unspools interviews with Anita Ekberg ( Sylvia ) who bathed in the Trevi Fountain in the movie , Yvonne Furneaux ( Emma ) , who plays protag Marcello Mastroianni‘s ( Marcello Rubini ) suicidal girlfriend and with Anouk Aimée ( Maddalena ) , who plays his lover .
It also features commentary from Rome paparazzi of that time from whom Fellini drew inspiration .
“ The film was a great adventure for everyone , and the documentary captures that spirit , ” said Fellini Foundation topper Vittorio Boarini .
Federico Fellini directed “ La dolce vita ” and worked on the script with Ennio Flaiano .

IT MIGHT be gruesome , but counting road kill could be a quick and effective way to spot local changes in wildlife populations .
In 1984 , 1994 and 2005 , Bob Brockie and Richard Sadleir , two retired ecologists , drove the length of New Zealand ’s North Island , counting dead animals along the way .
Then , along with Wayne Linklater of Victoria University of Wellington , they compared their data with road kill counts going back to 1949 .
In some cases , the counts agreed with known changes in a population .
For instance , the number of dead possums on the roadside fell by 60 per cent between 1994 …

“ These include formal requests for information and / or subpoenas from , among others , the United States Department of Justice , the New Jersey Attorney General ’s office , the Federal Trade Commission and the Canadian Competition Bureau , ” the email said .
Ticketmaster confirmed the email was authentic but had no other comment .
Ticketmaster , which is seeking to merge with the world ’s largest concert promoting company Live Nation , was besieged by complaints earlier this year when fans of Bruce Springsteen who signed on to Ticketmaster to buy concert tickets were told that they had sold out within minutes .
They were instead directed to the reseller TicketsNow which had considerably more expensive tickets .
Ticketmaster has said the problem was caused by a computer glitch .
The Canadian government said last month that it had asked its Competition Bureau to investigate complaints that Ticketmaster diverted tickets to its reselling subsidiary , which then sells them for far higher prices .
In February a Canadian man filed a C$ 500 million ( $ 407 million ) lawsuit against Ticketmaster , charging the company broke the law by reselling tickets at inflated prices .
That same month , Ticketmaster settled with the state of New Jersey to resolve more than 2,000 complaints over how it had handled ticket sales for Springsteen concerts .
Canadians , most recently , are complaining about inflated prices to hear Leonard Cohen .

I have to agree that many people do not realize what a Pagani Zonda is let alone the new Pagani Zonda R even when it comes to some car enthusiasts .
One day I will be able to pull up to a crowd of people in a new Pagani Zonda R and they are all going to look at me with this confused facial expression that basically says “ what in the world is that . ”
I will then find myself trying to explain that my Pagani Zonda R has an improved variation of the 7.3 liter AMG V12 that other Zondas have while my R version should beat the recorded Nurburgring lap time of 7:27.82 that the Zonda F accomplished some time ago .
After that I will have to repeat myself about 10 more times and then tell them this is an all new model that has a longer wheelbase than the Zonda F and has been redesigned from the ground up only carrying over about 10 % of the components from the Zonda F .
Then they will ask me what the hell is a Zonda F and I will have to slap a few people and then …
I will wake up from my dream and tend to the serious bump on my head from hitting it on something .
In your dreams right ?
Well , maybe not if you have over a million dollars to buy one of these bad boys .
Better put your name on the list now before they are all gone because this one is going to be FAST !
A few Pagani Zonda R stats to daydream about :
0 - 62 mph : 3.0 seconds
Top Speed : 233mph
Horsepower : 739 bhp
Engine : Mercedes Benz AMG 6.0 liter V12
Transmission : Paddle - shift ( sequential ) gearbox with 20 millisecond shift time
Vehicle Weight : 1070kg
Price : $ 1.8 million ( USD ) est .
Codename : C9

MADISON , Wis. , Feb. 28 ( UPI ) -- Fundraisers in Wisconsin say drag queen bingo and bar bingo with shots is helping recharge a game waning in popularity .
Charities trying to raise cash in a poor economy are trying to change bingo's reputation as a stodgy senior citizen 's game , The Wisconsin State Journal reported Saturday .

" Bingo is trying to ... get away from the stereotype of mature women going to a bingo parlor .
Some are really trying to attract a different group , because their audience is , well , dying , " said Mary Magnuson , lawyer for the National Association of Fundraising Ticket Manufacturers .
In 1995 , an estimated 1,300 charitable groups had active bingo licenses in Wisconsin .
By last year , the number had dropped to 464 active licenses , the Journal reported .
While fewer churches host bingo games , other groups are setting up extra tables for overflow crowds , including drag queen bingo played through the winter in Madison to benefit the AIDS Network , the Journal reported .
Bar bingo also has become so popular that taverns ask charities to come in and run games , Magnuson said .
" It 's hugely popular , " Magnuson said .
" You have a bunch of people in their 20s and 30s who pour in and play , but also drink , eat and have a good time . "
The research aircraft “ Polar 5 ” today concluded its Arctic expedition in Canada .
During the flight , researchers measured the current ice thickness at the North Pole and in areas that have never before been surveyed .
The result :
The sea-ice in the surveyed areas is apparently thicker than scientists had suspected .
Normally , newly formed ice measures some two meters in thickness after two years .
“ Here , we measured ice thickness up to four meters , ” said a spokesperson for Bremerhaven ’s Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research .
At present , this result contradicts the warming of the sea water , according to the scientists .
Apart from measuring ice thickness , the composition of arctic air was also investigated .
With the help of a laser , the researchers studied the level of pollution of the atmosphere by emissions from industrialized countries .
In the next few weeks the results will be evaluated .
Some 20 scientists from the U.S. , Canada , Italy and Germany took part in the expedition .

As I quietly lamented ( or at least noted ) the impending death of GeoCities today , I wanted to double - check my memory that it was once one of the very largest sites on the Web .
Yup–ten years ago , in April 1999 , Web measurement company Media Metrix rated it as the sixth largest online property .
Which got me to wondering :
How many of 1999 ’s Web giants remain gigantic today–assuming they still exist at all ?
That ’s a relatively easy question to answer , since the Media Metrix report ( which is now conducted by ComScore ) still comes out monthly .
In fact , Comscore released the numbers for March 2009 yesterday .
So I did a comparison between the April 1999 report and the March 2009 one .
Are you stunned to learn that more companies fell off the top 15 than stayed on it , and that some of 2009 ’s biggest properties did n’t exist at all in 1999 ?
Here are Media Metrix ’s top 15 Web properties ( ie , networks of related sites ) for April 1999 .
I ’ve rounded the figures for unique visitors up to the nearest million .
1. AOL ( 46 million unique visitors ) : Mock AOL if you must .
But in 2009 it ’s still a biggie–the fourth largest Web property , with 104 million unique visitors .
2. Microsoft ( 32 million unique visitors ) : Still a giant in 2009 – the number - three property with 122 million unique visitors .
3. Yahoo ( 31 million unique visitors ) :
It may have seen more than its share of troubles in recent years , but in 2009 , Yahoo is the second largest Web property , with 146 million unique visitors .
4. Lycos ( 29 million unique visitors ) :
Sold multiple times in the last ten years and greatly downsized but still around in 2009 , as part of a company called Daum ; no longer in the top fifty Web properties .
5. Go Network ( 21 million unique visitors ) : Disney ’s ill - fated attempt to build a Yahoo - like portal remains extant in name only .
Disney Online , its successor , is the 26th largest Web property today , with 28 million unique visitors .
6. GeoCities ( 19 million unique visitors ) .
Yahoo had agreed to buy GeoCities in January 1999 , but did n’t take control until May .
Today , it ’s rolled up into Yahoo ’s numbers .
But some time this year , it ’ll just go away .
7. The Excite Network ( 17 million unique visitors ) : Once - mighty Excite collapsed years ago , but its site remains in business as part of Mindspark , a minor outpost of the IAC empire .
IAC controls the Ask Network , which is the sixth largest Web property with 73 million unique visitors .
8. Time Warner Online ( 13 million unique visitors ) :
Not counting AOL , which it owns today , 2009 ’s Time Warner network is the 33rd largest Web property , with 25 million unique visitors .
9. Blue Mountain Arts ( 12 million unique visitors ) .
This once - hot online greeting card site is still with us , now part of American Greetings , which is n’t a top - 50 property .
10 , AltaVista ( 11 million unique visitors ) :
The original hot search engine is now a sad front end for Yahoo Search , and therefore presumably rolled up into Yahoo ’s ComScore numbers .
11 . Amazon.com ( 10 million unique visitors ) .
Still doing fine–today , Amazon ’s sites reach 61 million visitors , good for tenth place .
12 . Xoom.com ( 9 million unique visitors ) : Back in April of 1999 , Xoom was a mini-empire of Web services , including free hosting , clip - art downloads , and more .
A month later , it partnered up with NBC to become part of that company ’s online efforts .
Then , in 2001 , it went away .
Today ’s Xoom.com , a service for international money transfers , is related in name only .
13 . Snap ( 9 million unique visitors ) :
This site started out as CNet ’s attempt to build a Yahoo - like portal , then became a joint venture with NBC .
And then the name went away at the same time that Xoom did .
The current Snap.com belongs to the unrelated Web site preview company .
14 . Real Networks ( 8 million unique visitors ) :
The online media company remains a top - 50 Web property today–just barely –at # 49 , with 20 million unique visitors .
15 . Cnet ( 8 million unique visitors ) :
The network of tech sites remains a big player today ; in May 2008 , it became part of CBS Interactive .
That property is # 11 in Comscore ’s numbers , with 54 million unique visitors .
So to summarize , four of April 1999 ’s top Web properties remain in the top fifteen ( plus AltaVista , Excite , and GeoCities , which are extant and part of top - 10 properties ) .
Four more are in the top 50 , or are part of properties that are .
Two exist but have fallen out of the top 50 .
And two ( Xoom and Snap ) no longer exist .
Bottom line :
If you were one of the Web ’s biggest properties a decade ago , chances are high that you remain in business in some form in 2009 … but you probably are n’t still a giant .
So who replaced all those companies that fell out of the top 15 over the past decade ?
Here are the properties in Comscore ’s Media Metrix top 15 for March 2009 that I have n’t already mentioned :
1. Google ( 151 million unique visitors ) : Existed in 1999 , but as a not - very - well - known startup that was n’t within a country mile of the top 50 properties .
Today ’s # 1 ranking includes visitors to other sites and services launched or acquired by Google such as YouTube and Gmail–also not yet around in 1999 .
5. Fox Interactive ( 85 million unique visitors ) : Rupert Murdoch ’s empire was on the board in 1999 with News Corp. at # 31 .
But its modern - day incarnation is huge in large part because of MySpace , which did n’t exist until 2003 .
7. eBay ( 70 million unique visitors ) : # 20 in 1999 .
2009 ’s figure presumably includes PayPal and Skype , which it picked up along the way .
8. Wikimedia Network ( 61 million unique visitors ) : I have trouble remembering life without Wikipedia , but it was n’t founded until 2001 .
9. Facebook ( 61 million unique visitors ) .
Founded in 2004 .
10 . Apple ( 53 million unique visitors ) .
In the pre-iTunes era that was 1999 , Apple was n’t a top - 5o property .
11 . Glam Network ( 52 million unique visitors ) .
This ad network of more than 500 independent sites was founded in 2003 .
12 . Turner Network ( 47 million unique visitors ) : Comscore did n’t have Turner–parent of such sites as CNN.
com–as a top - 50 property in 1999 , but it may have been counted as part of Time Warner back then .
13 . Viacom Digital ( 47 million unique visitors ) : # 25 in 1999 .
Anyone care to guess which of today ’s top 15 Web properties –which , to recap , are Google , Yahoo , Microsoft , AOL , Fox , Ask , eBay , Wikimedia , Facebook , Amazon , CBS Interactive , Apple , Glam , Turner , and Viacom–will still be booming in 2019 ?
Which will still be hanging in there ?
Which will be dead , dead , dead ?

There has been ample grumbling from bankers who took the Treasury Department ’s money .
Now , it seems we have our first bank to actually follow through and return the money .
The Treasury bought $ 90 million worth of preferred stock in IberiaBank , based in Lafayette , Louisiana , on Dec. 5 .
Yesterday , the bank announced it has given the Treasury notice that the money is coming right back .
The reason , says the bank ’s CEO in a press release : " We believe recent actions , interpretations , and commentary regarding various aspects of the program places our Company at an unacceptable competitive disadvantage . "
Not the clearest explanation , to be sure .
( Our call to the bank for a clearer take was n’t immediately returned . )
Another CEO from a Louisiana bank , MidSouth , was plainer about his discontent last week : " They 're talking about attaching all sorts of strings to the money …
The Treasury needs to stop listening to the special interests of the ' too big to fail ' banks that got us into this trouble and break them up .
And at the same time it should back away from community banks and let us do what we 're supposed to do with the TARP funds – lend the money . "
Clearly the bailout is n’t popular , and the bankers are unhappy about the added compensation limits and public pressure to lend .
Under the new limits passed by Congress earlier this month , the five most highly compensated execs at IberiaBank would have seen their bonuses limited .
IberiaBank announced that it will be delivering about $ 575,000 in dividends to the Treasury along with the $ 90 million investment on Mar. 31 .
A Treasury spokesman told ProPublica it did receive the bank ’s request and said the redemption should take place without a hitch .
The Treasury has invested in more than 400 banks throughout the country and has been signing up more and more weekly , as you can see on our running tally .
About 162 banks have announced that they wo n’t be taking the Treasury ’s cash , according to the investment firm Keefe , Bruyette , and Woods , but this is the first time that a bank has taken the money and then given it back .
A sign of things to come ?
Some residents of a small Texas municipal district believe that a key
section of landmark voting rights legislation -- created in 1965 to
protect minorities in jurisdictions with a history of racial
discrimination -- is archaic and should be abolished .
The debate has teed up today 's Supreme Court argument , which could forever change the intersection between election law and civil rights .
" The America that has just elected Barack Obama
is not the same America that existed when Section 5 was put into
place , " says Gregory S. Coleman , an attorney for the Northwest Austin
Municipal Utility District .
Section 5 refers to the portion of the Voting Rights Act ( VRA ) that mandates that the Justice Department approve any change in voting procedures for covered jurisdictions .
Coleman will tell the Supreme Court justices that the district is suing the government because Congress was wrong to reauthorize key sections of the Voting Rights Act in 2006 .
" At some point you have to say we 've come far enough .
Why do we
and the other affected jurisdictions have to have the federal
government looking over our shoulder , " says Coleman .
He calls Section 5 -- which currently covers nine states and portions of another seven
-- an " ancient formula " that has become a " badge of shame , " and he
argues that no election - related lawsuit has ever been filed against the
district .
The lawsuit was prompted when some residents of the 3,500
community became infuriated that they had to spend two months and
hundreds of dollars in legal fees just to move a polling place from a
garage to a school .
They support the broader goals of the Voting Rights
Act but believe Section 5 should be scrubbed .
The case has civil rights lawyers worried .
In briefs filed with
the court , the NAACP Legal Defense Fund argues , " No statute in our
history embodies America 's commitment to democracy more clearly than
the Voting Rights Act . "
" We have Section 5 because of a history of jurisdictions doing everything conceivable to adversely affect the ability of African - Americans initially , and other minorities later , to exercise their right to vote , " says John Payton , president of the Legal Defense Fund .
Voting Rights Act Still Necessary ?
Payton dismisses any notion that enough progress has been made to make Section 5 unnecessary .
" Since the last authorization there have been hundreds and
hundreds , hundreds of examples of jurisdictions trying to change
practices and procedures to vote that would have adversely affected the
minorities ' right to vote , "
he says .
" The fact that Section 5 is still working means it 's still
catching things .
If it is still catching things , we need it . "
The Obama administration
agrees .
In court papers , it argues that Congress was right to pass the
latest reauthorization of Section 5 in 2007 , saying that the
legislation " continued this nation 's sacred commitment to eradicating
the effects of its darkest days . "

Noting the history of discrimination across the country , Justice Department lawyer Edwin S. Kneedler writes , " While progress has been made
over the last four decades , Congress in 2006 acknowledged the still
painful reality that this blight has not yet been eradicated . "
The case will be the most important voting rights case to come before Chief Justice John Robert 's court .
At his confirmation hearings , Roberts
was confronted with memos he had written as a young Reagan
administration lawyer in support of narrowing the Voting Rights Act .
During the hearings , he said , " I was a 26 - year - old staff lawyer .
It was
my first job as a lawyer after my clerkships .
I was not shaping
administration policy . "
But as chief justice , Roberts has been skeptical of race - based remedies .
In a Texas redistricting case he wrote , " It is a sordid business , this divvying us up by race . "
Richard L. Hasen , an election law expert at Loyola Law School ,
warned Congress in 2006 that the court could eventually strike down
provisions of the law unless Congress updated it to take into
consideration the law 's success .
He warned that some justices might not
see enough recent evidence of intentional discrimination by states to
justify the Justice Department 's preclearance role .
" No one knows what would happen if Section 5 suddenly disappeared .
It should stand , but it could use some updating , " Hasen said .
Concerns About Problems at the Polls for Minorities
Hasen is concerned that the court could find that the problems that do exist with minorities at the polls exist across the nation , not only in the jurisdictions covered by Section 5 .
" The court could find less than a justification to single out these jurisdictions for additional scrutiny . "
At the time , Hasen proposed a number of steps that would make it
easier for some jurisdictions to no longer be subject to these special
rules if they could prove they had taken enough steps to prevent racial discrimination in voting in their areas .
Congress declined to follow the recommendations .
" If Congress had followed these steps it would have been more likely
that the court would reject arguments against the constitutionality ,
because the law would be more tailored to modern circumstances , " says
Hasen .
" That makes it more likely that the court could strike down the
act as unconstitutional .
Some justice might not see this as an
appropriate remedy for today .
You have to show that there is real evidence of intentional discrimination .
An opinion that strikes down Section 5 could have negative implications for other civil rights laws as well . "
The Supreme Court will rule on the issue by late June .
Most years in my physics courses we construct water bottle rockets as a class project ; but this stunt takes bottle rocketry to new levels .
We never considered launching actual people !
Water bottle rockets illustrate a multitude of relevant physics principles , and they 're fun to build too .
You can construct them using plastic soda bottles as a fuselage , plastic or balsa wood fins , and some PVC piping for a launch pad .
Then all you need is water and ( compressed ) air for rocket fuel .
There are a multitude of websites that explain how to build simple water bottle rockets .
Just make sure you pay attention to the safety precautions .
As far as the physics goes , we could talk about the potential energy stored in the bottles after they are pressurized , the fluid dynamics of the expelled air / water fuel mixture , air drag while in flight , conservation of momentum during the launch phase , and the kinematics of projectile motion .
However , what 's most striking is the relatively large amount of thrust you can generate with this simple set - up .
It may surprise you to learn that the world - record launch for a water bottle rocket is just a hair over 2,000 feet .
This means that the rocket in the video left the launch pad at a speed of over 200 miles per hour !
In the video it appears that they use 25 two - liter bottles to launch the " pilot " a horizontal distance of approximately 25 or 30 meters from the launch point .
He appears to achieve a maximum height of up to 10 meters .
We wo n't go through all of the calculations here , but applying some kinematics and Newton 's laws of motion ( and knowing that the thrust for a water bottle rocket occurs over a time period of about 0.1 to 0.2 seconds ) we can reasonably approximate the acceleration and thrust force acting on the pilot during the time the water / air mixture is being expelled from the rockets .
We find that during this brief period , our prospective astronaut is experiencing forces of up to 2,000 pounds and an acceleration in the neighborhood of 10 _g_s !
No wonder he looks so shaken up afterwards .
Now who says the Japanese space program is n't alive and well ?

I 've been on thise site for a bit and i have noticed that lots of people around here learn " minority " languages like croation , Serbian and Danish , shall i go on ?
Well what motivate 's you to learn these languages when you could derive more beneifit from learning a more widely known languages like Russian in Eastern europe and French , English , German in western Europe .
Like those of you who speak danish i can't help but wonder why .
I was listening to Radio Netherlands ( english ) and they where talking about the possibility of Danish becoming the language of the Home and english becoming the language of school and business ( like in gibraltar )
So back to my original point why do you learn a minority language when you could learn a language like russian and " kill two birds with one stone " ?
By the way im learning russian :)

I suppose Dutch could be considered a ' minority ' language if you compare it with Russian , English or Spanish as it is a language that relatively few people study and it has fewer native speakers than the aforementioned languages .
Having said that , Dutch , like Danish and Croatian , is NOT a minority language in the country it 's spoken in so it would n't really be surprising if someone learns the language for travel reasons ... or because they happen to live there .
I would NEVER have considered learning Dutch if I had n't moved to the Netherlands , although I 'm sure some people would learn Dutch purely out of interest .
I think people learn minority languages either because it 's part of their heritage , live in an area where the language is spoken or simply have an interest in the language or culture .
I would love to learn Tibetan or Georgian in future as I have an interest in their culture and history but a lack of resources ( and time ) have prevented me from doing so yet .

But really Dutch is n't " very neccesary " in the Netherlands .
I know a Polish person who only speaks there native language and english and that person gets along fine over there without Dutch .
Also i know A German who speaks only Deutsch and English and he lives in the UAE and he has no use for arabic ...
Im not sure but do you get a feeling from the Netherland 's and also Denmark i dare say that you do n't have an incentive to learn the language because of the high number of English / French speakers ?

Even in a country like the Netherlands where a large portion of the population speaks English , you will never really fit in with the local people until you know their language .
There will be plenty of occasions where they will be speaking amongst each other in their own language , simply because it feels more comfortable , or because of an inside joke , or maybe because they want to keep something from you .
All the more so when you live an a country like the UAE , where I suspect your German friend mostly hangs out with other expats and only deals with locals when he has to .
When you do move to a new country , learning the language is a must if you really want to be integrated .

But really Dutch is n't " very neccesary " in the Netherlands .
I know a Polish person who only speaks there native language and english and that person gets along fine over there without Dutch .
If this Polish person does n't have a Dutch boyfriend whose parents seem to be the only people in the country who never learnt English , then I 'd suspect that he or she would have nothing to worry about .
People who move to the Netherlands for a job rather than a partner can get along perfectly well without learning Dutch .
They can always choose to hang out with other expats and not worry about whether they 'd offend their partners ' families by not speaking a word of Dutch .
Sadly , I have had more than enough arguments with my boyfriend 's parents who felt it was a bad thing that I was n't fluent in Dutch after just 2 months of living in the Netherlands .
I have also had a lot of people saying that I MUST learn Dutch and will often get ignored at parties and family gatherings because my Dutch is not perfect .
They wo n't use English to communicate with me and yet will not listen when I try my best to speak in Dutch ....
With regards to the workplace , you * can * find a job that does n't require fluent Dutch but these jobs are mostly restricted to call centre and similar jobs .
Even in companies where English is the official language of business , you 'll still have plenty of Dutch colleagues who will prefer not to speak English unless absolutely necessary and who will not really make the effort to socialise with you if your Dutch is not up to scratch ( although this is quite understandable , really ) .
I have had a few meetings at work recently which were conducted in Dutch as I was the only non-Dutch staff member there .
This might be due to the fact that they all know I know enough of the language to cope with a meeting .
So even if the company language is English , that is no guarantee that you will hear nothing but English all day ( I think I hear more Dutch than English at my company ) .
So basically learning Dutch is essential for me , if only to keep my boyfriend 's family and other busy - bodies off my back .
I 'd gladly drop Dutch from my language learning if I had the chance but I know that if I ever want to feel at home here or broaden my career prospects , Dutch is a necessity .
PS .
Not all Dutch people speak English .
I come across plenty of people every day who have trouble stringing a simple sentence together .
Given that English is not the official language of the Netherlands , I can totally understand and respect this .
I just do n't understand why the media and the Dutch themselves portray the Netherlands as an English - speaking haven when it most certainly is n't .

If you are a student in the Netherlands or Flanders , you can easily survive without Dutch .
But just try looking for a job and you 'll find out that outside universities , IT sector and multinational companies being fluent in Dutch is an absolute must .
And as ZanyHermit already said , you 'll never get fully integrated without speaking the local language .

As a foreign language enthusiast I need no practical reason for studying a language - although others might have .
Four weeks ago I started with Danish and not only because I 'll travel to Denmark next year .
It 's the pure interest and if there is some real practice possible , then it's all the better :-)
And it 's not only the language - I will also read books about the history , watch Danish movies , listen to Danish radio - just do various things to get to know as much as I like about the Danish culture .
It 's part of my own lifelong education .
I do indulge in stuff like this .
I just love it !!!
Who can give reasons for what someone loves or not ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama opened a crack on Monday in a decades - old U.S. embargo against communist Cuba , allowing U.S. telecommunications firms to start providing service for Cubans and lifting restrictions on family ties to the island .
In a major shift from the Bush administration ’s more hard - line approach to Havana , Obama ended limits on family travel and money transfers by Cuban Americans in the United States to Cuba .
The decisions unveiled by the White House do not eliminate Washington ’s trade embargo against Cuba set up 47 years ago , but it does hold out the prospect for improving relations between the two longtime foes .
“ The president has directed that a series of steps be taken to reach out to the Cuban people to support their desire to enjoy basic human rights , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters .
“ These are actions he has taken to open up the flow of information . ”
Administration officials said Obama hoped the new measures would encourage Cuba ’s one - party state to implement democratic reforms long demanded by Washington as a condition for removing sanctions imposed after Fidel Castro took power in 1959 .
Shares of companies that stand to gain from a thaw in U.S. ties with Cuba soared on the news , led by Canadian mining and energy company Sherritt International , a major player in Cuba ’s nickel and oil industry , whose stock rose 24.5 percent .
Miami - based cruise operator Royal Caribbean also saw its shares rise on hopes that the No. 2 cruise ship operator and rival Carnival , could sail to Cuba , just 90 miles from the United States .
U.S. telecommunications companies will now be allowed to set up fiber - optic cable and satellite links with Cuba , start roaming service agreements and permit U.S. residents to pay for telecoms , satellite radio and satellite television services provided to individuals in Cuba , the White House said .
Signaling prospects for further gestures , Obama also directed his government to look at starting regularly scheduled commercial flights to Cuba .
Air travel between the United States and Cuba is limited to charter flights at present .

While they insistently call for an end to the U.S. embargo , Cuba ’s leaders have in the past reacted with caution and suspicion to initiatives presented by Washington as seeking to “ open up ” Cuba ’s political system .
Havana rejects arguments that it needs Western - style democracy and has resisted as “ subversive ” past U.S. efforts to channel funds and communications equipment to dissidents and independent journalists on the island .
PRAISE AND CRITICISM
Supporters of easing U.S. sanctions against Cuba hailed the family - related policy changes , which will affect an estimated 1.5 million Americans who have relatives in Cuba .
They voiced hope it would lead to even bolder steps by Obama to dismantle the trade embargo , which critics argue is an obsolete policy that has failed to foster change in Cuba despite being maintained by successive U.S. administrations .
But conservative critics of Obama ’s strategy said it would provide an increased cash flow to help prop up Cuba ’s communist government .
Obama had promised in the presidential campaign to allow Cuban Americans to travel more freely to Cuba and increase financial help to family members , but insisted he would not end the trade embargo until Cuba showed progress toward democracy .
Obama ’s gesture appeared intended to signal a new attitude toward both Cuba and other Latin American countries that have pressed Washington to end a trade embargo that has sought to isolate Havana for more than four decades .

It also comes ahead of Obama ’s attendance at a Summit of the Americas in Trinidad later this week .
Cuba is among the U.S. foes Obama has said he would be willing to engage diplomatically , instead of shunning them as his predecessor George W. Bush did .
“ I enthusiastically applaud this , it is ground breaking ...
... I sincerely hope that this is the beginning of even more relaxation , ” said Silvia Wilhelm , executive director of the Miami - based Cuban American Commission for Family Rights .
Until now , Cubans living in the United States had been allowed to travel to the island only once a year and were limited to send only $ 1,200 per person in cash to needy family members in Cuba .
Obama faced some resistance in Congress , especially from opposition Republicans .
“ President Obama has committed a serious mistake by unilaterally increasing Cuban - American travel and remittance dollars for the Cuban dictatorship , ” said Lincoln Diaz - Balart and Mario Diaz - Balart , both U.S. lawmakers for Florida , home to the largest Cuban exile community in the United States .
The two congressmen accused Obama of violating a broad pledge he made at his inauguration in January to “ extend a hand ” to autocratic rulers around the world on the condition they relaxed their grip on power and opened up to democracy .
At Havana airport , for decades the scene of tearful departures and reunions for families separated by politics and exile , Cubans were overjoyed with Obama ’s measures .
“ This is the most beautiful thing that could happen , ” said 60 - year - old Pablo , saying goodbye to his daughter who was returning to Miami .
“ If Obama does this , all of us will be able to get together .
The family is what matters . ”
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Being a “ dumb blonde ” is nothing to laugh at , unless you ’re actress Anna Faris .
Cast member Anna Faris attends the premiere of " Observe and Report " in Los Angeles April 6 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Phil McCarten
Faris , whose comedy “ Observe and Report ” debuts in movie theaters on Friday , has made a career playing less - than - brainy blondes on film , but in reality she is anything but dumb .
Still , when the 32 - year - old who majored in English literature in college is called stupid in her movie roles , she fails to let it bother her .
In fact , she relishes it .
“ It does n’t bother me if people think I ’m a dumb blonde , ” Faris told Reuters .
“ I spent a lot of energy worrying about what people think , and I already have to do that enough in my career , and I just do n’t want to be preoccupied with it . ”
Raised by parents who kept her on a strict curfew and did not allow her to watch many movies , Faris gained notice in the “ Scary Movie ” series of horror film spoofs in the 1990s .
In recent years , she proved adept at playing a stoner on a quest for pot in “ Smiley Face ” and last year was a Playboy bunny who found herself in a college sorority in “ The House Bunny , ” which she also produced .
Her career track recalls that of an earlier “ dumb blonde , ” Goldie Hawn .
Hawn , 63 , played a dimwitted dancer on TV comedy “ Rowan & Martin ’s Laugh - In ” before winning an Oscar in 1969 ’s “ Cactus Flower . ”
Hawn ’s first foray into producing , “ Private Benjamin , ” proved to be a box office blockbuster in 1980 .
NEW MOVIE , OLD TRICKS
Faris is up to her old -- and rather stupid -- tricks again in “ Observe and Report ” as a vacuous cosmetics counter clerk who attracts the interest of a mall security guard named Ronnie , played by Seth Rogen .
In one scene , Faris appears nearly passed out on a bed after too much partying , with vomit streaked on her pillow .
It is just one of many over - the - top sequences in a film centered on Ronnie ’s mission to catch a nude flasher run amok in a shopping mall .
“ My mom might need a glass of wine before she watches ( the movie ) , ” Faris joked .
Faris said she was raised in a fairly conservative manner in suburban Seattle , but her parents let her stay up as late as she wanted if she was reading .
She gained her independence at the University of Washington , where she studied literature .
Her favorite authors include Joyce Carol Oates and Flannery O’Connor .
Faris said she would love to write but admits to agonizing over each sentence and having problems developing plots .
She turned “ House Bunny ” into a moderate box office success with $ 70.4 million in global ticket sales .
The seeds of her next comedy idea involve her portraying a “ flawed , dispassionate woman . ”
“ I think we ’ve seen a lot of very driven , Type A women on screen in the last decade , especially in comedies , and I want to explore the other area , ” she said .
Faris holds fast to the lesson , taught to her by director Keenen Ivory Wayans in his “ Scary Movie ” parodies , that there is no vanity in comedy .
So , she dives into every role with no regard to appearances .
Even when she talks about taking on a dramatic role instead of a comedy , Faris cannot avoid joking about it .
“ Somewhere in there , there ’s like the heroin addicted prostitute that ’s just yearning to come out , ” she joked .
Relations between President Karzai's Afghan government and Washington are at an all - time low .
As Richard Holbrooke - President Obama 's envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan - prepares to make his first visit to the region since being appointed , the BBC's Ian Pannell in Kabul looks at why the relationship has soured .
Mr Karzai has fallen out of favour Hamid Karzai has become increasingly vociferous in his criticism of American military tactics and has been making half - hearted threats to shift his allegiance to Moscow if he does not get his way .
Washington has yet to publicly declare its hand but a series of well - placed leaks , briefs and snubs have raised the prospect that it could move its support elsewhere in this year 's presidential election .
One Afghan newspaper spoke of " a new cold war " .
A senior Afghan government official says the new Obama administration has insulted President Karzai and one prominent MP accuses America of " running a shadow - government " .
' Narco- state '
The decline in relations began with a visit last year by Joe Biden , now the vice - president , to Kabul .
Joe Biden 's meeting with President Karzai reportedly did not go well
At the time , as the Democratic vice - presidential candidate , he attended a private meeting with Mr Karzai .
A well - placed source describes Mr Biden , exasperated at not getting " straight answers " on drugs and corruption , launching into a verbal tirade and storming out of the meeting .
In a country where honour and decorum are second only to God and country , this was less than tactful .
On the campaign trail and more recently in confirmation hearings , senior members of President Barack Obama 's team have questioned the effectiveness and honesty of Hamid Karzai 's government .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's written statement to Congress during her confirmation hearing called Afghanistan a " narco- state " that was " plagued by limited capacity and widespread corruption " .
She may have been wise enough not to use the phrase in her public testimony but by the time it was reported on the front page of the newspapers in Kabul , it did not really make much difference .
' Potential impediment ' Earlier in January the Nato secretary - general wrote an opinion piece about the lack of leadership in the country , laying the blame not at the feet of the Taleban but the lack of governance .
Civilians need better protection , says Mr Karzai
Then there was a recent article in the New York Times .
Quoting anonymous " senior administration officials " , it said Washington planned to take a tougher - line with Kabul and that Hamid Karzai was now regarded as " a potential impediment to American goals " in the country .
Hamid Karzai is an avid reader of the Western press and is known to be highly sensitive to criticisms they may have of him .
Publicly he has not responded but he is now under considerable pressure .
His government 's writ is limited to Kabul , the north and a few urban spots elsewhere in the country .
His own popularity has fallen and some whisper privately and mischievously about his " state of mind " .
When asked whether the country was heading towards a crisis , one senior political figure responded that the country was already in one .
Old Afghan hand President Karzai has been holding a series of meetings with former Mujahedeen commanders in the past few weeks amid suggestions that he is trying to align the country with Russia .
The president wants new rules of engagement for Nato troops
That has certainly been his public stance .
As well as a deliberately leaked " letter of understanding " with Moscow , President Karzai publicly warned America that unless it supplied the military hardware he wanted , he would look to other countries for support .
No -one was in a moment 's doubt who this meant .
The Russian ambassador , Zamir Kabulov , an old Afghan hand , was seen strutting around parliament last week .
He has warned that the US and Nato are repeating the same mistakes of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan .
As he was posted to the Soviet Embassy at the time , his opinion is worth considering .
Now President Karzai has sent a document to Nato outlining new " rules of engagement " .
If implemented they would substantially alter the mandate for foreign forces in the country .
It seems inconceivable that there could be a real and lasting schism between Kabul and Washington .
It will be the job of Richard Holbrooke , the US Special Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , to ensure that does not happen .
But the date has been set for Afghanistan 's presidential election and the West 's disappointment with Hamid Karzai can no longer be disguised .
A number of challengers are jostling for American support and in the current climate , their chances are starting to improve .

Pelosi , awaiting key reports , sees possible ' criminal activity ' in detainee abuse David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday April 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Pelosi says she hopes to ' learn a great deal more ' from Inspectors General reports on torture , due in June
In a wide - ranging conversation with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) on Wednesday night , MSNBC host Keith Olbermann waited until the final moments of his interview to raise questions on the allegations of torture against the Bush administration .
Pelosi said that despite a difference in opinion between Congress and the Obama White House on the matter , " we believe that we have to take a look " to ferret out potential " criminal activity " in the treatment of detainees .
The question was raised after Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) told MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow that he would support a Department of Justice investigation into the reported torture .
His comments came on the heels of a leaked report by the International Committee of the Red Cross which alleges terror war captives were systemically abused , the process of which included CIA medical personnel .
The Red Cross also said that some detainees disappeared .
The 40 - page document is based on ICRC interviews with 14 " high - value " detainees sent to the US base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in September 2006 , following spells at secret CIA detention centers abroad .
" Well , the administration has said we are closing Guantanamo , " said Pelosi .
" We know that and we are in the process of doing that .
They have said that the United States does not torture . "
" Clearly they have done what has needed to be done , in terms of going forward , the Obama administration , " said Olbermann . " ... But to truly eradicate it , you have to go back and clean out the stables .
Is n't it necessary to correct the past rather than just saying we 're not going to do this again ? "
Pelosi , noting a " difference of opinion " between the Obama White House and Congress , said " we believe that we have to take a look at what happened ; there may be criminal activity . "
" There has to be some way for the truth to be known , A , and B , acted upon , for people engaged in illegal activity , " she continued .
" And hopefully we 'll learn a great deal more from the inspectors general when they have their reports in June on this subject , it 's very , very important . "
The ICRC report on American torture of detainees is available online ( PDF link ) .

The FDIC will set up investment partnerships and lend 85 percent of the money needed to buy up troubled assets that banks want to sell .
This will be accomplished with low interest , non-recourse loans , and lots of taxpayer money .
It remains to be seen how purchased assets will be priced .
Incidentally , this is how the Resolution Trust Corporation ( RTC ) unloaded much of the real estate from the savings and loan crisis -- non recourse loans .
The Treasury will hire four or five investment management firms , matching the private money that each of the firms puts up on a dollar - for - dollar basis with government money .
If this turns out to be part of the package then one can assume they have the managers lined up .
The Treasury plans to expand lending through the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility .
The plan is to buy up as many toxic assets as possible so that banks can get back to lending .
The available monies to the Treasury will be running out of money soon so the key word here is -- leverage .
We never learn .
This is not very different from what was proposed last September .
More and more , it appears the new toxic asset plan is a mirage -- it is being done with smoke and mirrors .
Current talk is that the Treasury is going to buy $ 1 trillion in troubled mortgages and related assets from financial institutions .
It should be noted that this means we , the taxpayers , are going to be buying these toxic assets .
The plan is being designed to rescue the nation ’s banking system by taking the toxic assets off their balance sheets .
Does that sound familiar ?
Nouriel Roubini has been writing about this for some time , and if he is right the numbers are staggering .
More than the $ 2 trillion that is currently being forecast .
It appears the plan has three parts :
It has more buzz words and wrinkles but one thing remains the same -- lots of taxpayer money ; and hope that this strategy will help avoid the inevitable nationalization of banks .
There is one big wild card .
Will the banks be willing to sell the mortgages at prices substantially below the prices they paid for these securities .
Stay tuned -- I doubt it .
WEST LAFAYETTE , Ind . –
Fish do n’t make noises or contort their faces to show that it hurts when hooks are pulled from their mouths , but a Purdue University researcher believes they feel that pain all the same .
Joseph Garner , an assistant professor of animal sciences , helped develop a test that found goldfish do feel pain , and their reactions to it are much like that of humans .
A paper detailing the finding was published in the early online version of the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science .
“ There has been an effort by some to argue that a fish ’s response to a noxious stimuli is merely a reflexive action , but that it did n’t really feel pain , ” Garner said .
“ We wanted to see if fish responded to potentially painful stimuli in a reflexive way or a more clever way . ”
Garner and Janicke Nordgreen , a doctoral student in the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science , attached small foil heaters to the goldfish and slowly increased the temperature .
The heaters were designed with sensors and safeguards that shut off the heaters to prevent any physical damage to a fish ’s tissue .
Half of the fish were injected with morphine , and the others received saline .
The researchers believed that those with the morphine would be able to withstand higher temperatures before reacting if they actually felt the pain .
However , both groups of fish showed a response at about the same temperature .
Because both groups of fish wriggled at about the same temperature , the researchers thought the responses might be more like a reflex than a cognitive reaction to experiencing pain .
The reflexive response is similar to a person involuntarily moving a hand off a hot stove with which they had come into contact .
The reaction happens before a person actually experiences pain or understands that they have been hurt .
Upon later observation in their home tanks , however , the researchers noticed that the fish from each group were exhibiting different behaviors .
“ The fish given the morphine acted like they always had : swimming and being fish , ” Garner said .
“ The fish that had gotten saline – even though they responded the same in the test – later acted different , though .
They acted with defensive behaviors , indicating wariness , or fear and anxiety . ”
Nordgreen said those behavioral differences showed that fish can feel both reflexive and cognitive pain .
“ The experiment shows that fish do not only respond to painful stimuli with reflexes , but change their behavior also after the event , ” Nordgreen said .
“ Together with what we know from experiments carried out by other groups , this indicates that the fish consciously perceive the test situation as painful and switch to behaviors indicative of having been through an aversive experience . ”
Garner believes that the morphine blocked the experience of pain , but not behavioral responses to the heat stimulus itself – either because the responses were reflexive or because the morphine blocked the experience of pain , but not the experience of an unusual stimulus .
“ If you think back to when you have had a headache and taken a painkiller , the pain may go away , but you can still feel the presence or discomfort of the headache , ” Garner said .
Those with saline both experienced pain in the test , as well as responding to it , and were able to cognitively process that pain , thus causing the later fear and anxiety .
“ The goldfish that did not get morphine experienced this painful , stressful event .
Then two hours later , they turned that pain into fear like we do , ” Garner said .
“ To me , it sounds an awful lot like how we experience pain . ”
The findings could raise questions about slaughter methods and how fish are handled in research .
Garner said standards of care could be revisited to ensure fish are being treated humanely .
A few clips of the Expendables is now available :
The Expendables - Boat Gunfight
The Expendables - Basketball Fight
The Expendables - Rebel fight
The Expendables - Smaller
The Expendables - Cockpit
The Expendables - Tatoo
The Expendables - Run and die
If those clips are any indicator of what to expect , then the Expendables movie is going to be pure awesomeness !
Long live Sylvester Stallone !
:)
More clips of the Expendables below :
I found this clip this morning and thought I 'd share it here at C&L .
The clip is from 1990 when a much younger Rush Limbaugh got owned by the studio audience during his very brief career in television .
The crowd eventually becomes so incensed by his nasty attacks on women that he can't get a word in edgewise and they are forced to clear the studio in order for Rush to actually finish the segment .
Rush has challenged President Obama to a debate , but only because he knows there is n't a hope in hell it will ever happen .
He knows he would n't stand a chance , but that 's not going to stop him from rallying his ignorant minions .
He cares nothing for his party , this nation or its people , he 's out for power , money and fame -- much like the party he now leads .
If you 've ever wondered why cowards like Limbaugh , O'Reilly and those of their ilk never debate anyone of any substance , watching this clip will help you understand .
When exposed to the average American , hate merchants and propagandists like Rush do n't stand a chance .
el Rashbo has n't changed much in the past twenty years and neither has the GOP .
I would n't advise the president to lower himself to debate this idiot , but in my heart of hearts ... oh , nevermind !
Jeff Sachs comes down hard on the Geithner plan , and his worries need to be taken seriously .
I was starting to come to the conclusion that the plan would simply fizzle — that even though participating players would get a large put along with their free toaster , it would n’t be enough to raise the price they ’re willing to pay to a level banks would be willing to sell at , rather than keep assets on the books at far above their true value .
But once you take into account the possibility of insider deals , that all changes .
As Jeff says , a bank can create an off - balance - sheet entity that buys bad assets for far more than they ’re worth , using money borrowed from taxpayers , then defaults — in effect a straight transfer from taxpayers to stockholders .
If there ’s a mechanism to police such deals , it is n’t clear .
And the sense that the administration is just too close to Wall Street continues to grow .
By GottaLaff
You have got to be kidding .
I posted about the " birthers " Friday the Thirteenth petition , and as you see in the video above , Rachel Maddow covered the story that day .
Guess what :
The Supremes accepted a petition from World Net Daily :
bearing names of over 325,000 people asking the court to rule on whether or not the sitting president fulfills the Constitution 's " natural - born citizen " clause
the judge promised before the gathered crowd that he would , indeed , read and review the briefs and petition
" Tell me what to do , what can I do ? "
Taitz reports asking Scalia .
" Those soldiers [ her plaintiffs ] can be court - martialed for asking a legitimate question , who is the president , is he legitimate ? "
She says Scalia responded , " Bring the case , I 'll hear it , I do n't know about others . " [...]
" I said , ' Justice Roberts , my name is Orly Taitz .
I 'm an attorney from California , and I got up at 3 o'clock in the middle of the night , flew and drove thousands of miles just to ask you a question .
So please give me some leeway , ' " Taitz told WND .
" My question is , do you know there is illegal activity going on in the Supreme Court of the United States ? "
According to Taitz , the room was stunned silent as she continued , " I have presented my case to you , and you personally agreed to hear this case in conference .
But your clerk refused to forward a supplemental brief to you .
He has hidden this brief from you .
He refused to put it on the docket .
Additionally , my case was erased from the docket one day after the Inauguration , two days before my case was to be heard .
" Outraged citizens and members of the media and state representatives are calling the Supreme Court , demanding to have the case reentered on the docket , " Taitz told Roberts .
Then she held up the WND petition and continued , " Moreover , here are the names of U.S. citizens who signed this petition and who sent individual letters to individual justices , including you , Justice Roberts , all of them demanding the same thing – that you hear my case in regards to Barack Hussein Obama 's eligibility for presidency . "
According to Taitz , Roberts approached the microphone and said , " I see you have papers .
I promise you I will read all your papers , I will review them .
Please give them to my Secret Service and I will review all of them . "
Shortly thereafter , Taitz told WND , a Secret Service agent identified by his badge as Gilbert Shaw accepted two suitcases of documents and pledged to deliver them to Roberts .
This years Formula
One season kick - offs this month and all of the leading teams have now revealed their 2009 challengers and its perhaps time to consider who is likely to deliver the goods .
Remember the last lap ?
Well it starts up again at the end of the month !
The new regulations :
Its not just a question of the regular suspects carrying on where they left off last year either , as a whole raft of new regulations has meant that everyone has had to go back to the drawing board ( alright Computer - Aided Design system ) and start from scratch .
As a result , this years cars look dramatically different to their predecessors , having large , wide front wings , and tall narrow rear ones .
Oh , and slick tyres are back as well .
Its been interesting to see how the various teams designers have interpreted some of the new rules as well , Toyota and Williams in particular having come up with a design around the rear diffuser , which extracts air from beneath the car and helps improve downforce , which has raised a few eyebrows and had F1 insiders questioning its legality .
However , the governing body , the FIA , has apparently declared the design legal so expect others to adapt theirs in a copycat fashion before the start of the season .
The other major unknown is how the teams have developed their new KERS designs and whether or not they will run with them at the start of the season .
KERS stands for Kinetic Energy Recovery System and is a way of harnessing the energy generated from braking and using it to help propel the car .
Most teams have adopted a system using batteries but the Williams team has gone out on a limb with a small , rotating flywheel .
There have already been some concerns over safety with these systems and a BMW - Sauber mechanic received a nasty electric shock from one during testing at the end of last year .
But - who 's going to win ?
But back to the question in hand whos going to come out on top .
Its not just going to be down to who the best driver is , but how well their team has adapted to the new regulations .
Well , expect reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton and McLaren to be up there .
The team does get it wrong sometimes with its car design , and so far testing has n't gone that well with a lack of top speed .
But they have the resources to bounce back .
Whether his team - mate Heikki Kovalainen can up his game a bit this year remains to be seen .
Hamiltons closest challenger for the title last year was Felipe Massa and expect more of the same .
Ferrari again appear to have produced a competitive car and Massas team - mate , 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen is expected to have regained his motivation which seemed to have slipped away in the second half of last season .
He should certainly give Massa and Hamilton a harder time this year .
Next up theres the BMW - Sauber duo of Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica .
This team curtailed development of its 2008 car , must to Kubicas annoyance last year , in order to concentrate on this years model , particularly the KERS technology , so it ought to be better prepared than many of the others .
Kubica won his first Grand Prix last year while Hedifeld sometimes struggled to keep up .
I would expect to see Kubica stamp his authority on the team again this year and be a real challenger .
BMW could be really , really good this year
Whos next ?
Oh yes , Fernando Alonso and Nelson Piquet at Renault .
The new car is very striking but has seemed to lack straightline speed in testing , resulting in the team undertaking some intensive runs at Kemble Airfield in Gloucestershire .
If they sort the car then Alonso will be challenging , if not , expect some sulks .
The jurys still out as far as Piquets ability to cope at the very top .
Hes an accomplished driver but if he doesnt deliver this year hell sink without trace .
Toyota really needs to win a race in 2009 in order to justify the massive amount it has spent on its F1 campaign over the years , so far without notable success .
The new car looks good but the team is way behind on KERS development .
Both Jarno Trulli and Timo Glock are capable of running at the front if they have the right machinery beneath them .
Expect one of them to spring a surprise at some point in the season .
Look how clean and tidy that factory is - can't win though , can they ?
Last year Toro Rosso scored a surprise victory at the Italian GP but their star driver , Sebastian Vettel has move to sister team Red Bull .
The former has the advantage of Ferrari engines while Red Bull uses Renault , which arent as fast , so drivers Sebastien Buemi and Sebastien Bourdais ( there are too many Sebastiens around here ! ) will have an advantage but dont expect fireworks and I should be surprised if they score another victory .
Red Bull on the other hand has produced possibly the most innovative looking car on the grid , albeit late in the day with little time left for testing .
Lead driver Mark Webber broke his leg badly in a cycling accident last year and is still recovering .
Its bound to affect him in some way , so dont be surprised to see Vettel take the upper hand .
In fact , I put Vettel down as a serious championship challenger this year .
Id like to see Williams driver Nico Rosberg do well but I think the team will still be running in the middle of the field most of the time .
Kazuki Nakajima is too erratic to deliver the goods consistently .
As for the rest , Brawn with Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello are all cobbled together and if you go by their testing form , they could be the surprise of the year .
Barrichello has been has been flying , but once the testing stops , we will see how good they actually are .
Force India will be using Mercedes engines and have technical input from McLaren , so have no excuse not to move forward in some way with Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella .
So whos going to be champion ?
Pick from Hamilton , Massa , Raikkonen , Kubica or Vettel , depending on whos got the best car .
And we wont know that until the Australian Grand Prix on 29 March .
Who do you think is going to win ?
Are you going to any races this year ?
Why not let us know by commenting below .
So , picking up where I left off ...
David Moon , about whom the internet knows surprisingly little , gave a wild talk on a language he 's been working on : the Programming Language for Old - Timers .
Actually the talk was n't about the language , but its macro system .
PLOT is a language with syntax , but whose grammar is defined in itself .
PLOT macros take token streams , produced by a fixed tokenizer , and perform LL ( 1 ) parsing on that stream , building up abstract syntax tree objects or returning other token streams .
Actually , given that macro output can be AST objects , macros take AST fragments as well .
The interesting thing is that macros are hygienic , that they track source locations , and that they have access to the full PLOT language themselves .
It seems that you can actually implement Lisp macros on top of PLOT macros .
Anyway , a sharp tool , but I look forward to seeing what Moon carves with it .
Next up was a talk by Joe Marshall , a Scheme hacker now working at Google , about implementing continuations on machines with no continuation support , like the JVM or CLR .
The basic idea was for functions to be modified to return an OK / Error flag , with the actual return value in an additional output argument .
The compiler should do some live - variable analysis , and have a separate flow path that saves variable values all the way down the stack , as functions return " Error " , and that can be restored when you reinstate a continuation .
It 's nasty .
Joe must really want Scheme on the CLR .
Next there was Alexey Radul , a grad student of Sussman 's , giving a talk entitled " The Art of the Propagator " .
The concepts were interesting , although hindered by Radul 's poor diction .
The basic idea appears to be an approach to calculating constraints - based systems in the presence of backtracking and conflicting information , with electronics as a metaphor -- connecting boxes and wires , signals flowing back and forth .
Not like any problem I have ever seen in practice , though .
Following that were a set of lightning talks , the last of which was legendary : one M. Greenberg ( who was that guy ? ) talking about the history of an old macro system , TRAC .
Apparently all computation in TRAC was done by macros .
Macros could rewrite their definitions out of existence , and thus be recursive and terminate .
It was startling , but Greenberg steeled our resolve with the words , " Do n't be afraid of macros -- they 'll sense your fear , and fuck you up . "
Then , a panel discussion on the future of Lisp , the ostensible topic of the conference .
From left to right there was Pascal Costanza , an academic from Brussels hacking mostly on CLOS - related things ; Edi Weitz , an industrial Common Lisp hacker ; Ravi Nanavati , an erstwhile Schemer but current Haskeller ; Rich Hickey , Clojure language designer ; Alan Bawden , former Scheme Steering Committee member ; Duane Rettig , Allegro CL hacker ; and Scott McKay , a former Scheme and Dylan hacker now working for ITA software .
Kent Pitman moderated .
It started good , with the long view , then things devolved .
Eventually the audience started to talk with each other instead of with the panel , and for some reason settled down onto the " why is n't Lisp popular " navel - gaze .
Quite disappointing .
After dinner , there was a staged " debate " on " Macros : Are they a menace ? "
It was obvious that the panel ( Steele , Gabriel , Costanza , and the scapegoat , someone whose name I forget ) was having a good time .
At one point , Gabriel wrote out the " ( defmacro ..... ) " on the chalkboard , noted that the " ... " is often large and thus heavy and must sink to the bottom , leaving the parenthesis before the " defmacro " looking like a frowny face : q.e.d .
More seriously , the arguments against macros centered on control : control by bosses on workers , with the idea that macros make custom languages , thus making individual programmers less replaceable .
While I do n't believe the premise , the conclusion to me comes from another world .
I hack Free Software precisely because I like my trade , and want to practice it in an environment free from coercion and domination .
The " debate " had an interlude , in which Costanza asked Sussman why MIT had switched away from Scheme for their introductory programming course , 6.001 .
This was a gem .
He said that the reason that happened was because engineering in 1980 was not what it was in the mid-90s or in 2000 .
In 1980 , good programmers spent a lot of time thinking , and then produced spare code that they thought should work .
Code ran close to the metal , even Scheme -- it was understandable all the way down .
Like a resistor , where you could read the bands and know the power rating and the tolerance and the resistance and V=IR and that 's all there was to know .
6.001 had been conceived to teach engineers how to take small parts that they understood entirely and use simple techniques to compose them into larger things that do what you want .
But programming now is n't so much like that , said Sussman .
Nowadays you muck around with incomprehensible or nonexistent man pages for software you do n't know who wrote .
You have to do basic science on your libraries to see how they work , trying out different inputs and seeing how the code reacts .
This is a fundamentally different job , and it needed a different course .
So the good thing about the new 6.001 was that it was robot - centered -- you had to program a little robot to move around .
And robots are not like resistors , behaving according to ideal functions .
Wheels slip , the environment changes , etc -- you have to build in robustness to the system , in a different way than the one SICP discusses .
And why Python , then ?
Well , said Sussman , it probably just had a library already implemented for the robotics interface , that was all .

Now it 's Tuesday morning , which started with some guy talking about bombing people with Lisp .
Or maybe it was about supplying parts to the military .
At one point there was a slide with a little clip - art tank and a clip - art pistol and a clip - art fighter jet .
Sheesh .

The government is expected to provide money for sites where work has stopped because of funding problems and for building council houses .
The stamp duty ‘ holiday ’ on buying housing is also expected to be extended .
An announcement is also expected on a scheme to turn unsold homes into social housing .
Darling is also expected to reveal a rise in public borrowing of as much as £ 160 billion as tax revenues fall due to the recession .

There is no indication yet whether any of the £ 1 billion has been earmarked for the beleaguered LSC framework .
RIBA welcomed the announcement , issuing a statement to the AJ saying : ‘ The proposed £ 1 billion boost to move housing projects along should be very worthwhile particularly if this initiates a start up in new houses being built .
Architects working on both private and social housing have seen a huge drop - off in their work and anything the Government can do to help kick - start this would hugely help that large number of practices .

1 Family sued Oliver Stone and Warner Brothers for crime inspired on their movie
In 1996 , the family of Patsy Ann Byers sued Oliver Stone , Warner Brothers , and others involved in the making and distribution of the movie “ Natural Born Killers ” for an unspecified amount .
The frivolous lawsuit claimed that the movie caused Sarah Edmondson and Benjamin Darrus to go on a crime spree which resulted in Edmonson shooting Byers during a robbery , leaving her paralyzed from the chest down .
The case was ultimately dismissed in June 2002 when a Louisiana appeals court ruled that neither Oliver Stone nor Time Warner intended to inspire violence with the film and they could not be held responsible for the actions of the film ’s audience .
2 Man sued Bud for not getting beautiful women
In 1991 , Richard Overton sued Anheuser - Busch , creators of Budweiser , for $ 10,000 .
He claimed to have suffered emotional distress , mental injury , and financial loss because drinking beer did not make his fantasies of beautiful women in tropical settings come to life , as he claimed it had advertised , driving him to buy and drink more and more Bud Light .
The case was dismissed .
3 Customer sued dry cleaner for $ 65 million over lost pants
In another frivolous lawsuit , Roy Pearson Jr , a judge in Washington , tried to bully a family - owned dry cleaning shop by suing the owners for $ 54 million in damages after they lost his pants .
The case demoralized the South Korean immigrant owners of the business and brought demands that the customer be disbarred and removed from office for pursuing a frivolous and abusive claim .
Pearson ’s lawsuit against Custom Cleaners of Northwest D.C. eventually ended with a U.S. District Judge finding for the defendants .
Pearson later indicated that he would appeal .
4 Couple sued American Airlines over more legroom
Jerome and Judith O’Callaghan filed a $ 100,000 suit against American Airlines in 2004 because they did n’t have enough legroom on a flight to Paris .
The couple claimed the airlines had advertised generous legroom , but said it was n’t the case .
Their nine - hour flight left them with back and leg pain .
Allegedly the limited space made Jerome ’s legs so unsteady that he tripped and broke his nose and teeth later at the entrance to the Basilica of St. Paul ’s in Rome .
5 Rapist sued employer for not preventing him from committing crime
In 2002 , a Sandusky man serving a 10 - year sentence for raping a patient at the former Providence Hospital sued the hospital for negligence .
Edward Brewer sued the hospital for $ 2 million , claiming they were negligent by not preventing him from raping one of its patients .
The judge ruled that any damage Brewer suffered due to his crime was his responsibility for choosing to commit the crime , and that the hospital had no legal duty to protect him from that choice .
6 Batman vs Batman : Mayor of Batman city sued Warner Brothers
The mayor of an oil - producing city in southeastern Turkey , which has the same name as the Caped Crusader , sued helmer Christopher Nolan and Warner Bros for royalties from mega - grosser “ The Dark Knight . ” Huseyin Kalkan , the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party mayor of Batman accused “ The Dark Knight ” producers of using the city ’s name without permission .
“ There is only one Batman in the world , ” Kalkan said .
“ The American producers used the name of our city without informing us . ”
No one from the town of Batman has explained why it took so many years to take legal action , since Batman first appeared - as a comic book character - in 1939 .
7 German Playboy , 77 , sued a 19 - year - old for refusing to sleep with him
Aging German playboy Rolf Eden filed charges against a 19 - year - old for refusing to sleep with him .
The complaint ?
Ageism .
He says , despite a night on the town with Eden , which ended back at his place , she refused to have sex with him , saying the he was too old for her .
So he filed charges with the prosecutors ’ office : “ After all , there are laws against discrimination . ”
Eden is well known to Germans for having been the king of Berlin nightlife in the ‘ 50s and ’60s .
The elderly playboy –who claims to have bedded between 2,000 and 3,000 women in his long life - – once shocked Berlin by saying he would like to die while having sex .
He wrote : “ I would like to die as I have lived : on a woman .
” He also said that there are some women who are too old for him .
But in that case he would be more diplomatic and say , ‘ sorry , you ’re not my type ’ .
8 Man sued over lap dance injury
In 2008 , a married investment broker in his 30s sued a midtown strip club .
Stephen Chang claimed in court papers that he was at the Hot Lap Dance Club near Madison Square Garden in Manhattan alone and was getting a paid lap dance when the accident occurred .
According to the lawsuit , as the dancer swung around , the heel of her shoe hit him in the eye , causing him “ to sustain serious injuries . ”
The lawsuit claimed the club “ and / or its employee ” were “ negligent ” for her “ suddenly swinging around ” and his lawyer says Chang sustained “ serious injuries . ”
9 Viewer sued NBC over ‘ Fear Factor ’ rat- eating episode
After watching an episode of the reality TV show Fear Factor on NBC in 2005 , Austin Aitken sued the network for $ 2.5 million .
He said the sight of contestants eating blended rats disgusted him so much that his health suffered .
He claimed the show raised his blood pressure rise , made him dizzy , and caused him to vomit .
He also became so disoriented , he smashed into a door .
The lawsuit was thrown out of court .
10 Man sued wife for donated kidney
After Long Island doctor Richard Batista was slapped with divorce papers from his cheating wife , he decided he ’d had enough and sued her for the return of a gift he ’d give her eight years prior : a kidney .
After the successful transplant , Dawnell – Batista ’s wife– survived , but not their marriage , which lasted only another four years .
The heartbroken doctor requested the one - time love of his life to pay $ 1.5 million for the organ he donated .
He insisted his cash - for - kidney claim was a direct result of his wife ’s behavior .
11 Shop Owner sued a homeless for $ 1 Million
In 2007 , a Manhattan antique shop owner ’s lawsuit against hobos who camped in front of his store generated debate about what to do with New York ’s homeless , many of whom spend winter nights on the street .
Karl Kemp , owner of the posh Karl Kemp & Associates Antiques on Madison Avenue , sued three men and a woman for $ 1 - million , alleging they scare away customers when they drink alcohol , urinate and warm themselves above a heating duct in front of his shop .
Kemp ’s suit , filed in state Supreme Court , also seeked an order to keep them 30 m away .
12 Student sued school after being awakened by teacher
A 16 - year - old Connecticut high school student who fell asleep in class alleged he suffered substantial hearing loss when his math teacher smacked her palm down on his desk to wake him up while she was teaching , so his parents decided to sue Danbury High School , the Connecticut Board of Education and the city of Danbury on his behalf .
Attorney Alan Barry says 15 - year - old Vinicios Robacher suffered pain and “ very severe injuries to his left eardrum ” when teacher Melissa Nadeau abruptly slammed the palm of her hand on his desk .
Vinicios has been teased by students at school ever since .
Elite troops arrived 90 minutes after the fighting began
There was confusion outside the Manawan police training academy in Lahore , Pakistan , for at least 90 minutes after the gunmen stormed the place .
Some kind of coherent response developed only later , with elite police commando units , the paramilitary rangers as well as army troops surrounding the compound .
Policemen interviewed by TV crews on the spot said the attack came during the morning parade hour when more than 800 trainees were out , all unarmed .
The militants entered the sprawling compound , apparently by scaling the boundary wall , and threw grenades at the parading trainees .
Ilyas , a police constable and eyewitness , told reporters : " We were exercising in the training ground inside the compound when we heard a blast . "
" A great cloud of dust blew over us and I felt something hit my face .
When I touched my face there was blood all over . "
" Then I saw a man firing a Kalashnikov running towards us .
He had a beard and his face was partially covered by a bandanna .
Three of my colleagues fell down in the burst of firing .
I just turned and ran .
Thank God , I managed to get away . "
Police sub - inspector Mohammad Riaz , one of the trainers who is holed up inside the school , told a TV reporter that he was trapped inside with " 10 to 12 people , including policemen and recruits " .
He said the attack happened when a police parade was going on around 0730 .
About 750 policemen were participating in the parade , he said .
" I was in my room .
Suddenly there was an explosion .
Then a second , and a third .
Some three or four big explosions , after which firing from heavy weapons started , " said Mr Riaz .
" They [ probably ] first threw in some grenades or rocket propelled grenades from outside the wall .
The recruits started running .
I saw them running .
I tried to get out [ of the room ] , but then heavy weapon fire started from all directions . "
" I could n't judge where it was coming from .
All the windowpanes of the building were broken .
Then we took shelter in a room and stayed there until the rescue people arrived . "
Mr Riaz said the attackers were present at " three or four positions " .
" Two or three men are on the second floor [ of the building ] , some are on the third floor above , said the policeman , who said he was armed with a gun .
Some of the trainees did manage to escape , one of them with a bullet in his leg .
TV cameras peeping from over the boundary wall captured motionless images of five or six policemen , lying on the ground in the parade area .
They appeared dead , though some may have been only injured .
Some civilians were also hit and injured on the road outside the compound , apparently when the attackers fired in the direction of police security at the gate along the road .
Rescue workers have been able to take some of the injured out of the school in armoured personnel carriers .
Speculation Despite growing incidents of militant attacks across the country , the school only had peacetime security in place at the time .
Besides , some experts interviewed on TV said the training schools usually had small armouries , with old weapons not fit to counter the modern weapons of the militants .
A senior retired police official , Afzal Shigri , said it was not known whether the trainees were new recruits or trained officials on mid-service training .
He said new recruits were unlikely to challenge the attackers , but if there were any trained police officers in there , they might find a way to overcome the attackers even without any arms .
But defence analyst Lt - Gen ( rtd ) Talat Masood said that Pakistani policemen did not match the level of physical endurance and motivation that the militants had displayed time and again .
When the elite forces arrived 90 minutes later , they were welcomed by the crowd of spectators outside the school with loud chants of Allah - O - Akbar ( God is Great ) .

Back in 2002 , I wrote a series of articles on “ distributing computing ” ( see Related topics ) .
At that time , RPyC did not exist , but I covered the Python tool Pyro and the library xmlrpclib .
Surprisingly little has changed in the last seven years .
Pyro is still around and actively maintained ; and xmlrpclib still exists in Python , as does SimpleXMLRPCServer ( though these have been refactored as xmlrpc.client and xmlrpc.server in Python 3 ) .
The space RPyC steps into is very much the one already occupied by Pyro and XML - RPC .
RPyC does not really add anything fundamentally new to these longstanding tools , but there are some nice features to the design of RPyC .
RPyC 3.0 + , in a nutshell , has two modes to it : a “ classic mode , ” which was already available prior to its version 3 , and a “ services mode , ” which was introduced in version 3 .
The classic mode lacks any real security framework ( which is n’t always a bad thing ) and simply presents remote machines as if they were local resources .
The newer , services , mode isolates a collection of published interfaces that a server supports and is secure inasmuch as it prohibits everything not explicitly permitted .
The classic mode is essentially identical to Pyro ( without Pyro ’s optional security framework ) ; the service mode is essentially RPC ( for example , XML_RPC ) , modulo some details on calling conventions and implementation .
Background on distributing computing
In the paradigm of stand - alone personal computing , a user ’s workstation contains a number of resources that are used to run an application : disk storage for programs and data ; a CPU ; volatile memory ; a video display monitor ; a keyboard and pointing device ; perhaps peripheral I / O devices such as printers , scanners , sound systems , modems , game inputs , and so on .
Personal computers also have network capabilities , but conventionally , a network card has largely been just another sort of I /O device .
“ Distributing computing ” is a buzz - phrase that has something to do with providing more diverse relationships between computing resources and actual computers .
In the old days , we used to speak of “ client / server ” and “ N - Tier architecture ” to describe hierarchical relationships among computers .
However , different resources can enter into many different sorts of relationships — some hierarchical , others arranged in lattices , rings , and various other topologies .
The emphasis has shifted towards graphs , away from trees .
Some of the many possible examples :
SANs ( storage - area networks ) centralize persistent disk resources for a large number of computers .
In the opposite direction , peer - to - peer ( P2P ) protocols such as Gnutella and Freenet decentralize data storage and its retrieval .
The X Window System and VNC ( AT&T ’s Virtual Network Computing ) allow display and input devices to connect to physically remote machines .
Protocols such as Linux Beowulf allow many CPUs to share the processing of a complex computation , whereas projects such as SETI@Home ( NASA ’s Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ) , GIMPS ( Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search ) and various cryptographic “ challenges ” do the same with much less need for coordination .
Ajax is another means , albeit specifically within a Web browser client , of utilizing resources from many sources .
The protocols and programs that distribute what were basically hardware resources of old - fashioned PC applications make up only part of the distributed computing picture .
At a more abstract level , much more interesting things can be distributed : data , information , program logic , “ objects , ” and , ultimately , responsibilities .
DBMSs are a traditional means of centralizing data and structuring its retrieval .
In the other direction NNTP , and later P2P , radically decentralized information storage .
Other technologies , such as search engines , restructure and recentralize information collections .
Program logic describes the actual rules of proscribed computation ( various types of RMI and RPC distribute this ) ; object brokerage protocols such as DCOM , CORBA , and SOAP recast the notion of logic into an OOP framework .
Of course , even old - style DBMSs with triggers , constraints , and normalizations always carried a certain degree of program logic with them .
All of these abstract resources are at some point stored to disks and tapes , represented in memory , and sent as bitstreams over networks .
In the end , what is shared between distributed computers are sets of responsibilities .
One computer “ promises ” another that under certain circumstances it will send some bits that meet certain specifications over a channel .
These promises or “ contracts ” are rarely first about particular configurations of hardware , but are almost always about satisfying functional requirements of the recipients .
Why RPyC is useful
Before outlining what RPyC does , let me suggest three categories of resources / responsibilities that RPyC can be used to distribute :
Computational ( hardware ) resources .
Some computers have faster CPUs than others ; and some likewise have more free cycles on those CPUs once the process priorities and application loads are considered .
Similarly , some computers have more memory than others , or more disk space ( important , for example , in certain large - scale scientific calculations ) .
In some cases , specialized peripherals might be attached to one machine rather than another .
Informational resources .
Some computers may have privileged access to certain data .
Such privilege can be of several sorts .
On the one hand , a particular machine might be the actual originating source of data ; for example , because it is attached to some sort of automated data collector such as a scientific instrument or because it is a terminal into which users enter data ( a cash register , a check - in desk , an observation site , etc . ) .
On the other hand , a database might be local to a privileged computer , or at least to a limited group that the machine or account belongs to .
Non-privileged computers might nonetheless have reason to have access to certain aggregate or filtered data derived from the database .
Business logic expertise .
Within any organization — or between organizations — certain parties ( individuals , departments , etc. ) have the capacity and responsibility to decide the decision rules in certain domains .
For example , the payroll department might determine ( and sometimes modify ) the business logic concerning sick days and bonuses .
Or Jane , the database administrator , might have the responsibility to determine the most efficient way to extract this datum from complex relational tables .
RPyC lets you distribute all those resources .
RPyC classic mode
The RPyC classic mode , in essence , just lets all the capabilities of a remote Python installation run within a local Python system .
Security here basically amounts to the same thing as giving a shell account to whoever connects .
If security is at issue , the encryption library tlslite can encrypt connections and require logins for connections .
In other words , you can easily create the equivalent of ssh rather than the equivalent of telnet .
Of course , the advantage here is that these connections can be controlled by Python scripts , and allow more robust interaction between local and remote resources than does a language such as Expect .
To launch a server on a remote machine , simply run classic_server .py that comes with RPyC .
If you want a secured connection , add the - - vdb option .
To customize a port , use -- port , or check -- help for additional options in the server .
You can , of course , launch your server as part of general system initialization or in cron jobs , to make sure they are running on a given machine .
Once some servers are running , you can connect to them from as many clients as you like .
Note , however , that servers are not really that special ; the same machine and process can utilize many servers and act as server to many clients at the same time ( including two machines symmetrically “ serving ” each other ) .
A shell session ( once some servers are launched ) shows this :
Listing 1 . System and Python information
>>> import sys , os >>> os.uname ( ) #
Some info about the local machine ( ' Darwin ' , ' Mary - Anns- Laptop.local ' , ' 10.0.0d1 ' , ' Darwin Kernel Version 10.0.0d1 : Tue Jun 3 23:40:01 PDT 2008 ; root : xnu-1292.3~1/RELEASE_I386 ' , 'i386 ' ) >>> sys.version_info #
Some info about the local Python version ( 2 , 6 , 1 , ' final ' , 0 ) >>> os.getcwd ( ) '/ Users/davidmertz '
Show more

Now , let ’s import RPyC and connect to a few servers .
Before doing this , I had launched local servers from two different Python versions , and one on a remote machine .
Listing 2 . Importing RPyC and connecting to servers
>>> import rpyc >>> conn26 = rpyc.classic.connect(' localhost ' ) >>> conn26.modules.os.uname ( ) ( ' Darwin ' , ' Mary - Anns- Laptop.local ' , ' 10.0.0d1 ' , ' Darwin Kernel Version 10.0.0d1 : Tue Jun 3 23:40:01 PDT 2008 ; root : xnu-1292.3~1/RELEASE_I386 ' , 'i386 ' ) >>> conn26.modules.sys.version_info ( 2 , 6 , 1 , ' final ' , 0 ) >>> conn26.modules.os.getcwd ( ) '/ Users/davidmertz/Downloads/rpyc-3.0.3/rpyc/servers ' >>> conn25 = rpyc.classic.connect(' localhost ', port=18813 ) >>> conn25.modules.os.uname ( ) ( ' Darwin ' , ' Mary - Anns- Laptop.local ' , ' 10.0.0d1 ' , ' Darwin Kernel Version 10.0.0d1 : Tue Jun 3 23:40:01 PDT 2008 ; root : xnu-1292.3~1/RELEASE_I386 ' , 'i386 ' ) >>> conn25.modules.sys.version_info ( 2 , 5 , 1 , ' final ' , 0 ) >>> conn25.modules.os.getcwd ( ) '/ Users/davidmertz/Downloads/rpyc-3.0.3/rpyc/servers ' >>> connGlarp = rpyc.classic.connect( " 71.218.122.169 " ) >>> connGlarp.modules.os.uname( ) ( ' FreeBSD ' , ' antediluvian.glarp.com ' , ' 6.1 - RELEASE ' , ' FreeBSD 6.1 - RELEASE #0 : Fri Jul 18 00:01:34 MDT 2008 ; root@antediluvian.glarp.com :/usr/src/sys/i386/compile/ANTEDILUVIAN ' , 'i386 ' ) >>> connGlarp.modules.sys.version_info ( 2 , 5 , 2 , ' final ' , 0 ) >>> connGlarp.modules.os.getcwd( ) '/home/dmertz/tmp/rpyc-3.0.3/rpyc/servers '

You can see that we have connections to a couple of different machines with different Python versions .
The functions and attributes we accessed are arbitrary , but the important point is that we might call any functions or classes available on those machines .
So , for example , if I know the machine antediluvian.glarp.com has a Python module Payroll installed on it that has the function get_salary ( ) in it , I might call :
Listing 3 . Calling get_salary ( )
>>> connGlarp.modules.Payroll.get_salary( last=' Mertz ' , first= ' David ')
Show more
Show more icon
Over at antediluvian , there might be a local database installed , or it might even make its own connections to other resources .
What is returned by my function call , however , is simply the same data that would be returned if the function was run locally on antediluvian .
Putting code on the remote machine
Running standard module functions on a remote machine is a cute trick , but what we often want to do more usefully is run our own code remotely .
There are several ways of doing this within RPyC ’s classic mode .
The most direct way is perhaps to simply open a Python shell onto that machine via the connection we have established .
For example :
Listing 4 . Opening a Python shell on a remote machine
>>> conn = rpyc.classic.connect('linux-server.example.com ' ) >>> rpyc.classic.interact(conn )
Python 2.5.2 ( r252:60911 , Oct 5 2008 , 19:24:49 ) [ GCC 4.3.2 ] on linux2 Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information .
( InteractiveConsole ) >>>
#... run any commands on remote machine Show more Show more icon
From such a remote shell , you can define whatever functions or classes you want , import any outside code , or do anything you can do from a local Python shell .
There is also an RPyC function called deliver ( ) that seems to send a local object over to a remote server , where presumably it might run in the local context .
Unfortunately , I was not able to get this function to act as I expected ( I am sure I just have some syntax wrong , but the documentation is vague ) .
As a kludge , you can directly execute ( or eval ( ) ) code in the remote server .
For example :
Listing 5 . Executing code on a remote machine
>>> #
Define a function ( or class etc ) as actual source code >>> hello_txt = " " " ... def hello( ) : ... import os ... print " Hello from " , os.getcwd ( ) ... " " " >>> exec hello_txt #
Run the function definition locally >>> hello() Hello from /tmp/ clientdir >>> conn.execute( hello_txt ) #
Run the function definition remotely >>> remote_hello = conn.namespace [ ' hello ' ] >>> remote_hello( ) # Displays on remote server >>> with rpyc.classic.redirected_stdio(conn ) : # Redirect to local client ... conn.namespace [ ' hello ' ] ( ) ... Hello from / tmp / serverdir Show more
Show more icon
What we have done is compile a function into the remote namespace and run it as if it were a local function .
However , we need to also grab that remote console output if we want to actually see the output from its print .
If hello ( ) had instead returned a value , though , it would still be returned to the local context as in the prior examples .
Monkey patching
What we did with the with context above was basically a kind of “ monkey patching . ”
That is , we temporarily used a local STDIO in place of a remote STDIO .
RPyC lets you do this in general with system resources .
Code might run ( that is , use CPU and memory ) on a local machine but still use some key resource on the remote machine .
That might be a computationally expensive function call if the server has more CPU resources , but often it is something such as a socket where the remote machine has different access domains .
For example :
Listing 6 . Monkey patching a socket connection
import myserver c = rpyc.classic.connect(' machine-outside-firewall ' ) myserver .socket = c.modules.socket # ...run myserver , which will now open sockets outside firewall Show more Show more icon
Asynchronous resources
If utilizing a resource on a remote machine is time consuming , the local program using that resource might seem to stall while the remote action is completing .
However , this need not be so if you make these calls asynchronous .
A remote object can report whether it has a result ready , and you can do other local actions in the meantime ( or perhaps actions utilizing other remote servers ) .
Listing 7 .
An asynchronous call
>>> conn.modules.time.sleep( 15 ) #
This will take a while >>> #
Let the server do the waiting >>> asleep = rpyc.async(conn.modules.time.sleep ) >>> asleep async ( < built - in function sleep > ) >>> resource = asleep ( 15 ) >>> resource.ready False >>> #
Do some other stuff for a while >>> resource.ready True >>> print resource.value None >>> resource < AsyncResult object ( ready ) at 0x0102e960 >
Show more
Show more icon
In our example resource .value is uninteresting .
However , if the remote method that we made asynchronous returned a value , that value would be available once resource .
ready became True .
RPyC service mode
I will write relatively little about the newer RPyC service mode .
The classic mode is really the more general system , even though it is itself built as a new - style service in just a few lines of code .
A service under RPyC is really little different from XML - RPC ( or whatever - RPC ) .
Classic mode is just a service that exposes everything on the remote system , but you can build services that expose just a few things in a small number of lines of code .
For example :
Listing 8 .
Using service mode to expose a few methods
import rpyc class DoStuffService ( rpyc.Service ) : def on_connect ( self ) : " Do some things when a connection is made " def on_disconnect ( self ) : " Do some things AFTER a connection is dropped " def exposed_func1 ( self , * args , ** kws ) : " Do something useful and maybe return a value " def exposed_func2 ( self , * args , ** kws ) : " Like func1 , but do something different " if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : rpyc.utils.server.ThreadedServer(DoStuffService).start()
Show more
Show more icon
From a client , this service is just like the classic mode server , except all it exposes is the methods that are prefixed by exposed_ ( minus the prefix ) .
Trying to access other methods ( such as builtin modules ) will fail .
So a client might look like this :
Listing 9 .
Calling service - exposed methods
>>> import rpyc >>> conn = rpyc.connect ('dostuff.example.com ' ) >>> myval = conn.root.func1 ( )
# Special ' root ' of connection >>> local_computation ( myval )

Conclusion
There is more in RPyC than I have mentioned .
For example , like Pyro , RPyC provides a “ Registry ” that lets you name services and access them by name rather than by domain name or IP address .
This is straightforward , and the RPyC documentation explains it .
The two biggest threats to Internet users ' privacy , from the point of view of Rep. Rick Boucher ( D - Va. ) , come from behavioral advertising technology and from deep packet inspection ( DPI ) -- the ability for an ISP to scan the contents of IP packets , and make determinations as to their handling based on those contents .
But the specter of another company using both of these technologies together , like liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen , spelled out a more explosive danger .
Chairing hearings of the House Subcommittee on Communications , Technology , and the Internet yesterday , Rep .
Boucher made that clear :
" What services that consumers consider essential to the safe and efficient functioning of the Internet are advanced by DPI ? " asked Boucher during his opening remarks yesterday .
" Since the death of NebuAd 's DPI - based behavioral advertising service last year , are other companies using DPI to deliver behavioral advertising ?
What , if any , safeguards are in place to ensure that consumers are giving meaningful consent to the tracking of their activities on the Internet ? "
The nation 's broadband providers would like to be able to use DPI as a method for implementing traffic control , especially for narrowing the bandwidth allowed for applications such as BitTorrent .
In instances where they 're involved in programming and content services , they 'd also like to at least not be barred from implementing behavioral advertising , perhaps as a way of checking which clips viewers are watching online and targeting ads to parallel those clips .

But both weapons in the arsenal of the same companies could spell disaster , which is why NCTA President and CEO Kyle McSlarrow tread very carefully during his prepared opening remarks yesterday , acknowledging the existence of both but only exclusively and individually .
" Packet inspection serves a number of pro-consumer purposes , " read McSlarrow ( PDF available here ) .
" First , it can be used to detect and prevent spam and malware , and protect subscribers against invasions of their home computers .
It can identify packets that contain viruses or worms that will trigger denial of service attacks ; and it can proactively prevent so - called Trojan horse infections from opening a user 's PC to hackers and surreptitiously transmitting identity information to the sender of the virus .
Packet inspection can also be used to help prevent phishing attacks from malicious e-mails that promote fake bank sites and other sites .
And it can be used to prevent hackers from using infected customers '
PCs as ' proxies , ' a technique used by criminals , in which user PCs are taken over and used as jumping - off points to access the Internet , while the traffic appears to be generated by the subscriber 's PC .
As a result , the technology can be used in spam filters and firewalls . "
Never mind , for the moment , that the whole concept of proxies was relegated to the realm of the malicious user .
For Georgetown professor and Electronic Privacy Information Center Executive Director Mark Rotenberg , even if ISPs use DPI responsibly and not in concert with behavioral ad targeting , that does n't make it right .
From his perspective , breaching privacy bounds in the name of traffic control simply is n't ethical .
" In the communications context , service providers and their businesses partners also have an obligation not to intercept the content of a communication except for the purpose of providing the service , to comply with a court order or other similar legal obligation , " read Rotenberg 's prepared testimony ( PDF available here ) .
" It is possible that the techniques being developed by these firms may help in some ways to safeguard privacy if they are robust , scalable and shown to provably prevent the identification of Internet users .
But the essential problem is that they simply do not have the right to access communications traffic for this purpose .
Also , I would not recommend that you alter current law or enable consent schemes to make this permissible . "
Though no new bill has been drafted , Rep .
Boucher said up front it 's his intent to draft one this year .
He told the Subcommittee Thursday , " It 's my intention for the Subcommittee this year to develop legislation extending to Internet users that assurance that their online experience is more secure .
We see this measure as a driver of greater levels of Internet uses such as e-commerce , not as a hindrance to them . "
Get A Jump Start On Credit Card Processing from Ruby
By Matthew Lang
The development team behind the time tracking site freckle , have just released a PDF guide detailing the terminology and processes behind processing credit card details in Ruby .
Much like Amy Hoy 's previous guides relating to Rails , the Jump Start Credit Card Processing guide is a very colorful guide and is split into three small parts that make it easy to digest .
It gives an overview of the process and actions involved in processing credit card payments as well as explaining different methods that can be used to validate a credit card .
A 6 step example in Ruby using the Active Merchant gem shows you the basic steps required to process payments .
A set - up check list is also given , as well as explanations for the different types of bank accounts you 'll need to have in place .
The guide also includes a link to a javascript credit card detection and validation library written by freckle member Thomas Fuchs .
This is a great place for developers to start who are looking to add processing payments to a project .
At only 15 pages the guide is short , but covers all the basic steps required to implement the processing of credit card payments using colorful illustrations .
Not content with version 1 of this guide , the freckle team have already started work on a second version of this guide .
Time Warner Cable ( TWC ) has given up -- for now , at least -- on plans to sell broadband Internet service on a metered basis .
That is a smart move , because it was going to be an awful mistake .
Consumers and lawmakers had already jumped into attack mode , and -- more importantly to Time Warner Cable 's shareholders -- some TWC customers started calling up the cable company 's competition to consider switching .
But the bigger problem is that there seems to be a huge disconnect between Time Warner Cable management and their customers .
And that 's not good .
As Pali Research analyst Rich Greenfield writes in a blog post ( registration required ) today :
The most shocking part of Time Warner Cable ’s sudden termination of its plans to roll - out broadband usage caps to several additional “ test ” markets , is that they appear taken completely by surprise , in terms of the public / government ’s reaction to their new broadband strategy .
In a socially - connected world of blogs , social networks , twittering , e-mail , etc … it ’s truly hard to fathom that TWC management did not anticipate a harsh public outcry - particularly given the “ low ” levels of caps they sought to impose .
It 's possible Time Warner is still going to try the significant change in business model again later this year , once it has time to " educate " its ( apparently ignorant ? ) customers , and roll out an invasive " gas gauge " that helps customers figure out how much Internet they 're using , if they remember to pay attention to it .
( That will certainly make watching YouTube more fun ! )
But in the meantime , TWC is going to continue blaming its customers for not liking the idea of paying more money for the same service they 're getting today .
In a blog post yesterday , Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt highlighted " misunderstanding " about its plans , and continued to insist that charging people more for their Internet service is " the best pricing plan " for consumers .
What part of " your bill is going up " are most people misunderstanding ?
This is almost as silly as Time Warner Cable COO Landel Hobbs ' remark earlier this month , when he likened a month of Internet consumption to a single meal transaction .
" When you go to lunch with a friend , do you split the bill in half if he gets the steak and you have a salad ? "
We understand why Time Warner Cable wants to raise prices :
Web video will eventually threaten its legacy cable business , and if TWC can provide an economic incentive to watch more cable TV -- and an economic disincentive to watch Hulu , iTunes , or Netflix -- that 's good for Time Warner .
Heck , we 're in favor of TWC trying to change its strategy and make more money , if it can do it right .
That 's capitalism .
But trying to play this off as " the best pricing plan " for consumers -- many of whom , especially the most tech - savvy , will have to pay more for Internet service -- is silly , and just bad business .
So it 's smart that TWC has backed off for now until it can figure out a better message .
Time Warner Cable and other ISPs -- including Time Warner 's AOL ( TWX ) -- made the decision to sell all - you - can - eat Internet service a decade ago because it was an easy , effective way to boost subscribership .
They are now stuck with that model until they can figure out an effective , convincing way to market a different business model .
This is not it .
( A $ 5 / month , across - the - board price hike might even be an easier starting place , and could generate $ 500 million a year in more revenue .
Comcast 's model of capping subscribers at 250 GB a month is also more reasonable and friendly . )
The more that cable companies misunderstand their consumers and try forcing their hand into unfriendly , convoluted service models , the more people are going to hate their cable companies .
And with competition increasing , Time Warner Cable can't afford to be hated .
The Australian author who spent more than five months in a Thai jail for insulting the country 's monarchy says he is happy with the way the Australian Government handled his release .
Forty - one - year - old Harry Nicolaides had been jailed for more than three years for insulting a crown prince in a book , but was granted a royal pardon on Thursday night .
He was tearful as he greeted family on his return to Melbourne Airport from Thailand on Saturday afternoon .
Mr Nicolaides says the uncertainty about his future had been gruelling before the pardon was given and he commended the Federal Government 's role in his release .
" I was happy with the Australian Government 's efforts , they had constraints that they had to work within and the Australian embassy did a marvellous job , " he said .
He says he is happy to be home , but angry about his ordeal .
" I am angry , I am frustrated , I am perplexed , " he said .
The Federal Government says it did everything it could to lobby for his release .
Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith said he was pleased by the King 's decision .
" We believe that we did everything that we could , " he told reporters in Perth .
" I welcome the fact that so soon after his pardon he has returned to his family and Australia . "
" I think it is a measure of the good relationship between Australia and Thailand that the pardon was granted by the King of Thailand on Wednesday , the paperwork was completed on Friday and less than a day later , with the assistance of the Thai authorities , he was returned to Australia . "
Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Julie Bishop also welcomed Mr Nicolaides ' return .
" The imprisonment of Mr Nicolaides has been a traumatic experience for him and his family , particularly his elderly parents , " she said in a statement .
" We are relieved that the appeals for clemency have been given sympathetic consideration by the king . "
Mr Nicolaides says he plans to write a tell - all book .

Both sides of politics have botched the vote on the Government 's increased alcopops tax , but the measure has now been blocked by the Senate .
The bill was sent to a second vote in line with Senate tradition after initially being passed when Northern Territory Country Liberal Nigel Scullion missed the first division .
A Labor senator then missed the second vote but the bills were ultimately blocked because the Government failed to convince Family First Senator Steve Fielding to support the measure .
Senator Fielding 's decision to defeat the measure will cost the Government $ 1.6 billion which it had expected to collect from the increase in tax on pre-mixed drinks over the next four years .
Senator Fielding voted against the bill after failing to persuade the Government to crack down on alcohol advertising in sports programs .
The Greens and Independent Senator Nick Xenophon yesterday agreed to support the measure , which the Government had argued was needed to tackle youth binge drinking .
But Senator Fielding accused the Government of using the law as a tax grab .
The defeat of the bill may also mean the Government will have to hand back hundreds of millions of dollars it has already collected since it gazetted the law last April .
Senator Scullion apologised to the Senate for missing the first vote .
" It was an inadvertent error ; I was caught in a stairwell having an impromptu meeting . "
Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the Senate 's vote is disappointing and means the drinks will shortly be cheaper again .
Ms Roxon has rejected an Opposition offer to do a deal that would let the Government keep the $ 300 million already raised by the higher tax .
" If the Liberal Party did n't want to return this money to the industry they should have supported our bill , " she said .
" What he is proposing is simply an idea of the distillers , which is to take some small hit now and ensure their profits years into the future .
" We are not prepared to do that ; we believe that this was a sensible tax [ because ] it was putting all spirit products onto the same tax base . "
A report released this week by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs found that it was too early to tell whether the tax increase had resulted in a decrease in binge drinking levels .
The Distilled Spirits Industry Council ( DSICA ) welcomed the Senate 's decision to reject the tax .
" The Senators who made the right decision in rejecting the Government 's tax grab on RTDs realised that a tax was not a solution to problem drinking , " the Council 's Stephen Riden said .
" Now is the time that all parties start working together to create a community - wide , comprehensive approach to the issue .
" Senator Fielding demonstrated a sensible , practical approach to alcohol policy - making in this country by voting down a measure that was flawed from the outset .
" The Government should also be recognised for placing harmful and binge drinking on the political agenda , and the impetus for change must be embraced by all groups who have participated in the RTD ( ready to drink ) tax debate . "

And Ken Starr is to blame .
Yes , that Ken Starr .
The prosecutor who led the campaign to impeach President Bill Clinton has filed a legal brief -- on behalf of the " Yes on 8 " campaign -- that would forcibly divorce the 18,000 same - sex couples married in California last year before the passage of Prop 8 .
News broke Tuesday that the California Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on March 5 , and will then make a decision within 90 days on the validity of Prop 8 and these 18,000 marriages .
When Starr 's legal brief went public in December , the Courage Campaign immediately launched the " Don't Divorce ... " campaign , asking our members to send us pictures with a simple message for Starr and the Prop 8 Legal Defense Fund .
Those pictures , and the heartfelt messages on them , inspired blogger Paul Delehanty ( kid oakland ) to send us a suggestion : Would Regina Spektor allow us to put the pictures to the words and music of her hit song " Fidelity " ?
So , we asked her and she said yes , very enthusiastically .
Regina Spektor 's song , in concert with the pictures , shines a beautiful light on the 18,000 couples that Ken Starr wants to forcibly divorce .
Watch " Fidelity , " the heartbreaking music video , and then tell the Supreme Court not to divorce 18,000 California couples .
Tell the Court to invalidate Prop 8 , reject Ken Starr 's case , and let loving , committed couples marry .
DEADLINE : Valentine 's Day .

Earlier this evening , Alex Jones ’ flagship website , Infowars.com , came under a concerted denial of service ( DoS ) attack .
It is unavailable at the time of this report .
The attacks are coming out of Japan .
A Whois database search reveals the origin to be the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre in Milton , Australia .
DoS attacks usually consist of concerted efforts to shut down a web server by flooding the computer with requests and consuming its resources so that it is no longer available to users .
DoS attacks commonly constitute violations of the laws of individual nations .
Over the last few days , Alex Jones and his websites have covered the so - called swine flu “ pandemic ” and have built a solid case that the outbreak is part of a larger campaign by the government to frighten the populace and institute martial law as specifically detailed in the Department of Defense ’s “ Implementation Plan for Pandemic Influenza ” and other government documents .
Alex Jones is the primary media source calling the government ’s bluff on the bogus “ pandemic ” elevated earlier today to a level 5 under World Health Organization guidelines .
WHO Director - General Margaret Chan declared the phase 5 alert after consulting with flu experts from around the world .
“ All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans , ” Chan told reporters in Geneva .
“ It really is all of humanity that is under threat in a pandemic . ”
“ All countries should immediately activate their pandemic preparedness plans , ” the WHO declares .
“ This change to a higher phase of alert is a signal to governments , to ministries of health and other ministries , to the pharmaceutical industry and the business community that certain actions should now be undertaken with increased urgency , and at an accelerated pace . ”
The Department of Homeland Security ’s National Response Plan follows the same criteria in the case of a flu pandemic or terrorist attack and relies on the military — specifically the Northern Command — to respond to such events .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Alex Jones has featured a number of guests on his nationally syndicated radio show in the last few days that have outlined the government ’s plan to use a bogus pandemic as an excuse to impose martial law and engage in forced vaccination .
Guests have also noted the eugenics endgame of the ruling elite , determined to reduce world population to 500 million , as stated on the Georgia Guidestones .
A number of U.S. military cyber attacks have originated out of Japan where there is a large military presence .
Over the last few years , the Pentagon has developed an “ offensive ” cyber capability against “ adversaries , ” including DoS attacks .
In the Pentagon ’s “ Information Operation Roadmap ” document , it is stated that the military “ must fight the Net . ”
The Pentagon believes the internet needs to be dealt with as if it were an enemy “ weapons system . ”
Finally , here is a list of specific IP addresses and other information related to the attack :
118.11.79.219
122.26.194.245
121.95.152.130

It 's easy to be mean , to make fun of something and tear it down .
It 's much harder to poke fun at something that can be rather silly , and have it come from a place of love and deep respect .
Tim Schafer has mastered the latter with Br?tal Legend , an adventure game that is at times a love letter to heavy metal , and at others a great excuse to make fun of the chrome - soaked , sex - obsessed conventions of the music .
During GDC 2009 , Double Fine hosted a group of game writers at its offices , giving the press a small taste of the game , with Schafer 's commentary .
" I always wanted to bring this world to life , " he told everyone .
" What you see in rock videos , it 's never really done with much of a budget or fidelity to it at all .
Even though the lyrics are so evocative , there 's always that one guy standing in the middle of an empty church with a plastic sword . "
Schafer said that every scene was designed to look like the cover of a metal album , and the design work is at the same time darkly gothic and utterly ridiculous .
The story takes place in an alternate universe where the power of rock is real .
Jack Black plays Eddie Riggs , the so - called " best roadie in the world . "
After dripping blood onto an amulet that Riggs wears as a belt - buckle , he 's transported to a land that looks exactly like the stage set from his former band ... except in this world the druids are out to kill him .
The first combat erupts , you meet the beautiful sidekick character , build a car to get around , and get your mission : the leaders of the resistance have no idea how to organize , feed , or move people in great numbers .
Eddie realizes instantly that they do n't need a hero ... they need a roadie .
Metal luminary and scream - master Rob Halford provides the voice of the game 's bad guy , and an early mission has you rescuing head - banging metalheads who will soon make up your user - controlled army .
In a fun twist , the evil minions are hair metal fans ... the true enemies of real metal .
The hair - metal fans and your army will clash , as Schafer explains , " just like in LA in the 80s . "
From that point on Riggs can call on his army to fight for him , adding a strategic element to the rather simplistic hack - and - slash gameplay we had seen up to that point .
You 'll be able to explore the land using your car — called the Deuce — and the world is huge , 64 square kilometers .
You 'll be driving around to move the story forward and to take on side missions to upgrade your weapon and car , giving the game some serious legs .
The fact is , the game is funny — laugh - out - loud , subtle , quick - witter humor that comes from a great script and attention to detail .
The art is also amazing , with a ton of detail and little surprises to be found here and there .
All throughout the game classic metal tracks are played in the background , along with rejiggered metal that comes together into a classic track at just the right time .
( We were told many of the rights still were n't completely secured . )
You 'll be fighting with your guitar , driving in your metal hot -rod , and hopefully getting it on some with groupies here and there throughout the game ... it 's hard to image how the game would catch a Teen rating based on what we saw .
After the game was dropped by Activision , only to be picked up by EA , there was a lot of speculation about just how viable the product would be .
" In many ways , it was easier to pitch the second time , " Schafer said , " since we had something to show . "
EA was right to pick this one up , it 's funny , smart , and lovingly crafted .
Sadly , Schafer is known more for critical acclaim than retail receipts these days , but this could be just the game to change that trend .
“ There Was n’t a Mine Runnin ’ a Lump O’ Coal ” : A Kentucky Coal Miner Remembers the Influenza Pandemic of 1918 –1919
In 1918 the Spanish influenza hit the United States and then the rest of the world with such swiftness that it sometimes went unnoticed until it had already passed .
By mid-1919 it had killed more people than any other disease in a similar period in the history of the world .
Kentucky coal miner Teamus Bartley was interviewed at ninety - five years of age and vividly recalled the impact of the flu pandemic on his community .
With a dearth of healthy laborers , the mines shut down for six weeks in 1918 and miners went from digging coal to digging graves .

Teamus Bartley :
It was the saddest lookin‘ time then that ever you saw in your life .
My brother lived over there in the camps then and I was working over there and I was dropping cars onto the team pole .
And that , that epidemic broke out and people went to dyin ’ and there just four and five dyin ‘ every night dyin ’ right there in the camps , every night .
And I began goin ‘ over there , my brother and all his family took down with it , what ’d they call it , the flu ?
Yeah , 1918 flu .
And , uh , when I ’d get over there I ’d ride my horse and , and go over there in the evening and I ’d stay with my brother about three hours and do what I could to help ’em .
And every one of them was in the bed and sometimes Doctor Preston would come while I was there , he was the doctor .
And he said “ I ’m a tryin ‘ to save their lives but I ’m afraid I ’m not going to .
” And they were so bad off .
And , and every , nearly every porch , every porch that I ’d look at had — would have a casket box a sittin ’ on it .
And men a diggin ‘ graves just as hard as they could and the mines had to shut down there was n’t a nary a man , there was n’t a , there was n’t a mine arunnin ’ a lump of coal or runnin ' no work .
Stayed that away for about six weeks .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The last living survivor of the Titanic earned only a small fraction of what auctioneers hoped to raise when she sold her final remaining mementos of the doomed ship to pay nursing home bills .
Millvina Dean , 97 , was trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers .
The 17 items belonging to 97 - year - old Millvina Dean sold for about $ 8,000 on Saturday , according to auctioneer Alan Aldridge -- not enough to pay for two months at her nursing home .
Aldridge had earlier speculated the sale could raise up to $ 50,000 for her .
But the bidder who bought the Dean item with the closest connection to the doomed voyage returned it to her after the sale , Aldridge said .
" A young man bought the canvas bag for £ 1,500 ( $ 2,200 ) and donated it back to Millvina , " Aldridge said .
He did not reveal the buyer 's identity .
The canvas bag might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship , Aldridge said .
" Historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto Carpathia , the rescue ship , in a mail sack , " Aldridge said .
After her rescue , Dean , her mother and brother returned to England with a canvas sack , among other possessions .
" There is speculation that this would have been the bag .
It 's a leather and canvas bag .
You would easily get a child or infant in it , " Aldridge said , though he added that research by the Smithsonian , the British Postal Museum and the Liverpool Maritime Museum showed no proof that Dean had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag .
It was the second auction in less than a year at Henry Aldridge & Son for Dean , who was a 9 - week - old baby when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 .
Aldridge said before the sale he was eager to raise as much for Dean as possible .
" She 's in a residential nursing home .
She 's 97 years of age .
She 's paying £ 3,000 a month in nursing home fees , " he said .
" As she said , £ 3,000 a month is £ 36,000 a year , which is a lot of money , " he said .
" When she runs out of money , the state will pay fees for her , but while she can pay her fees , she decides where she gets her care .
When the state pays , they decide . "
Dean 's previous sale , in October , raised just over £ 30,000 , Aldridge said .
" It 's made a lot of people aware of her plight , a lot of people have sent her funds , " he said .
Dean never married and had no children .
" There are cousins but there is no one directly to support her , " Aldridge said .
" The property she lived in ( before she moved to the nursing home ) was not hers .
She 's just an ordinary little old lady .
" If she 's lucky , she 'll get another four or five years , she 's quite a fit lady , " he said .
Dean was not available to speak to CNN herself because of a throat infection , Aldridge said .
The auction included 17 items from her collection -- most of them memorabilia related to the Titanic and signed by her , but not from the ship itself .
The auction , in Devizes , southwest England , also included letters from the estate of Titanic survivor Barbara Dainton - West which fetched more than $ 36,000 .
One letter sold for about $ 21,800 , while two others went for about $ 5,800 and just over $ 10,000 , Aldridge said .
The letters include descriptions of her family 's trip to board the Titanic and the immediate aftermath of the sinking .
Dainton - West , who was 10 months old when the ship went down , died in October 2007 , the auctioneer said .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Can this G - 20 summit prove to be anything more than group therapy for a bunch of fingernail - gnawing , troubled individuals ?
U.S. President Barack Obama and British PM Gordon Brown want financial stimulus assurances from the G - 20 .
The prospects are not good .
The men and women called together in London by UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown to counter an economic slump are politicians -- just at a time when the world 's electorates are demonstrating their lack of faith in governments and in their ability to understand , let alone sort out , the economic mess .
Thirty , 20 , even 10 years back there used to be some belief that getting the power - players together could solve problems , or at least give others a push in doing so .
But it was once said of a former U.S. Secretary of State , " There was never any world situation so bad that a few well - chosen words from John Foster Dulles could n't make it a hundred times worse . "
The main task of this London summit may be simply to avoid doing that .
The British talking down of expectations over the past few days has been significant .
Up front , on camera , ministers make optimistic noises .
Behind the scenes diplomats warn of a potential lose - lose scenario .
If the summit fails to agree , it will destroy what is left of any confidence in the world 's trading centers .
Who 's who at the G - 20 »
But if the G - 20 leaders do sign up to an agreement , it is likely to be so anodyne that it wo n't make any difference , other than boosting a few participants ' opinion poll ratings at home a notch or two for being seen to try .
It was always unreal to imagine that the economic ministers of the G - 20 nations were going to re-write their budgets in 24 hours in London .
And since the G - 20 does n't have a permanent secretariat , who is going to enforce anything they do agree ?
The run-up to the summit has revealed essential differences in approach between the principals .
U.S. President Barack Obama and Brown both favor driving on fiscal stimulus , even if the governor of the Bank of England is cautioning his prime minister he can't afford to throw any more money at the problem .
Obama , Brown together before the G - 20 summit »
Brown and Obama have limited room for maneuver since both their countries have such hefty current account and budget deficits .
They just do n't have the money to do it themselves , and they may have trouble persuading those who do have the cash to use it .
In an uncomfortable reminder of serious divisions over the Iraq war , Germany 's Chancellor Angela Merkel and France 's President Nicolas Sarkozy , each with more national traditions than Obama and Brown , and with their welfare states already pumping money into their economies as unemployment increases , are pursuing a different agenda .
Blaming " Anglo - Saxon economics " and dodgy banking practices for the mess , they do n't want more funds injected .
Watch the view from France »
They want to focus on tougher regulation of the financial community .
They want the summit to start re-writing the global rulebook on capitalism .
Fact Box
This week 's London Summit brings together the leaders of the world 's 20 largest economic powers , known as the Group of 20 , to discuss the global financial crisis and decide new measures to set the world on a more stable economic footing .
Sarkozy , a man constitutionally uncomfortable unless the spotlight is shining on him , has even threatened to walk out of the G - 20 proceedings rather than sign up to anything he does n't consider tough enough on reining back tax havens , policing hedge funds and restricting the bonus culture .
Facing growing unpopularity at home , he is back on the " moral capitalism " kick he evidenced when holding the EU presidency .
The intriguing thing is that the economic crisis and Brown 's lining up with Obama , who has proclaimed his belief in the enduring " special relationship " with Britain , has revived the Franco - German alliance which used to dominate EU affairs and which had seemed to wither under Merkel and Sarkozy .
She does n't like his touchy - feely ways , he finds her incremental style of politics frustrating .
They had drifted apart , but they are back sharing a political tent .
Their agreement does not just make life uncomfortable for Brown .
It means that on his first trip outside the U.S. , Obama is facing unexpected tensions with instinctive allies and the possibility of being associated with discord and failure .
He must be disappointed too at the overall contribution from the EU , which sees many of its newer members to the east struggling for survival in the economic slowdown .
The EU response has been insignificant , poorly co-coordinated , and divided .
Jose Manuel Barroso , the president of the European Commission , has outlined six areas on which the Europeans hope the summit will focus .
They include , tactfully , both Brown 's fiscal stimulus and Sarkozy / Merkel 's tougher regulation of markets .
The big question on the fiscal stimulus front is :
What will China do ?
The Chinese perspective »
Brown 's hope is that China , worried about the safety of its money invested in the U.S. , will be ready to commit extra funds to fighting the world recession .
But if he agrees to do so , President Hu Jintao will surely exact a price .
Already the G - 8 countries have seemingly conceded that the world 's current problems are too big for them to solve and that G - 20 is a more appropriate forum .
If China comes up with the money to help , it will need assurances that it will in the future enjoy greater power within such multilateral institutions as the IMF and the World Bank .
The U.S. and Europe , who have dominated the G - 8 , now have little option too but to accept a new world order .
The G - 20 meetings -- remember that chap George Bush who called one in Washington last November ? -- have given Asia , India , China and Latin America a much - needed voice at the top table .
Whatever the outcome in London it is unlikely now that the G - 8 alone will ever carry the same sway .
And not surprisingly , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who hosts this summer 's G - 8 in Sardinia , has proposed that its gathering should be immediately followed by one of the G - 20 .
VINA DEL MAR , Chile ( Reuters ) - Center - left world leaders including Britain ’s Gordon Brown and Brazil ’s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Saturday called for global financial reforms at next week ’s G20 summit , but the U.S. warned against over - regulation .

Meeting in the Chilean coastal resort of Vina del Mar in a pre-G20 warm - up , Brown , Lula , host Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said deep financial reforms were vital to avert a another financial meltdown .
“ The whole world is paying the price for the collapse of a reckless venture of those that have turned the world economy into a gigantic casino , ” Lula told fellow leaders in a roundtable discussion .
“ We are rejecting blind faith in the markets . ”
Brown said the G20 summit in London had to focus on concrete ways to revive growth and create jobs while protecting the environment and the world ’s poor .
“ We have got to be very clear that banking cannot be unsupervised any more ; there ’s got to be cross border supervision , ” he said , calling for an overhaul of the system of international finance and coordinated policies to help underpin sustainable growth .
U.S. President Barack Obama has called on fellow G20 leaders to agree on immediate action to help boost the struggling global economy , while Brown wants the group to back a $ 100 billion expansion of trade financing and agree upon a long - delayed global trade pact .
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden told the meeting overlooking Chile ’s Pacific coast the United States was eager to coordinate international policy to reduce systemic risk to global markets , but warned over - regulation could hurt healthy markets .
“ We should not over - react .
It is not a choice of markets or governments , ” Biden said .
“ A free market still needs to be able to function . ”
Thousands of people marched in Britain , France , Germany and Italy on Saturday to protest the economic crisis and urge world leaders to act to reduce poverty , create jobs and avert climate change at the G20 summit .
“ We have to democratize the economy , globalization and the financial system .
How to do this ?
We already know : with information , transparency and responsibility , ” Zapatero said .

Shannon Connell of Madison says her brother Michael rarely talked about work .
She knew he ran an Ohio company called New Media Communications that set up websites for Republicans including former President George H.W. Bush and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush .
But it was n't until after he died last December , when the small plane he was piloting crashed , that she learned via the Internet of his tie to a voter fraud case and to allegations that presidential adviser Karl Rove had made threats against him .
" At first , it was really hard for me to believe Mike was dead because somebody wanted him dead , " says Shannon , a buyer for a local children 's resale shop .
" But as time goes on , it 's hard for me not to believe there was something deliberate about it . "
A native of Illinois , Shannon moved to Madison in 2002 , the same year as her sister , Mary Jo Walker .
Walker , a former Dane County Humane Society employee , has similar concerns about their brother 's death : " It does n't seem right to me at all . "
Michael Connell - who died at age 45 , leaving a wife and four kids - was a computer networking expert who lived near Akron .
Last July 17 , an attorney who 's filed a federal civil rights lawsuit alleging a conspiracy to rig elections in Ohio held a press conference at which he identified Connell as a principal witness .
The attorney , Cliff Arnebeck of Columbus , Ohio , tells Isthmus he does n't believe Connell was engaged in criminal activity but may have been a " data - processing implementer " for those who were .
" I was told he was at the table when some criminal things were discussed . "
A week after the press conference , on July 24 , Arnebeck wrote U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey seeking protection for Connell , whom he said had been " threatened " by Rove , a key player in the campaigns of George W. Bush .
Arenebeck says Connell was told through an intermediary that unless he agreed to " take the fall " for election fraud in Ohio , his wife [ and New Media partner ] faced prosecution for lobby law violations .
There was no claim of a threat on Connell 's person .
Arnebeck was permitted to depose Connell last Nov. 3 .
The portion of this deposition that dealt with the alleged threats was sealed , but Arnebeck is preparing a motion to make it all public .
He affirms that Connell denied any involvement in voter fraud , but thinks Rove still had reason to regard him as a threat .
" The problem that Mike Connell represented is [ he was ] a guy of conscience , " says Arnebeck .
" If it came right down to it , he would not commit perjury . "
Arnebeck " absolutely " would have called Connell as a witness in his lawsuit .
Shannon and Mary Jo both say their brother , a devout Catholic , seemed upset in the weeks before his death .
Mary
Jo feels he was " stressed out and depressed " on his birthday last November ; Shannon says he atypically did not respond to an email she 'd sent .
On Dec. 19 , Connell flew alone in his single - engine Piper Supercub from a small airport near Washington , D.C.
The plane crashed on its final approach to his hometown Akron - Canton Airport , between two houses .
The cause is still under investigation but is presumed accidental .
The blogosphere refuses to accept this .
" Mike was getting ready to talk , " writes one online journalist who labels Connell a source .
" He was frightened . "
Connell 's widow has rejected such speculation .
" He was n't about to talk , because there was nothing to talk about , " Heather Connell told the Huffington Post .
" Nobody did anything wrong . "
Shannon Connell , for her part , dismisses reports that her brother was warned not to fly , but still considers the crash that killed him " very suspicious . "
Michael was an experienced pilot , and his plane had recently been serviced .
Plus there 's the timing - " after the deposition and before the trial .
It just seems very convenient . "
Arnebeck goes further in suggesting foul play .
" I have been told by multiple sources , " he says , " that this plane crash was not an accident , and by multiple sources that the technology is available to bring down a plane in this way . "
What 's his evidence ?
Arnebeck repeatedly cites a recent online article by Minnesota emeritus professor Jim Fetzer .
The article , datelined Madison and headlined " Has Cheney Been Murdering Americans ? " , mentions Connell along with other possible victims , including Sen. Paul Wellstone and Pat Tillman , the former NFL player killed in Afghanistan .
Michael Connell 's sisters do n't know what to believe .
Says Shannon , " I really just want the truth to come out . "
So does Mary Jo , who doubts this will happen : " With so many things that people in power get away with in this country , I do n't expect anyone to ever be named , much less prosecuted , in the death of my brother . "

A tale of two applicants
Ron Trachtenberg was appalled .
In a protest email to members of the city of Madison 's Alcohol License Review Committee , the Madison attorney and former alderperson called it " a disaster " and " disgusting . "
Trachtenberg was referring to a pair of bartender license applications heard by the ALRC on April 15 .
The first was for a 29 - year - old woman he described as " cute , blonde , curvaceous , good breasts and articulate , with a killer smile . "
Her application had been flagged for review by the Madison Police Department because she failed to report a traffic violation and several administrative actions for noncompliance stemming from two OWIs she received in 2004 and 2005 .
( She also had past convictions for battery , bail jumping and marijuana possession . )
She explained , basically , that these just slipped her mind .
That she had two OWIs and was seeking a bartender 's license was remarked on by one committee member .
But Madison Capt .
Carl Gloede said this in itself would not have triggered a review , and the committee granted the license .
Next up was a 50 - year - old man who needed a bartender license for a new job .
He had no alcohol - related offenses and no one challenged the fullness of his disclosures .
But he was convicted of growing pot in his home ( a felony ) in 2003 , and had slightly older convictions for retail theft and disorderly conduct .
The man , who already has a job as an alcohol server , said he'd had an undiagnosed autism - related condition but has since been taking medication and become " a much better member of society . "
The ALRC rejected his application .
" The ALRC treats people really summarily , " says Trachtenberg .
" They 're just really rough on them . "
And it 's true , there seems to be little logic to how the ALRC handled these two cases .
Why should someone with an obvious drinking problem get a license and a guy busted for growing pot six years ago be denied ?
Could it be simply that the committee found one applicant more pleasing ?
See if you can come up with a better theory :
The back - to - back applications are archived on Madison City Channel ( www.cityofmadison.com/mcc12/index.html), Part 1 of the ALRC's April 15 meeting , around the one - hour mark .
Throwing it all away
It was last Wednesday , Earth Day , when Isthmus asked the U.S. Postal Service in Madison if it was no longer recycling large quantities of plastic wrap .
" I hope we 're recycling it , " said Karen Cronin , the post office 's spokeswoman .
" We try to recycle everything here , so that kind of surprises me . "
It is kind of surprising .
Until about a year ago , the post office was bundling and recycling the shrink wrap that magazines and other materials are sent in .
According to one employee , " a couple of bins - full a day " of this wrap now gets thrown out with the trash , and a machine the post office bought for bundling it sits unused .
Cronin , after looking into the matter , called back to say the post office used to make money off this material , but then the market for such recyclables bottomed out .
Her post - Earth Day take : " Due to budgetary constraints right now , we can not pay extra to prepare the recycled materials and also pay to have it hauled away . "
A new city motto ?
From Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf 's new memoir , on the years she spent in Madison in the early 1960s : " In Madison I was so cold I sometimes feared my tears would freeze . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Google
Inc helps newspaper websites make money through online advertising and does not misappropriate their content , a lawyer for the search engine said on the company ’s blog on Tuesday .

“ We drive traffic and provide advertising in support of all business models , whether news sources choose to host the articles with us or on their own websites , ” wrote Alexander Macgillivray , Google ’s associate general counsel for products and intellectual property .
“ Users like me are sent from different Google sites to newspaper websites at a rate of more than a billion clicks per month , ” he wrote .
On Monday , The Associated Press , a 163 - year - old news wire paid for by member newspapers , said it was working on a plan to protect its content from misappropriation on the Internet .
On Tuesday , Google ’s Chief Executive Eric Schmidt , speaking at the Newspaper Association of America ’s annual meeting in San Diego , said AP has a “ multimillion - dollar ” deal with Google for the search engine to host and distribute its news .
Some journalists have complained that search engines run by Google and Yahoo Inc make millions of dollars off their news , and that it should belong to them instead .
Publishers from The New York Times Co to EW Scripps
Co are struggling with a decline in advertising revenue that threatens the survival of some of their newspapers .
They are trying to find ways to make more money online to make up for what they are losing on their print editions .
Macgillivray wrote that Google helps them make more of that money by referring readers back to their websites .
“ For news articles we ’ve crawled and indexed but do not host , we show users just enough to make them want to read more -- the headline , a ‘ snippet ’ of a line or two of text , and a link back to the news publisher ’s website , ” he wrote .
He said that news outlets that object to Google ’s “ fair use ” of their material can request that it be removed from the company ’s index .
Schmidt told the Newspaper Association that newspaper websites someday would use several business models , including ads that support free news delivery , subscriptions and micro-payments , which are small fees to read articles .
Schmidt said he was impressed by how newspapers took to the Internet in the 1990s , but , he said , they had not changed their business models to suit the medium .

Two highly decorated former detectives who were convicted of serving as assassins for the mob , helping to kill at least eight men in one of the most spectacular police corruption scandals in New York City ’s history , were sentenced on Friday to life in prison — for the second time .
( The sentencing is the topic of Jim Dwyer ’s About New York column , which notes that both men have been drawing tax - free disability pensions . )
The two men , Louis J. Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa , were convicted of murder in 2006 and were to be sentenced to life in prison .
But then , in a stunning reversal , the federal judge overseeing the case , Jack B. Weinstein , threw out the convictions .
He ruled that although there was little doubt that Mr. Eppolito and Mr. Caracappa had “ kidnapped , murdered , and assisted kidnappers and murderers , ” he had no choice but to let them go because the five - year statute of limitations in conspiracy cases had run out .
Federal prosecutors appealed Judge Weinstein ’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , which last September reinstated the convictions .
The appellate court concluded that Judge Weinstein ’s view of the conspiracy was too narrow , and that it had continued to exist within five years of when the men were charged .
Although murders and other serious crimes that the men were accused of occurred in Brooklyn in the 1980s and 1990s , prosecutors used more recent and less serious charges — money laundering and narcotics distribution in Las Vegas in 2004 and 2005 — to bring the earlier acts under the umbrella of an ongoing criminal enterprise .
The two former detectives were defiant in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Friday , as the life sentences were imposed .
“ I was a hard - working cop , ” Mr. Eppolito told Judge Weinstein , as reported by The Associated Press .
“ I never hurt anybody .
I never kidnapped anybody . … I never did any of this . ”
Mr. Caracappa told the judge , “ You ’ll never take away my will to prove how innocent I am . ”
In addition to the life sentences , Mr. Eppolito , 61 , received an additional 100 years for various other offenses including money laundering , and was fined $ 4.7 million .
Mr. Caracappa , 67 , received an additional 80 years , and a $ 4.2 million fine .
In a statement , the United States attorney in Brooklyn , Benton J. Campbell , said he hoped the sentences would “ bring some closure for the families of the victims of these defendants ’ unspeakable crimes and for the citizens of the city whose trust they betrayed . ”
The two men , who logged a combined 44 years on the job , were found guilty of secretly being on the payroll of the Luchese underboss , Anthony Casso , starting in the mid 1980s .
The A.P. reported :
Caracappa left the New York Police Department in 1992 after establishing a special unit for mob murder investigations .
Eppolito , whose father was a member of the Gambino crime family , was a decorated officer who went on to play a bit part in “ GoodFellas ” and launch an unsuccessful career as a screenwriter .
The pair were arrested a 2005 drug sting in Las Vegas , where they had retired .

Roland Martin says Miss California , Carrie Prejean , is being slammed for being honest about her beliefs .
( CNN ) --
A lot of folks are always saying they like to keep it real , that they want authenticity and straight talk .
Yet when someone actually does it , there is hell to pay .
Welcome to the world of Miss California , Carrie Prejean , who , since she answered a question regarding same - sex marriage in Sunday 's Miss USA pageant , has been savagely attacked by those who oppose what she had to say .
Leading the burn - her - at - the - stake parade is media opportunist Perez Hilton , the self - described gossip queen , and the individual who kick - started this controversy by asking the initial question as to whether the issue of same - sex marriage should be left up to the states .
It seems that Hilton , who is gay , was none too pleased that Prejean chose to actually give her personal opinion on the issue , and ripped her on his blog after the show , using crude obscenities as he continued to attack her at every turn on his media blitz .
Hey , Hilton , from a real journalist to a wanna - be who traffics in gossip :
Never ask a question if you 're unprepared for the answer !
Frankly , this whole story is pretty stupid .
Is n't the whole point of asking a question to get someone 's true feelings , rather than the plastic and superficial answers we are all used to receiving ?
Sure , Prejean could have gone the safe route and given one of those answers that reveal nothing and is hard to decipher -- you know , the ones politicians give all the time -- but no !
She actually gave her real opinion , and is now being torn to shreds for it .
She opposes same - sex marriage .
OK , fine .
So what if she had said , " Hey , I 'm in full support of same - sex marriage . "
Would she now be celebrated on gay - focused blogs , magazines and Web sites ?
Would her detractors actually be saying how open she is and that she 's a great person ?
Same - sex marriage is undoubtedly a hot button issue .
And being from California , the site of Proposition 8 , the ballot initiative that voters approved outlawing same - sex marriage , Prejean has surely had to hear the debate go back and forth .
But her remark is n't outside the mainstream .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll shows that 55 percent of Americans are against same - sex marriage , and Proposition 8 did pass in her state 52 - 48 percent .
iReport.com : Prejean ' should step down '
What 's interesting about this is that many of the same folks who are slamming her for her remark voted for President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden , who both have the same belief : that marriage should be between a man and a woman .
Even Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made it clear that she has the same view , and it was her husband , President Bill Clinton , who signed the In Defense of Marriage Act , the federal law that forbids states from having to recognize gay marriage in other states .
In other words , four of the biggest liberals in the country have the same belief as Prejean , but a beauty pageant winner is being torn to shreds .
Hello , hypocrisy !
Those who criticize Prejean have the same right as she does to express their viewpoints .
But enough with all the political correctness , where someone says she should have danced around the issue , smiled and move on .
iReport.com : ' Thank you , California !'
At the end of the day , we all have to be true to ourselves .
Whether it's a gay gossip writer who favors same - sex marriage or a heterosexual woman who is against same - sex marriage .
The day we condemn folks for speaking honestly is the day we become a bland society .
Maybe we 're already there .

On this St. Patrick 's Day , the people of Ireland , North and South , can feel pride and relief that the recent murders of two unarmed British soldiers and a police officer by “ Republican dissidents ” have not only failed to revive “ the Troubles , ” but have reinforced the general commitment to peace .
That ’s especially fortunate right now , because the Irish certainly need to feel good about something .
After almost twenty years of partying on the tab of the Celtic Tiger , the Irish economy does not have a mere hangover .
It has whiplash — and that ’s a special kind of pain .
Historically pitied as the slowest economy in Europe , Ireland surged ahead in the early 1990's on a potent blend of low corporate taxes , strategic investment , and European Union subsidies .
Now , all of a sudden , some god of comeuppance has slammed on the brakes , and the whole country can feel itself going through the windshield .
The major causes of this crash are as clear as Waterford crystal , the parent company of which is now in receivership .
Number one is the global meltdown .
But blameworthy , too , is Ireland 's own faith , embraced from the top of the leadership to the bottom of the economic ladder , that a fantastic property bubble would never burst .
This led to wild over - reliance on the construction sector , the collapse of which is now all the more devastating .
Economic growth having finally brought Christmas to Ireland ’s coffers , the government took a Santa approach to spending , tossing large , unsustainable pay hikes to the public sector .
Last but not least were the absurd risks taken during the boom .
Last summer , for instance , ten individuals invested a total of 451 million euro to buy a ten per cent stake in Anglo - Irish Bank . . . using money lent to them by Anglo - Irish Bank . . . in order to prop up the stock price of Anglo - Irish Bank .
The stock plummeted anyway , imperiling both the bank and the investors , which included the biggest construction business in the country and a private hospital network .
Anglo - Irish Bank is now owned by the citizens of Ireland .
As for the effects : Unemployment , recently an asterisk , is now at ten per cent and rising .
Housing prices are in free - fall .
Welfare rolls are up 87 per cent in one year .
A new McDonald 's just opened in Ennis .
The management received 500 job applications , a notable portion of them from former lawyers , bankers and architects .
All this has shaken the Irish , and split their society along many lines .
Here as elsewhere , the most fraught social schism is between the high fliers and the working stiffs ; between those who made a mess while making fortunes , and those who are now obliged to clean up the mess while losing their savings .
But there are more particular Irish fissures , too .
Psychologically , there is a break between old and young — between those who remember when this country was much worse off than now ( in effect , its entire pre-Tiger existence ) and those who have only known the Ireland of plenty .
Ideologically , the crisis has strained the conflicting affections for American - style capitalism and European - style socialism .
Like everyone else , the Irish like job security , 35 - hour work weeks , plentiful holidays , low taxes , high salaries , and the good jobs that grow in entrepreneurial climates .
But they have yet to fully accept that more capitalism means less socialism .
For many years , Ireland was too poor to have this choice .
Then , for a while , it was rich enough to avoid it .
Not anymore .
Last June , Irish voters rejected the Lisbon Treaty and the closer association with Europe that it entailed .
But now that euro - zone membership is widely viewed as the only thing — apart from the letter “ r ” — that distinguishes Ireland from bankrupt Iceland , the treaty is likely to be revived .
There is , however , at least one national conundrum that economic calamity seems to have resolved , however .
This is the moral tug between elation at what Ireland has gained materially , and trepidation over what it has lost spiritually .
Light fortune engendered a dark feeling ; a nagging sense that a great national identity , forged over centuries of hardship , had weakened in just a few decades of ease ; that some core mark of mettle had been washed away by the rising tide of wealth .
No one is worried about that anymore .
JERUSALEM —
The publication late last week of eyewitness accounts by Israeli soldiers alleging acute mistreatment of Palestinian civilians in the recent Gaza fighting highlights a debate here about the rules of war .
But it also exposes something else : the clash between secular liberals and religious nationalists for control over the army and society .
Several of the testimonies , published by an institute that runs a premilitary course and is affiliated with the left - leaning secular kibbutz movement , showed a distinct impatience with religious soldiers , portraying them as self - appointed holy warriors .
A soldier , identified by the pseudonym Ram , is quoted as saying that in Gaza , “ the rabbinate brought in a lot of booklets and articles and their message was very clear :
We are the Jewish people , we came to this land by a miracle , God brought us back to this land and now we need to fight to expel the non-Jews who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land .
This was the main message , and the whole sense many soldiers had in this operation was of a religious war . ”
Dany Zamir , the director of the one - year premilitary course who solicited the testimonies and then leaked them , leading to a promise by the military to investigate , is quoted in the transcripts as expressing anguish over the growing religious nationalist elements of the military .

The Metal Gear Solid series has always been a favorite of mine .
Metal Gear Solid was the first game I ever pre-ordered thanks to GamePro 's coverage hyping my 12 - year - old brain into a frenzy .
I was ravenous for the game , completely obsessed with the apparent ability to jump into the shoes of a super soldier like none other .
A lone wolf ( well , snake ) infiltrating a heavily guarded fortress in Alaska , armed with only his wits and a sneaking suit .
The emphasis on NOT killing is what attracted me ; to try to sneak through the game .
What a new experience .
I had played Tenchu : Stealth Assassins when my friend got it the month before , but still , this was modern day espionage so it was n't the same .
When the game came out , my mother drove me to the EB in the mall and I snagged the game , almost literally throwing it into my PlayStation when I got home .
At the insistence of GamePro , I had borrowed a friends Dual Shock controller , which had just been released .
I had also turned off all the lights and blacked out my room .
I turned up the sound and immersed myself in the beautiful opening theme of MGS .
Then I was off .
Sneaking past the elevator , the helipad and finding the SOCOM .
Calling my superiors and the people assisting me ( including Natasha , every time I picked up ANYTHING that resembled a weapon ) .
I played through the amazing heart attack sequence , immersed in the cinema ( Rumble ftw ) , and then came to my first Boss .
Revolver Ocelot was taken care of , but it was n't until years later at which I would sympathize with him , so he 's coming later .
The Tank Battle and the strange hand - to - hand encounter with Grey Fox soon followed .
However none of these shocked me as much as Psycho Mantis .
Mantis was the first boss battle that really ever shocked me .
It was the first truly " next - gen " experience .
Until then with most games , it had been mostly platforming and well timed jumps , or unload all your bullets and strafe .
Not Mantis .
The man was diabolical .
A truly awe inspiring encounter .
He was merciless too .
He would get Meryl to kill herself , and could read my previous save files .
Hell , the guy made fun of me for saving so often .
And then the fight .
The only other boss battles that have ever really come close to matching the experience of this battle have come from the other Metal Gear games .
But this stands out .
You always remember your first great boss battle , right ?
After failing twice , I got a call from the Colonel .
Unplug the controller and put it into slot 2 .
Such a simple , but completely unexpected solution .
I rapidly swapped out the controller as Psycho set my TV to the HIDEO channel .
And thus , I defeated my enemy .
But then I got something unexpected .
A soliloquy .
I should have hated this guy after what he did , holding a gun to Meryl 's head , forcing me to knock her out .
I should n't have cared .
But I did .
It was just a game , but I felt for this character , who had just tried to kill me , because his past was so messed up .
I found out what turned him into this masked bondage nut .
He was a sadist to be sure , joining FOXHOUND for the joy of killing , a reflection of his disgust brought on by his interactions with other people , and their disgust with him .
But as he dies , he reflects on how it felt to help someone , as he helps Snake move on to the next area .
I still to this day am amazed at how a bastard like Psycho Mantis can still be one of my favorite videogame characters , and whats more , at how much I understand his motives and feel for the guy .
But Hideo was n't done .
I was saddened by the death of Sniper Wolf , despite the cheese of the " can love bloom on the battlefield " line .
I was awestruck once again at the epic end of Vulcan Raven ( devoured by Ravens , wow ) .
Even Liquid was made into a tragic villain in his desire to prove himself as more then just ( what he thought ) the waste material from Big Boss .
But enough about MGS , we have 3 more games !
While MGS 2 is definitely the weakest of the Metal Gear Solid games , I still love it .
MGS 2 had its fair share of boss battles , but the character that really stood out for me was one that a lot of people do n't like , do n't care about or have just plane forgotten .
Not Fat Man , but the female member of Dead Cell , Fortune .
The first time we glimpse Fortune is when she is obliterating a team of Navy Seals .
Her power , while later revealed as a gimmick , is still pretty cool and makes for an okay boss " fight " in which you need to dodge her huge rail gun while waiting for an elevator .
What made her so interesting though , was the raw emotion she displays .
As a loyal soldier to the US , why does she go crazy and rebel ?
To kill Solid Snake due to a total misunderstanding .
She got played , like so many other characters in the MGS universe , by Ocelot .
But what hit me the hardest was in that huge ending , before the final boss , she is shown to not have supernatural abilities .
Ocelot proves this by shooting her at near point blank range .
But she does n't go down .
No , instead she deflects a number of Metal Gear Ray 's Missiles with her mind .
That did it for me .
After being so thoroughly betrayed , once again , a former enemy dies while protecting me .
An awesome way to redeem herself after shooting at me with a rail gun .
Metal Gear Solid 2 ended with a few awesome experiences , but no truly memorable boss fight , aside from the extremely surreal fight with a fat , bald guy on roller blades .
It 's greatness came in it 's convoluted - but - fun story and it's ingenuity ( like when the game tricked me into going to sleep ) .
But Metal Gear Solid 3 redeemed this , offering me two stunning boss fights , one tough one , an epic motorcycle chase and my favorite character design ever .
However , MGS 3 also lost points .
I loved hearing the bosses stories , and in this game , I got the cliff notes version for everyone .
Even the Boss was not nearly as well developed as I would have hoped , though much was hinted at .
The cobra unit was an awesome collection of bosses , and were at the core of one of the greatest twists in my gaming experience .
At this point in the series , we had seen two special forces units go completely rogue , so this was nothing new .
But the Cobra Unit was different .
They were all insane .
The Pain is the only one that was never really a threat .
Once the Pain is killed , we got the toughest boss fight in the game ( save the last one ) , The Fear .
The Fear was similar to Vamp , only more of a pain in the ass .
He was the challenging one I mentioned earlier .
But still The Fear was nothing compared to the epic fight that followed soon after .
Snake soon enters the arena of my second favorite boss of all time .
The father of modern sniping , The End .
The End is one of the most interesting boss fights I 've ever had the pleasure to experience .
It was as much a puzzle as anything else .
Though it got easy once you tranquilized his parrot ( or killed it , if that 's your thing ) and started using the infra red goggles .
Still , to get his camo , and if you were trying to get his Mosin Nagant , to sneak up on him was still a hell of an experience .
But what made it so interesting for me is that while I beat him my first time through , the entire battle took me close to 45 minutes .
The realization that I had solved this great puzzle was quite a nice reward as a gamer .
When I thought back to how I had played through it , I got a sense of satisfaction as I had tried to treat it like a real sniper battle , using camouflage and the directional mic to find my target and hit him before he could hit me .
The End was a great fight , and clever too .
It was in a huge area , and required you to actually think , which is one of the reasons the Metal Gear Series is so enjoyable : they 're intuitive , while still requiring creativity in the way you choose to take on the bosses .
You do n't just take cover and pump them full of lead .
You solve their puzzles and use your own wits and stealthy abilities to take them on .
As a quick aside , The Fury , the next full boss battle you experience has one of my favorite character designs ever , and is at the heart of what bothers me about MGS 3 .
Hideo removed the bosses back story due to backlash from 2 , but here , I wanted the stories of each and every one of the five Cobra members .
All we know is that The Fury was a cosmonaut and has a jet pack .
But what makes MGS 3 into one of the most stunning games released last generation is the final boss battle .
The field of flowers and the battle between mentor and student .
It was beautiful and it was hard .
The boss , especially at higher difficulties , loved to kick your ass .
But I did it , I finally brought her down ( tranquilizing her , no kills FTW ) .
Then , Kojima thawed my heart .
He forced me to pull the Trigger .
I stood over her broken body for what felt like an eternity before finally pulling the trigger .
The boss , Big Boss ' mentor was dead , and it was my fault .
Then , Kojima rubs salt into the wounds .
The Boss was a true patriot .
Her job , and the job of the entire Cobra Unit was to sacrifice themselves as patriots so America could be blameless .
The Boss was killed as a traitor for politics .
She was never really a bad guy , she was just doing what her country required .
Heart breaking .
I wont lie , I teared up .
I had pulled the trigger on a fictional character , a fictional patriot , but I felt like I had done a great disservice in doing so .
Kojima really knows what the hell he is doing .
Then , finally , it 's time for MGS 4 and we get the Beast and Beauty corps .
What a way to end .
A homage to the previous great bosses of the MGS series .
We get a homage to Mantis , Wolf / Fortune / The End , Vulcan Raven / The Hind D battle , and even Decoy Octopus .
Yet this time around , they all felt fresh again .
The beauties were all excellent fights , but it's what happens after each battle that gets me .
Drebin calls me , and gives me exactly what I crave .
He tells me the sad , sad stories of why each one of these beautiful women turns into a psychopathic and perfectly loyal soldier .
While we never have the interactions with the characters like we do with the other bosses of the MGS series , we nonetheless get an insight into why these dangerous women are also so vulnerable .
And we can only hope that we helped put their demons to rest .
But while the Beauty and Beast Corps are all rather amazing battles , it is the final fight with Liquid Ocelot that was the most memorable .
The two old men fighting atop Outer Haven , just beating the tar out of each other .
As the battle progresses we get the three generations of Ocelot , starting with his Liquid incarnation and ending with a battle brewing for over 40 years of in game time , between Ocelot and Snake .
This battle capped off a 10 year ( in real life time ) battle between Snake , the Patriots , Ocelot and all the major players in the MGS world .
We , as gamers got to experience the tragedies of Snake and his adventures , and we actually got to gain insight into what makes these villains villains .
MGS 4 is still the only game to ever make me truely tear up and cry .
When Snake put a gun to his mouth , I was truely sad .
I had played through his adventures for 10 years , and had stuck with him .
I had played Portable Ops and Ac!d , and even the Game Boy Color game , but nothing really prepared me to see my favorite hero put his gun in his mouth at the end of the game and prepare to end it all , especially after those E3 trailers .
Thankfully , Big Boss is awesome .
That is why , for those MGS Bosses throughout all 10 years of the series , I salute you .
Work had been due to create eight flats worth £ 500,000 each A group of about 50 squatters have moved into a multi-million pound mansion in Bristol and claim they are " looking after " the empty property .
The squatters , including children , took over the Grade II listed building six days ago after climbing through a window which had been left open .
The former maternity hospital , in Clifton , was bought in 2008 by property developer Jason Birakos for £ 3 m .
Mr Birakos is now seeking a court order to remove the squatters .
Workers had been due to start converting the building into eight two - bedroomed apartments with a value of about £ 500,000 each .
Professional squatter Mr Birakos is also planning to build three houses , worth £ 1 m each , on the site at the corner of Mortimer Road and Clifton Down Road .
One of the squatters , Miriam Green , said : " We live in a damp country and a lot of properties , especially really old beautiful stone buildings like this - when they 're left like this with nobody living in them - become damp .
The squatters left a note on the door " Living in it keeps it warm - we are actually looking after the place - it 's like having your own live - in security . "
Jake Eisenstein , 27 , who described himself as a " professional squatter " said : " We got in through an open window , there was no forced entry .
" We are against corporate expansion in our communities and the privatisation of social space .
We believe in taking it back with our own hands . "
Jason Birakos , who owns the building , said : " I feel extremely annoyed and frustrated at the legislation in place , which prevents us from protecting our own property .
" Given that we are property developers and have had to go through the proper legislative channels - it has been extremely expensive and very arduous . "
Squatting is legal if entry to an empty property has not been by force and no criminal damage has been committed .

Dirac String Trick
Here I try to present one way of thinking about the Dirac String Trick .
This way of thinking about the motion makes it easy to program .
The Dirac String Trick motion always for the rotation of a central ball ( which has outward radial strings attached to its surface ) such that the strings do not get twisted or tangled up .
After 2 rotations about the axis of rotation the strings return to their orignial positions , again , without any twists .
It has been suggested that this motion may have something to do with the spin of a particle ( like the electron or proton ) .
See for example the paper " Geometric Model for Fundamental Particles " by Batty - Pratt and Racey , International Journal of Theoretical Physics , Vol. 19 , No. 6 , 1980 .
See also my other web pages on this subject at Spherical Rotations
Here is a simple animation of the motion .
There are two small dots ( spheres ) , one red and one white , which follow different strings ( orange ) around the center sphere .
The way I like to think of this motion is to image concentric cones ( or funnels ) , each with a slightly different pitch ( some almost closed , others , more open , some almost flat , etc . )
At any one point in time , a string is confined to the surface of a cone .
The string is wrapped around the cone 's surface , completing 180° roatation around the cone from the rim of the cone inward to the surface of the sphere .
In the next increament of time , the concentric layers of cones rotate ( about the axis of rotation of the sphere ) .
All the starting points of the strings are now on the rims of different cones .
A sting is confined to the new cone 's surface and complete 180° wrapping around the cone .
As this structure of cones rotates around , the strings appear to do a complicated motion .
But it is a simple motion of wrapping themselfs around the surface of the cone which has its rim at the sting 's starting point .
The next Figure shows the cones rotated slightly .
And here , the cones have rotated so that the first cone 's rim is at the starting point of the string .
Note how the string ( orange ) is confined to the blue cone 's surface as it wraps around the string .
The cones have now ( next Figure ) rotated so that the green cone 's rim is at the string 's starting point .
The string again wraps around the cone by 180° but since this ( green ) cone is more " open " than the previous ( blue ) cone , the string has to bend and stretch differently .
It is this bending and stretching that makes the strings ' motion look complicated .
But now you know it is very simple .
In the next Figure , the cones have rotated such that the rim of the more open blue cone is at the starting point of the string .
Here , the string is in a plane ( no cone shown ) with other strings .
The cone in this case would be maximum open ( flat ) .
As the cones continue to rotate , the string next encounters ( in our Fugires ) the redish - pink cone .
Then the orange and red cones .
Note that in the about Figure where the string is wrapped around the red cone , the string is wrapped in a counter - clockwise direction .
As the cones continue to rotate , the starting point of the string again encounters the rim of the red cone , but this time at the left side of the cone .
Whereas in the previous Figure , the string seems to be going " up and around " , now it seems to be going " down and around " .
This is how the strings appear to wrap " up and over " the center sphere through half of the cycle and then " down and under " through the other half of the cycle .
And so on through the rest of the cycle ( the rest of the rotation of all the cones . )
Although confusing to watch , here is an animation of the cone structure rotating .
Note that I have only shown a few cones in these animations .
Actually , think of a dense packing , or continuous packing of concentric cones so that there is no gap between one cone an another .
That is how the stings ' smooth motion is derived .
With this construct of cones in mind and with the cone structure simply rotating around the rotation axis , it is easy to program any one strings motion .

Webb Faces
Up to the U.S. Incarceration Machine , Seeks Re-thinking the War on Drugs
More than 1 in 100 adults in the United States are now behind bars .
1 in 31 are in prison , probation or parole .
The U.S. with 5 % of the world ’s population now has 25 % of the world ’s prisoners .
Incarceration of drug offenders has risen 1,200 % since 1980 from 41,000 to 500,000 .
The appetite of the American prison machine is voracious .
Each year 7 million Americans are jailed and approximately 700,000 go on to serve prison sentences .
When a racial prism is added to these numbers the stark reality of racial unfairness is impossible to deny .
And now women and girls are the fastest growing group of prisoners .
Senator Jim Webb of Virginia looks at these numbers and in a speech on the Senate floor wondered out loud : “ Either we have the most evil people on Earth living in the United States , or we are doing something dramatically wrong . ”
He has introduced a bill , which already has 19 co-sponsors including Republicans and Democrats ( including the top three Republicans on the Judiciary Committee ) , that will answer that question .
It sets up a national commission , the National Criminal Justice Commission , which will look at ways to reduce the prison population including rethinking drug policy .
The chairman will be appointed by President Barack Obama who reportedly has called Webb twice to commend this effort .
When Webb ran for the U.S. senate he raised the need for criminal justice reform during the campaign .
Many told him it was a third rail of politics that would make his already improbable election impossible .
But , Webb surprised the country and turned red state Virginia blue .
At a meeting this week in Washington , DC attended by 70 advocates for criminal justice and drug policy reform his staff told us that this issue is a “ passion for Senator Webb ” that is of “ deep importance ” and that he has been concerned about “ for decades . ”
Webb ’s goal , they told us , was to see this bill “ enacted this year . ”
Webb sees the hypocrisy of U.S. drug laws .
He notes that more than half of Americans aged 12 and over have used an illegal drug and wonders “ In talking of legality and illegality , what does that do to the fiber of our society ? ”
He goes on to note that “ I saw more drug use at Georgetown Law School than anywhere else I ’ve been .
A lot of those people went on to be judges . ”
Indeed , the last three U.S. presidents have a history of drug use – Clinton admitted putting a marijuana joint to his lips , but to the nation ’s snickering claimed he did not inhale ; Bush reportedly was a cocaine user during his alcohol abuse days but refused to discuss it ; and now Barack Obama has acknowledged his past use of marijuana and cocaine .
Three presidents who join most of America in having used an illegal drug but who all escaped the clutches of the drug war .
Would America have wanted each imprisoned ?
Their lives ruined ?
And , Senator Webb is well aware of the racially disproportionate impact of the drug laws .
This March 26th , in a Senate speech when he introduced his bill he emphasized : “ African - Americans are about 12 % of our population ; contrary to a lot of thought and rhetoric , their drug use rate in terms of frequent drug use rate is about the same as all elements in our society about 14 % .
But they end up being 37 % of those arrested on drug charges , 59 % of those convicted , and 74 % of those sentenced to prison . ”
What does that do to the African American family ?
What does it do to employment , income and wealth creation ?
Is it possible to become a post- racial society without facing the issue of racial unfairness in the justice system ?
Webb ’s commission would not tinker at the edges of the drug war , a quagmire America has been trapped in since President Nixon declared it , he is seeking fundamental paradigm shifting change , not incremental change .
As Webb says “ America ’s criminal justice system has deteriorated to the point that it is a national disgrace ” and “ we are locking up too many people who do not belong in jail . ”
And , Webb is not shy about discussing what happens in America ’s prisons .
Webb said in his Senate speech : “ We have a situation in this country with respect to prison violence and sexual victimization that is off the charts and we must get our arms around this problem .
We also have many people in our prisons who are among what are called the criminally ill , many suffering from hepatitis and HIV who are not getting the sorts of treatment they deserve . ”
Indeed , 60,500 prison inmates reported sexual assaults and that are estimated to under - reported by approximately ten fold .
He talks about “ warehousing ” the mentally ill , 350,000 people incarcerated with mental illness with no professional treatment , and notes there are four times as many mentally ill people in prison than in mental hospitals .
The Marion Correctional Treatment Center reports the cost of housing each mentally ill inmate at $ 77,561 .
Many Americans might remember that some of the soldiers involved in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal had worked in the U.S. prison system before joining the military .
At the meeting with Webb staffers some families of prisoners described how they are charged $ 20 for a $ 15 telephone call with their loved one because the prison makes a commission on the calls .
Another woman from Louisiana described how her son was sexually assaulted in prison by a guard and then put in solitary confinement until he agreed to withdraw the charges .
Every day in America prisoners are being abused and with 2.4 million behind bars there are millions of family members hearing the stories and telling their friends .
The American prison scandal is more widely understood than politicians and prison guards realize .
For too long Americans have thought nothing can be done about ending the drug war – even though most see its obvious failure .
We are trained to believe that things ca n’t change .
But this has always been the case : Slavery can’t end , women can’t vote , child labor is essential , the forty hour work week is unrealistic , gays can’t marry , Jim Crow will always be the law , alcohol prohibition ca n’t end .
History is proof that even the most seemingly unchangeable can in fact change radically .
The drug war ’s failure is hard to dispute with a straight face it is so evident , and finally there seems to be a senator who takes drugs seriously .
But , Senator Webb has a long way to go and he will not get there without a lot of people speaking up and demanding change .
Senator Webb needs individuals and organizations to write his office and express support .
He needs people to write their elected officials and tell them to support Webb ’s commission .
We need to bring in mainstream American organizations like churches , temples and mosques , civic clubs , fraternities and sororities , business clubs . . . the fact is all of us are adversely affected by the expensive horror of mass incarceration .
Indeed , the basic American ideal of being the “ land of the free ” is undermined by over - incarceration in America ’s abusive prisons .
Now is the time .
The economic collapse is forcing city , state and federal governments to look at their expenditures .
The prison budget deserves special focus .
States spend $ 44 billion annually on prisons .
In almost all states after education and health care , prisons are the biggest budget line item .
Forty states have cut vital services during this economic collapse .
If the U.S. put in place a sensible prison policy – where those who we fear are the only ones locked up , not the addicted , the drug users , the mentally ill or non-violent – the prison population would be closer to 500,000 people rather than 2.4 million .
Immediately states would see a significant fiscal savings at a time when they are desperate for reducing expenditures .
Across the country reforms are being seen at the state level , a boost from a national commission could create the momentum needed for the paradigm shift that is needed .
Senator Webb may have a president in the White House who will take reform of prison and drug policy seriously .
During the presidential campaign President Obama told Rolling Stone :

This topic was originally covered in the Unique Id Generator article , where you can find more a heavy - handed solution , allowing a developer to determine the character set used for and length of the generated id .
However , as most of the commenters pointed out , there is a simpler way to create unique numbers that will work for most developers ; that is to increment a global number each time it is used .
YUI already has a counter for this YAHOO.env._id_counter , which they use to generate unique IDs in the YAHOO.util.Dom.getUnique
Id function ( and probably other places ) .
However , they haven t exposed a good API to leverage this variable without directly accessing the pseudo - private _id_counter variable .
So the first task is to write a function to return and increment the _id_counter variables .
Example 1 : getNextIdCounter
getNextIdCounter : function ( ) { return YAHOO.env._id_counter ++ ; }
This function returns the current value of the counter , before incrementing the counter .
If you use the YUI - EXT - MVC framework , this has been added to the end of yahoo - ext / lang.js , where YAHOO.env is augmented ; I may move the YAHOO.env augmentation into its own file at some point , when I migrate the browser detection functions off of YAHOO.lang .
Now we can write a new version of getUnique Id , using getNextIdCounter to generate the id .
This has also been added to YAHOO.lang in yahoo - ext / lang.js .
Example 2 : getUniqueId
getUniqueId : function ( prefix , isNotInDOM ) { var pfx = prefix || yui - gen , id ; do { id = pfx + _YEVN.getNextIdCounter ( ) ; } while ( isNotInDOM && document.getElementById( id ) ) ; return id ; } ,
Calling getUnque
Id will return a string , yui - gen# , where # is the latest value of _id_counter .
Using the first argument a developer can provide their own prefix , instead of yui - gen .
And if they are worried that a given ID might exist in the DOM , simply set isNotInDOM to true and the function iterates until a valid ID is found .
It is that simple .
The value of the getNextIdCounter function is that it wraps the environment variable , so that the developer does not have to manage incrementing _id_counter when they use it .
This allows YUI - EXT - MVC to leverage the same uniqueness generator as YUI , instead of duplicating it .
These methods are available at yahoo - ext / lang.js .
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told an audience Friday “ never waste a good crisis , ” and highlighted the opportunity of rebuilding economies in a greener , less energy - intensive way .
Highlighting Europe ’s unease the day after Russia warned that gas flows via Ukraine might be halted , she also condemned the use of energy as a political lever .
Clinton told young Europeans at the European Parliament that global economic turmoil provided a fresh opening .
“ Never waste a good crisis ...
Do n’t waste it when it can have a very positive impact on climate change and energy security , ” she said .
Europe sees the United States as a crucial ally in global climate talks in Copenhagen in December , after President Barack Obama signaled a new urgency in tackling climate change , in stark contrast to his predecessor George W. Bush .
Europe has already laid out plans to cut carbon dioxide emissions to about a fifth below 1990 levels in the next decade , while Obama has proposed a major shift toward renewable energy and a cap and trade system for CO2 emissions .
But with many countries in the grip of a punishing recession , some question whether businesses can muster the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to cut carbon emissions .
“ Certainly the United States has been negligent in living up to its responsibilities , ” said Clinton , on her first visit to Europe as secretary of state .
“ This is a propitious time ... we can actually begin to demonstrate our willingness to confront this . ”
Clinton said she was encouraged by China ’s stance on climate change during a visit there last month .

“ It is very important that at the beginning of this effort , China has expressed a willingness to participate , ” she told reporters .
“ They realize they ’ve just surpassed the unfortunate record that we just held of being the largest carbon emitter . ”
POLITICAL LEVER
Many politicians argue that the economic crisis , energy security issues and climate change can all be dealt with in a “ New Green Deal , ” replacing high - carbon infrastructure with green alternatives and simultaneously creating millions of jobs .
“ There is no doubt in my mind the energy security and climate change crises , which I view as being together , not separate , must be dealt with , ” Clinton added .
She attacked the use of energy as a political weapon , echoing Europe ’s worries after repeated spats between Russia and gas transit country Ukraine hit EU supplies in recent years .
“ We are ... troubled by using energy as a tool of intimidation , ” she said .
“ We think that ’s not in the interest of creating a better and better functioning energy system . ”
Clinton is set to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for dinner in Geneva in the hope of improving relations after a post - Cold War low during Bush ’s presidency .
The latest cuts to Russian gas exports in January forced the closure of factories , hospitals and schools in Eastern Europe in mid-winter .
A new row between Ukraine and Russia appeared to have been averted Thursday after state - owned Gazprom said Ukraine settled payments at the heart of the disagreement .
But European leaders were rattled by the warning of cuts to supply by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
Those who have long felt there was a suspicious backstory behind Congress 's support of the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping may feel their suspicions are closer to being confirmed this week .
Congressional Quarterly 's Jeff Stein has an explosive story about how the Justice Department thwarted a criminal investigation of Representative Jane Harman ( D - California ) in order to guarantee her support for the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program .
According to CQ , in 2004 , Harman had helped lobby the * New York Times * to kill its NSA warrantless wiretapping story , which the newspaper had originally intended to publish on the eve of the 2004 elections .
The story was published a year later in December 2005 , drawing condemnation from the Bush administration , which excoriated the newspaper for putting the lives of Americans at risk by exposing the program .
The news launched a national debate about whether the adminsitration had exceeded its authority in authorizing the NSA to conduct warrantless domestic surveillance .
At the time , Harman joined the administration in condemning the Times , calling for prosecution of the newspaper and issuing a statement that said , " I believe it essential to U.S. national security , and that its disclosure has damaged critical intelligence capabilities . "
This raised questions at the time about why a top Democrat , with a history of involvement in intelligence issues , would break ranks and support a program that many of her colleagues were condemning as illegal .
According to CQ , about two months before the Times published its story , Harman was allegedly caught on court - approved NSA wiretaps engaging in a quid - pro-quo conversation with an Israeli agent .
The NSA was tapping Israeli targets associated with the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee for an investigation of AIPAC officials suspected of illegally trading in national defense information .
In one conversation intercepted by the NSA , an Israeli agent allegedly asked Harman to intervene in the investigation of two AIPAC officials .
The agent asked Harman if she could use her influence to get then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to reduce the charges against the two AIPAC officials suspected of espionage .
In exchange , AIPAC allegedly promised to lobby Nancy Pelosi , then - House minority leader , to give Harman the chair of the House Intelligence Committee in 2006 after the Democrats were expected to assume the majority position in the House .
Harman is allegedly heard on the wiretap agreeing to intervene on AIPAC 's behalf and then telling the Israeli agent , " This conversation does n't exist . "
Justice Department attorneys wanted to launch a full investigation of Harman , but according to CQ , Gonzales intervened to halt the inquiry because he said the administration " needed Jane " to support the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program , which he knew the Times was on the verge of exposing .
And this is exactly what the administration got from Harman once the story broke .
Since Harman had already exhibited support for the NSA program prior to being caught on tape – by pressuring the Times to refrain from publishing its story – she might have continued to support the program even if the administration had n't done her a favor by stopping the criminal investigation against her .
But since she was allegedly caught on tape already making one quid - pro-quo deal with AIPAC , it raises the possibility that she might have made another one with the administration to support its program .
As for Gonzales – the top law enforcer in the country – allegedly nixing a criminal investigation to gain political support for a White House program , CQ quotes a former NSA official saying " It 's the deepest kind of corruption . "
It should be noted that Harman is likely not the same congressional representative that the Times reported last week was targeted by the NSA in 2005 or 2006 for possible ties to a terrorist .
The Times said in that story that a congressman became a person of interest after traveling with a congressional delegation to the Middle East in 2005 or 2006 and being in contact with someone who was already under surveillance for having possible ties to terrorism .
In that case , the NSA had sought to spy on the congressman without a court order , but the plan was ultimately halted at the last minute by intelligence officials who did n't think it wise to illegally spy on a federal lawmaker .

More than 1,000 people were attending a religious service at the mosque
At least 20 people have been killed after a suicide bomber detonated a device at the entrance to a Shia mosque in north - east Pakistan , police say .
Dozens of others were injured in the blast south of the capital , Islamabad .
A religious congregation attended by upwards of 1,000 people was taking place at the mosque in the Chakwal area of Punjab province .
A day earlier eight paramilitary soldiers were killed in a suicide attack on an Islamabad security base .
Nadim Hasan Asif , a top regional security official , said the bomber " was stopped at the entrance ( to the mosque ) and pushed himself in and exploded , " AP news agency reported .
Another official , provincial law minister Rana Sanaullah told AFP : " The bomber was intercepted at the entrance otherwise he could have caused large - scale casualties . "
Eyewitnesses described the bomber as a male teenager dressed in black .
A doctor at a nearby hospital said more than 60 people were injured and that some of them were in a critical condition .
It is not clear who was behind the latest attack but analysts say it appeared to be sectarian in nature .
Pakistan has a long history of tit - for - tat attacks by militants from the majority Sunni and minority Shia communities and thousands of people have been killed , correspondents say .
Last month , a suicide bomber killed 48 people and wounded many others at a mosque near the Afghan border in the worst such attack to strike Pakistan this year .

Dear Maggie Gallagher , President and Brian Brown , Exec .
Director , NOM :
I admit , this is something that I normally would not do , seeing as I find that your values are completely abhorrent to me .
That 's right , I am a long - time married heterosexual with children , and I find your stance akin to those bigots who protested for miscegenation during the Loving v. Virginia battle that finally decreed that in this country , we had no right to deny marriage rights to people because they were not of the same race .
You , Ms. Gallagher and Mr. Brown , are the bigots that fight to hold on to notions that should have been put away long ago to deny human beings equal rights because of their sexuality .
You see , my sexuality is quite secure and I feel no threat to it by homosexuality .
I hold no fear for the strength of my marriage by allowing gays and lesbians to marry .
My ability to procreate has not been adversely affected even with my fellow San Francisco residents having the right to marry .
My job is not -- nor my spouse 's job , nor my children 's education -- in danger from us being around committed homosexuals .
I 'm curious if you could even outline how any of that could be threatened , because I 've taken a good look through your website and I can't find one single way that you 've been able to show a threat ... unless of course , your marriage is simply not as strong as mine and having others commit would suddenly inspire you or your spouse to up and leave .
Personally , I find the ease that divorces are available far more destructive to the institution of marriage .
You know , if you looked at the number of marriages of all the GOP presidential candidates in 2008 , you would have more divorces than candidates ... add Newt Gingrich in there , and whaddya know ?
You 'd have divorces in the double digits .
From the " Party of Family Values ? "
Now , that 's a threat .
But I digress .
I just have a few pointers to you if you want to be taken credibly , instead of laughed off the national stage , as Rachel Maddow has done so well above .
1 ) Admit this is a violation of your faith .
Be honest .
I have yet to meet one opponent of marriage equality that when you scratch the surface , does n't boil down to an issue of faith .
In fact , your own website admits as such :
NOM seeks to ( a ) educate the public about the consequences of same - sex marriage in Massachusetts , especially for children and people of faith , and ( b ) organize a political response to the Tim Gill coalition , supporting pro-marriage legislators and exposing key proponents of same - sex marriage .
Because here 's the thing : if it 's a matter of your faith , you lose .
Your faith cannot dictate civil rights , any more than it could when the southern states invoked Scripture to justify slavery during the Civil War .
So please , be honest and let 's just be done with this hate and bigotry .
2 ) If you 're going to put out an ad to frighten citizens about the ooga - booga scary notion that marriage equality will somehow bring down civilization as we know it , it might actually have more credibility if you could find an actual doctor to claim her job is somehow threatened , rather than using a really , really bad actor .
Better hope they have n't heard of Norway , Denmark or The Netherlands , where marriage equality has not resulted in dogs and cats living together nor mass hysteria .
And for crying out loud , do n't let your audition tapes get out .
You may have pulled them for copyright infringement from YouTube , but we still know they 're out there and we know that it proves how fraudulent your fearmongering is when you have to resort to Z - list actors to " act " it out .
Were Chuck Norris and Scott Eckern not available ?
3 ) And really , this is just silly .
If you 're going to launch a new campaign called " Two Million For Marriage " ( 2M4 M ) you might want to check who owns that domain first , you boneheads .
Yours in complete and utter scorn ,
Nicole Belle
A pioneering headteacher is calling for all secondary schools to follow his lead and start classes at 11 am , allowing teenagers two hours extra in bed .
Dr Paul Kelley , head of Monkseaton Community High School in North Tyneside , said it would mean the end of " teenage zombies " dozing off in lessons before lunch , after experiments showed teenagers could have different body clocks from adults and younger children .
Russell Foster , an Oxford professor of neuroscience , tested the memory of 200 Monkseaton pupils at 9 am and 2 pm using pairs of words , and discovered a 9 % improvement in the afternoon .
Students correctly identified 51 % of word pairs in the later session , compared with 42 % in the morning .
Tayler McCullough , 15 , one of the test subjects , said the majority of students would welcome the extra hours in bed .
" I 'm extremely hard to get up in the morning .
One or two people like to get to school early , but most of us would be up for going in later .
I 'm sure it would make a big difference to our learning ability . "
Kelley is adamant a change of school timetable will have a significant impact on exam performance .
He said : " Teenagers are n't lazy .
We 're depriving them of the sleep they need through purely biological factors beyond their control .
This has a negative impact on their learning , and possibly on their mental and physical health .
We 've just learnt of this , but it is vital that we act on it .
" The research carried out by Professor Foster showed that , from the age of 10 , our internal body clocks shift , so it 's good for young people to stay in bed .
They peak at 20 then gradually go back again , but body clocks do not reach the pre-teenage level until around 55 years old .
The ' time shift ' is two hours on average , so teenagers should get up two hours later .
We are making teenagers ratty by making them get up early . "
He wants his school 's governors to approve his plan and put the new timetable in place before the opening of Monkseaton 's new £ 20 m school building , the most technologically advanced in the country , in September .
Kelley has a history of groundbreaking teaching methods .
In January , he carried out a trial at Monkseaton High that found pupils scored up to 90 % in a GCSE science paper after one session involving three 20 - minute bursts interspersed with 10 - minute breaks for physical activity .
The 48 year - nine pupils had not covered any part of the GCSE science syllabus before the lessons .
In 1998 , Kelley established a scheme with the Open University bridging the divide between school and university by allowing sixth formers to study undergraduate modules alongside their A - levels .
Kelley hopes his latest idea will be just as successful .
" We have to be pragmatic .
But this proves that , by starting later , children 's learning improves , as does their health . "
Foster said : " This is preliminary data , but what 's exciting is that it matches more detailed studies carried out in Canada and the US .
Teenagers get up late not because they are lazy but because they are biologically programmed to do so . "

Breathing process must go on un -obstructively since our lives depend on it .
If it does not our lives get affected severely .
Some people have medical issues whereas some may have psychological issues that may cause shortness of breath and lead to further medical and behavioral issues .
Those who face medical issues may get help from the respiratory specialist who can help them treat the issue in an effective manner .
They either recommend medication or they may also provide assistance through the machines and equipment that are meant to provide support for such cases .
There are different types and levels of problems people in Australia may face when they are facing trouble in breathing .
One example of such issues is not getting enough air into the lungs due to obstruction in the air passage way and that causes sleep apnea .
Due to that people develop more issues that lead them to lose their sleep hours as they cannot sleep as when they want to and lie on the bed they will not be able to breathe properly .
In such cases doctor recommend cpap machine hire to assist in smooth breathing process .
In such cases when people have disturbed sleep they may also consult sleep doctor so that they may treat their sleep issues .
Sometimes people develop sleep disorders because of the panic and anxiety related to something .
In this case a psychologist may also be helpful to treat such anxiety problems and give more help for better sleep .
Another issue that could lead to sleep issues is the problem in heart functioning .
If the heart is not functioning well , or patient is not getting enough oxygen in the blood due to that issue , this may also lead to further problems in breathing and sleeping .
In that case a Cardiologist may help as well .
This may include scanning and treatment and they will also recommend some pills to make sure your breathing and heart functions stay easy and smooth and would not cause any troubles .
For treating asthma , heart problems and breathing troubles , we can get many solution from the doctors .
As some may suggest to keep a ventilator ready for treating breathing troubles as most hospitals have the facility .
Some may also suggest keeping travel cpap for sleep apnea treatment in order to stay worry free no matter if you travel or sleep .
To avoid allergies and getting contracted with breathing issues that are spread through viruses around it is best to keep yourself protected with the help of n95 mask and staying safe from contaminated places .
The best ways is to use a hand sanitiser to keep yourself safe from the viruses if you already have touched them .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors Corp. said in a government filing Thursday that its accounting firm has found there is " substantial doubt " about the automaker 's ability to survive .
The embattled automaker made the disclosure in a 480 - page filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission .
The filing 's grim tone is not a surprise .
GM has sustained large and continuing losses that have now reached $ 82 billion over the last four years .
It had previously said it needed additional federal loans , coupled with improved sales , to remain in business .
GM said in a separate statement that it is confident it will be able to turn around the business if it gets the federal help it is seeking and when consumer demand for autos returns .
" The auditor 's opinion has no impact on the aggressive actions we are taking to restructure our business for long - term viability , " GM said .
Still , Thursday 's filing presents another hurdle the automaker will have to clear as it makes the case that it deserves additional taxpayer support going forward .
The Obama administration , under the terms of the $ 13.4 billion in federal loans GM has already received , must determine that the company 's plans make it viable in the long run .
The government must determine that GM has a " positive net present value " or else demand repayment of the loans within 30 days - a development that would plunge the company into bankruptcy and quite possibly force it out of business .
The government has wide latitude in how it judges the company 's net present value , based on assumptions it makes about future sales , car prices and costs for the company going forward .
The administration clearly does not want to force the largest U.S. automaker into bankruptcy .
The GM filing disclosed that the Treasury already agreed to waive requirements that the automaker meet certain terms of the original loan agreement , including that it win agreement with creditors to convert two - thirds of its unsecured debt to equity by Feb. 17 .
But even if the Obama administration continues to give support to GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and rival Chrysler LLC , which has also received federal loans , Thursday 's filing could create problems in its relations with suppliers and banks .
For example , concerns about GM 's future could cause companies that supply it with parts start to demand cash on delivery from the cash - starved automaker , according to GM 's filing .
While parts makers would be reluctant to damage their largest customer with such a demand , they may have no choice because of GM 's filing .
Those parts makers ' own auditors and banks could use the doubts raised by GM 's auditors to raise questions about their own future .
Privately held Chrysler does not have to file a year - end financial statement with the SEC .
Last week , Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) said its auditors have not substantial doubt about its future .
Ford went into this auto crisis with a much stronger cash position than GM or Chrysler .
GM said Thursday auto sales , which have plunged more than 40 % in recent months , must rebound by next year if it is to survive .
Meantime , GM also said it needs additional federal loans to stay in business .
GM received $ 13.4 billion so far , and it has asked for up to $ 16.6 billion more .
In addition , it is seeking $ 7.7 billion in loans to convert production from light trucks to more fuel efficient cars under an Energy Department loan program .
And it is also seeking aid from foreign governments for some of its non-U.S. operations .
" The failure to obtain sufficient funding from the U.S. government or governments outside the United States may require us to shrink or terminate operations or seek reorganization for certain subsidiaries outside the United States , " the filing said .
" If we fail to obtain sufficient funding for any reason , we would not be able to continue as a going concern and could potentially be forced to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code , " GM added .
GM 's stock was down 17 % in midday trading .

huh ?
Libertarians do n't argue that the economy is zero sum .
In fact , most libertarians argue that economic growth is the key to success of everyone overall .
That 's why libertarians argue that taking money from the productive ( i.e. wealthier ) people and giving it to the less productive ends up hurting the poor more - because the economic pie is n't growing as fast .
And if you think the current system is laissez - faire , you 're quite mistaken .
The housing bubble and the financial bubble happened , to some degree , because of actions taken by the Federal Reserve .
There were a lot of factors , and certainly greed was one of them , but the system was not " unregulated " , it was regulated poorly .
Systems were already in place to ( in theory ) prevent the Madoff scandal , but the regulators were uninterested in pursuing .
For what it 's worth , I do agree that " Too Big To Fail " is probably " Too Big To Exist " .
But I believe this because companies that are TBTF take advantage of the corruptibility of the politicians , and use that government power to ensure their own survival .
TBTF is n't a problem with the market , it 's a problem with the fact that Congress is not staffed by angels .

Re : huh ?
taking money from the productive ( i.e. wealthier ) people
Oh really ?
You just assume wealthy people are productive ?
What about those who inherit their wealth ?
Even heirs who still work are n't necessarily more productive , or even productive at all - their lack of production can easily be hidden by their vast cash reserve .
See , it 's this type of assumption made in economics that gets us into trouble .
All the various " laws " of economics are just taken for granted without anyone ever re-examining them to see if they still hold true , if they ever held true , or they 're appropriate to the subject they 're compared against .
I mean , have you even seen a real - life " rational actor " ( economics - wise ) ??
I have n't - all I see are human beings </> - people who do not make their decisions purely on logical economic concept , though many may try .
A large part of economic " law " - if not its entirety - depends on the true existence of this fictitious entity and I have seen NO ONE who touts these laws ever adjust for the fact that their theories depend on key premises that are at best wildly inaccurate .
And we run our country on this house of cards .
No wonder it fell down .

You 're right - economic " laws " have assumptions
You are exactly right when you say that the various " laws " of economics are just assumed to be true .
I think most of them are still valid if certain basic assumptions are met .
For example , free market competition does push prices down towards costs if there are many suppliers and many consumers in a market and participants are free to come and go , and accurate information about the market is available to everyone .
The problem is that this assumption is met only rarely in practice .
There are many , many commodities where there are only a few ( or even only one ) supplier , there are large barriers to entry , and important information is held by only one party .
One of the best examples today is local broadband communications , where Congress has pretended that " the market " will just magically work despite none of those qualifying assumptions being true .
And you 're quite right that the market players are not always rational actors with plenty of time to research their decisions .
Health care is a good example ; are you really going to calmly shop the market for trauma surgeons when you 're in a hospital ER with a bullet wound ?
The government 's job is to try to make a market actually work where possible ; to regulate when market forces are insufficient ; and to step in and provide a service if it 's considered important enough and the market simply can't provide it .
In that order .

Re : huh ?
There are a few problems with ka9q 's line of thinking :
1 ) First of all , to assume that those WHO HAVE are those who MAKE is not accurate .
Paris Hilton is quite wealthy , but I do n't think anyone would argue that she 's more productive and a wiser investor of money .
2 ) Trickle down economics is not a magic bullet .
We 've had eight years of low taxes under Bush .
The wealthiest part of our population saw their assets grow dramatically , but the middle class did not .
One of the presuppositions of Trickle Down is that the money we 're not taxing is going to be invested back into our economy creating work , but in a global economy , the wealthy are just as likely to invest that money half - way across the globe in some third - world , but rapidly growing economy .
Good for them , good for that world 's economy , not so good for us - at least not for a long , long time .
Furthermore , the idea that the wealthy are going to go around creating all of these brilliant investments ... where exactly are they going to find the time and incentive to make all of these decisions ?
Most of them have full time jobs as it is .
The extent of most of their financial decision - making is whom to give the money to and hope they invest it well .
( And many of these " geniuses " picked Bernie Madoff . )
But lets look at some of the giant companies around us - Google , Kinko's , Apple , Microsoft , etc .
These were created by people who had NOTHING .
The core cause of their success was n't some guy with money who said , hey , let 's make Google .
It was a kid who was young , and hungry , and focused , who made it happen .
3 ) A recent nobel winning economist did research in India .
He watched the effect micro loans , or very small loans to families who wanted to make investments in things like vegetable gardens , etc .
He came back years later , and found that those small loans had had a much greater effect than originally anticipated .
These micro-loans had helped them to get them ABOVE subsistence level , and because they now had ( for the first time in their lives ) discretionary funds , they were able to take this additional capital , and continue to invest it .
Over the long term , there were huge changes in their financial situation .
Some might argue ( with validity ) that this is precisely trickle down economics at work .
The problem becomes that ( as we 've said ) how many wealthy people ( or even banks ) have time to make this type of small investment ?
It becomes a question of how best to deliver this type of aid ?
For the wealthy , maybe a couple of " drops " may trickle down in the form of investment loans , but for every one deserving person who 's found , there are probably hundreds who are not .
At the same time , redistributing this aid in the form of taxes and tax relief to the poor ( at the expense of the rich ) means that for every deserving person who is now able to break the " subsistence barrier " and is able to start the journey into economic mobility , there are probably a hundred who who are n't deserving , and who will not make that investment .
The question becomes , then , what balance of tax distribution will best serve to create the right mixture of " fertilizer , " or broad based investment over a large area , and also having targeted investments on promising individuals ?
I 'm running out of time here , so I 'll just sum up by saying that the core principles I 'm talking about here are made clearer when you look at our current and last president .
Which world do you want to live in :
1 ) The one where the son of an ex-president who basically flunked his way through life becomes president predominantly because of his father 's political connections ?
2 ) The one where the kid who had virtually nothing , and who had to have a scholarship and loan to go to college became president through hard work and resolve ?
Just some thoughts .
Looking forward to other people 's thoughts and criticisms .

Excellent points :
1 ) Paris Hilton is the exception - not the rule .
Aside , do you really know how her wealth trickles down , or do you just love to hate a pop-culture celebrity like her .
The VAST MAJORITY of wealthy people do create a trickle down effect .
2 ) I love your comment about the founders of Google being hungry and focused .
They were n't entitled , they were young and hungry , and they worked very hard to make Google happen .
If they were fat dumb and happy , we would be paying for their food stamps .
Tell me that the trickle down effect does n't work with Google - how many jobs have they created , thousands or tens or thousands ?
3 ) Micro investments - another excellent example .
BTW , who makes micro investments ?
NOT the government - wealthy private individuals .

It is rather astounding how conservatives have worked themselves into a lather convincing themselves that our new president is a " Socialist " who wants to take money from the productive and give it to the unproductive -- simply because he said he wanted to roll the tax rates back to what they were a few years ago .
( He * did * use some poorly chosen words , I 'll admit . )
And now it does n't even look like he 'll do that for a few years .
For what it 's worth , * I * would probably pay more under Obama 's original plan , but to tell you the truth I considered it a fair deal given the rest of his platform .
I 'd like to keep my money as much as anyone , but there are times when money simply is n't the most important issue -- and this is one of them .
I think you 're simply wrong about the causes of the current market crash .
I think we can at least agree that the market was regulated poorly even if from my point of view it was not regulated enough and from yours it was regulated too much .
All sorts of regulations that had kept the market stable were systematically dismantled , starting under Reagan and continuing under Clinton and both Bushes , and eventually that had an effect that should have been fully expected .
The same thing happened here in California when electricity was deregulated in 2000 ; the market went completely unstable and we had electrical emergencies nearly every day .
What actions by the Federal Reserve do you mean ?
If by that you mean the repeal of various financial reserve requirements , the merger of banking and investment operations , and the unregulated growth of repackaged securities , you 're right .
But someething tells me you mean something else .
It 's promising that we agree on TBTF being TBTE even if it 's for opposite reasons .
The evidence that unregulated markets are unstable markets is now overwhelming , so I can understand why libertarians are a little defensive right now .

Re : huh ?
The fact that this president is a " socialist " is undeniable .
An effective stimulus package is one that jump starts economic engines that are self sustaining .
You claimed they stimulus budget can't be criticized as a whole , it needs to be scrutinized line by line , yet you found it easy to criticize Bush as a whole and not consider his actions one by one .
That is typical Liberal double speak .
If you really look at HR1 line by line , you will see the vast majority is pork to non sustainable sectors .
Furthermore , it significantly increases entitlements and it is a fact that " safety nets " perpetuates poverty and social decline .
Its funny that you claim that the market crash is a conservative disaster - once again , the hallmark of democratic indoctrination .
The Bush administration can be criticized for many things ( I personally think it was awful ) , but one thing I will never blame it is causing this crash .
We have ESTABLISHED EVIDENCE that conservative attempts during the Bush administration to reign in FM ^2 were blocked by the radical left .
Free markets are self regulating , and what the democrats did is remove moral hazard from self regulation and therefore tamper with the basis of the market .

Re : huh ?
I criticize Bush as a whole because the man did n't make a single positive contribution as president .
Not one , except perhaps not declaring martial law on January 19th of this year and canceling Obama 's inauguration .
I do n't know enough about James Buchanan to know if he still qualifies as the worst US president in history , but George W Bush most certainly qualifies as the most disastrous US president in the last 100 years .
FM^2 ?
I think you need to take off the libertarian ideological blinders and look at things again from first principles .
Pay very close attention to the fact that the properties of free markets depend on some critical assumptions that are often untrue without government regulation .
" democrats did is remove moral hazard from self regulation "
Do you know what " moral hazard " actually means ?
I do n't think you do .
Read up on it .
The Wikipedia article is n't a bad start .
I used to consider myself fairly libertarian , and on social issues and individual rights I am still very much so .
But it was hearing nonsense like what you just said that made me change my position on economics .

I 'm sorry , but there has n't been anyone with libertarian leanings in charge of the government since the 19th century .
Bush did n't preach libertarian values , his policies would best be described as cronyism .
You claim that we 're in our current issues because of a laissez - faire system .
The very lynchpin of the subprime crisis : Fannie and Freddy - two government established and government mandated companies .
The enablers ?
The SEC , the OTS , the Fed , etc .
In financial markets , it 's WORSE to have bad regulation than it is to have no regulation at all .
Bush was a neo -con puppet .
Paulson and Cheny were the Wall Street and Oil puppetmasters who found new and creative ways of robbing the poor to feed the rich .
The problem with government regulation is that it 's run by the government , and in America , the government is controlled by the highest bidder .

" We now have direct experimental evidence for what happens when our government takes a completely laissez - faire role in the economy "
Really ?
When ?
Banking is the most heavily regulated industry in the economy ; hardly " laissez - faire " , no matter how many people repeat that falsehood .
And as for , " Libertarians often argue that the economy is a zero - sum game , " I think you 're off your rocker .
I am not at all familiar with a libertarian " zero- sum economy " argument .
If you know of some , please point them out .
On the other hand , libertarians often do argue that government spending is a zero- sum game , which is to say that every dollar the government spends into the economy , was either first taxed or borrowed out of the economy .

Re : for serious ?
Okay , I 'll concede that I used " laissez faire " in a relative sense , and the regulatory climate has never , ever been " laissez faire " enough to please the true libertarians .
Yet the financial industry * has * become much less regulated in recent years .
That 's an undeniable fact ; all sorts of regulations were repealed starting with Reagan and reaching a fever pitch under Bush Jr .
The libertarians ' " zero sum game " argument I was talking about * was * the claim that government spending is a zero sum game .
If I worded that too broadly , I apologize .
I 'd be happy to go back and reword it to say that " Libertarians often argue that government spending is a zero sum game " .
That does n't modify my argument at all because I was arguing precisely the opposite : government spending is NOT a zero sum game .
It depends entirely on what they spend it ON .
A certain government expenditure can increase or decrease economic productivity , or it might have no effect other than to drain a certain amount of money out of the economy .
Each case has to be looked at under its own merits .
I argue that one of the largest government expenditures -- defense spending -- works to decrease productivity in addition to being largely a waste of money in its own right , yet conservatives largely have a blind spot about this one .
It 's as if the money we spend on the military comes out of the aether , not from tax revenues .
Now I 'll grant you that neocons and libertarians are n't the same thing .
Some libertarians do agree that our defense spending is out of control and that we 're involved in far too many wars that have nothing to do with true national defense .
But I 'm talking about libertarians with a small 'l ' , i.e. , everyone who says they have a libertarian point of view , not the view of the Libertarian Party , and right now that seems to includes a lot of what could also be described as neo-cons .
My apologies if I painted with too broad a brush .
Maybe I should have said " conservative " instead of " libertarian " in the first place .
They overlap , but they 're not the same .
But if you do identify as libertarian , then you seem to share with the conservatives the strange notion that the current economic mess is entirely the fault of the federal mortgage companies .
No , it 's not , and we have abundant empirical evidence that it 's not .
You could blame it on the corporations who exploited lax regulations , but that would be like blaming bacteria for doing what comes naturally .
The blame falls squarely on the government for dismantling the regulations that kept the market stable .

Now that you 've come that far , it 's time to assume that most of your opinions are based on factual points of similar veracity .
You 've been sold a bill of goods , or maybe you 're just surrounded by people who all think alike ... either way , if you can learn , you will , if you can't , you wo n't , so there 's not much anyone else can say to you .

Re : for serious ?
I am able to change my views in accord with experience and new evidence .
You seem to consider this a weakness or at least a disadvantage .
I guess you 're entitled to your opinion .
I watched Milton Friedman 's TV series " Free to Choose " circa 1980 .
Do you remember it ?
I fully bought into his arguments .
To be sure , 30 more years of the drug war have only strengthened Friedman 's positions on issues of personal freedom .
I 'm afraid we 'll never get that one right any time soon .
But his positions on financial regulation have not fared as well .
Markets can do wonders IF -- big IF -- their basic assumptions are met .
Problem is , they 're always met only in a libertarian dreamworld .
In the real world , they often are n't .
That 's the fatal flaw in libertarian economic ideology ( and it IS an ideology ) .
SOME amount of government regulation is always needed to keep most markets healthy ; they simply wo n't do it on their own .
Time and again , the ideologues have dismantled regulations claiming that markets can run themselves .
Time and again , the results have often been disastrous .
I can understand why you 're a little touchy .
This economic disaster is the largest in many decades , and it was n't long in coming after the dismantling of regulations such as the Glass - Steagall Act that had stood for decades .

Phil , your arguments are as flawed as a sieve .
You do however have one good point - " productivity " .
Socialist countries have no productivity because people have zero incentive to be productive .
Please name ONE productive socialist nation .
Previously , you failed to name one successful socialist nation , I suspect you will ignore this challenge as well with additional long winded rhetoric .
Your attempt to refute ( or divert ) the fact the economy is a zero sum game is mute .
Aside for introducing massive inflation , when the government wants to give $ 1 to the " needy " it needs to take about $ 2 from the " wealthy " ( or as Libtards like to say : the " lucky " ones . )
You talk about " Bush 's disastrous war " playing the typical Libtard blame card .
Here are some facts you would like to ignore .
Congress has been Democratically controlled for over two years now .
The economic collapse happened on Democratic watch .
The Democrats have blocked every single attempt to reigh FM ^2 in .
The Democracts have not introduced a SINGLE piece of legislation to correct the flaws in the housing marked - is it a just a coincidence ?
Since the messiah has been in office , the DJI dropped from ~ 8,500 to ~ 6,500 .
The Messiah is now sending additional troops to Afghanistan for what you call a " criminal war " .
Why are n't you blaming him of war crimes ?
Based the libtard school of blame - this economic disaster points all the way back to the left of center .
Your conclusion that disaster happens when the government takes a passive role is a wrong one .
The democrats have created a snowball that started rolling in the Clinton administration and we are just seeing the results .
The Democrats slowly built a house of cards with the " fair housing acts " and Clinton 's removal of the firewalls between the mortgage sector and the finance sectors .
The Democrats have continuously held a steady front to prevent serious investigation into their actions .
This is all well documented on C - Span , so you do n't have to take my word for it .
This disaster is n't due to the lack of government intervention , this disaster is due to government intervention backed by a radical left wing agenda .
It is time that folks such as yourself wake up and look at the facts .
Last , remember that paying more taxes is patriotic .
I urge you to pay more taxes .

You still do n't get it .
I argue that EVERY country , including ours , is and always has been inherently " socialist " .
They differ only in degree ( the government 's fraction of GNP ) and nature ( which socialist services the government funds ) .
This is true even for governments that do little more than maintain an army .
National defense is provided to a country 's citizens as a socialist service .
I 'd need much more specific definitions to answer your question .
What 's " productivity " ?
Per-capita purchasing power ?
Depending on who does the calculation , the US is 4th , 6th or 8th highest in the world , with countries like Luxembourg , Norway and Singapore above us .
How about average life expectancy ?
That 's a good indicator of the productivity of its health care system .
The United States is 45th in the world , with most of western Europe well above us , including countries I suspect you 'd classify as " socialist " .
Again , what the hell is FM ^2 ??
It 's pretty funny to blame the collapse of the economy on the Democrats just because they ( barely ) controlled Congress for the last two years .
Starting in 1980 we had 20 years of Republican presidents , including the most radical one in many generations in terms of wars started and deficits increased .
I do n't think you skipped Iraq as an honest oversight , did you ?
We were attacked , so we had a legimate reason to invade Afghanistan , though that legitimacy extended only to attacking al Q'aeda and those parts of the government that supported them .
We had no legitimate reason whatsoever to invade Iraq .
And in neither country do we have the right to violate the Geneva Conventions and the Convention Against Torture .
They are treaties to which the US is a party , so violations are crimes under US law as well as international law .
Bush and Cheney have openly admitted to ordering those violations , so it is not hyperbole to refer to them as war criminals .
They ARE war criminals .
For what it 's worth , I think Obama is making a mistake by sending more troops to Afghanistan .
Our job there should be strictly limited to ensuring that it is n't used as a base for further attacks on us .
As intensely as I dislike the Taliban , getting rid of it just is n't our job , and we will probably fail to do it anyway .

FM^2 = Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac .
Per your suggestion , I looked up the Moral Hazard definition on wikipedia : " Moral hazard is the prospect that a party insulated from risk may behave differently from the way it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk . "
This is consistent with my point .
In a free market , if companies are exposed to risk they behave more responsibly .
This massive intervention by govt removes most risk and therefor creates a situation which promotes bad behavior .
In a free market - the companies should have been left to fail .
The dooms day scenario our elected officials tried to convince us would happen would not have happened .
Companies would be have bought and following the " impulse response " they would have self corrected to " steady state . "
The war in Iraq was wrong - or at least that is my position based on the information I have .
But that still does not justify your point that the " conservatives " are wrong .
The last administration was a failure , and most political analysts would agree that it was a clear departure from conservative values .
Back to productivity , what would your productivity be if we take your free Q sponsored health care away , force you to pay for govt health care , and then significantly reduce your salary to the market average since because we will put in place the " fair pay doctrine " .
Your point that we are already " socialist " does n't go far , as politics is n't binary .
Yes , we have " common interest " things in every nation , but there are many colors of gray .
There are many of us that want to avoid this country from going to the radical left .
We all pay taxes for common benefits , we do n't want to pay MORE taxes and perpetuate MORE poverty .
We have seen nations go this way before and we already saw where they ended up .
BTW , you still have yet to name one successful socialist nation .
Lets reflect on : USSR and Eastern block nations , China , Cuba , and Europe .
Europe is probably half way there .
How is productivity there compared to the US ?
Name ONE significant product / achievement that has come out of Europe in the last 40 years .

Moral Hazard
Yes , that 's the definition I thought it had .
And , believe it or not , we are actually in violent agreement that it would have been best to let these companies fail .
Since I became a * former * EV1 driver , I confess that I 've kinda been looking forward to GM 's eventual failure .
Unfortunately , a lot of people will suffer a lot more from it than will the people who were responsible for it .
And that 's precisely the problem .
These companies became " too big to fail " .
And why was that ?
Because government fell down on its job .
In fact , in recent decades government , driven by economic libertarians , has been hell bent on removing every obstacle possible to anticompetitive behavior .
Mergers and acquisitions have taken place at a fever pitch and antitrust law has been completely dormant , all in the supposed name of " getting government out of the way " and " letting the wisdom of the market rule " .
You see , the moral hazard that got us into trouble was the moral hazard of corporate bankruptcy .
It became possible to set up a corporation , establish a highly leveraged investment , and get rich if the investment paid off .
But if the investment failed , then the corporation would simply declare bankruptcy and those who ran it would walk away .
So much of this went on that in the end it all came down in a cascading failure .
All in the name of " unleashing the wisdom of the market " , extremely complex new forms of investments were left unregulated , everyone got in on the game of gambling with other peoples ' money , and the inevitable happened .
The fact is that there is a proper role for government regulation , and markets can actually be freer and more productive WITH it than without it .
Now maybe you agree that this experiment in deregulation was a failure and that a move back to greater regulation is now necessary to -- paradoxically -- make the markets more free , or at least function more like ideal free markets .
So maybe we 're in violent agreement .
But I 'm not sure .
If you oppose ANY move in that direction , you have a real problem .
We 've done the experiment and the results were pretty clear .
So I guess your only alternative is to mischaracterize your opponents ' arguments , shout " socialism " at them and hope that others find the word as yucky as you do .
I think that 's where we came in .
I was merely pointing out that every government since the concept was devised have ALWAYS provided socialist - like services , sometimes on a truly massive scale ( as with the United States Department of Defense ) .
So just yelling the world " socialism " over and over is n't very constructive .
It would be far more constructive to discuss * WHICH * services should be provided in that manner and to what degree , and which are better provided by the market .
It would also be much more constructive to discuss the degree to which governments should be involved in regulating markets , not whether such regulation is morally right or wrong or whether it again constitutes the bogeyman of " socialism " .

( Recasts ; adds IRS lawyer , background , bylines )
WASHINGTON , March 3 ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration on Tuesday endorsed legislation to crack down on offshore tax havens , raising the stakes in a mounting dispute between the United States and bank - secrecy nations such as Switzerland .
The endorsement of bills unveiled on Monday in the Senate and the House of Representatives came from U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner at a congressional hearing .
“ We fully support the legislation ... on offshore tax centers , and we look forward to working with you as part of the broader effort to address international tax evasion , ” Geithner told the House Ways and Means Committee .
The U.S. government last month widened its legal assault on tax dodgers with secret offshore accounts by suing Swiss banking giant UBS AG UBSN .
VXUBS .N to try to obtain the names of thousands of its rich U.S. clients .
Tax havens are estimated to deprive the U.S. government of more than $ 100 billion a year , say advocates of the bills introduced by Michigan Senator Carl Levin and Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett , with the backing of other Democrats .
When he was a senator last year , President Barack Obama co-sponsored similar legislation with Levin .
A thriving business in tax evasion developed in recent years on Wall Street among consulting firms , law firms , hedge funds and other elite financial players .
Some purveyors even sought patent protection for their off - the - shelf schemes .
The Levin and Doggett bills would ban patenting tax avoidance plans , target dozens of offshore “ secrecy jurisdictions ” for more scrutiny and put a greater burden on U.S. taxpayers to show that their tax arrangements are legitimate .
TOUGHER IRS RULES ?
A senior U.S. Internal Revenue Service lawyer told Reuters the IRS may team up with other governments to crack down on tax cheats as it faces pressure to toughen rules on Americans who try to conceal income in offshore tax havens .
“ We are concerned about U.S. people hiding their assets and not reporting their correct worldwide income , ” Steven Musher , IRS associate chief counsel for international issues , said in an interview on the sidelines of a banking conference .
At the same time , Musher said the IRS does not want changes to be burdensome for banks and financial institutions .
“ We are trying to achieve the balance between increasing the reliability and quality of documentation to serve these various competing purposes , ” he said .
Musher declined to discuss the agency ’s lawsuit seeking to obtain the names of thousands of American clients with overseas accounts at UBS .
His remarks , as well as Geithner ’s , came a day before a senior UBS executive was to testify before a Senate subcommittee hearing looking into allegations of tax evasion .
Mark Branson , chief financial officer of UBS Global Wealth Management and Swiss Bank , will appear Wednesday before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , chaired by Levin .
Also testifying will be IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman and John DiCicco , acting assistant attorney general in the Justice Department ’s tax division .
Doggett said at the Ways and Means Committee hearing that many other countries allow Americans to hide their wealth .
He asked the administration to " look closely at those that are coming and asking for a government bailout , like Morgan Stanley , which has 158 subsidiaries in the Caymans , Citigroup C.N with 90 , and Bank of America BAC.N with 59 , to explain why it 's equitable for them to be able to avoid taxes at the same time they 're asking for so much tax money . "
The IRS ’s civil lawsuit came after UBS agreed to pay $ 780 million and identify some clients in a deal to resolve criminal fraud charges that it helped wealthy Americans evade taxes .

In this part of the Perl 6 Tricks and Treats newsletter we look into how to get started .
Where to read the documentation , the spec-test .
How they are integrated .
We take a look at the IRC channel used by the Perl 6 developers , the perl 6 evalbot and the pastebot used to share code snippets .
We 'll also check out what is the last element of an infinite list .
This entry was first sent out as part of the Perl 6 Tricks and Treats .
Visit here to subscribe .
Welcome back to the Perl 6 Tricks and Treats Yesterday was the second part of the Introduction to Perl 6 talk I gave in the Tel - Aviv Linux User Group .
Unfortunately there were only 4 people including myself .
I wonder if that reflects on the state of Perl 6 , the level of the first part I gave two weeks earlier or the others were just lazy and planning their Passover Holidays .
Anyway , maybe because of the small number of participants the meeting was good , there were lots of good questions especially on why and how to start writing Perl 6 .
So let me address those questions here too .
How to get started with Perl 6 Currently Perl 6 is not yet in the state of easily writing in it .
There are lots of features not yet implemented , some of them being quite important .
So if you are planning to actually start writing Perl 6 code be prepared that you will bump into all kinds of obstacles .
Why write Perl 6 now ?
You can not expect your Perl 6 code to be used in production yet .
It will take a lot more time to write anything in Perl 6 than in any of the languages you actually know , so why start writing Perl 6 now ?
The reason is to start learning it now .
The learning curve of Perl 5 is considered gentle but long .
IMHO
The learning curve of Perl 6 can be still gentle but it is way longer than that of Perl 5 .
Just in the previous issue I wrote about the subroutines in Perl 6 .
In Perl 5 I can teach subroutines in 5 - 6 slides .
In Perl 6 I think I would need more than 40 slides to cover it all .
Obviously that would be too much for an introduction course .
Anyway it just shows that you 'll have to take your time learning Perl 6 .
As there are not many examples or explanations on how to write Perl 6 yet , a lot of things you will need to learn by reading the specs .
That can be hard as it is very dense .
Then you go out to experiment and you might quickly find that things do n't work as the spec says .
As someone who is just learning Perl 6 it is hard to tell when did you misunderstand the specs and when did you just bump into a bug in the implementation or a feature that has not been implemented yet ?
Resources
It can be frustrating but there are a couple of very good resources to help you .
Specs and spec-tests
First of all the specs , the spec-test suit and their integration .
Both the specs ( the Synopsis documents ) and the unit tests live in the Pugs Subversion repository .
Using a web browser the specs can be read here : Perl 6 spec in the Pugs repository .
and the spec-tests are here : Perl 6 spec-tests in the Pugs repository organized according to the chapters of the specs which in turn follow the order of the Camel book .
Of course you can check then out using the svn command and read the specs using perldoc or your favorite text editor .
The best view though might be the integration of the two on Perl cabal .
If you click on the word " Synopsis " in the first clickable column - for some reason all the links are called just like that - you 'll reach the a HTML version of the relevant chapter from the specs integrated with the tests .
In every test file there are comments saying which part of the spec are they testing .
These pages are build using those smart links so you can click on links such as this one : - Show t/spec / S02- literals / quoting .t lines 2558 ( no results ) - and see the relevant tests .
So you can read the spec and then see examples .
You can also see if those tests were successful or not or if they are being skipped .
The test suite has comments such as this : #? rakudo skip ' nested curlies in q{ ...} ' meaning that the next test - a call to ok ( ) or is ( ) or some similar testing function - or the next block of tests should be skipped on Rakudo .
That usually mean Rakudo does not understand that code , sometimes even cannot parse it .
In case you do n't find an example or if you find the examples lacking this can be a good opportunity to help the Perl 6 development effort by writing more tests .
Before doing that the best would be to talk to some of core developers .
For that the best way is to use IRC .
IRC The Internet Relay Chat is one of the oldest online chat systems .
In order to use it you need an IRC client , then you need to connect to an IRC server and in there to join a channel .
A channel is like a room full of people talking at the same time .
There are many desktop IRC clients but if you do n't have one the best might be to start with a web based IRC client .
I just found Mibbit The Perl 6 people are using the irc.freenode.org server and the name of the channel is # perl6 .
As I am writing this there are 134 people in the channel , apparently most of them sleeping .
If you have an IRC client installed then this link should open it to the right place .
Otherwise you can use Mibbit :
Go to the web site of Mibbit and type in the relevant information by yourself or you can click on this link I prepared : IRC # perl6 on freenode using Mibbit
You will be asked to type in a nickname with a suggested random name already filled in then " Click to join chatroom " .
Once you are in you 'll see people talking .
Not only can you ask question here , but you can also try you code snippets .
just type in rakudo : say " hello , my name is foo " after a few second Rakudo will print its response .
The channel is logged so you can look up previous discussions .
For example , you can look here mib_0 gaypc is just the nick I was given when connecting using mibbit from the meeting yesterday .
You can follow a few lines and see .
One of the people in the class asked me what will happen if if we try to fetch the last element of an infinite list .
In other words what will happen if we run this code : ( 1.. Inf ) [ * - 1 ]
So I tried .
I was not afraid of crashing the evalbot that runs the code as I did that earlier that day and Moritz Lenz fixed the resource limit of Rakudo .
As you can see in that log , within a few second three heavyweights of the channel started to talk about our little experiment : pmichaud , Patrick Michaud , the project leader of Rakudo , masak , Carl Masak author of a large chunk of the good Perl 6 code out there including November , the wiki .
jnthn , Jonathan Worthington who is , well , just him .
He is one of the key developers of Parrot and Rakudo .
Within 10 lines we got to the point that Masak submitted a Rakudo bug report on a related issue .
So not only have we got an answer in a few seconds but we also helped a tiny bit the development of Perl 6 .
Private IRC channel
Of course you might not want to have all your trials and errors on the #perl6 channel so you can open a private conversation with the p6eval bot .
Just type in the following command : / msg p6eval rakudo : say " hello " this will send a private message to the p6eval bot which will open a new conversation window - in the case of Mibbit it opens a new " tab " and sends you the answer .
Once you switched to this tab it is enough to just type rakudo : command to ask for the evaluation .
Perl 6 standard
The p6eval bot can also use other implementation and it can also use the definition of Perl 6 to see if your code is correct syntactically .
This one uses the definition as Larry Wall writes it .
So I type : std : command
And the p6eval bot will check if it is correct syntactically :
Let 's see two examples : < mib_yv79dh > : std : say 42 < p6eval > : std 26098 : OUTPUT << ok 00:02 35 m >>
This shows the time it took to parse that code .
< mib_yv79dh > : std : foreach my $ x ( 1 ) {} < p6eval > : std 26098 : OUTPUT <<##### PARSE FAILED ##### Syntax error ( two terms in a row ? ) at /tmp/JTnE5W5NEt line 1:------> ...
This shows that the above code ( which is actually a perl 5 construct ) cannot be parsed by Perl 6 .
That 's usually a good indication that the error is on our side .
Pastebot IRC is a really nice way for quick communication but it is pretty much limited to single lines of code .
What if you have a multi- line snippet that you would like to show to others ?
Pastebots are the tool for this .
Basically a pastebot is a web page where you can paste some code snippet .
Once you submit the form it will generate a unique page containing your code .
You can send the address of this unique page to others .
Even better when the pastebot is connected to an IRC channel .
Once you submit the form it will send the link along your chosen nickname and the one - line summary you wrote to the selected IRC channel .
People can then click on those links and see your example immediately .
The Perl 6 people use this pastebot .
Testing and contributing
Now let me return to the testing and documentation for a second .
If you found that there are test cases missing from the test suite and if you do n't have commit access to the Pugs repository yet then it is very much recommended to join the channel and ask how can you submit new test cases .
You can use the pastebot to show what did you write so the members on the channel will be able to evaluate your suggestion easily .
Mailing lists
There are also mailing lists that can be used but they are usually a lot slower in response time .
Try sending a message to perl6-users-subscribe@perl.org to subscribe to the perl6 - users list .
The archive of the list .
Getting Perl 6
I am using and recommending the Rakudo implementation of Perl 6 that runs on top of the Parrot Virtual Machine .
See the up - to - date instructions on how to get them on the Rakudo web site
That 's it for now .
Comments and Discussion I am always open to comments and criticism ( just have a positive spin to it :-)
So if you find any issue with the examples , please do n't hesitate to let me know .
If you 'd like to ask question about Perl 6 , probably the best would be to sign up on the Perl 6 users list by sending an e-mail to perl6-users-subscribe@perl.org
You can also look at the archive of the perl6 - users list .

The Taliban on Saturday claimed responsibility for the ' attack ' in Binghamton , New York , where a gunman went on a shooting spree at the American Civic Centre on Friday , killing 13 people before turning the gun on himself .
Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud told Reuters from an undisclosed location , " I accept responsibility .
They are my men who attacked New York . "
The ' attack ' was in response to US drone strikes in Pakistan , which target al Qaeda and Taliban militants along the country 's border with Afghanistan , Mehsud said .
The Pakistani Taliban commander claimed the attack was launched by a Pakistani man and another unidentified man .
The chief of the Tehrik - e - Taliban Pakistan warned that ' such attacks would continue ' to avenge missile strikes by US drones in tribal areas and ' brutalities in Palestine ' .
Mehsud also pointed out that he had said a few days ago that his militants would carry out attacks on American soil .
The claim by the Pakistani Taliban commander came hours after a US drone attack in North Waziristan tribal agency killed 13 people , including women and children .
Authorities in New York said a man armed with two handguns killed 13 people at an immigration services centre before killing himself .
The gunman was believed to be of Vietnamese - origin .
Mehsud had recently claimed responsibility for the terrorist siege of a police training centre at Manawan near Lahore that killed eight persons and injured over 90 as well as for two recent suicide attacks .
Enlarge By Nick Oza , The Arizona Republic Missionaries Daniel Maxwell , left , and Daniel Oakey talk to Sandra Munoz and her daughter , Sarah , about the men's Mormon faith in Mesa , Ariz .
FAITH & REASON FAITH & REASON Blog : Join the conversation on religion , spirituality and ethics | Forum : Debate fellow readers
The Mormon Church is one of the fastest - growing denominations in the country , and much of that growth is coming from an unlikely source : Latino immigrants .
Latinos overwhelmingly are raised Catholic , but the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints is aggressively reaching out to them by touting the religion 's heavy focus on family and community , pillars of the Mormon faith that are also at the center of Hispanic culture .
FAITH & REASON : Is immigration a religious issue ?
FULL COVERAGE : Latest religion news at faith.usatoday.com
As a result , Latinos are joining the Mormon Church at a greater rate than members of any ethnic group , even Anglos , church leaders say .
But the outreach has created some unusual conflicts because the majority of the Latino converts are undocumented immigrants , which goes against a major tenet of the Mormon Church : obeying the law .
At the same time , some Mormons who say the church teaches compassion are upset that fellow members , including Arizona state Sen.
Russell Pearce , R - Mesa , have spearheaded a crackdown on illegal immigrants .
" What has happened among a good number of LDS members is that they have been shaped by the Republican Party of the last 40 years .
They gravitate to the Republican Party , and the party has become very anti-immigrant , culture - wars - oriented , " said Brigham Young University history Professor Ignacio Garcia .
Men on a mission
One recent afternoon , Daniel Oakey and Daniel Maxwell knocked on the door of an apartment in a predominantly Latino neighborhood in west Mesa .
They wore the uniform indicative of Mormon missionaries : short - cropped hair , white shirts , plain ties , dark trousers and backpacks .
Miguel Chavez , an 18 - year - old Mesa Community College student , was expecting the two for his weekly Mormon lesson .
Chavez , a native of Colima state in Mexico , came to the U.S. five years ago .
Raised Catholic , he attended Mass weekly until two missionaries arrived at his door one day .
At first , Chavez thought " they were crazy . "
But the missionaries kept coming back , and Chavez began to like what he heard .
" My father died a few years ago in a job accident in Colima , " Chavez said .
" They told me that families can be together forever , and we can see each other after this life .
I really want to see my dad again . "
Spreading the faith Since Joseph Smith Jr. founded the Mormon Church in 1830 in upstate New York , proselytizing has been a cornerstone of the Mormon faith .
The church sends missionaries all over the world .
In recent years , the church has been teaching missionaries Spanish , not only to proselytize in Mexico and other Spanish - speaking countries , but also to tap into the surging Latino population in the United States , including the 1.8 million Latinos in Arizona The Mormons are not alone .
Many denominations , from Baptists to Methodists , are vigorously trying to reach Latinos .
But perhaps none has done so as methodically as the Mormon Church .
Of the 186 missionaries assigned to the Mesa mission , the largest in the state , 52 are Spanish speakers .
Their work has helped grow the number of Spanish - speaking Mormon congregations in the Phoenix area from fewer than five a decade ago to more than 30 today , church leaders say .
The majority of the Spanish - speaking congregations are in Mesa , which was founded by Mormon settlers in the late 1800s , but congregations have also sprouted in Phoenix , Tempe , Scottsdale , Peoria , Glendale , Chandler , Queen Creek and Gilbert .
There are now about 7,000 Latino Mormons in the Valley .
Garcia estimates that nationwide , 70 % of all Latino converts in the past 10 to 15 years are undocumented immigrants .
" Our position is to invite everyone to learn more about the Gospel of Jesus Christ and his plans for his children independent of national origin , " said Mark Bassett , president of the LDS Mesa mission .
" We do n't know what their immigration status is .
We are not the government or the police . "
No questions asked Under the gaze of a Catholic statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe , Oakey and Maxwell prayed in the yard of Sergio Jose Galvez Garcia , a 20 - year - old immigrant from Colima .
The missionaries , both also 20 , spent nine weeks studying Spanish in Utah before arriving in Arizona .
Now Oakey and Maxwell can roll their R's as well as the Spanish speakers they approach on the street .
To appeal to Latinos , the missionaries emphasize the faith 's focus on family and community .
But perhaps more importantly , the missionaries do n't ask about immigration status and do n't care if an immigrant reveals he is in the country illegally .
They are assigned to the Liahona Second Branch , a Spanish - speaking congregation in Mesa .
At times , church members provide food , clothing , job referrals — even a chance to earn some money doing yard work or other odd jobs — when they learn immigrants have lost jobs due to the economic downturn or laws aimed at cracking down on the undocumented , said Pablo Felix , the congregation president .
" Our job is to bring souls under Christ , " Felix said .
" The Lord does n't look at documentation .
He just looks at our faith as members . "
Obeying the laws
Some state lawmakers , on the other hand , are trying to drive illegal immigrants out of Arizona .
Pearce said his immigration legislation , including the state 's 15 - month - old employer - sanctions law , is rooted in the Mormon Church 's 13 Articles of Faith .
" We believe in laws and the sustaining and obeying of the laws of the land , " Pearce said .
At the same time , Pearce said he is sympathetic toward illegal immigrants .
" I tell you , most of these are good people , " he said .
" But you are still taking jobs from Americans , suppressing wages and breaking the law .
We ca n't tolerate that . "
Still , he does n't believe Mormons are undermining his efforts by reaching out to Latinos .
" They are not providing sanctuary policies for them , unlike some folks who hide behind their religious status and are ( promoting ) sanctuary policies .
This church simply does n't ask ( about immigration status ) . "
Some Mormons , though , think the Pearce - led crackdown hurts immigrant families , including the U.S. - born children of illegal immigrants , and goes against the Mormon faith 's emphasis on families and compassion .
Pearce 's role in the immigration legislation has fueled perceptions that the Mormon Church is behind the crackdown .
Wilford Andersen , a member of church 's Southwest governing body , said Pearce does not speak for the church .
" Just like any church , there are people with different opinions , " Andersen said .
" People have the right to disagree on political issues and the right to consider issues carefully and come to their own conclusions , and we respect that , as do other churches . "
The church has not taken a position on immigration , Andersen said .
" But we feel it is our responsibility to minister to all of God 's children , regardless of ( immigration ) status , " he said .
Immigration has touched off a " quiet revolution " within the Mormon Church , said Garcia , the Brigham Young professor .
The church sees Latinos as the best opportunity for growth because of their numbers and openness to new faiths , but there is resistance from Mormons who tend to be conservative Republicans , he said .
' More open ' culture Between appointments , Oakey and Maxwell tried approaching people on the street .
The first were Anglos , but they ignored the missionaries .
The next people , however , Sandra Muñoz , 27 , and her daughter , Sarah , 6 , stopped and prayed , then agreed to talk more the next day .
" Generally , the Hispanic people are more open to street contact , " Maxwell said .
" I think it is the Hispanic culture .
They are loving and open . "

The ideology that dare not speak its name
The set of ideas that has dominated public policy around the world for the last thirty years has been given a variety of names – neoliberalism [ 1 ] , economic rationalism , the Washington Consensus , Reaganism and Thatcherism being the most prominent .
Broadly speaking , this set of ideas combines support for free market ( or freer market ) economic policies with agnosticism [ 2 ] about both political liberalism and the relative merits of democracy and autocracy .
Since demands for definition are inevitable , I ’ll point to mine here .
A striking feature of all of these terms is that they are currently used almost exclusively by opponents of the viewpoint being described , to the point where any use of such terms invariably provokes protests about unfair labelling ( this is true even of the most neutral term I can find , “ economic liberalism ” ) .
Even more striking is the fact that these terms were originally used in a broadly positive sense by supporters of the ideas concerned .
I ’ve done the story on economic rationalism , Don Arthur covers neoliberalism ( with links to more from Taylor Boas and Jordan Gans - Morse ( pdf ) and you can check Wikipedia for the others .
Why is it that neoliberalism seems to be subject to a political version of the euphemism treadmill ?
A look at the history will help a bit .
For each of the sets of ideas in question , two things happened .
First , the ideas described by the terms evolved in the direction of a more tightly defined and hardline free - market ideology – this happened both because ( positive ) users of the term became more consistent in their ideology over time and because some with more moderate views ceased to identify with the term .
Second , advocates of neoliberalism gained political power without , in general , convincing the majority of the public .
In Australia and New Zealand , there was a bipartisan elite consensus in support of economic rationalism during the 1980s and early 1990s .
In the UK , Thatcher won a series of elections with minority support thanks to a weak and divided Opposition .
In Latin America , neoliberal policies were implemented by dictators like Pinochet , and quasi- dictatorial strongment like Fujimori .
Finally , as this process took place , the term was taken up by critics , who needed a descriptive label for the set of ideas they were criticising , and , soon afterwards , abandoned by its original advocates .
In Australia , the crucial event was Michael Pusey ’s book Economic Rationalism in Canberra .
In the case of neoliberalism , the change occurred after the Pinochet coup .
This analysis gives two reasons for the euphemism treadmill .
First , there is the obvious one .
Unpopular ideas require euphemisms , and these euphemisms wear out over time .
The second is more subtle .
From the inside , ideology usually looks like common sense .
Hence , politically dominant elites do n’t see themselves as acting ideologically and react with hostility when ideological labels are pinned on them .
Ideology is only useful for an insurgent group of outsiders , seeking a coherent basis for a claim to displace the existing elite .
Because neoliberalism typically enjoyed rapid triumphs , it never needed to express itself as a formal ideology , and the initial users of the term rapidly dropped it , once they got into power .
fn1 . Confusingly , and reflecting the different meaning of “ liberal ” , in the US , “ neoliberal ” there has a different history and application , referring initially to Clinton - era DLC - oriented Democrats .
The US neoliberals share some views , such as support for free trade , with neoliberals in the ( originally ) Latin American sense , but the global term is more applicable to the free - market right , represented by the business wing of the Republican party than to these centrist Democrats .
As noted , Reaganism is sometimes used for this idea , but it ’s not an exact match .
fn2 . That is , the neoliberal ideology itself has little to say about these questions .
Neoliberals may regard democracy and ordinary notions of political liberalism with outright hostility ( Lee Kuan Yew , the Mises Institute ) .
Or , they may like Hayek , regard democracy and free speech as second - order goals , desirable only if they do n’t get in the way of free markets .
Mises ( unlike the institute that bears his name ) offers a more appealing view , arguing that , in the long run , democracy is more favorable to free markets than autocracy , whatever the initial position of the autocrat .
Finally , many neoliberals are , in political terms , orthodox liberal democrats , who advocate neoliberal policy while accepting that they need to convince the majority of voters of the validity of their position .
Even among the last of these groups , most are willing to make political alliances with anti-democratic neoliberals , in much the same way as many ( but not all ) democratic socialists felt the need to work with the communist left in the trade union movement and elsewhere .
Update
In comments at my blog , Terje Petersen points to what amounts to a dysphemism treadmill on the other side of politics , which is now using “ neo- socialist ” as a term of abuse , presumably having found “ socialist ” unsatisfactory as a replacement for “ liberal ” , which has lost its power to sting .
Unlike “ neoliberal ” and “ neoconservative ” , this term has never had any currency among those it is meant to describe .

Last October , Apple started using unibody designs in their MacBook and MacBook Pro .
A newly uncovered patent suggests that the next product to incorporate this aluminum case may be the iPod .
Advertisement
The patent shows that the iPod 's new casing will be carved out of a single , large and thick block of sheet metal , making the device lighter , thinner and sturdier .
Although it may be a significantly stronger product , with it being made out of one slab of metal , it seems that it would be harder to take the iPod apart for second - hand replacements and repairs , meaning that consumers would have to turn to Apple directly for all their iPod needs .
However , having it made out of one block of sheet metal would reduce the costs of creating it .
Does this also mean it 'll be cheaper for consumers as well ?
Please , Apple , let it be so .

Sugar makes kids hyperactive
Many parents have seen the gleam in their child 's eye after a can of cola .
But Drs Vreeman and Carroll , paediatricians at the Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis , say sugar is not to blame for out - of - control offspring .
At least 12 double - blind , randomised trials have examined how children react to diets with different levels of sugar – none detected any difference between children who had sugar and those who did not .
Even in studies of children with attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder , no difference in behaviour was detectable .
Yet when parents believe their children have had sugar they rate their behaviour as more hyperactive , even if what they ate and drank was sugar - free .
" The differences were all in the parents ' minds , " the authors say .
You lose most of your heat through your head
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It is widely believed that wearing a hat is the most effective way of staying warm in winter because " 40 - 45 per cent of body heat is lost through the head " ( as stated in a US Army manual ) .
But this is wrong .
There is nothing special about the head .
If it were true , people would be colder going hatless than trouserless , which is " patently not the case " , the authors say .
The myth arose from a military study which measured heat loss in people wearing Arctic clothing and , as they were hatless , naturally they lost most of their heat through their heads .
In fact , people lose around 10 per cent of their body heat through their head .
If it 's cold outside it makes sense to wrap up , but a hat wo n't make a huge difference .
Cures for a hangover
None , the authors say .
Many are offered , even by medical experts , but no good evidence shows they work .
Propranolol , tropisetron , tolfenamic acid , glucose and supplements such as borage , artichoke , prickly pear and Vegemite have all been suggested but all failed to end the throbbing head and heaving gut .
( They do not mention the pint of water and paracetamol before bed ) .
The only preventive , they say , is to drink less .
Poinsettias are toxic
The red -leaved Christmas plant is widely suspected of being poisonous .
It is not .
Of almost 850,000 reports involving plants to the American Association of Poison Control Centres , none of the 23,000 relating to poinsettias involved significant harm .
Even in cases where children ate substantial amounts , none needed medical treatment .
Parents can relax that the Christmas table decoration is safe .
Suicides increase over the holidays
Dark , cold nights , family dysfunction , loneliness – all can contribute to feelings of despair .
But the evidence suggests that while the holidays can be difficult , they also give people something to live for .
Studies show suicides decrease in the days before a holiday and increase in the days after .
They are also lower in the winter and higher in the summer .
Night food makes you fat
Some diets suggest not eating late helps weight loss and some research backs it .
A Swedish study found obese women ate later than slimmer counterparts – but they were fat by eating more meals and their eating pattern was thus extended over a longer time , not because they were night eaters .
The timing makes no difference ; how much is eaten does .
The research was carried out by Aaron Carroll and Rachel Vreeman of the Indiana University School of Medicine and published in the Christmas issue of the British Medical Journal

Captivate ’09 , Capcom ’s annual game expo , is about 1 week away .
Coincedence ?
I think not .
I do n’t know about you , but I ’m ready for Capcom to take me for a ride .
First in a series .
Part 2 is here , and here ’s Part 3 .
The recipe for change seems straightforward : Make your newsroom Web - first .
Teach reporters that publication is the beginning of the process , not the end .
Get them shooting photos .
Teach them to do video .
Tell them their jobs include engaging with readers in chats , comments and discussion forums .
Get them blogging .
Introduce them to Twitter .
And indeed , all of that stuff should happen every day in the reinvented newsroom .
But there ’s a danger of seeing the Web as a wholly new country , one in which every reporter and every editor becomes a multi-armed digital entity doing absolutely everything .
It ’s an alluring theory , and can be a necessity in newsrooms cut to the bone .
But in practice , Web journalists are n’t cut from the same cloth any more than print journalists are .
Take a print paper with a hardcore investigative reporter , a feature writer with an eye for character , a movie critic , a City Council reporter and a parenting columnist .
( Sadly , this example is increasingly hypothetical . )
Ask those five to work and write like each other and you ’ll get an ungodly mess .
The same is true online .
Newsrooms ’ printcentric folks sometimes lump
Web staffers together , but they too have very different styles and ways of working .
A reporter who bird - dogs breaking news and updates it throughout the day works and writes quite differently than a daddy blogger valuable for his engagement with a loyal community of readers .
A curator who provides roundups of links may employ a very different voice and skills than a reporter who ’s great at packages of text , photos and video .
A producer of interactive graphics drawing on data sources has a very different job than a wrangler of reader discussions .
The only link between these jobs is the Web .
In my decade - plus at the Wall Street Journal Online , I tried my hand at a few of those roles and helped our newsroom try out variants of them .
Through trial and error , I found that Web - journalism jobs fit into five or so broad categories , based on the rhythms of the work and the temperaments they required .
Understanding how those roles were different , and matching the right people to them , was an important part of making the newsroom work .
I ’ll explore those roles in the next few posts — but first , some baseline assumptions .
I ’d hope this would go without saying , but every reporter or editor hired today should be told the following :
1 . Your job no longer ends with the production of material for the print paper .
You ’ll be expected to think of a story as it will be expressed across multiple media channels , and to supply whatever ’s needed to tell that story effectively for each of those channels .
2 . Your job begins with filing online first — and that first filing could be a tweet , SMS , email alert or Web headline .
Expect all of the above .
3 . We love great writing , but storytelling is no longer just that .
The storytelling process includes shooting and / or selecting video and / or photos , preparing supplemental material ( such as relevant primary documents ) to post online and being involved with the creation of interactives or data sources for exploring a story .
4. Storytelling is now two - way — you ’ll offer ideas for reader discussion and how to shape the conversation , and be a part of that conversation .
5. Stories morph and flow to follow and find readers .
Part of the reporting / storytelling process is thinking of ways that other parts of the newsroom can leverage a story — whether it ’s through a related blog item , an online chat with a source , or something else .
Not every new hire or existing staffer assuming a new role has to have all these skills immediately — we ’re not there yet as an industry .
Nor should we demand that everybody have the same level of ability at each skill .
But what we absolutely should require is a willingness to spin up a story ’s wheels in all channels , instead of expecting that work to be done by others .
Next : Packagers and specialists .
You can LEGALLY record songs on the radio and Internet for free .
You can LEGALLY record and watch television shows in the CANADA and US for FREE .
Movies are popular for about 60 days then they spend the next 10 months collecting dust on the selves at WalMart until they end up in the 2/$ 10 or less bin .
The recording companies and networks ’ arguments for copyright do not ring true .
Their fight is NOT about protecting the quality and integrity of the original works nor is it to ensure the ORIGINAL CREATOR is properly compensated because neither is the case .
It IS about control of virtually every single bit of information and entertainment .
Their current argument could easily be made for news and information shows , educational shows and documentaries .
So some day down the road a big news company , oh I do n’t know say Fox or CTVglobemedia decide that their news and information is SOOOO valuable that they are going to pursue every single users who “ shares ” snippets or links to their content .
Using this ruling as a precedent they could win their argument .
It would also put them out of business .
This is probably the first time in human history that the large corporations and monopolies do not have ultimate control of what is is available and when or where and to whom it ’s available .
Without the monopoly of distribution their business model falls to pieces .
So instead of changing their business models and competing with the marketplace they continually seek legislative means to take back control of the marketplace with things like the DMCA and the ACTA .
The bigger fight IS NOT about movies , music and television shows .
It ’s SIMPLY about control of THE MARKETS .
ANY MARKETS .
HOWEVER THOSE MARKETS MAY EVOLVE without having to COMPETE .
I have NO problem compensating the ORIGINAL creators for the works .
However compensating the like of SONY and Paramount to fund their extortion racks is something entirely different .
Let ’s hope the boys in Sweden finally get this discussion going in the right direction with EVERYONE involved .
NOT just the privileged few .
The real chicken seemingly plays the role of a woman .
The storyline becomes increasingly menacing as the two characters go to the pub — he has beer , she has white wine — and end up having sex in the toilet .
The final scenes show the real chicken carcass being hurled against a wall , then run over by a van before the rubber chicken returns and simulates fornication again .
A sign of North Melbourne 's major sponsor , Mazda , is featured at the start of the video .
The backing track is Move Bitch by American rapper Ludacris .
No North Melbourne players , coaches or staff are seen , however simulated sex acts take place in the locker belonging to senior player Brady Rawlings , and on a desk of a North Melbourne staff member .
Arocca ordered that the video , The Adventures of Little Boris , be removed from YouTube after being alerted to it by The Age and having its content described to him by the AFL .
Arocca , who was returning from a speaking engagement in country Victoria last night , said : " Foolishly , one of the younger members of our group placed it on his Facebook ( page ) .
" It then found its way onto YouTube .
It 's now been removed .
I 'm furious to say the least that it 's gotten out , though I have n't had the advantage of seeing it . "
AFL corporate affairs manager Brian Walsh saw the video and last night described it as " infantile and inappropriate " .
He said the AFL would monitor North Melbourne 's handling of the matter .
Arocca said he would investigate the matter today to " get to the bottom of one , why it was done , two , why it was disseminated , and three , what appropriate counselling and or action I need to take as the CEO …
We 're embarrassed that it 's gotten out , we have taken steps to remove it from the source and hopefully it wo n't go any further . "
Arocca said he would come up with a response " internally and if necessary externally " .
The handing out of a plastic toy , known as Little Boris , is a weekly routine at North .
Assistant coach Darren Bewick , a former Essendon player nicknamed Boris , awards it to the person judged to have committed the biggest gaffe of the week .
The Age is not suggesting Bewick had anything to do with the video or its dissemination .
The film was posted on YouTube about a month ago and was viewed nearly 200 times before it was removed .
Phil Cleary , a former footballer and long - time campaigner on violence against women , said : " It just bristles with degradation of women .
Do n't they get it ? " he said .
" Here we have the North Melbourne Football Club allowing someone access to their clubrooms , to their offices , to produce a video that 's just plain misogynistic .
It 's just full of women hatred — women are to be belittled , to be raped and to be degraded .
It 's sick . "
Invoking earlier incidents involving former Kangaroos skipper Wayne Carey , Cleary said the video came from a club " that has already had one of its most prominent players paraded in public and condemned by a range of people , and recently bared his soul about the very question of his attitude to women " .
The North Melbourne video incident has come to light just days after Adelaide Crows champion Nathan Bock was charged by police for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend .
With PETER HANLON
Guy - Ernest Debord would be spinning in his grave – had he not been cremated following his suicide in 1994 .
The arch - rebel who prided himself on fully deserving society 's " universal hatred " has now officially been recognised as a " national treasure " in his homeland .
The French government has duly stepped in to prevent Yale University from acquiring his personal archives , which contain almost everything he ever produced from the 1950s onwards : films , notes , drafts , unpublished works and corrected proofs , as well as his entire library , typewriter and spectacles .
The crowning jewel is , of course , the manuscript of The Society of the Spectacle , Debord 's devastating pre-emptive strike on virtual reality .
The small wooden table on which his magnum opus was composed is also thrown in .
It 's difficult to convey how bizarre it is to hear Christine Albanel – Sarkozy 's minister of culture – describing the revolutionary Debord as " one of the last great French intellectuals " of the second half of the 20th century .
A love - in between a resurrected Andreas Baader and Angela Merkel would be only marginally more surprising .
Then again , intellectuals have been something of a Gallic speciality ever since the Dreyfus Affair .
They 're accorded the privileged status usually reserved for the likes of Bono on these shores .
Jean - Paul Sartre 's funeral , in 1980 , attracted some 50,000 punters .
I doubt whether Noam Chomsky or Tom Paulin will top that .
But however incongruous her position , Madame Albanel is spot -on : no one – not even his sworn ideological enemies – can deny Debord 's importance .
Even though the young prankster soon turned into a curmudgeonly old soak , his influence is all - pervasive .
In fact , it was precisely because he hated the modern world with a passion that he was able to analyse it so presciently .
" All that was once directly lived has become mere representation , " he observes in the opening pages of The Society of the Spectacle – a statement that 's only grown in truth since he made it , back in 1967 .
Howls for Sade , his first movie , certainly was not " mere representation " .
It was the cinematographic equivalent of a meeting between Yves Klein 's monochromes and John Cage 's 4 ' 33 " : the screen remains blank throughout – all - white when there is some dialogue and all - black the rest of the time .
During the last 20 minutes , the film plays itself out in total silence and obscurity .
Guy Debord co-founded not one , but two , radical movements : the Lettrist International ( 1952 ) and the more famous Situationist International ( 1957 ) , which popularised concepts such as " dérive " and " détournement " .
The situationists ' hour of glory was undoubtedly the student uprising of May 1968 , which they partly shaped , but their influence has kept on growing ever since , from Malcolm McLaren and Jamie Reid 's work with the Sex Pistols to the current crop of British psychogeographers ( Iain Sinclair , Will Self , Stewart Home et al ) via Factory Records and The Idler 's anti-work ethic .
In 1959 , Debord and the artist Asger Jorn published Mémoires , which was bound in sandpaper so that it would attack any book placed next to it .
For years , this lethal dust jacket served as a perfect symbol of Debord 's abrasiveness : he was the ultimate outsider whose ideas could never be assimilated by the mainstream .
So what went wrong ?
The official recognition of Debord 's work tends to dissociate the revolutionary from the writer whose classical prose style has been compared with that of great memorialists such as Saint - Simon .
This negates the situationist belief that politics , literature and art must go hand in hand : " The point is not to put poetry at the service of revolution , but to put revolution at the service of poetry " .
Revolution was supposed to lead to the " supercession of art " by enabling human beings to live poetry and become works of art .
From this point of view , Debord belongs to the tradition of dadaists and surrealists such as Jacques Vaché , Arthur Cravan or Boris Poplavsky .
" There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book , " Oscar Wilde famously wrote .
" Books are well written , or badly written .
That is all . "
The French have long made this aphorism their own , as exemplified by the reception given to the likes of Rimbaud , Céline , Jean Genet or Dennis Cooper .
It seems that the only crime an author can commit on the other side of the Channel is poor writing – although you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors wo n't be making a June 1 debt payment of $ 1 billion , a company spokeswoman said Wednesday .
The debt is due the day after GM 's government - imposed May 30 deadline to have an aggressive restructuring plan in place or be left to face bankruptcy .
GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) said it would n't make the June 1 payment because as part of its restructuring , the company will be offering to exchange bondholder 's debt for equity in the company .
" We 're going to have an exchange offer open anyway , " said GM spokeswoman Julie Gibson .
A press representative for GM bondholders was not immediately available to comment .
While GM CEO Fritz Henderson has said that bankruptcy has become " more likely " in recent weeks , he has also said that an out - of - court restructuring remains a viable option .
GM has received $ 13.4 billion in federal loans and could receive an additional $ 5 billion before May 30 .
Beyond that , the Treasury department task force overseeing restructuring for GM and Chrysler has not said how much more support GM might be eligible to receive if it is able to restructure and reduce its debts and other obligations .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Despite crushing defeats in the last two elections , Senate Republicans have new " energy and enthusiasm " for winning back the majority , according to their leader , Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky .
A top GOP leader says George W. Bush , politically , was a " millstone " around the GOP 's neck .
" President Bush had become extremely unpopular , and politically he was sort of a millstone around our necks in both ' 06 and ' 08 , " McConnell told reporters Friday .
" We now have the opportunity to be on offense , offer our own ideas and we will win some . "
Many of those ideas get presented as amendments to Democratic bills , and even though they 're usually defeated , they can draw attention to GOP policy alternatives and force Democrats to take difficult votes .
" They become the way you chart the course for a comeback , which , in this country , always happens at some point , " McConnell said .
" The pendulum swings . "
McConnell said many of the ideas for amendments come from conservative think tanks and other Republican thinkers off Capitol Hill .
" Newt Gingrich , for example , has an idea a minute .
Many of those are quite good .
Many of those become amendments , " he said .
McConnell also said he does n't mind the " party of no " label Congressional Democrats and the White House give Republicans .
" I do n't feel anyone should be apologetic for opposing a bad idea , " McConnell said .
" I 'm not fearful of an effort to demonize dissent . "
After being labeled by Democrats the " party of no " for criticizing the budget without offering solutions , House Republicans said Thursday that they have come up with a plan B -- though were later criticized for a lack of details .
" Two nights ago , the president said , ' We have n't seen a budget yet out of Republicans . '
Well , it 's just not true , because here it is , Mr. President , " House Minority leader Rep. John Boehner said Wednesday as he held up a booklet that he said was a " blueprint for where we 're going . "
Watch GOP leaders unveil their ' leaner ' budget »
The details of the GOP budget will be presented on the House floor next week , said Rep. Paul Ryan , R - Wisconsin .
" We 're going to show a leaner budget , a budget with lower taxes , lower spending and lower borrowing , " Ryan said .
The blueprint includes familiar Republican proposals to limit " wasteful " government spending , cut the size of government and provide incentives to private entities to expand access to health care .
It also includes a major overhaul of the tax code , proposing a marginal tax rate of 10 percent for income up to $ 100,000 and 25 percent for any income above that level .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs laughed off the Republicans ' proposal Thursday , joking that their blueprint has more pictures of windmills than charts .
" It 's interesting to have a budget that does n't contain any numbers .
I think the ' party of no ' has become the ' party of no new ideas , ' " he said at the daily briefing .
CNN contributor Paul Begala says that Republicans are simply out of ideas -- and have no one to blame but themselves .
" The Republicans are like an arsonist who complains that the fire department is wasting water .
Obama is trying to handle an immediate crisis while also laying the foundation for long - term growth .
The Republicans are doing neither , " Begala said .
" They have no plan to stop the loss of jobs or to get capital markets functioning properly -- and they certainly have no plans for health care , education or energy , which are the keys to both long - term economic growth and long - term deficit reduction . "
Begala added : " If this were ' Sesame Street , ' the announcer would be saying , ' This program brought to you by the letters G , O and P ...
None of the crises the president is addressing were of his creation .
All of them were created or worsened by the Republicans who ran the House of Representatives , Senate and White House for years . "

Justice Memos Gave Bush Total Power Lawyers for George W. Bush ’s Justice Department asserted that the President had unlimited powers to prosecute the “ war on terror ” on American soil and could ignore constitutional rights , including First Amendment freedoms of speech and the press and Fourth Amendment requirements for search warrants , according to nine secret memos just released .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly
The memos related to opinions drafted by John Yoo , a deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , a powerful agency that advises the President on the extent of his powers under the Constitution .
In perhaps the most controversial of the memos , dated Oct. 23 , 2001 , and entitled " Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States , ” Yoo said Bush ’s war powers allowed him to put restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom of speech .
" First Amendment speech and press rights may also be subordinated to the overriding need to wage war successfully , " Yoo wrote .
" The current campaign against terrorism may require even broader exercises of federal power domestically . "
The memo concluded that " that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations . ”
The Fourth Amendment states that “ the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated . ”
The memo said Bush had the legal authority to order searches and seizures without warrants against individuals that he judged to be terrorists .
" We do not think a military commander carrying out a raid on a terrorist cell would be required to demonstrate probable cause or to obtain a warrant , " said the memo , which was prepared by Yoo for then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and Defense Department attorney William Haynes .
Another OLC attorney , Robert Delahunty , was identified as a co-author of the memo .
" We think that the better view is that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to domestic military operations designed to deter and prevent future terrorist attacks . "
In effect , the newly released memos make clear that – as some critics have long maintained – President Bush viewed his post 9/11 powers as Commander in Chief as “ plenary ” or unfettered .
What made the “ war on terror ” especially problematic in a constitutional Republic was that the conflict had no limits in time or space .
In other words , theoretically , the conflict would go on forever and the supposed front lines could be inside the United States as well as around the world .
Renouncing Yoo ’s Memos
Just three months before Bush exited the White House , Stephen Bradbury , as acting chief of the OLC , renounced the Oct. 23 , 2001 , legal opinion in a “ memorandum for the files ” that called Yoo ’s opinion about suspending First Amendment protections as “ unnecessary ” and " overbroad and general and not sufficiently grounded in the particular circumstance of a concrete scenario . "
In an Oct. 6 , 2008 , memo , Bradbury wrote that Yoo ’s legal opinion “ states several specific propositions that are either incorrect or highly questionable . ”
But Bradbury attempted to justify or forgive
Yoo ’s controversial opinion by explaining that it was “ the product of an extraordinary period in the history of the Nation : the immediate aftermath of the attacks of 9/11 . ”
The Oct. 23 , 2001 , “ memorandum represents a departure , although perhaps for understandable reasons , from the preferred practice of OLC to render formal opinions only with respect to specific and concrete policy proposals and not to undertake a general survey of a broad area of the law or to address general or amorphous hypothetical scenarios that implicate difficult questions of law , ” Bradbury wrote .
Bradbury identified five controversial points contained in Yoo ’s Oct. 23 , 2001 , memo and wrote that “ appropriate caution should be exercised before relying in any respect on the memorandum as a precedent of OLC , and that the particular propositions identified should not be treated as authoritative . ”
It was unclear what prompted Bradbury to draft the memo to the file , although his work along with Yoo ’s and that of Yoo ’s boss , Jay Bybee , was the subject of an internal Justice Department investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility , which completed its still - classified report late last year .
Bradbury wrote another memo five days before Bush left office in January in which he once again repudiated Yoo 's legal opinions .
It would appear that this memo was in response to the OPR report .
Bradbury said in the Jan. 15 memo that the flawed theories by Yoo in no way should be interpreted to mean that Justice Department lawyers did not " satisfy " professional standards .
Rather , Bradbury wrote " in the wake of the atrocities of 9/11 , when policy makers , fearing that additional catastrophic terrorist attacks were imminent , strived to employ all lawful means to protect the Nation . "
Another of the released memos – dated March 13 , 2002 and signed by Bybee , then assistant attorney general at the OLC – said Bush had the authority to transfer suspected terrorists to other countries without concern for whether they would be tortured .
Bybee 's memo was written one month after Bush suspended Geneva Conventions protections for al - Qaeda and Taliban prisoners .
“ Although such transfers might violate our treaty obligations if extradition is to a country where torture is likely ...
To fully shield our personnel from criminal liability , it is important that the United States not enter in an agreement with a foreign country , explicitly or implicitly , to transfer a detainee to that country for the purpose of having the individual tortured , " Bybee wrote .
" So long as the United States does not intend for a detainee to be tortured post - transfer , however , no criminal liability will attach to a transfer even if the foreign country receiving the detainee does torture him , " Bybee wrote .
Bybee 's memo said a 1998 law that prohibited the United States from handing over prisoners to countries that engaged in torture was not valid because it interfered with the President 's constitutional powers .
Bybee is now a federal judge on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
Military Commissions Another OLC memo dated April 8 , 2002 , said Bush did not need approval from Congress to hold military commissions to prosecute alleged terrorists .
However , the Supreme Court shot down that theory and declared military commissions illegal because Congress did not explicitly approve them .
Congress did pass the Military Commissions
Act in 2006 to prosecute detainees held at Guantanamo Bay .
In releasing the memos on Monday , Attorney General Eric Holder said " Americans deserve a government that operates with transparency and openness .
It is my goal to make OLC opinions available when possible while still protecting national security information and ensuring robust internal executive branch debate and decision - making . "
In a speech before the Jewish Council of Public Affairs in Washington , Holder said that " too often over the past decade , the fight against terrorism has been viewed as a zero - sum battle with our civil liberties .
Not only is that school of thought misguided , I fear that in actuality it does more harm than good . "
Jameel Jaffer , the director of the American Civil Liberties Union ’s National Security Project , said the memos released Monday “ essentially argue that the President has a blank check to disregard the Constitution during wartime , not only on foreign battlefields , but also inside the United States . ”
“ We hope today ’s release is a first step , because dozens of other OLC memos , including memos that provided the basis for the Bush administration 's torture and warrantless wiretapping policies , are still being withheld , ” said Jaffer , whose organization has tried to obtain the memos under the Freedom of Information Act .
“ In order to truly turn the page on a lawless era , these memos should be released immediately , ” he said .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , who plans a hearing on Wednesday to discuss the formation of a “ truth commission ” to probe the Bush administration ’s policies , said the newly released legal opinions “ regarding national security remain of great concern . ”

I can't be the only one who 's avoiding just about anything made in China :
At the height of the U.S. housing boom , when building materials were in short supply , American construction companies used millions of pounds of Chinese - made drywall because it was abundant and cheap .
Now that decision is haunting hundreds of homeowners and apartment dwellers who are concerned that the wallboard gives off fumes that can corrode copper pipes , blacken jewelry and silverware , and possibly sicken people .
Shipping records reviewed by The Associated Press indicate that imports of potentially tainted Chinese building materials exceeded 500 million pounds during a four - year period of soaring home prices .
The drywall may have been used in more than 100,000 homes , according to some estimates , including houses rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina .
“ This is a traumatic problem of extraordinary proportions , ” said U.S. Rep.
Robert Wexler , a Florida Democrat who introduced a bill in the House calling for a temporary ban on the Chinese - made imports until more is known about their chemical makeup .
Similar legislation has been proposed in the Senate .
One of the ingredients they used was fly ash .
You remember fly ash , do n't you ?
Neither the authority nor the E.P.A. has released the results of tests of soil or the ash itself .
Authority officials have said that the ash is not harmful , and the authority has not warned residents of potential dangers , though federal studies show that coal ash can contain dangerous levels of heavy metals and carcinogens .
“ You ’re not going to be endangered by touching the ash material , ” said Barbara Martocci , a spokeswoman for the T.V.A .
“ You ’d have to eat it .
You have to get it in your body . ”
The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation also released a statement saying there was no indication of risk unless the ash was ingested .
Personally , I think breathing in particulate matter counts as ingested .
But that 's just me !
Oh , and look out for leather furniture , too .
Bill : Ban headwear in license photos
A St. Cloud legislator says a bill that would ban any kind of headwear in a driver 's license photo is a matter of public safety .
But some Muslims say they have a religious right to cover their heads .
Republican Rep. Steve Gottwalt says banning headwear would make it easier for law enforcement to identify people and it would make it fair for everyone .
But Suban Khalif says Muslim women wear a head scarf nearly 24 hours a day as part of their religion , and taking it off -- even for a few minutes -- is a big deal .
Khalif and other Muslim women say their facial features should be enough for law enforcement to identify them .
Gottwalt 's bill has exceptions .
If a person has a deformity or a medial condition that requires headwear , then it can be word for the driver 's license picture .
Gottwalt says he 's hoping to get a committee hearing for the bill soon .

Sex trafficking is target of legislation
A bill introduced Monday would include sex trafficking on a list of crimes of violence and would increase penalties for certain situations , such as when a victim is injured .
The bill authored by Sen. Sandy Pappas , a St. Paul DFLer , would also provide training and public awareness and would help victims get access to services such as health care and legal representation .
Pappas says those parts of the bill would cost money , so she 's focusing on changes to the criminal statutes this session and hopes the rest will be implemented later .
Human rights advocates say prostitution and sex trafficking can increase during bad economic times .

WASHINGTON–John McCain is the latest high - profile politician to repeat the diehard American falsehood that the 9/11 terrorists entered the United States through Canada .
Just days after Janet Napolitano , the U.S. homeland security secretary , sparked a diplomatic kerfuffle by suggesting the terrorists took a Canadian route to the U.S. eight years ago , McCain defended her by saying that , in fact , the former Arizona governor was correct .
" Well , some of the 9/11 hijackers did come through Canada , as you know , " McCain , last year 's Republican presidential candidate , said on Fox News on Friday .
The Arizona senator 's remarks prompted the Canadian embassy to immediately reissue remarks made earlier this week by Ambassador Michael Wilson , who reminded Americans once again that no 9/11 perpetrators came to the U.S. via Canada .
" Unfortunately , misconceptions arise on something as fundamental as where the 9/11 terrorists came from , " Wilson said .
" As the 9/11 Commission reported in July 2004 , all of the 9/11 terrorists arrived in the U.S. from outside North America .
They flew to major U.S. airports .
They entered the U.S. with documents issued to them by the U.S. government .
No 9/11 terrorists came from Canada . "
Crestfallen embassy officials contacted McCain 's office soon after his Fox News remarks to set the record straight .
McCain , an avid supporter of NAFTA and a powerful friend to Canada on Capitol Hill , recently visited the Canadian Embassy and had lunch with Wilson .
The normally reserved Wilson made his 9/11 remarks on Tuesday following a CBC interview in which Napolitano appeared to believe that the hijackers entered the U.S. from Canada .
She later said she had misunderstood a question asked during the interview and was well aware there had been no Canadian 9/11 connection , but added that the Canada - U.S. border had , in the past , posed a security risk to Americans .
The next day , Napolitano appeared at a border conference and suggested Canada was more lax in its immigration policies than the U.S. , alleging Canadian authorities allow people into the country that would not pass muster south of the border .
Napolitano has also ruffled diplomatic feathers with her insistence that the Canadian border must not be treated any differently than the U.S. - Mexican boundary , where a drug war rages and countless illegal immigrants flood into America every year .
McCain expressed some sympathy for Canada on that front on Friday .
" The difference , obviously , is , with all due respect to the Mexicans , there 's not corruption on our northern border , " he told Fox News .
" And , unfortunately , there is significant corruption , great corruption and drug cartels on our southern border . "
In Washington for G7 and G20 meetings on Friday , Canada 's finance minister expressed frustration that the Canada 9/11 myth lives on .
" It 's unfortunate that what is a statement that is not true is being repeated from time to time , " Jim Flaherty said .
" It 's just factually wrong ... I would hope that people would n't want to make statements that are inaccurate so that we wo n't hear much of that anymore . "
Conservative blogger Ann Althouse was listening and she described what happened next :
He 'd slotted the story into his Obama - does n't - know - what - to - do template and was riffing away about Obama 's indecision and what he must be fretting about and how he'd probably want to apologize to the pirates and so forth .
The big show was steaming along .
( I thought a good ending would be : hostage crisis ... it 's Jimmy Carter all over again . )
And then he was slipped the news that the U.S. crew had taken their ship back , defeated the pirates .
And Rush should have turned that big show around instantly .
It should have been : Yay , America !
Americans do n't lie back and wait to be rescued .
We 're ready to fight .
We 're self - reliant .
The government is n't the answer to everything .
There were lots of great alternate Rush Limbaugh templates to mobilize right then .
This is why we need to have our own guns .
This is why the bitching about Bush after Katrina was all wrong .
Etc. etc. But Rush could n't turn that big show — that big container ship — around .
He could n't let go of Obama does n't know what to do , and I felt a little sad about my radio hero .
Althouse points like a laser beam at Limbaugh 's blunder , in fact she admits to it herself : the Republican Party expected Obama to fail this test , expected him to " be like Jimmy Carter . "
Just hours after the hijacking , long before most of the facts were known , Republicans and conservatives like Limbaugh and Althouse were placing massive bets against the ability of the United States -- under the leadership of the Obama administration -- to deal with this crisis .
Limbaugh placed a big bet on the table that the United States would fail .
But Limbaugh 's mistake should have been almost immediately obvious .
Even as we were digesting the first news of the hijacking , more reports came in indicating that the ship 's crew of tough American merchant sailors had managed to overpower one of their attackers and had chased the remaining attackers off the vessel .
Unfortunately , the fleeing pirates had taken Captain Richard Phillips hostage when they fled in the Maersk Alabama 's lifeboat .
Rush Limbaugh had bet against these sailors , and so had already lost most of his bet even before his show was over .
But Republicans were n't going to cut their losses : instead they doubled down .
After an attempt to trade the captured pirate for Captain Phillips went wrong , Phillips found himself trapped aboard the small lifeboat with four heavily armed pirates .
" There 's no way Phillips is getting out of this , " Republicans seemed to be saying .
Once again key Republican talking heads bet against an American mariner , the U.S. Navy , and the leadership of the Obama administration .
Republican spokesman Brad Blakeman was on MSNBC this morning predicting that the U.S. Navy would fail in its mission to rescue Captain Phillips .
Over at This Week with George Stephanopoulos , Newt Gingrich went on the attack against the Obama administration , betting against the U.S. Navy .
Knowing as we do how this story ends , it 's hard not to conclude that Gingrich is a little reckless .
Clearly Gingrich has no idea what he 's talking about .
Gingrich was n't privy to the Obama administration 's deliberations and planning .
While Gingrich was loudly condemning the Obama administration as a " do - nothing , " halfway around the world the U.S. Navy 's SEALs were executing a plan signed off on by Barack Obama , and successfully rescuing Captain Richard Phillips .
Newt Gingrich bet against the U.S. Navy SEALs and lost .
What did this minor incident involving piracy have to teach us about the Republican Party ?
The Republican Party really is hoping that the United States fails .
Often .
So much so that we crawl back to the Republicans and beg them to take over the government in 2010 and 2012 .
Because the Republican Party wants the United States to fail , the Republican Party has a vested interest in causing the United States to fail .
This perverse incentive can be seen working itself out in the way that Republican talking heads and thought leaders like Limbaugh and Gingrich bet against the United States , predicting our failure before all the facts are in .
Limbaugh in particular clearly savors the thought of American failure .
The Republican Party 's leaders are irresponsible .
Politics is supposed end at the water 's edge .
For Republicans like Limbaugh and Gingrich to go on the radio or television and demonstrate that they are hoping for a hostage rescue to fail so they can exploit that failure for political gain is a clear demonstration that the Republican Party and its leaders are unfit to serve as the leaders of our country .
All too often Republicans place party before country , and that simply is n't acceptable in a situation like the one Richard Phillips faced this week .
Update : Wow , thanks for all the kind comments and my second trip to the Rec List .
I 'd just like to make a shameless plug for my home blog , The Richmond Democrat .
Thanks again for your kind words

Reddit ’s Ad Experiment Is Good News for Condé Nast .
Maybe for Digg , Too .
How do you sell ads on a user - generated content site frequented by people who love technology and hate ads ?
Sell ads that look exactly like the content itself .
That ’s the strategy that Condé Nast is taking –cautiously –with Reddit , the Digg - like news aggregator it bought a couple of years ago .
And it might be working .
So says Josh Stinchcomb , who runs sales and marketing for the “ business ” group of Condé ’s digital properties , which also includes Wired.com , Ars Technica , and Web sites for the likes of The New Yorker and Portfolio .
About three months ago , Stinchcomb began running ads that look exactly like the story headlines Reddit users submit and vote on .
The only difference :
They sit at the top of the site ’s homepage and carry a “ sponsored link ” tag .
Like this ( click to enlarge ) :
The results have made Condé “ cautiously optimistic , ” says Stinchcomb .
You can measure that two ways : Click - through rates for the ads are running at about five percent , which is several times more than the industry average .
And readers have n’t revolted .
The latter is a real possibility at a site like Reddit , whose users are fiercely protective of the community they ’ve built , and antagonistic toward advertising in general .
Stinchcomb says about 20 percent of Reddit ’s users have installed ad - blocking software on their Web browsers .
If Condé keeps using the ads–they ’ve run them from three sponsors so far and are tinkering with a self - service version that would allow marketers to submit ads on their own–it wo n’t create a torrent of cash .
Right now the ads are priced at a $ 7 CPM ( that ’s $ 7 for every 1,000 eyeballs Condé gets in front of the ads ) , and Stinchcomb says he ’ll probably have to knock that rate down .
( He says he may also consider changing ad pricing to a cost - per - click / performance model , which would be a first for Condé ) .
But even a little bit of money would be a plus for Reddit , which has remained more or less a revenue - free property for Condé , even though traffic has shot up since the acquisition .
Stinchcomb says Reddit now attracts five million uniques visitors a month , up from 1.5 million when the publisher bought the site ( per usual , third - party traffic meausurements are much smaller ) .
Just as important , if it works for Reddit , it could have big implications for Digg , which has a significantly bigger audience , but faces the same problems selling ads .
Digg has raised $ 40 million so far , at a very high valuation , but revenues have been paltry .
The site is reportedly planning to start selling ads that will look and feel a lot like the ones Reddit is already trying .
High time to start experimenting .

SANTELLI : Now , think about it this way .
Maybe I 'm missing something .
But the outrage seems to be about M's , millions of dollars , right ?
$ 165 million , OK ?
But I would think that it should be looked at as a pretty big positive , because when you go from the M , maybe you should try to go to the B's , which is the billions of dollars , and maybe that 's going to even enlighten it for the T , trillions of dollars .
You know , $ 165 million is like worrying about 16.5 cents , while $ 165 maybe necessitates a little more outrage .
What do you guys think ?
Brewer : ... he called them losers ...
Francis : I think he regretted that word .
Brewer : ... and his rants , well you know sometimes we say things in the heat of the moment that is easy to regret ...
Francis :
This time Santelli 's making waves , trying to put the AIG bonus outrage into perspective ....
The man the legend , CNBC 's Rick Santelli joins us now live from Chicago .
Rick , alright you 've got to explain the logic to us here because the people who love to misinterpret you are already out there doing there work .
Santell : I am as outraged as anyone for rewarding bad behavior , however if there were contracts in place ....
We are now focusing on a sixteen dollar towel rack in the bathroom , but times that by a thousand ....
[ media id =7598 ]
He 's baaaack .
Rick Santelli , the right wing hero and the man who too cowardly to represent CNBC on The Daily Show is now calling the payouts of bonuses to AIG executives nothing more than a bathroom product compared to other monies being spent .
He says he 's outraged as anyone over it though , but a contract is a contract Watch the beginning of the clip and notice how CNBC's Melissa Francis and MSNBC 's Contessa Brewer defend Santelli calling Americans who got underwater in the housing market as " losers , " by saying it was just in the heat of the moment .
CNBC ran an ad promotion based on Santelli's Rebel Yell rant so do you think he regretted it at all ?
Francis , who I watched say that Joe the Plumber was a star on this time block for MSNBC certainly has Santelli 's back .
Is she saying he was misquoted when he called average American " loser ? "
It 's amazing how tone deaf these pundits and politicians have been over AIG and their feelings about Wall street .
The public is furious and to think that a meager 165 million dollars of bonuses would n't upset America is insane .
And Obama 's people have not done a good job on explaining this situation either .
I 'd like to see Santelli forfeit his entire salary since he 's been a leading voice on CNBC throughout the worst economic meltdown in generations as a show of solidarity with the American people , who he believes are losers .
And the amount of signatures on our FiX CNBC petition is now higher than the DOW .
There is one reason why I will never , ever try heroin : I know Chet Baker ’s life story .
Okay , there are other reasons , but his story ranks near the top .
Of course there is no shortage of musicians who have suffered serious decline or death due to drugs .
But Baker ’s story resonates with me more than any other because of the squandering of natural gifts and the stark contrast between his image and the truth .
Chet Baker was a largely self - taught musician .
His enlistment in the army in the 1940s and 50s brought him to the west coast , where he was exposed to the cool jazz sound that was emerging .
His style seemed particularly shaped by fellow trumpeter Miles Davis , eschewing flashiness in favor of melody and subtlety .
Baker was not a highly regarded songwriter ( in fact he never learned to read or write music ) , but he did have a couple of advantages over counterparts such as Davis , namely his voice and his look .
This is how Chet Baker looked in the 1950s :
And this is how he sounded :

James Dean looks , a golden voice , and a broadly accessible cool jazz sound : I believe that ’s what music executives would consider crossover appeal .
And Baker achieved a great amount of success being marketed as the cool , sexy singer who also happened to be a great trumpeter .
But that success would be short - lived .
Like many jazz musicians ( and soldiers , for that matter ) in the 1950s he had taken to using heroin .
His addiction came to the fore in the 60s , with mounting legal , financial , and health troubles .
He served jail time in the U.S. and Europe , including a year in an Italian prison .
He pawned his instruments to raise drug money .
And he somehow ended up breaking his front teeth ; he made a dubious claim about being mugged but the suspicion was that it was simply decay from heroin abuse .
As you might imagine , front teeth are important for playing the trumpet .
As such , he was forced to switch to the flugelhorn , a larger instrument that is typically played in a lower register and requires less impact on the teeth .
Here ’s a 1964 performance from Baker clearly showing his missing teeth :
I suspect whoever decided to shoot that video with Baker missing his front teeth may have also dabbled with hard drugs .
Time passed and Chet Baker essentially vanished from the American scene although he did continue to tour in Europe and Asia where he had a large following .
In the 1980s , he would have something of a revival in the U.S. thanks in part to Elvis Costello ’s patronage .
But by this point , Baker had lost much of his vocal luster and the adjustment to playing with dentures had also negatively impacted his trumpet sound .
He recorded prolifically in this period , but the quality was extremely variable .
For me there is one highlight , and it is his mid-80s recordng of Elvis Costello ’s “ Almost Blue ” :

Download the latest version here .

Although that is one of his higher quality performances from that period , you can hear how the precision and range of his voice have suffered .
Decades of heroin use did not spare his looks either :
In 1988 , Chet Baker died by falling out of a second - story hotel window in Amsterdam .
It ’s unclear how the fall happened , but his body was found to contain heroin and cocaine .

It is no secret that I love language and all things related it to .
Also , being a bit of a pedant , I love to share titbits of information about words , phrases , and language in general .
Therefore , I have put together a list of misconceptions ( one of my favorite types of list ) about common sayings .
Some involve spelling errors , while others involve conception or comprehension errors .
Be sure to tell us your favorite ( and by that I mean most hated ) common errors in the comments .
SEE ALSO : 10 Common Sayings That Mean The Opposite Of What You Think
10 Scot Free
Common Saying :
To get off scot free
Many people think that this saying refers to Scottish people being tight with money – hence something being free , but in fact the word “ scot ” is an old Norse word which means “ payment ” – specifically a payment made to a landlord or sheriff .
So this phrase – while meaning what most people think it means , has no connection to the Scottish people – it just means to get off without having to pay .
9 Fit as a Fiddle
Common Saying :
As fit as a fiddle
This is another phrase where a single word has confused people – “ fit ” in the context of this saying does not mean “ healthy ” which is a 19th century definition .
Its original meaning was “ suitable ” – and it is still used in that context in the sentence “ fit for a king ” .
As fit as a fiddle means “ as appropriate as can be ” – not “ in excellent health ” .
The first use of the phrase , incidentally , was in the 16th century and it was originally “ as right as a fiddle ” .
8 Another Thing Coming
Common Saying :
If you think that , you have another thing coming
This is a complete aberration of the original phrase because of the sound of English .
The correct phrase is “ if you think that , you have another think coming ” – in other words , “ what you think is wrong so think again ” .
Because the “ k ” in “ think ” often ends up silent when saying “ think coming ” people have changed the phrase over time .
Of course , “ another thing coming ” makes no sense at all .
To illustrate how global this error is , when you google “ another thing coming ” it returns 139,000 results ; when you google “ another think coming ” it returns a mere 39,000 results .
7 Eat Humble Pie
Common Saying : Eat humble pie
This phrase means “ to be humble in apologizing for something . ”
I was slightly reluctant to put it on the list because it actually does mean what people think it means , but there is still a misconception here ; people think that this phrase means to eat a pie made of humbleness but it actually means to eat a pie made with umble ( pictured above ) .
Umble is an old English word for offal – the bits of the animal seldom eaten today ( sadly ) .
It was a pie that was normally eaten by the poor as the finer cuts of meat were left for the rich only .
“ To eat a humble pie ” is an example of metanalysis ( words being broken down into parts or meanings that differ from the original ) as it sounds just like “ to eat an umble pie ” .
Other examples of this in English are “ an apron ” which used to be “ a napron ” .
6 Rule of Thumb
Common Saying : Rule of thumb
People commonly think that this saying is a reference to a law allowing a man to beat his wife as long as he uses a rod no thicker than his thumb .
It is , of course , completely untrue .
There is no record of any judge in Britain ever making a ruling like this – or any lawmaker passing a law .
The phrase actually refers to doing something by estimates – rather than using an exact measure .
5 On Tender Hooks
Common Saying :
On tender hooks
This phrase is very commonly misspelt .
First off , what exactly is a tender hook ?
It does n’t seem logical does it ?
Well – that is because it is n’t .
The phrase is actually “ on tenterhooks ” .
A tenter was a medieval tool used for making cloth – the tenterhooks ( pictured above ) were small hooks to which the fabric would be stretched in the manufacturing process .
To be on tenterhooks means to be left hanging – or to be in a state of suspense .
4 Take a Raincheck
Common Saying : I ’ll take a raincheck
This phrase is usually meant to mean “ I wo n’t do it now but I will later ” .
This is the commonly accepted meaning ( and has been for a long time ) so it is now considered to be correct .
It is included here merely out of interest because its original meaning was slightly different .
Initially , a raincheck was offered to people who had tickets to a baseball game that was rained out – they would offered a “ raincheck ” which was a ticket for a game at a later date to make up for the missed game .
This eventually found its way into shopping jargon in general where a raincheck was an offer to sell an out - of - stock good when it arrived back in stock .
The meaning has eventually broadened to a point that it is not an offer any longer but a response .
3 Free Reign
Common Saying :
To give someone free reign
This is a spelling error that leads to a misunderstanding – though the meanings remain the same fundamentally .
Many people presume this phrase to mean that a person given free reign , has the “ royal ” power to do anything they want .
In fact , the correct phrase is “ free rein ” and it comes from the days before cars when horses were used as our main mode of transport .
When navigating a steep or winding path , one would relax the reins so that the horse could pick the safest path as he was more likely to do a better job than the rider .
2 Wreck Havoc
Common Saying :
To wreck havoc
Havoc means chaos – and to wreck something is to put it into a state of chaos .
So why would you make chaos out of chaos ?
You would n’t .
What you might do is wreak havoc though – because “ to wreak ” means “ to cause to happen ” .
The two words are pronounced differently – wreck sounds like “ rek ” while “ wreak ” sounds like “ reek ” .
It is a small – but common , error .
1 Beg the Question
Common Saying :
To beg the question
Let ’s face it – 99 % of people reading this list will not know the correct meaning of “ beg the question ” , but that implies that the mistaken meaning should really be considered correct through common usage – so let us not fight about right or wrong – I will just state the facts : “ to beg the question ” does not mean “ to raise the question ” .
Originally the phrase was “ to begge the question ” and it appeared in English around the 1580s .
It is a reference to a question ( or phrase ) which implies the truth of the thing it is trying to prove .
Confusing ?
Okay – here is an example : “ why does England have fewer trees per acre than any other country in Europe ? ”
This is a “ begged question ” – the person asking is implying that England has fewer trees – when in fact , it may not .
Another example is “ he must be telling the truth because he never lies ” .
Decartes was begging the question when he said “ I think , therefore I am ” .
Oh – and for those of you who are used to using the term in the wrong way , consider using “ prompt the question ” as a correct alternative .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Gov. David Paterson will announce plans Thursday to introduce same - sex marriage legislation in the state Assembly , according to an assemblyman who was asked to be present for the announcement .
A New York assemblyman says Gov. David Paterson knows " this will be a defining moment . "
" The governor 's office called me and asked if I would stand with the governor , " said Micah Z. Kellner , a state assemblyman from Manhattan .
" I said I will be thrilled to stand with the governor when he makes this announcement . "
Paterson has expressed support for gay marriage in the past but when asked Tuesday , he would not confirm details of an announcement .
" There is clearly a problem in that those individuals who are gay or lesbian who would live in a civil union are still not entitled to somewhere between 1,250 and 1,300 civil protections " available to married couples , Paterson said .
" We would like to try to address that at some point in the near future . "
Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer introduced the same bill in 2007 .
It passed in the Assembly 85 - 61 but died in the state Senate .
The bill 's chief supporter in the Senate , Democratic state Sen .
Thomas Duane , said Paterson " knows how hard it is to pass this kind of legislation . "
" He worked to try to pass hate crime legislation for many years , " Duane said .
" I know how strongly the governor feels about this kind of civil rights legislation . "
Paterson has previously said he is committed to bringing " full marriage equality in New York State . "
" No governor in the history of New York has been at the forefront , " said Kellner .
" He realizes it is the civil rights movement of the 21st century . "
Duane agreed .
" I also know that he [ Paterson ] knows that this will be a defining moment . "
Bruce Anderson , interim executive director of the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual & Transgender Community Center , said it 's " high time that we have the opportunity to discuss this in Albany . "
" We have waited very long , " he added .
If the legislation passes , it would make New York the fifth state to legalize same sex-marriage .
Similar measures have been approved by courts or lawmakers in Connecticut , Vermont , Massachusetts and Iowa .
Because of its previous success in the Assembly , the bill is expected to pass there , but it will need 32 votes to pass in the state Senate .
" We hope to have this bill passed at the end of June , at the end of the legislative session , " said Kellner .
" No one wants to bring this to the floor to fail , it would be a huge disaster .
We want to make sure that if we bring this to the floor for a vote that it passes . "

 Why bother about winter ?  said the Grasshopper ; we have got plenty of food at present .

When the winter came the Grasshopper had no food , and found itself dying of hunger , while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer .

Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is seen speaking in this video grab provided to Reuters on September 11 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Internet
BERLIN ( Hollywood Reporter ) - A Dutch TV jury has found Osama bin Laden not guilty of the September 11 attacks .
In the conclusion Wednesday night to the show “ Devil ’s Advocate ” on Dutch public broadcaster Nederland 2 , the jury of two men and three women , along with the studio audience , ruled that there was no proof bin Laden was the mastermind behind the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001 .
The Netherlands , home to “ Big Brother ” creator Endemol , is known for being on the cutting edge of format - based television .
But even for Dutch standards , “ Devil ’s Advocate , ” from Amsterdam production house AVRO , pushes the envelope .
The show features star defense attorney Gerard Spong standing up for some of the world ’s worst criminals .
In the latest show , Spong was able to convince the jury that bin Laden ’s connection to September 11 was a product of “ Western propaganda . ”
The jury also ruled there was insufficient evidence to prove bin Laden was the real head of terrorist network al - Qaida .
The jury did rule , however , that bin Laden is a “ terrorist who has misused Islam . ”
The show is certain to provide further ammunition in the already heated Dutch debate over immigration and the country ’s large Muslim minority .
The Netherlands saw a sharp rise in anti-immigration and anti-Islamic sentiment after the 2004 murder of Dutch director Theo Van Gogh by a Muslim extremist .
Spong has been at the center of the debate , supporting legal action against anti-immigrant politician Geert Wilders .
Rush Limbaugh wins ' unsexiest ' man of the year award John Byrne
Published : Thursday March 26 , 2009

The man who touted ' Barack the Magic Negro ' and mocked Michael J. Fox for allegedly faking Parkinson 's disease has beaten out the man who stole nearly $ 65 billion for a dubious accolade .
Rush Limbaugh , mocked as " Jabba the Nut " by free weekly Boston Phoenix , has been selected as the ugliest man of the year by the paper .
The 99 runner - up unsexiest men of the year can be viewed at this link .
" Americas ugliest moment of 2009 ?
Rush Limbaugh , his man - boobs a - jiggle , bouncing at the CPAC podium to bask in the sickly glow of conservatisms orgy of greed , avarice , and arrogance , " the paper writes .
" Here , at last , was the shining image of the 21st century Republican Party : a leeringly rich Baby Boomer squatting at the top of the mountain , reaping his jollies from the suffering of those at the bottom , praying for the failure of hope .
" If this hypocritical and morally repugnant reformed Oxy junkie wants to discuss failure ,  maybe we should talk about his career as an NFL commentator  or the last time he detoxed off prescription smack , " they add .
Number two ?
Chris Brown who they say is imitating " Ike Turner 's worst traits " and brings " new meazning to the phrase ' hit record , ' citing his recent spat with star Rihanna .
Number three : Bernie Madoff , the man who mounted the largest Ponzi scheme in history .
Also notable is the Phoenix 's # 4 : Jim Cramer , of CNBC , who was recently lambasted by Comedy Central 's Jon Stewart for his histrionics and history in pushing stocks .
" CNBC 's Jim Cramer is the Jenna Jameson of financial reporting : the more the economy took it in the rear , the louder his screams of ecstasy became , " the Phoenix says .
" We had this loudmouthed , prop - wielding financial Gallagher on our list a full year before he got pwned by Jon Stewart  but in 2009 , Cramer wins our most - devolved award , streaking up the list from his 91st - place showing in 2008 to now land inside the top 10 .
Howd we figure it ?
Simple calculation : we moved him up a spot every time the market went down like a porn star  and added bonuses every time he whimpered ' I shouldve done better . ' "
They dub Cramer " Crock Broker . "
Michael Kamrava , the man who artificially inseminated a mother with octuplets , makes number 9 .
The paper calls him Dr. Octogynecologist and says , " looking at this Telly - Savalas - meets - Dr. - Evil , it suddenly makes sense : maybe this is the only way he can get women pregnant . "
The paper explains , " To the masses , unsexiness is defined in superficial ways  pores big enough to drive Hummers through , and hair that grows like kudzu in unwanted places , and unexplained protuberances .
Think Danny Bonaduce or Carrot Top ( or virtually any man you can think of with red hair ) .
To the faceless myrmidons here at Phoenix Unsexy Headquarters , however , unsexiness is an altogether different quality , defined instead by gypping jillions out of charities or punching your girlfriend or yelling at your cinematographer . "
" Our annual survey of the years Unsexiest Men is a corrective to this sort of deplorable behavior , " the Phoenix editors write .
" Assembled by a watchful team with a low tolerance for hypocrisy , wastefulness , and unfunny comedians , our list holds men accountable for their rampantly unsexy ways .
Consider this list a compendium of social subpoenae from the High Court of Sexiness . "

Microsoft 's prosecution of TomTom over alleged violation of patents is looking increasingly like a failure in its long - running policy of tying down Linux users through cross licensing of its IP .
Computerworld has dredged up an email exchange with Microsoft's IP and licensing legal chief that explains Microsoft 's got a long history of licensing its File Allocation Table / Long File Name ( FAT LFN ) with companies in the car navigation space and that have specifically been using Linux and open source .
Microsoft 's corporate vice president and deputy general counsel of intellectual property and licensing Horacio Gutierrez said 18 companies had signed up , including Kenwood , Alpine , and Pioneer .
According to Computerworld :
" When asked specifically if " there are companies using Linux and open - source software , which have signed FAT patent cross-licensing agreements , such as the ones , which TomTom has refused to agree to ? "
Gutierrez replied , " Yes , other companies have signed FAT patent licenses , both in the context of patent cross licensing agreements and other licensing arrangements . "
Microsoft in earlier statements has insisted the case is not about Linux and Gutierrez denied this was the first step in a series of suits over a claimed 235 cases of Microsoft patents being violated by free and open - source software .
It 's worth noting that Gutierrez was one of the Microsoft legal eagles who claimed in 2007 that free and open - source software infringes those 200 - plus patents .
TomTom US has refused to comment on the case .
Contrary to what Microsoft may state about this not being about Linux , tying up companies that use Linux and open source in patent licensing agreements cuts to the very core of one of the things that 's kept Linux and open - source alive : free distribution of the kernel and code .
Samba maintainer Jeremy Allison pointed out in a recent blog posting by writer Glyn Moody that companies who sign up to Microsoft 's licensing cannot continue to distribute their code under GPLv2 .
Section seven of GPLv2 - called the " Liberty or Death " clause - states that you cannot distribute code if outside restrictions have been imposed .
" What people are missing about this is the either / or choice that Microsoft is giving TomTom , " Alison posted .
" It is n't a case of cross - license and everything is ok .
If TomTom or any other company cross licenses patents then by section 7 of GPL v2 ( for the Linux kernel ) .
they lose the rights to redistribute the kernel * at all * . "
In other words , Microsoft is eroding Linux and open source and slowing their development .
A deal with Microsoft prevents GPL'd code from returning to the ecosystem whence it came , with any improvements or updates , as companies that do patent licensing deals with Microsoft must keep it in - house .
This is particularly damaging for Linux , given consumer electronics companies such as those Microsoft is tying up are making heavy use of Linux in devices from in - car systems to TVs and DVD players and could potentially return their improvements to the kernel to the market .
One reason these companies have turned to Linux and open source rather than use Windows is because of the simple expense of licensing Windows , and the fact the code is not open so they cannot make changes needed to run gadgets and devices .
" Make no mistake , this is intended to force TomTom to violate the GPL , or change to Microsoft embedded software , " Allison wrote . ®
Today a broad array of 29 farmers , consumer groups , businesses and other organizations sent a letter to Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius , President Obama ’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services , urging her to veto HR 2121 , a bill passed by the Kansas State Legislature last week which would require an additional disclaimer on labels for dairy products produced from cows not treated with recombinant bovine growth hormone ( rbGH or rbST ) , a genetically engineered , artificial hormone that induces cows to produce more milk .
( To read more about the problem with rbGH , check out this earlier Civil Eats post . )
The bill was sent yesterday to Governor Sebelius , who has ten days to veto it .
“ Since the FDA ’s controversial decision to approve the use of rbGH , questions have only grown about its safety for humans , ” said Dr. Michael Hansen , Senior Scientist for Food Safety for Consumers Union .
“ HR 2121 interferes with consumers ’ right to know what is in their food and how it ’s produced and farmers and dairies have the right to tell them . ”
Consumers Union sent a similar letter to Sebelius urging her to veto the bill .
The required disclaimer would read : “ the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has determined there are no significant differences between milk from cows that receive injections of the artificial hormone and milk from those that do not . ”
That statement is based on an 18 - year - old FDA review ; however , FDA ’s own publications , as well as subsequent scientific studies have shown that there are significant differences , some of which may affect human health .
The Kansas bill also goes against long - established Federal policy as outlined by the FDA in a July 27 , 1994 letter to New York Department of Agriculture and Markets : “ The bottom line is that a contextual statement is not required … and in no instance is the specific statement ‘ No significant difference has been shown …’ required by FDA . ”
In addition , the Legislature tacked on the dairy labeling rules of HB 2295 as a rider on HB 2121 without a hearing in the Senate Agriculture Committee .
This denied the numerous opponents of labeling restrictions the chance to testify .
Even with the lack of proper debate , the bill barely passed the Senate by a 22 - 15 vote , just two votes short of failing , demonstrating that there is barely a mandate for labeling changes in Kansas .

“ As she reviews this bill , and ascends to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , we urge Governor Sebelius to veto this bill , protect the health of Kansas ’ citizens , and to leave a legacy of support for the public interest , not special interests , ” said Patty Lovera , Assistant Director at Food & Water Watch .
Due to growing consumer demand , companies are removing rbGH from their dairy products across the country .
In addition , over 160 hospitals all over the country have pledged to serve rbGH - free products and the past president of the American Medical Association said in a letter to all AMA members that hospitals should serve only milk produced without rbGH .
“ Kansas is taking a step in the wrong direction , as more than half of the 100 largest dairy processors in the country have gone partially or completely rbGH - free to satisfy consumer demand , ” said Heather Whitehead , True Food Network Director at the Center for Food Safety .
“ If dairies decide not to label milk as rbGH - free due to these unnecessary labeling requirements , or decide not to sell their products in Kansas , citizens will be denied the chance to make informed choices about what kind of dairy products to buy . ”
Local retailers are also concerned about the effects of the labeling requirements .
“ We hope that Governor Sebelius will veto HB 2121 which could create a financial hardship for the state ’s mid-sized and small dairy producers and retailers , and could raise barriers to interstate commerce , ” said Devrin Forte , Store Manager at Topeka Natural Foods .
Food & Water Watch and Center for Food Safety both have action alerts so you can tell Governor Sebelius that consumers have the right to know what ’s in the milk , and dairies have a right to tell them .

Implementations
Rakudo
As happens each month , Rakudo had another release in April , featuring ( among other new features ) typed hashes and arrays , lexical subroutines and multis , Perl 5 regexes , Unicode character names both in Regular expressions and double quote interpolations , Sockets and many bugfixes .
This is also the first release where Rakudo passed more than ten thousand spec tests ( mainly due to the regex improvements ) .
The Rakudo team is also proud to welcome the first new committer since Rakudo left Parrot 's nest : Cory Spencer contributed lots of patches to move built - in subs and methods to the setting ( ie the Perl 6 library holding built - ins ) , thus enabling for example the Trig export , so that you can now say use Num : Trig ; to import trigonometric functions .
SMOP
Paweł Murias spent much time bringing re-smop , the refactored version of SMOP , up and running .
He will implement multi methods for SMOP as a project for this year 's Summer of Code .
Summer of Code
I 'm glad to inform you that this year The Perl Foundation will mentor nine Perl related projects , four of which are somehow related to Perl 6 or Parrot : Paweł 's project as mentioned above , Hinrik " Literal " 's Enduser documentation for Perl 6 project , Kevin Tew 's prototype for an LLVM based JIT core in Parrot , and Daniel Arbelo will plug the libdecnum libraries for large decimal arithmetics into parrot ..
These all look like excellent proposals , and all of the students have already proved their hacking skills in some Perl or Parrot projects .
I wish them and us the best of luck .
Others
I probably missed this in my last summary , so here it comes :
There was a large discussion about a logo for Perl 6 and / or Rakudo .
Larry
Wall told us both what criteria a logo must fulfill , and what is initial proposal was .
So unless somebody comes up with an even better idea , it will be Camelia , a colourful female butterfly .
It also appears on perl6 - projects.org , which has gained a pleasing number of occasional contributers .
Beatitudes Christian Wallpapers –
The word Beatitude comes from the Latin beatus , meaning blessed .
The beatitudes are profound teachings from Jesus found in the Bible .
These teachings were very counter - cultural in the days of Jesus and are the same to this day , but in the economy of God , the characteristics shown by the people he described are beneficiaries of God ’s richest blessings .
Blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted .
Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth .
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .
Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God .
Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of God.
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ’ sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
– Matthew 5:3-10
1. Poor in Spirit : A deep recognition of one ’s total depravity and emptiness without God .
This person totally recognizes how unworthy they are of God ’s Grace .
2 . Those who Mourn : A person who recognize his / her sinful condition and mourns over it , this person is repentant and because of this , turns to the grace of God for forgiveness .
3 . The Meek :
This person recognizes the awesome power of God and are humbled at who He is and what he has done , they do not put confidence in themselves , they place total confidence in God .
4. Hunger and Thirst for Righteousness :
This person has a hunger for the things of God , his / her appetite for the things of God never fades away and they always desire to see the will of God displayed in their lives .
5 . The Merciful : This person realizes that God expects us to be merciful towards others and they practice the act of forgiveness , even to those who do not deserve it .
6 . The pure in Heart :
This person recognizes that he / she has an impure heart and is completely surrendered to Jesus and His ability to transform .
These people are free from evil desires and live a transformed life through the power of Jesus .
7 . The Peacemakers :
These people have a never - ending love for mankind and the creation of God and strive daily to encourage peace among their neighbors .
These people recognize that true peace comes from the result of Jesus ’ death on the cross .
8. Persecuted for righteousness :
These people are persecuted not because of the wicked things they have done , but quite the opposite , they suffer because they believe in Christ , the Bible , and the Church .
The Christian life is rejected by men with evil hearts and suffering comes as a result of our belief in Christ .
Jesus exalts those who go through such suffering and He tells of a great blessing that awaits such people in heaven .
Blessed are ye , when men shall revile you , and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
Mathew 5:11 - 12

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A habitually violent young man was convicted Wednesday of the murder of teenage actor Rob Knox , who had starred in the latest " Harry Potter " film .
The father , brother and mother of Rob Knox pose together after the death of the young actor .
Karl Bishop , 22 , attacked Knox and four friends with two kitchen knives outside a bar in Sidcup , south east London , last May .
He stabbed them 10 times in less than two minutes , the Old Bailey court in central London heard .
Knox , 18 , had rushed out of the bar after he heard that Bishop had threatened his younger brother Jamie but he ended up being stabbed five times , once in a main artery .
He died in hospital later that night .
Bystanders said Bishop 's face was " screwed up in rage " as he lashed out with the two knives , the Press Association reported .
Days before the attack , the actor had finished filming on " Harry Potter And The Half - Blood Prince , " due for international release in July , in which he played the role of Marcus Belby .
He was set to reprise the part in future " Harry Potter " films .
Knox 's father Colin told mourners at his funeral , including co-star Rupert Grint , that his son had been " living the dream , " PA said .
Prosecutor Brian Altman told the court that the young actor 's promising life was ended by a " habitual knife carrier " who believed stabbing people was an " occupational hazard " and had previous convictions for knife crime .
Bishop is due to be sentenced on Thursday .
Knife crime in Britain is a political hot topic due to a spate of recent killings of mainly young people in major cities .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has urged tougher sentences for those caught carrying knives .
He told the Daily Telegraph last month : " By carrying a knife you are not only endangering the lives of others , but you are more likely to be killed , or end up in jail .
" We need to change the way young people think about knives , we need families and communities working together ... to get this message across and help stamp out knife crime and get weapons off our streets . "
The actions of Obama 's Chief Financial Adviser Larry Summers and his Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner in permitting the payment of $ 165 million in bonuses to AIG executives ( Summers , according to the Wall Street Journal , actually pressed Sen.
Chris Dodd , D - CT , to secretly remove a bar to the payment of such bonuses from the bailout bill ) and the storm of public outrage that has followed public disclosure of those payments , provides President Obama , whose administration is stumbling badly on many fronts , to turn things around and avoid political disaster .
He should promptly demand Geithner 's and Summers ' resignations , and should also fire the CEO of AIG , Edward Liddy ( as 80 % owner of AIG , the US has the power to do that anytime ) .
It would also be a good idea at the same time to fire the CEOs of all the leading banks that are at this point surviving on government bailouts .
This would allow Obama to correct the fundamental mistake he made during the transition period following the November election in installing a bunch of Clinton - era economic advisors and Bush holdovers to be his economic team .
The US economy is in disastrous shape , and it is going to take new ideas , and people untarnished by the last 30 years of deregulatory excess and unsavory links to Wall Street , to rescue it .
Obama has no shortage of good people to turn to : Nobel economist and NY Times columnist Paul Krugman , former World Bank Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz and economist James Galbraith all spring immediately to mind as people who could offer new and better approaches to addressing both the immediate crisis and the longer - term challenge of restoring the health of the nation 's economy , and of making it work for everyone , instead of just the wealthy few .
Of course , it could be that Obama is really not interested in radically changing the US economy , and its financial system .
He has certainly accepted the tarnished coin of the Wall Street establishment during his campaign , and could simply be doing their bidding , but one has to operate on the hope that this is not the case .
After all , the Obama campaign also raised an unprecedented amount of cash from ordinary folks , and if money is influence , he owes those little people big time .
In any event , it seems clear that if this president who spoke during his campaign of " hope and change " continues to cater to the bankers and the corporate interests that want to see no major revamping of the economic system and the regulatory apparatus , he is headed for a one - term presidency -- and a sad and failed one at that .
The voters who sent Obama to Washington have been willing to extend him the benefit of the doubt , even when he made his almost uniformly lousy cabinet picks .
They were willing to grant that he had been handed a disastrous situation by the last administration .
But as each week passes , the disaster becomes less Bush 's and Cheney's , and more Obama's .

The same can be said of Obama 's other big crisis : the two endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Again , Obama has largely retained and accepted the advice of the same people who helped run these huge policy disasters during the Bush / Cheney years , and is buying the basic assumptions of those two wars .
He is most certainly not ending the Iraq conflict , and is now talking about leaving as many as 50,000 US troops in Iraq for years -- as many as were in Vietnam in the fall of 1965 .
He is reportedly talking about doubling the number of troops in Afghanistan to over 60,000 , and about expanding the war into Pakistan , and not just the tribal areas , but Baluchistan province , a heavily populated part of that country .
This latter decision , which could lead to an explosion in Pakistan , and the collapse of the central government , could lead to an huge demand for more US troops in the area -- perhaps hundreds of thousands more -- and even to India 's entry into the conflict .
This is as outrageous and doomed a strategy as is his economic program of trying to salvage the nation 's zombie banks while nickel - and - diming a " stimulus " program for ordinary people .
He should seize the moment , shitcan his corrupt and inept economic team and sack his military advisers , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his Centcom commander David Petraeus , and bring in people who will tell him how to get the US out of both conflicts pronto .
If he fires and replaces his economic and military teams , and announces both a quick end to the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars and the immediate break - up of the country 's big failed national banks and financial institutions , he has a chance to become a great president .
If he does not , it is as predictable as the rising of the seas that his presidency will be a failure .
We are nearing a point where the American public is going to lose patience with the half measures , the continuing pouring of national treasure down the twin sinkholes of the failed financial institutions and the two endless wars in the Middle East , and the tone - deaf behavior of cabinet secretaries and advisors who do n't have a clue about how average Americans are living these days .
This is President Obama 's moment for action .
Firing Geithner and Summers would be a good start .
Americans should make an effort to let President Obama know that they want more than token stimulus programs .
( Just consider this : official unemployment is now 8.1 percent , but only 4.5 % of American workers are able to collect unemployment benefits , and meanwhile , real unemployment is closer to 18 percent .
That 's a lot of hurt , and not a lot of help . )
A good idea would be to join a march on the Pentagon set for this Saturday , March 21 , ( http://natassembly.org/MarchOnPentagon.html) and a two - day program of demonstrations against Wall Street set for April 3 and 4 in New York City ( http://www.bailoutpeople.org/).
The ozone layer over the far northern hemisphere -- once relatively robust compared to the Antarctic concentrations -- would have developed a similar ozone hole by the 2020s if the Montreal Protocol had not limited ozone - depleting substances .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The year is 2065 .
Nearly two - thirds of Earth 's ozone is gone -- not just over the poles , but everywhere .
The infamous ozone hole over Antarctica , first discovered in the 1980s , is a year - round fixture , with a twin over the North Pole .
The ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation falling on mid-latitude cities like Washington , D.C. , is strong enough to cause sunburn in just five minutes .
DNA - mutating UV radiation is up 650 percent , with likely harmful effects on plants , animals and human skin cancer rates .
Such is the world we would have inherited if 193 nations had not agreed to ban ozone - depleting substances , according to atmospheric chemists at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , and the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency , Bilthoven .
Led by Goddard scientist Paul Newman , the team simulated " what might have been " if chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) and similar chemicals were not banned through the treaty known as the Montreal Protocol .
The simulation used a comprehensive model that included atmospheric chemical effects , wind changes , and radiation changes .
The analysis has been published online in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics .
Simulations of global ozone concentration show the real - world ozone layer ( left ) versus a " world avoided , " in which CFCs had never been banned .
Reds depict high concentration ; dark blues show low concentrations .
Note the seasonal pulse of ozone over the poles , how it declines to holes ( blue ) , then becomes global depletion by the 2050s .

" Ozone science and monitoring has improved over the past two decades , and we have moved to a phase where we need to be accountable , " said Newman , who is co-chair of the United Nations Environment Programme 's Scientific Assessment Panel to review the state of the ozone layer and the environmental impact of ozone regulation .
" We are at the point where we have to ask :
Were we right about ozone ?
Did the Montreal Protocol work ?
What kind of world was avoided by phasing out ozone - depleting substances ? "
Ozone is Earth 's natural sunscreen , absorbing and blocking most of the incoming UV radiation from the sun and protecting life from DNA - damaging radiation .
The gas is naturally created and replenished by a photochemical reaction in the upper atmosphere where UV rays break oxygen molecules ( O 2 ) into individual atoms that then recombine into three - part molecules ( O 3 ) .
As it is moved around the globe by upper level winds , ozone is slowly depleted by naturally occurring atmospheric gases .
It is a system in natural balance .
But chlorofluorocarbons -- invented in 1928 as refrigerants and as inert carriers for chemical sprays -- upset that balance .
Researchers discovered in the 1970s and 1980s that while CFCs are inert at Earth 's surface , they are quite reactive in the stratosphere ( 10 to 50 kilometers altitude , or 6 to 31 miles ) , where roughly 90 percent of the planet 's ozone accumulates .
UV radiation causes CFCs and similar bromine compounds in the stratosphere to break up into elemental chlorine and bromine that readily destroy ozone molecules .
Worst of all , such ozone depleting substances can reside for several decades in the stratosphere before breaking down .
In the 1980s , ozone - depleting substances opened a wintertime " hole " over Antarctica and opened the eyes of the world to the effects of human activity on the atmosphere .
By 1987 , the World Meteorological Organization and United Nations Environment Program had brought together scientists , diplomats , environmental advocates , governments , industry representatives , and non-governmental organizations to forge an agreement to phase out the chemicals .
In January 1989 , the Montreal Protocol went into force , the first - ever international agreement on regulation of chemical pollutants .
Annual average concentrations of global ozone are shown for the " World Avoided " ( solid black ) , a modeled future with ozone regulation ( red ) , atmospheric chlorine at a fixed amount ( green ) , and a simulation of past observations ( blue ) .
The inset shows how ozone concentrations decrease as the amount of chlorine in the atmosphere -- effective equivalent stratospheric chlorine ( EESC ) -- grows over time .

" The regulation of ozone depleting substances was based upon the evidence gathered by the science community and the consent of industry and government leaders , " Newman noted .
" The regulation pre-supposed that a lack of action would lead to severe ozone depletion , with consequent severe increases of solar UV radiation levels at the Earth 's surface . "
In the new analysis , Newman and colleagues " set out to predict ozone losses as if nothing had been done to stop them . "
Their " world avoided " simulation took months of computer time to process .
The team started with the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry - Climate Model ( GEOS - CCM ) , an earth system model of atmospheric circulation that accounts for variations in solar energy , atmospheric chemical reactions , temperature variations and winds , and other elements of global climate change .
For instance , the new model accounts for how changes in the stratosphere influence changes in the troposphere ( the air masses near Earth 's surface ) .
Ozone losses change the temperature in different parts of the atmosphere , and those changes promote or suppress chemical reactions .
The researchers then increased the emission of CFCs and similar compounds by 3 percent per year , a rate about half the growth rate for the early 1970s .
Then they let the simulated world evolve from 1975 to 2065 .
By the simulated year 2020 , 17 percent of all ozone is depleted globally , as assessed by a drop in Dobson Units ( DU ) , the unit of measurement used to quantify a given concentration of ozone .
An ozone hole starts to form each year over the Arctic , which was once a place of prodigious ozone levels .
By 2040 , global ozone concentrations fall below 220 DU , the same levels that currently comprise the " hole " over Antarctica .
( In 1974 , globally averaged ozone was 315 DU . )
The UV index in mid-latitude cities reaches 15 around noon on a clear summer day ( a UV index of 10 is considered extreme today . ) , giving a perceptible sunburn in about 10 minutes .
Over Antarctica , the ozone hole becomes a year - round fixture .
In the 2050s , something strange happens in the modeled world : Ozone levels in the stratosphere over the tropics collapse to near zero in a process similar to the one that creates the Antarctic ozone hole .
By the end of the model run in 2065 , global ozone drops to 110 DU , a 67 percent drop from the 1970s .
Year - round polar values hover between 50 and 100 DU ( down from 300 - 500 in 1960 ) .
The intensity of UV radiation at Earth 's surface doubles ; at certain shorter wavelengths , intensity rises by as much as 10,000 times .
Skin cancer - causing radiation soars .
" Our world avoided calculation goes a little beyond what I thought would happen , " said Goddard scientist and study co-author Richard Stolarski , who was among the pioneers of atmospheric ozone chemistry in the 1970s .
" The quantities may not be absolutely correct , but the basic results clearly indicate what could have happened to the atmosphere .
And models sometimes show you something you were n't expecting , like the precipitous drop in the tropics . "
" We simulated a world avoided , " said Newman , " and it 's a world we should be glad we avoided . "
The real world of CFC regulation has been somewhat kinder .
Production of ozone - depleting substances was mostly halted about 15 years ago , though their abundance is only beginning to decline because the chemicals can reside in the atmosphere for 50 to 100 years .
The peak abundance of CFCs in the atmosphere occurred around 2000 , and has decreased by roughly 4 percent to date .
Stratospheric ozone has been depleted by 5 to 6 percent at middle latitudes , but has somewhat rebounded in recent years .
The largest recorded Antarctic ozone hole was recorded in 2006 .
" I did n't think that the Montreal Protocol would work as well as it has , but I was pretty naive about the politics , " Stolarski added .
" The Montreal Protocol is a remarkable international agreement that should be studied by those involved with global warming and the attempts to reach international agreement on that topic . "

Twelve children have been killed in north - western Pakistan after playing with a bomb they mistook for a toy , local officials say .
The children died after the bomb , which resembled a football , exploded on Saturday in Lower Dir district of North West Frontier Province .
The children - seven boys and five girls - were between five and 13 years old , officials say .
They found the device outside a local school as they were going home .
Officials say an investigation is under way to determine how the children got hold of the bomb .
Low Dir is part of Malakand division in North West Frontier Province .
Taleban militants there have recently agreed a peace deal with the government .
In 1991 , when inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency were allowed back into Iraq  after United Nations forces ejected the Iraqi invaders from Kuwait and Saddam Hussein had agreed to comply with certain UN Security Council resolutions  they quickly discovered that Saddam had been in violation of the Iraqi IAEA Safeguards Agreement .
Whereupon the Security Council passed Resolution 687 , which among other things , ordered the destruction  under supervision of a specially constituted IAEA Action Team  of all remaining elements of Iraqs nuclear programs , and imposed sanctions on Iraq until such time as the IAEA Action Team could report that such destruction had been accomplished and that Iraq was once again in compliance with its IAEA Safeguards Agreement .
The IAEA Action Team made such a report , first in 1998 , and updated it in succeeding years .
In particular ,
" Iraq was at , or close to , the threshold of success in such areas as the production of HEU through the EMIS process , the production and pilot cascading of single - cylinder gas centrifuge machines , and the fabrication of the explosive package for a nuclear weapon . "
It s worth noting that the only Iraqi actions which violated the letter of their Safeguards Agreement would have been those that involved the chemical or physical transformation of certain materials proscribed by the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .
In fact , the actual fabrication of the explosive package for a nuclear weapon , even had it occurred , would have literally been none of the IAEAs business .
Now , the single - cylinder gas centrifuge machine the IAEA Action Team referred to was a third - generation composite - rotor machine that German engineer Karl Schaab and associates supplied them back in 1989 .
There is no evidence that the Iraqis ever got even one to work  despite hands - on assistance by Schaab , himself  much less introduced uranium - hexafluoride into it .
However , when the German authorities learned what Schaab had done , they prosecuted him for violating German export control laws .
Schaab plead guilty but was able to avoid serious jail - time because , among other things , gas centrifuge technology was , and is , " dual-use . "
Fast forward to October , 2003 , when a ship destined for Libya was intercepted and its apparently legal cargo of dual - use first - generation gas - centrifuge parts and components confiscated .
You re probably wondering what pirate was responsible for the apparently illegal search and seizure of a ship on the high seas .
Well , about a year earlier , after having accused Iran , Iraq and North Korea of being an " axis of evil , " and repeatedly accused them since of developing  right under the noses of IAEA inspectors  nuclear weapons , to give to " terrorists , " President Bush the Younger announced his National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction [ .pdf ] .
From it , Bush developed  in blatant disregard of existing international law  the Proliferation Security Initiative , announced shortly after his launch of a war of aggression  in blatant disregard of existing Security Council Resolutions and the UN Charter  against Iraq .
According to Bonkers Bolton , then our principal non-proliferation weenie , the PSI was necessary because “ proliferators and those facilitating the procurement of deadly capabilities are circumventing existing laws , treaties and controls against WMD proliferation . ”
Translation ?
What A.Q Khan and his recently " outed " network had been doing may not have been against the law , international or otherwise , but Bonkers was going to put a stop to it , even if it meant our violating the law , international or otherwise .
In the last century , Pakistan had asked  but was not allowed  to become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group .
Comprised of 44 nuclear - supplier states  including China , Russia , and the United States  NSG members voluntarily agree to coordinate their export controls governing transfers of civilian nuclear material and nuclear - related equipment and technology to non-nuclear - weapon states .
But , since 1992 , to be " eligible " for importing certain items from an NSG member , an importing state  irrespective of whether it is a NPT signatory or not  must have in place a comprehensive IAEA safeguards agreement covering all their nuclear activities and facilities .
So what were the Pakistanis to do ?
Well , establish their own clandestine  but not necessarily illegal  suppliers / users group .
When Pakistan held its first international arms bazaar in 2000 , there was even available at the booth of Khan Research Laboratories ( KRL ) a second - generation uranium - enrichment gas - centrifuge brochure , as well as an associated 10 - page catalog of specialty vacuum pumps , gauges , high - voltage switches , power supplies , and other equipment .
According to KRL representatives , all the listed items were available for sale and had been approved for export by the Pakistani government .
So , what did CIA - Director George Tenet judge to be his greatest accomplishment ?
“ Our spies penetrated the [ A.Q. Khan ] network through a series of daring operations over several years .
Through this unrelenting effort , we confirmed the network was delivering such things as illicit uranium enrichment centrifuges . ”
Illicit ?
Says who ?
No one .
Nevertheless , this shipment to Libya of Khans first - generation junk sure looked like a job for Bonkers Bolton and his PSI pirates .
How about Khans , better , second - generation stuff ?
The IAEA has been unable to find any indication that Iran or anyone else ever bought any of it .
And there is no reason to suppose that Schaab  with his third - generation stuff  was ever a part of A.Q. Khans " network . "
Nevertheless , not long after the PSI seizure of the Khan junk shipment to Libya , A.Q. Khan was placed under house arrest and made a " confession " on Pakistani TV , in English , now a matter of historical record .
Contrary to what youve heard , over and over , from the neo-crazy sycophantic media , Khan did not " confess " to supplying Iran , Libya and North Korea with anything , much less " weapons technology . "
In fact , A.Q. didnt even mention Iran , Libya or North Korea in his TV " confession . "
What he said was that he had been confronted with a number of allegations , that he had concluded that " some of them " were true , and that he accepted responsibility for them .
President Musharraf promptly pardoned A.Q Khan .
But , perhaps for his own protection against Tenets " spies , " he remained under house arrest . "
Bush the Younger is no longer President , Musharraf is no longer Dictator , Tenet is no longer CIA - Director and a Pakistani High Court has just effectively released A.Q. Khan from house arrest .
The United States has expressed " deep concern . "
" No Cussing Club " Will Publish Clean Edition of " Naked Lunch "
In an effort to " make literature fun again , " pint - sized social agitator McKay Hatch of the " No Cussing Club " has developed his own line of books and will be putting out " clean " editions of classics so that people " who do n't want to hear that junk " will still be able to enjoy seminal works of modern fiction .
Hatch became famous in 2007 for his music video calling for people who want to hang with his crowd to avoid cussing at all costs :
" If you want to be my peer , please respect my ear , " said Hatch .
" Do n't cuss .
" Hatch has been pushing for his own clean line of books since he was in junior high , but it took a recent rejection from Random House to make him realize that he was on his own when it came to voluntary , grass - roots censorship of incendiary novels .
" I went to Random House , and I said look , I have over 20,000 kids in my club worldwide who are tired of all the cursing , and swearing , and no no's , " said Hatch .
" Those kids are going to grow up , and someday they are going to need books for college .
What books are you going to sell them ?
" When Random House could n't close a deal with Hatch , he got out a black marker , went to the library , bought a scanner , and got an account with Amazon 's BookSurge program .
Hatch 's new line of books will carry the " No Cussing Club " label , and will attempt to create hip , fresh editions of classic books targeted to family - oriented markets .
They intend to change the language of books without changing the spirit .
Their inaugural project will be a clean edition of William Burrough 's " Naked Lunch . " From the original version : " Did I ever tell you about the man who taught his asshole to talk ?
His whole abdomen would move up and down you dig farting out the words .
It was unlike anything I ever heard .
" This ass talk had sort of a gut frequency .
It hit you right down there like you gotta go .
You know when the old colon gives you the elbow and it feels sorta cold inside , and you know all you have to do is turn loose ?
Well this talking hit you right down there , a bubbly , thick stagnant sound , a sound you could smell . " From Hatch 's new , clean version : " Did I ever tell you about the man who taught his parrot to talk ?
His whole parrot would move up and down you dig squawking out the words .
It was unlike anything I ever heard .
This parrot talk had sort of a gut frequency .
It hit you right down there like you gotta go .
You know when the old colon gives you the elbow and it feels sorta cold inside , and you know all you have to do is turn loose ?
Well this talking hit you right down there , a bubbly , thick stagnant sound , a sound you could smell .
" Hatch claims that by manipulating language to remove bad swears , you are truly able to live a better , happier , stronger life .
" I like books sometimes , but every time I read a swear I have to leave the room and leave the book behind , " said Hatch .
" I know there are other people out there like me , and with my line of books , we no longer have to be ignorant of classic literature and famous writers . "

Nicknaming it the Devil , Koenigseder was able to give this Carrera a nice aggressive look with a new body kit .
The kit you see here is a completely unique body kit that transforms this Porsche , starting with new bumpers all around , and ending with air intakes coming from the roof .
It is still a Porsche Carrera GT under all the exterior mods , and it still holds its performance numbers under the hood .
But if you look at the fancy additions to the exterior , you can tell this kit from Koenigseder does n’t come cheap , and we have the prices for you .
The front bumper , similar to the Lamborghini in my opinion , will cost you 8,040 euros and that ’s not a typo on our part !
The rear bumper just as expensive at 5,400 euros and the side skirts are even more at 6,000 euros for the pair .
However if you can afford a Porsche Carrera GT , I doubt handing over an extra 10,800 euros for the rear wing , and roof air intakes would n’t break the bank .
Adding it all up , and if you choose the interior package as well ( 1,800 euros ) the total is 32,040 euros .
That ’s not too bad I ’d say , considering it ’s a Porsche Carrera GT that looks eligible for Formula 1 .
Some 40,000 troops are battling the drug gangs nationwide
Two undercover Mexican agents have been killed , apparently by hit - men working for the country 's most wanted man , local media reports say .
The agents ' bodies were found bound and blindfolded in Durango state , said to be the hiding place of alleged drug cartel head Joaquin " El Chapo " Guzman .
" Neither priests nor rulers will ever get El Chapo , " read a chilling note left with the corpses .
The Mexican government has denied it knows where the fugitive Mr Guzman is .
But the note 's reference to " priests " is seen as a reference to the Archbishop of Durango .
He caused a major stir , says the BBC's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City , by declaring two days ago that " everybody knows " that Mr Guzman - who escaped from a maximum security jail in 2001 - was living in the state .
The note may represent a major change in the drugs war in Mexico which has seen 8,000 people killed in the past two years as drug gangs fight for territory amid government crackdowns .
It was thought that there were two institutions that Mexican drug traffickers would rather not confront - the army and the church , our correspondent says .
Now it seems that nothing is off limits , he adds .
Last month , Mexico 's attorney general offered a reward of $ 2 m ( £ 1.37 m ) to informers who help arrest any of the country 's 24 most - wanted drug gang chiefs .

If youâ€™re an alternative energy advocate seeking for ways to green your living and you happen to live by a river or creek , you might be in luck .
We all know energy is generated by building dams over giant underwater turbines , but this technology doesnâ€™t have to be built on such large scales .
Micro hydro generators use modest water flows to generate electricity , and they trump solar and wind power in reliability because water runs day and night , independent of weather situations .
Letâ€™s take a look at a typical hydroelectric power plant to better understand how this technology works …
How It Works
Water is a heavy medium that moves quickly .
Similar to a car , which has similar properties , it takes a lot of energy to get water flowing .
Anyone who has ever stood by a waterfall or gone swimming in the ocean can vouch for the power of water flow .
In a hydroelectric power plant , engineers use the energy stored in running water to generate electricity .
Today , hydroelectric power is the most widely used renewable energy source .
It accounts for approximately 16 % of worldwide electricity production , far outweighing the contributions of solar , wind , and geothermal combined .
The most prominent feature of a hydroelectric plant is the dam .
Large dams are immense structures , sometimes hundreds of meters high , which can hold back several cubic miles of water .
Since water is the source of energy for a hydro plant , the dam is important for storing and controlling the flow of energy .
Once the dam is constructed , underwater gates are opened to regulate flow through an underwater turbine .
The pressure of the water pushes on the turbine blades , causing the turbine to spin a shaft that is connected to a generator .
Spinning magnets and coils in the generator produce current that is directed through a transformer and out to the grid , where it is used by you and me .
For residential generation , you probably wonâ€™t be blocking off a river or storing a cubic mile of water .
Instead , a typical residential generator uses a pipe to collect water from a stream or river .
The water gains energy by flowing downhill and is passed through a turbine that is connected to the end of the pipe .
The type of turbine you will need depends on the type of flow available on your property .
Go with the Flow : Calculating Water Flow
There are two numbers that measure the amount of energy available in your water supply : flow and head .
Before installing a hydropower generator for your house , you will have to determine both of these numbers .
Most hydroelectric installers will help you to estimate these values , but letâ€™s take a look at them to get the general idea .
Flow means just what you think it meansâ € ” the amount of water that you have available to turn your water wheel or turbine .
The more flow , the more energy you can produce .
In terms of a micro hydro generator , it will be the amount of water running down the pipe to your turbine .
In one second , how many cubic feet of water can you safely divert from your stream to turn a turbine ?
To put things into perspective , for a residential application ( which typically requires a few kilowatts of electricity ) :
a few cubic feet of flow per second is considered an ample flow rate
a number below 0.1 cubic feet is considered low
Low flow rates can still be used to generate electricity , as long as your water source has enough head .
Remember to consider seasonal changes in water level when estimating flow .
Head refers to the pressure of the water that strikes your turbine blades .
To understand the importance , imagine a high - pressure fire hose spraying a water wheel .
Clearly , the pressure of the fire hose would deliver more energy to the wheel than a typical garden hose .
In order to determine your head , you will need to estimate the distance water will fall before reaching your turbine .
The farther the water falls , the more energy you can produce with your water source .
Christopher McDougall , author of the forthcoming Born to Run , excerpts a section of his book that suggests costly , tech - term - laden training shoes are n't helping runners all that much — and they may actually be hurting .

McDougall draws from sports science , evolutionary study , and evidence from coaches and running teams that shoes with top - of - the - line " support , " " impact resistance , " and other features have actually resulted in more injuries for runners than using cheap , low - tech sneakers .
There 's actually an argument made for running barefoot as , McDougall argues , the human body was designed for .

Dr Daniel Lieberman , professor of biological anthropology at Harvard University , has been studying the growing injury crisis in the developed world for some time and has come to a startling conclusion : ' A lot of foot and knee injuries currently plaguing us are caused by people running with shoes that actually make our feet weak , cause us to over - pronate ( ankle rotation ) and give us knee problems .
' Until 1972 , when the modern athletic shoe was invented , people ran in very thin - soled shoes , had strong feet and had a much lower incidence of knee injuries . '
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
Do n't go tossing out your sneaks just yet , though — any doctor will tell you that a sudden change in footwear will almost certainly cause pain and injury .
Seeing as how most of us have been running with modern sneakers since we could really run , barefoot or thin leather soles are n't going to cut it .
But keep the injury evidence in mind next time you feel obligated to pay top dollars for something you 're born to do anyways .
The painful truth about trainers :
Are expensive running shoes a waste of money ?

The government cannot dispose of a civil suit accusing a Boeing subsidiary of helping the CIA transport prisoners for torture by claiming the whole program was a national secret , a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday .
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling chips away at the Obama and Bush administrations ' reliance on the so - called " state secrets privilege " to dismiss inconvenient lawsuits that target secret and extra-judicial anti-terrorism programs started after 9/11 .
The lawsuit alleges that flight support contractor Jeppesen Dataplan helped the CIA fly five non-U.S. citizens to foreign countries whose governments tortured and imprisoned the men , a legally dubious program known within the U.S. government as " extraordinary rendition " .
A three - judge panel rejected the government 's theory that its secret programs could never be challenged in court .
" According to the government 's theory , the Judiciary should effectively cordon off all secret government actions from judicial scrutiny , immunizing the CIA and its partners from the demands and limits of the law , " judge Michael Daly Hawkins wrote dismissively ( .pdf ) .
" The subject matter of this action ... is not a state secret , and the case should not have been dismissed at the outset . "
The court held that the government could n't tell a court to throw out the suit just because a secret program was at issue .
Instead , the judges said , the government has to wait to invoke the state secrets privilege until the plaintiffs ask the government , or in this case , its alleged contractor , to turn over evidence .
" The question is not which facts are secret and may not be alleged and put to the jury ’s consideration for a verdict ; it is only which evidence is secret and may not be disclosed in the course of a public trial , " Hawkins continued .
The decision reverses a district court 's dismissal , sending the case , Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan , back down to the lower court .
The Constitution Project , a D.C. - based thinktank that has been following the case closely , applauded the ruling .
" The Ninth Circuit 's decision recognizes that the state secrets privilege is not an immunity doctrine that can enable the Executive Branch to shield its conduct from any judicial review , " said Constitution Project Senior Counsel Sharon Bradford Franklin .
" We are thrilled that the decision preserves the role of the courts as an independent check on the executive branch 's conduct . "
The court did not give the plaintiffs the right to see highly classified evidence held by the government or Jeppesen , but allows the individuals to prove their standing using facts that are already known , or uncovered outside of the tradtional legal process of discovery .
That squares with the appeals court 's 2007 ruling in the Al Haramain case that allowed two U.S. lawyers to continue suing the government for allegedly spying on them without warrants .
That ruling , relied on in this case , banned them from using a top secret document the government accidentally turned over to them as a way to prove they were spied on .
But the court 's 2007 decision bucked the government 's contention that the whole lawsuit had to be thrown out since it could expose information about its warrantless wiretapping program that could put the nation at risk .
Instead the court ruled that the suit could continue if the two could prove – using only evidence that was n't secret - that they were likely targets of such a program .
Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller says the government was reviewing Tuesday 's court decision and had no comment on whether the government would appeal for a rehearing by a full set of appeals court judges or to the Supreme Court .

Two different trials could be thrown out after jurors allegedly discussed the cases on social networking sites .
One involves a $ 12 million civil trial and the other a five - month - long corruption charge .
In one case , the jury decided construction company Stoam Holdings should pay $ 12.6 million compensation to a rival .
But lawyers for the firm have complained that juror Johnathan Powell 's Twitter comments broke rules when discussing the civil case with the public .
U.S. courts usually allow jurors to discuss how they reached a verdict after the case .
However , there are still strict rules against talking about any case as it happens .
Timeline In Question
The arguments in this dispute centre on two points .
Powell insists ( and the evidence appears to back him up ) that he did not make any pertinent updates until after the verdict was given ; if that 's the case , the objection would presumably be thrown out .
( Source : twitter.com )
If Powell did post updates during the trial , the judge must decide whether he was actively discussing the case .
Powell says he only posted messages and did not read any replies .
Intriguingly , the lawyers for Stoam Holding are not arguing so much that other people directly influenced Powell 's judgment , rather that he might have felt a need to agree to a spectacular verdict to impress the people reading his posts .

Juror Promises Big Announcement
In a separate incident , defense lawyers for former Pennsylvania state Senator Vincent Fumo say his ongoing corruption trial has been tainted by a juror who posted about the case on both Facebook and Twitter .
In this case , the trial is so complex that the jury had been deliberating for five days when the defense made its complaint .
It has pointed to several posts the juror made during the deliberation process , including one reading " Stay tuned for a big announcement on Monday everyone ! "
In this case too , the problem appears not to be that the juror revealed any confidential information , but rather that they may have been influenced by feedback to their posts .

( CNN ) --
Two pirates in Somalia vowed revenge Monday , after the U.S. military killed three pirates and freed a U.S. ship captain who had been held hostage for several days .
Crew members of the Maersk Alabama celebrate after hearing the Navy had rescued their captain from pirates .
The pirates told a Somali journalist that they were angered by the U.S. action , as well as a French raid Friday that killed two pirates and one hostage and freed four hostages .
" We have decided to kill U.S. and French sailors if they happen to be among our future hostages , " said Abdullahi Ahmed , a member of a pirate group based at Harardhere , a coastal town in central Somalia .
President Obama said Monday the United States will confront pirates and hold them " accountable for their crimes . "
Obama added that he is proud of the military 's actions in rescuing Capt .
Richard Phillips from his pirate captors .
Members of the U.S. Navy shot and killed three pirates who had been holding Phillips hostage in a lifeboat on Sunday evening , a military official said .
The pirates seized Phillips after a failed attempt to hijack his ship , the Maersk Alabama .
For five days the pirates held Phillips in the lifeboat as U.S. Navy ships closed in and lingered nearby .
On Sunday , U.S. Navy snipers opened fire on the lifeboat after seeing one pirate point an AK - 47 at the captain 's back , the U.S. military said .
The shootings occurred as one pirate was aboard the USS Bainbridge negotiating over Phillips ' fate .

Three pirates in the lifeboat were killed .
Phillips was not hurt .
He was taken to another U.S. Navy vessel , the U.S. military said , where he received a medical checkup and spoke by phone with his wife in the United States .
Watch admiral tell how rescue went down »
Pirates in Somalia identified the slain men as Mohamed Ahmed Adawe , Nur Dalabey and Khalif Guled .
Two of them -- Dalabey and Guled -- were among the " most experienced men " in a group that has hijacked seagoing vessels for money , Ahmed said .
They were killed two days after the French military freed four hostages , including a child , who had been held by pirates for nearly a week on the yacht , Tanit , off Somalia 's coast .
In that operation , a hostage and two pirates were killed , the French Defense Ministry said , while three pirates were captured .

The military actions angered Ali Nur , a pirate who is based in Gara'ad , a coastal village in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland , in northern Somalia .
" From now on , after the killings by the U.S. and France , we will add some harsher steps in our dealings with hostages , particularly American and French hostages , " Nur told a journalist .
The U.S. military acknowledged Sunday that its actions to rescue Phillips could increase the risk of violence .
" This could escalate violence in this part of the world .
No question about it , " U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney told reporters .
Nur issued a warning to the United States .
" The killing of our boys was aggression , and the U.S. will see what they get from their operation , " he said .

A few hours ago The Pirate Bay website started to slow down , and eventually it became completely unresponsive .
With the trial going on at the moment , the downtime instantly led to all kinds of rumors .
However , there is nothing to worry about , the downtime is not related to the trial and people are on their way to bring the site back up .
At the moment there is no estimate for when the site will return .
The problem ca n’t be fixed remotely we were told .
However , people are on their way to the ‘ secret ’ location where the Pirate Bay hardware is located to find out what the problem is .
It ’s not a DDoS attack as some suggested .
When we receive additional information we ’ll post an update here .
The Pirate Bay ’s trackers are still up so all the torrents that are downloaded already should work just fine .
For those who are interested in the trial coverage , a summary of the events of day 10 was posted earlier today .
One ca n’t help but think that if The Pirate Bay was a traditional business making lots of profits as the Prosecution in the case would have everyone believe , the site would n’t suffer anywhere near the amount of downtime it does .
Of course , a torrent site that is fully operational all of the time would be no fun at all .
Everyone knows that absence makes the heart grow fonder ….
Update :
The problem was fixed this morning .
NAACP says bank giants steered blacks to bad loans Associated Press
Published : Friday March 13 , 2009

The NAACP is accusing Wells Fargo and HSBC of forcing blacks into subprime mortgages while whites with identical qualifications got lower rates .
Class - action lawsuits were to be filed against the banks Friday in federal court in Los Angeles , Austin Tighe , co-lead counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , told The Associated Press .
Black homebuyers have been 3 1/2 times more likely to receive a subprime loan than white borrowers , and six times more likely to get a subprime rate when refinancing , Tighe said .
Blacks still were disproportionately steered into subprime loans when their credit scores , income and down payment were equal to those of white homebuyers , he said .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Despite dire warnings of water shortages due to prolonged drought , the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday rejected a plan to ration water in the nation ’s second - largest city for the first time in 18 years .
The unanimous 15 - 0 vote against the plan marked a surprise setback for Los Angeles water managers , who like their peers in cities throughout California were directed to cut water use 20 percent this year under a drought emergency proclaimed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
But David Nahai , general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , the nation ’s biggest municipal utility , insisted that the proposal was not dead .
“ The city must cut back its water use .
There are no two ways about that , ” Nahai told Reuters after the vote .
He said the council ’s rejection stemmed not from disagreement over a need for mandatory conservation measures but from questions about how the plan would work and whether it amounted to a rate hike rather than a rationing scheme .
For procedural reasons , he said , the council had no choice but to disapprove the measure for now in order to buy more time to review the matter .
As adopted by the LADWP and endorsed by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , the plan calls for homes and businesses to pay a penalty rate -- nearly double normal prices -- for any water they used in excess of a reduced monthly allowance .
But Nahai insisted the measure was “ revenue neutral , ” designed entirely to encourage conservation .
The only other time such penalty pricing was imposed in Los Angeles was a year - long rationing system instituted in March 1991 , at the height of California ’s last statewide drought .
The current dry spell , now in its third year , is considered the worst to hit the state since the 1970s .
The Los Angeles rationing plan was to have taken effect by June 1 barring City Council action to block it .
Nahai said he hoped to gain council support for the measure after taking more time to explain the measure to the public .
A spokesman for the mayor , Matt Szabo , said the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California , which supplies 70 percent of the city ’s water , would impose rationing on Los Angeles if the city fails to take action itself .
Balance is challenging to achieve in a cantilever chair because it has no back legs .
So the materials in the rest of the chair have to be able to support the weight of the user by their related balance and strength .
The architectural and design challenges that University of Belgrade design student Uros Vitas took on were well rewarded by the results .
He created the first roll - up cantilever chair that achieves strength , balance and flexibility .
The Miesrolo Chair is handcrafted of meticulously carved wood strategically spaced on a synthetic elastomer to achieve its features .
In the end , what you have is an elegantly designed , sturdy , and sustainable chair that can also respond to utilitarian needs for space and portability .

The " Panic of 08 " will be followed by " The Collapse of 09 . "
In 2008 , when the worlds largest financial firms and equity markets crumbled , Wall Streets woes preoccupied the media .
In 2009 , the focus will broaden to include a range of calamities that will leave no sector unscathed .
Next in line is retail , which accounts for some 70 percent of consumer spending , 26 percent of which is holiday sales .
After the numbers are tallied to reveal a dismal retail Christmas , more big chain bankruptcies will follow .
Besides leaving masses unemployed , defunct retailers will leave behind thousands of empty stores .
Who will rent them ?
Nobody !
Add to these empties commercial space vacated by defunct financial firms and an array of troubled businesses , from restaurants to architectural firms , to high - tech operations , to offset printers , etc. , etc .
The inescapable result ( that we predicted over a year ago and is only now being discussed in the business media ) is a commercial real estate bust that will be costlier , wreak greater havoc and prove more intractable than the residential market decline .
Because most people dont live and shop on Wall Street , the " Panic of 08 " was viewed by Main Street as if from afar  even though many were losing money .
But when commercial real estate crashes , it will hit much closer to home .
The depressive atmosphere of thinly shopped , half - vacant malls will strike emotional chords and all the senses .
In office buildings , vacant floors and empty cubicles will dampen the workday spirit of the still - employed ; ever - present reminders of laid - off friends and colleagues and of the fragility of employment .
Abandoned , untended business and industrial parks will highlight the already mournful scene .
In cities studded with soaring towers and new construction predicated on eternal economic growth , streets lined with " For Rent / For Sale " signs will complement stilled cranes and uncompleted buildings .
As retail and commercial real estate collapse , the credit card sector and all its interrelated processing and back office support businesses will suffer and be forced to scale back .
Hordes of consumers who have been living off credit cards and racking up debt to the limit will lack the funds to service their debt much less pay it off , and they will be forced to default .
Given the nearly $ 3 trillion in consumer debt at risk ( excluding auto and mortgage ) an inevitable default snowball will add momentum to the in - progress Collapse of 09 .
While we alone predicted the " Panic of 08 " ( and even took out the domain name " Panicof08.com " on 7 November 2007 ) , we are not alone in predicting a Depression .
The " D " word is being uttered  in some cases by those who have the most to lose and whose best interests are not served by spreading gloom and doom .
" The world and country are in a depression , " said celebrity tycoon Donald Trump .
He then later softened the blow , downgrading it to a " virtual depression . "
" Virtual " to the few who will never have to worry where the next dollar will come from , it will be painfully real and hardly virtual to the multitudes who are and will be worrying .
The virally proliferating Greatest Depression is the Trend of Trends for 2009 .
Even so , beware !
Over the course of free - falling 2009 , the word from most official sources will be " recession , " and from the few mainstream trophy pessimists , " deep recession . "
For example , the oft - quoted naysayer , Nouriel Roubini , New York University professor of economics , forecasts a two - year recession not Depression .
On the sunnier side of Wall Street , the Federal Reserve predicts the US economy will contract only through the middle of 2009 and pledged , " In any event , the Committee agreed to take whatever steps were necessary to support the recovery . "
What " steps " ?
The Bernanke Two - Step ?
Adjust interest rates or print more money ?
Neither stopped the credit crisis from worsening , the real estate market from tanking or the stock markets from crashing .
It was Fed finagling , Washington deregulation and Wall Streets compulsive gambling that created the crisis .
To trust or to seriously consider pronouncements , analyses and predictions made by any of these sources is an exercise in willful self - deception .
Yet , with pensions , IRAs , 401 ks , stocks and mutual funds evaporating , many of those most affected deny reality and take hope that forecasts made by proven incompetents will miraculously restore their losses .
Throughout the many years leading up to what we term the " Greatest Depression , " The Trends Research Institute provided copious data and Globalnomic analysis to support our forecasts of economic upheaval .
In the past year alone , we have provided so much hard evidence ( housings starts , home sales , foreclosures , bankruptcies , bank failures , unemployment figures , stock indices , leading economic indicators , retail sales , etc. ) that further elaboration should be superfluous .
Those waiting to hear the " D " word from economic experts , talking heads and TV anchors before taking action will most certainly regret their indecisiveness .
Absent from the economic scenarios ranging from second quarter recovery , deep recession and " virtual " depression are the multiplicity of social , environmental , health , political , emotional / psychological and geopolitical factors that point beyond just Depression .
They point to The Decline and Fall of Empire America .
Well before Inauguration Day , Barack Obama was cast as the next Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
If he follows in FDRs footsteps , he could freeze deposits by declaring a " holiday " to stop a run on the banks .
While FDIC insurance may cover deposits , even after banks reopen , withdrawal amounts may be restricted .
( As the Argentine government did in 2001 2002 . )
Authors Note : Suspicious of the soundness of the banking system , I requested to withdraw a substantial sum from our Key Bank account , leaving funds sufficient to cover ongoing business operations .
First they tried to dissuade me , then they stonewalled me , and finally they turned openly hostile .
I was forced to sign a series of documents , including one acknowledging that since I was carrying a large sum , I could be the target of a robbery .
To enhance that possibility , the teller slammed down the bag of cash on the counter and publicly announced the sum .
Despite repeated requests in the days preceding my withdrawal to get the cash in hundreds , they gave it to me in twenties , making for a bag five times the size and more robber - friendly .
When I complained to the bank manager who had processed the request , the response amounted to " take it or leave it . "
This will not be an isolated event .
If you attempt to withdraw a large chunk of money from your account , negotiate the details in advance and anticipate possible hassle and obstruction .
Weve heard similar accounts from clients and Trends Journal subscribers who , over the past several months , tried to close out mutual funds , 401ks and assorted sinking equities .
They were dissuaded , cajoled , belittled and arm - twisted by brokers desperate to keep their accounts .
Many caved in under the pressure , didnt close them and lost most of what they had .
So , we leave you with a Greatest Depression consideration :
How safe is your money ?
How sound is your bank ?
At the end of November , Citigroup , once Americas largest bank , was on the rocks .
Fifty - two thousand employees were laid off .
In just three days , its stock lost more than half its value .
Rumors swirled that Citi was so desperate they were looking to sell or split up the company .
Is your money deposited in a local bank whose reputation you can bank on ?
Are you with a teetering giant or a poorly - managed regional ?
If either of the latter , it would be in your best interest to assess the risks .
Take some out if you think there is risk ; take it all out if you think theres high risk .
You may consider spreading it around and even banking abroad after all , this is the Global Age .

Bikini Clad Bar Refaeli Painted On A Southwest Airlines 737 ( Photos )
is all over the news this week .
Unless you 've been living under a rock , you know that she was chosen to grace the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue 2009 .
Another perk is that Bar 's bikini clad likeness will temporarily wrap the sides of a particular Southwest Airlines 737 for the next month .
Dubbed the SI One 737 , the Southwestern Airlines narrow bodied jet airliner sat on the tarmac at LaGuardia yesterday while photographers took advantage of the photo op with the hot Israeli model .
They even captured photos of the gorgeous on again , off again girlfriend of Leonardo DiCaprio while she held up the SI swimsuit issue , which was hot off the presses .
The day did n't end here .
Bar went on to the SI Swimsuit Launch Party which was attended by all of the swimsuit models and then headed over the guest on The David Letterman Show .

Fresh from signing the $ 787 billion American Reinvestment and Recovery Act , President Obama presented his proposed fiscal year 2010 budget before a joint session of Congress .
Outdoing even the profligate George W. Bush , at whose door he laid blame for the era of profound irresponsibility  he has inherited , the new president has requested a whopping 8 percent increase in discretionary federal spending over 2009 .
Hard - pressed Americans , who will foot the bill , can only dream about such a large raise .
Adding up the change you can believe in requires a calculator that can handle numbers followed by up to twelve zeros .
The $ 3.6 trillion President Obama wants the federal government to spend next fiscal year exceeds forecasted revenues by nearly $ 1.2 trillion .
Possibly having channeled Ronald Reagan , the rosy scenario adopted by President Obama to help hit his own deficit - reduction targets is that the economy will rebound strongly in 2010 and 2011 .
No one outside the White House believes that the robust growth necessary to produce significant increases in federal tax receipts as well as significant reductions in recession - related spending will return nigh that soon .
More than half of the $ 2 trillion deficit reduction the administration anticipates pulling off comes from money that will be saved by withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq over the next 19 months .
These savings are based not on actual reductions in budget outlays , but on the assumption that war spending would have continued at current levels ( roughly $ 130 billion per year ) for the next decade .
The remainder consists of substantial increases in taxes , targeting , among others , the top 2 percent of income earners , who already pay 62 percent of the total federal income taxes collected from individuals , and who will see the limits on their allowable deductions including mortgage interest payments and charitable contributions become tighter .
But hoped - for deficit reduction is just the tip of the presidents budget plan .
It contemplates a far - greater governmental role in the economy .
Student loans will be federalized .
The goal of establishing a national health insurance system gets a $ 630 billion down payment . 
Tens of billions of dollars more will be invested  in the ever - elusive quest for commercially viable alternatives to fossil fuels .
And $ 250 billion is earmarked for more bailouts of banks , insurance companies , and other private sector corporations deemed too big to fail . 
When the books are closed out for 2009 , the federal deficit is expected to be $ 1.75 trillion , setting a record for a one - time increase in the nations debt .
The red ink in this fiscal years budget stands at 12.3 percent of GDP , higher than at any point since 1942 , when America was ratcheting - up spending for the Second World War .
And GDP is shrinking at alarming rates .
Higher taxes and the continuation of the spending spree ignited by President Bush will only accelerate that trend .
The spectacle of Speaker Pelosi leaping to her feet and applauding at almost every pause in President Obamas address ought to tell you where were headed : not to prosperity , but to a simulacrum of France .
Technology.am ( Apr. 24 , 2009 ) — Michigan University chemists created a zinc - oxide crystal riddled with tiny pores that has the highest surface area of any material in the world .
The one - thirtieth of an ounce of the zinc - oxide crystal has enough surface area to cover an entire football field .
This labyrinthine material could eventually store hydrogen for cars or pull carbon dioxide out of the air , said Adam Matzger , the University of Michigan chemist who created the material . ”
Each pore is tiny , only a nanometer or two in size , just large enough for two hydrogen atoms , bonded to each other , to slip into a pore and bounce around like a rubber ball .
The secret is in the bounce .
It ’s not instantaneous .
Each time a hydrogen molecule hits the wall the hydrogen sticks for a fraction of a second , the product of what ’s known as the London dispersion force .
Hydrogen molecules are almost electrically neutral , with two negatively charged electrons flying around two positively charged protons .
However , sometimes both electrons end up on the same side of the molecule , giving the first lightest element a slight electrical charge , just enough for the gas to stick to the wall for a slice of a second .
Then the electrons zoom away , and the hydrogen molecule bounces away .
Today , hydrogen is stored at very high pressures , very low temperatures , which take very much energy .
In fact , it requires much more energy than the hydrogen itself has and that ’s why hydrogen - based cars are n’t feasible today .
The new material makes a hydrogen economy more feasible than it was before .
Even with the new material , the hydrogen gas has to be stored at about - 195 degrees C .
Fortunately , the porous crystals are easy to create .
Dumping white zinc salts into an environmentally - friendly solvent and drying the resulting crystals with a vacuum is all to create the pore - filled crystals .
Malware able to infect only right handed people
I ’m not kidding , the title is right .
Among all the windows settings there ’s one made for left handed people .
The option I ’m referring to is located under the Mouse control panel , labelled “ Switch primary and secondary buttons ” .
It lets you exchange the functions performed by the right and left mouse button .
Do n’t know if this setting is usefull or not , most of the left handed friends I have are still using the mouse like a right handed .
Maybe they do n’t even know the existence of such an option .
Anyway , look at this code :
It ’s a simple query on a registry key named SwapMouseButtons .
result_value is sent back to the caller , and the caller checks the value .
If the value is equal to 0x30 ( right handed ) the malware goes on running the rest of the code , but if the value is 0x31 ( left handed ) the malware ends immediately .
All the nasty things performed by the malware are executed after this check , it means that a left handed wo n’t get infected !
I ’ve seen some malwares using SwapMouseButton function in the past , but never something like that .
I bet the author is left handed and he wrote the check just to be sure to avoid a possible infection …
I ca n’t think of anything else .
Quite funny !!!
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Shunning the gem - studded pistols and gold chains flaunted by their fathers , a savvy new generation of drug smugglers is moving up the ranks of Mexico ’s cartels wielding college degrees and keeping low profiles to outsmart police .
Suspected Mexican drug trafficker Vicente Zambada is presented to the media in Mexico City March 19 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Daniel Aguilar
The fashionably - dressed sons of two prominent drug bosses were recently arrested in smart Mexico City neighborhoods , suspected of laundering money for the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels while moving seamlessly among the country ’s elite .
They typify a new wave of leaders of Mexico ’s warring drug cartels , whose turf wars killed 6,300 people last year .
Often the urbane offspring of cartel founders , they bring a clean - cut management style to the murky multibillion dollar enterprise .
“ These people are usually better prepared , better educated and very useful for the cartels because they ’re professionals , ” said political analyst Jorge Chabat .
“ They ’re harder to identify because they do n’t look like typical drug traffickers , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t detect them by saying ‘ Oh look , he has a big truck with wide tires and automatic weapons , gold chains , snakeskin boots and a big belt buckle and dark glasses . ’ ”
President Felipe Calderon has put dozens of top traffickers behind bars , along with thousands of low - level hitmen and drug runners , in an army - led war on cartels that has Washington worried about a possible spillover of violence .
For years the classic image of a Mexican drug baron has been of a macho gunslinger who revels in an ostentatious lifestyle of bad taste .
But that may be changing .
Vicente Carrillo Leyva , the suave 32 - year - old son of legendary drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes , was nabbed last week while jogging in a park near his house in the capital ’s most exclusive district and paraded in front of news cameras in a slick white Abercrombie & Fitch sweatsuit and trendy specs .
His late father was known as the “ Lord of the Skies ” for flying jets full of cocaine to the United States in the 1990s .
A high - living patriarch , when he died he was building himself an extravagant four - level palace in the Mexican border city of Nogales with soaring white domes and a 12 - foot exterior wall .
Carrillo Leyva , nicknamed “ The Engineer ” , grew up among a wealthy elite , was educated abroad and enjoyed frequent trips to Europe .
He reportedly speaks English and French well and had invested in a high - end boutique selling Versace clothes .
Neighbors said he lived a low - profile life .
“ No parties , no noise ; these neighbors were very discreet .
The young man went out running in the morning and his wife was very nice , ” a local resident told El Universal newspaper .
FAR FROM THE DIRTY WORK
Also captured this month , Vicente Zambada , 33 , the son of Sinaloa cartel boss Ismael “ El Mayo ” Zambada , lived a little larger , with luxury cars and five armed body guards .
But in his toned - down outfit of jeans , pressed shirt and jacket , he was undistinguishable from the young professionals who crowd Mexico ’s upscale bars and restaurants .
“ The older guys , their fathers , lived on the border and they often did the rough work of smuggling drugs and exterminating enemies , ” said Tony Payan , a drug trade expert at the University of Texas in El Paso .
“ These younger guys found it very comfortable to just move into the more financial part of the organization to try to legitimize the business , ” he said .
Young drug gangsters dubbed ‘ narco - juniors ’ first appeared in the 1990s , when the Arellano Felix clan in Tijuana recruited their sons and daughters and affluent friends to run drugs and carry out killings .
Zambada and Carrillo Leyva , more educated and refined , went straight to leadership roles .
The new style does not mean the young drug barons are less ruthless or protected from the violence .
Heavily armed gunmen killed the son of Joaquin “ Shorty ” Guzman , Mexico ’s most - wanted man , outside a shopping mall last year .
While they may not kill rivals themselves , they will order hits to stay ahead and are respected within the organizations , analysts say .
The new generation poses a challenge to Mexico ’s ill - equipped , badly paid and often poorly educated police , since sophisticated intelligence is needed to catch them .
“ They are paying a lot of attention to developing their top brass , ” said Mexican security expert Alberto Islas .
“ We are not out - gunning them and we are not out - smarting them .
I think that ’s why we are losing this war . ”
University of Hawaii students have been verbally and emotionally harassed by an outside group that has been flown in to the state to use scare tactics due to the students overwhelming support for a civil unions bill .
A mainland U.S. christian hate group calling itself Bema Ministries turned up on the campus last week to preach , harass , photograph , and intimidate students at the Campus Center .
They will be there this coming week as well .
They showed up on the University of Hawaii's Manoa campus , screamed at students for a few hours on Wednesday , got kicked out because they did n't have a permit , and then returned with a permit issued by the university chancellor the next day .
The student code of conduct expressly forbids hate speech yet this non-student group came on campus and not only made anti-gay statements , but told Hawaiian students that the sovereignty movement was idolatrous and evil , and told Buddhist students they would burn in hell .
The main course of hate was reserved for UH Manoa 's gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender and intersex students ( Pam 's Houseblend ) .
Counter protests are being planned , a sit in at the Chancellor 's office is also expected until these demonstrators leave .
This is unacceptable , that a non-student , non-Hawaiian hate group is allowed to come onto a campus to harass students .
Please contact the chancellor immediately to revoke their permit to enter the campus , this is a safety issue , as well as a violation of the universities principles .

Chrome on Mac
The March video walk - through reveals that the look and feel of the browser is distinct and instantly identifiable as part of the Chrome project .
At the same time , Chrome feels well integrated with OS X. Chrome Project Manager , Karen Gr?nberg , told Ars , " We are sensitive to all our platforms .
We do n't want to lose our Chrome features , but we will be respectful to the Macintosh platform .
You can tell at first glance that this is the Chrome browser and at the same time , it feels like a native application . "
Although many of the screen components feel chunkier than normal OS X choices , particularly in Google 's use of fonts and icons , the window is clearly a Cocoa - based application and uses all the standard Cocoa elements , from menus to window buttons to scrollbars to resize handles .
" Mac users are especially concerned with fit and finish , " explained Senior Software Engineer Amanda Walker .
" And we have paid particular attention to those details while integrating with the OS . "
Focusing on usability has been a big part of the Chrome project .
Google has performed usability studies on each of the target platforms , customizing each UI to ensure that it integrates well into the platform .
But making the UI feel native is n't where platform integration ends .
Pinkerton told Ars that Chrome 's integration with OS X goes deep .
When designing Chrome , it was Pinkerton 's role to make sure that the application 's architecture would not exclude what the browser needed to do on any of its target platforms , while at the same time leveraging as many native capabilities as possible .
" We wanted to do as much as possible to work with native services , from threading and the Mach layer through working with the native keychain and with PDFkit .
We wanted it to feel like a real Macintosh application , from using stored passwords and the address book to Spotlight . "
Webkit
Chrome is built on Webkit , an open source web browser engine that was originally developed by Apple by the KDE project and which helps power OS X's Safari on the Mac and the iPhone .
Webkit is actively being used by Nokia , Torch Mobile , and the KDE project , since it provides a rendering system that has been ported to a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms .
Although Apple remains a major WebKit player , Google is an active participant in helping grow the project .
The Chrome dev team tells us that they 're in daily contact with WebKit project members , keeping in touch via Freenode 's # webkit irc channel .
" We 're making changes that benefit all WebKit participants , " Walker said , noting that open source projects depend on this kind of community effort .
" Many of our updates are not Chromium - specific .
Our longterm goal is to help make all WebKit projects better . "
Security
Chrome surprised many people by outcompeting other browsers in the recent pwn2own competition at CanSecWest .
In the first day of the competition , Chrome remained the only browser to fend off security exploits .
" We were surprised to get as much attention as we did , " Amanda Walker told Ars .
" But it validated our architectural decisions , like sandboxing our renderer .
We 're not under any illusion that Chrome is immune from a security standpoint but this does vindicate some of the choices we made . "
Engineering director Linus Upson added , " We had the luxury of designing for security from the very beginning .
This let us build good defenses .
Normally it takes more than one bug to create an exploit .
By sandboxing , we could limit the number of bugs possible in each view . "
The security team at Google considered possible attacks from the very beginning of their design .
ChromeBot , which is used by Google , is a large scale virtual machine that accesses thousands of webpages to test for potential crashes .
ChromeBot preemptively helps find those crashes and potential exploits , and allows the Google engineers to fix them before they go live .
Security technologies also depend on the kind of threat presented , and Google has been building a wide range of security features into Chrome .
" Pwn2own is very different from much of what goes on in the wild , " Upson told Ars .
" For many users , it 's more important to provide features like phishing protection and warn users about pages with exploits . "
These user - centric security features were designed into Chrome from the start .
Downloading Chromium
The Chromium open source project means that anyone who wants to take a peek into the project can do so .
Admittedly , the committed versions lag behind the development versions , but it can be both instructive and exciting to sync to the repository and see where things stand .
That 's exactly what Ars did this week , in order to both test the program and to show readers how they can do so themselves .
To build Chromium yourself , you need Apple 's developer tools , a reasonable level of comfort operating Xcode , a modicum of terminal - fu , and some experience with version control .
It also helps if you had some decent hardware on - hand .
To get started , point your browser at the Chromium get - the - code page .
As Google points out , the codebase contains hundreds of thousands of files , so it really helps to begin by downloading a tarball .
Follow the most recent link from that page .
The uncompressed source tarball occupies about 5 GB of disk space .
Yes , you read that right .
The gzipped archive alone was about a half GB .
Ars tested the process on a Leopard 1.83 Intel Core 2 Duo mini with 1GB memory and found that hardware pretty woefully underpowered for the job at hand .
( PowerPC is not supported at this time . )
From start to end , the process took about 8 hours and the compilation is best run overnight .
Setting up and compiling
After extracting the source files from the tarball , install them into a convenient development folder .
Make sure your directory path has no spaces .
This little caveat has caught a few colleagues , whose builds failed because of the no-spaces rule .
So be smart and check your path before you go any further .
Next , download a copy of the gclient depot tools .
These scripts manage source checkouts for you .
All installation involves is downloading an small archive , decompressing the files , and adding their folder into your search path .
I do n't use bash but there are bash instructions on the tool page if you do .

Recently I started a new project in which I need to choose another database besides MySQL .
Since then , I had been using MySQL for basically everything , but given the MySQL licensing scheme and a few restrictions of the project itself , this time I had to use something else .
So I choose Firebird SQL .
But there ’s something about Firebird that always bothered me : why so few developers actually know and use Firebird ?
Basically ( at least here in Brazil ) I only see it being used among Delphi developers .
Why is n’t it as popular as MySQL or PostgreSQL ?
Given its features ( listed below ) , can we say that the project lives an unfair situation ?
Firebird have several features which makes it a great choice :
Really free : : contraty to MySQL , you can use Firebird in your commercial applications without any fee or legal problem .
( BTW : I know that PostgreSQL have this advantage too )

Databases with unlimited size : the database size limit is determined by the filesystem in which the database is stored .
But , if your database exceed its limit its always possible to split it in several files .
( the largest database known have 960 Gb link )

But , if your database exceed its limit its always possible to split it in several files .
( the largest database known have 960 Gb link ) 100 % SQL 92 compability
Connectivity : basically you can access a Firebird SQL through any programming language
My experience with Flamerobin is being really pleasant , but it ’s really sad to see that since I wrote my Microsoft Access to Firebird database converter ( MDB2FDB http://www.firebase.com.br/fb/downloads.php?categ=8) in 2006 that the Firebird popularity had n’t changed at all !
Since I really like this software , and I think that its current popularity situation is unfair , maybe it could be interesting to list some actions that may help this project .
So , here is my list :
Just use Firebird : really !
Just give it a try .
You ’ll get amazed by the amount of functionality can fit in it ’s small footprint .
You may donate some money for the projec too :
link : http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=ffoundation&id=contributions
May also be a sponsor :
link : http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=ffoundation&id=sponsor_howto
link : http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=ffoundation&id=sponsor_howto
If you miss some tool for it , you may build your own and then share it with others , just as I did with my MDB2FDB converter .
Write anything about it .
Of course , I could n’t finish this post without guessing ( just guesses ) the reasons why Firebird SQL is so unpopular if compared to MySQL or PostgreSQL :
There ’s no big player like Sun / Oracle or IBM supporting it right now .
The official website is terrible ( http://www.firebirdsql.org).
Seems futile , but the first impression of the project is horrible .
Makes you think it ’s stalled .
Firebird ’s biggest sponsor today is IBPhoenix , which main business IS Firebird .
But even it ’s website falls in the same problem .
Firebird ’s biggest sponsor today is IBPhoenix , which main business IS Firebird .
But even it ’s website falls in the same problem .
The fact of being Delphi related since it ’s begning .
With Delphi ’s decadence , its popularity just floundered with it .
Poor documentation
Maybe things may change to Firebird SQL after Oracle bought Sun ( many MySQL users are getting scared ( I see no reason for this by the way ) ) and may play with Firebird , but it ’s something improbable to happen . :)
Of course , these are just my opinions about it .
I really whould like to know yours .
Why do you think so few developers are using Firebird today ?

Today ’s wonderful Guest Artist is Jason Burgess of the comic Daily Wisdom which is more fun than you can shake a stick at .
SHARM EL - SHEIKH , Egypt ( Reuters ) - Palestinians hoping to raise $ 2.8 billion to rebuild Gaza at a conference in Egypt on Monday will find the path to reconstruction blocked by political and logistical factors , relief agencies say .
Egypt , which called for the gathering soon after Israel halted its Gaza offensive in January , says leaders from some 70 countries will attend including the presidents of France and Italy , and foreign ministers from Britain and the United States .
But the Islamist Hamas movement which runs Gaza is not invited .
Donors will seek to ensure no money reaches the group , and there is no guarantee that Gaza ’s borders will be opened to let sufficient supplies flow in .
Israel ’s 22 - day assault on Gaza , which it said aimed to suppress Palestinian cross - border rocket fire , killed more than 1,300 Palestinian and destroyed or damaged thousands of buildings across the coastal enclave .
More than a month after Israel and Hamas announced separate ceasefires , little long - term reconstruction has taken place and the aid is barely enough to keep residents fed and temporarily housed , the agencies said .
“ At the moment we are not getting in anywhere near the amount of aid that we need , ” said Juliette Seibold , policy and advocacy adviser for CARE International .
“ The work we are doing is very much focused on helping people tread water until the real assistance arrives , ” she said .
Some 15,000 houses were damaged or destroyed in the three - week offensive , according to the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) , which will present a recovery plan to the conference .
The PA hopes to raise $ 2.8 billion , after initial independent estimates put the cost at $ 2 billion .
In the Saudi capital Riyadh , Gulf Arab foreign ministers said their countries planned to pledge $ 1.65 billion in aid over a period of up to five years to rebuild Gaza .
They said other Arab countries could join their plan .
But any money pledged will face an obvious difficulty : reaching Gazans .
“ The issue for Sharm el - Sheikh will be frankly as simple as : ‘ Can we actually get cash inside Gaza to make the economy work ? ’ , ” said Michael Bailey , spokesman for Oxfam International .
“ The fundamental problem is that Israel will not allow adequate flows of materials or people into Gaza , ” he said .
The West shuns Hamas because it refuses to recognize Israel , renounce violence and commit to interim peace deals between Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas ’s Palestinian Authority .
Israel tightened its grip on Gaza ’s border crossings after Hamas took control in June 2007 , and says it will closely manage Gaza reconstruction by requiring project - by - project approval and guarantees that projects will not benefit Hamas .
Since the war ended on January 18 , Israel has not allowed in many materials deemed of dual use -- useful for both civilians and militants -- including cement and steel rods .
“ We will not allow Hamas to build new bunkers or use piping to build missiles , ” said Peter Lerner , spokesman for Israel ’s coordinator of activities in the Palestinian territories .
But Oxfam ’s Bailey said Israel has cast a very wide net .
“ We are talking about very simple things , ” he said .
“ Since the war there has been no pasta , no lentils and no fruit juice allowed into Gaza .
There is no way in anybody ’s imagination that these are dual use items . ”
Human Rights Watch said Israel continues to block goods from entering Gaza via the sophisticated Karni crossing near Gaza City .
Instead , trucks are routed to Kerem Shalom near Gaza ’s southern tip , where a $ 1,000 per truck handling fee applies .
Daly Belgasmi , the regional director of the U.N. ’s World Food Program ( WFP ) , said : “ It ’s quite challenging ... but we are working closely with Israel to coordinate our movement . ”
The United States is expected to pledge more than $ 900 million at the conference , but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also stressed that any aid must not benefit Hamas , which the U.S. deems a terrorist organization .
“ I will be announcing a commitment to a significant aid package , but it will only be spent if we determine that our goals can be furthered rather than undermined or subverted , ” Clinton told Voice of America in an interview taped on Friday .
The Palestinians began a long - awaited dialogue in Cairo on Thursday aimed at forming a unity government that can oversee the Gaza reconstruction .
Those steps hit a snag on Saturday when Abbas called for any unity government to seek a two - state solution , which Hamas immediately rejected .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Natasha Richardson , a film star , Tony - winning stage actress and member of the famed Redgrave acting family , died Wednesday after suffering injuries in a ski accident , according to a family statement .
She was 45 .
Natasha Richardson fell on a beginners ' slope in Canada .

Richardson , wife of actor Liam Neeson , was injured Monday in a fall on a ski slope at a Quebec resort about 80 miles northwest of Montreal .
Richardson 's family released a statement saying , " Liam Neeson , his sons , and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha .
They are profoundly grateful for the support , love and prayers of everyone , and ask for privacy during this very difficult time . "
According to a statement from Mont Tremblant Ski Resort , Richardson fell during a lesson on a beginners ' trail .
Watch a report on Richardson 's life »
" She did not show any visible sign of injury , but the ski patrol followed strict procedures and brought her back to the bottom of the slope and insisted she should see a doctor , " the statement said .
Richardson , accompanied by her instructor , returned to her hotel , but about an hour after the fall was " not feeling good , " the statement said .
An ambulance was called , and Richardson was taken to a local hospital before being transferred to Hopital du Sacre - Coeur in Montreal .
From there she was transferred to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City .
Friends and colleagues were saddened by her death .
" Natasha was brilliant , beautiful , funny , talented beyond measure , as emotionally raw as she was razor sharp , " said Jodie Foster , who worked with Richardson in " Nell , " in a statement .
" Tasha loved fiercely and that love continues in all of us who knew her .
May Liam , her beautiful boys and her loving family hold her close as they move through this tragic moment . "
" Natasha combined the best of [ her parents , Vanessa ] Redgrave and [ Tony ] Richardson : the enormous depth and emotional force of a great actor on the one hand , and the intelligence and objectivity of a great director on the other .
She was a one - of - a- kind , a magnificent actress , " said director Sam Mendes in a statement .
Mendes directed Richardson in her Tony - winning " Cabaret " performance .
Richardson was practically born to perform .
Her grandfather , Sir Michael Redgrave , was a famed British actor .
Her mother , Vanessa Redgrave , is an Oscar - winning actress , and her father , the late director Tony Richardson , helmed such films as " Look Back in Anger , " " The Entertainer " and the Oscar - winning " Tom Jones . "
Natasha Richardson 's uncle Corin Redgrave , aunt Lynn Redgrave , and sister Joely Richardson are also noted performers .
But being part of a family of actors was n't always easy for Richardson .
Her parents divorced when she was 4 and her mother , involved in controversial political causes , gave away a lot of money , putting the family in financial straits , according to the BBC .
Then there was the family heritage , of which Richardson once said , " Though my name opened doors it did n't get me work , and a lot of pressure comes from having a mother who is considered one of the greatest actresses of her generation , " the BBC reported .
In 2007 , Richardson worked with her mother in the film " Evening . "
Richardson said she made one point to director Lajos Koltai about the relatives working together .
" This is a unique opportunity , " she said she told him .
" This is the one time my mother and I are going to play mother and daughter on screen , so you 've got to take advantage of it . "
Watch Richardson talk about working with her mom »
Richardson 's first film role was a bit part in her father 's " The Charge of the Light Brigade " ( 1968 ) , made when she was 4 .
After a handful of roles through her teens and early 20s , she broke through as Mary Shelley in Ken Russell 's film " Gothic , " and followed that up as Patty Hearst in Paul Schrader 's 1988 film of the same name .
iReport.com : Share memories of Richardson
Richardson's other notable films included " The Handmaid 's Tale " ( 1990 ) ; the TV movie " Zelda " ( 1993 ) ; " Nell " ( 1994 ) , alongside Neeson , whom she married in 1994 ; the 1998 remake of " The Parent Trap " ; and " Wild Child " ( 2008 ) .

But some of Richardson 's greatest successes were on the stage .
At 22 , she played opposite her mother and Jonathan Pryce in a London production of Anton Chekhov 's " The Seagull " ; the performance earned her the London Drama Critics ' most promising newcomer award .
She won a Tony for her performance as Sally Bowles in the 1998 revival of " Cabaret " and earned raves for her Blanche DuBois in a 2005 production of " A Streetcar Named Desire . "
She was scheduled to perform in a revival of Stephen Sondheim 's " A Little Night Music " this year , following a January benefit performance of the show .
She and Neeson have two children , Michael and Daniel .
Richardson was married to Robert Fox from 1990 to 1994 .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Is n’t that what Jim Cramer does on every show , you might ask ?
That ’s a fair point .
But what if Jim Cramer has now decided that he will dedicate himself to defeating Barack Obama ’s agenda , declared himself to be on the “ White House enemies list ; ” and that what he is doing now is what he has done all along – to “ fight to help viewers and readers make and preserve capital . ”
That ’s what I call jumping the shark .
Bad investment advice is what Cramer does entertainingly .
But this sense of self - grandiousity – and his seeming demand to be taken seriously instead of as a ridiculous figure .
That ’s too much .
The self - puffery is evident as Cramer insists he is on a “ White House enemies list ” ( his source is the noted Democratic party insider Rush Limbaugh ) .
Cramer thinks he is on this “ list ” because made an outrageous comment about White House policy being designed to destroy wealth and kill kittens , and when questioned about it , the White House press secretary pointed out that Mr. Cramer ’s advice on how to create wealth was n’t what the White House was looking for .
Cramer claims he has spent his career helping viewers and readers “ preserve ” their capital – and that his advice now to oppose Obama is just a continuance of that .
So for a moment , let ’s look at the fate of those who would have followed Cramer ’s advice in the past .
The Consumerist points out that if one had followed Jim Cramer ’s stock - picking advice since 2000 , you would have been better served by flipping a coin – as Jim Cramer ’s advice is slightly worse than a coin toss .
This is also the guy who publicly advised his viewers on October 31 , 2008 2007 , just before the beginning of this stock market slide :
You should be buying things and accept that they are overvalued , but accept that they ’re going to keep going higher .
I know that sounds irresponsible , but that ’s how you make the money .
Right now , up is down , left is right , peace is war .
[ my emphasis ]
Eric
Tyson supplements this by describing some of Cramer ’s more recent investment advice :
Bear Stearns .
Cramer recommended buying this stock on 8/17/07 at $ 118.20 per share .
He lost 95 percent on this one – selling at just under $ 6 per share on 3/20/08 .
Morgan Stanley .
Cramer recommended buying this stock on 9/15/06 at $ 70.95 per share .
Its recently been trading in the mid-teens .
Lehman Brothers .
Cramer recommended this stock on 10/17/05 at $ 55.18 per share .
On 9/5/08 with the stock trading at $ 16 per share , on CNBC , Cramer selected Lehman as a “ screaming buy ” and said things could n’t get any worse for the company .
The stock now trades at less than $ 1 per share for more than a 99 percent loss for Cramer .
Merrill Lynch .
Cramer recommended buying this stock on 9/19/05 at $ 60.17 per share and sold it on 9/12/08 for $ 17.05 per share for a 72 percent loss …
( And , by the way , Cramer recommended buying financial services giant AIG on 11/7/05 at $ 66.34 per share and the stock currently trades around $ 2 per share for a 97 percent loss . )
Given his history , it ’s a bit rich of Jim Cramer to claim his career has been about “ preserving ” anything other than his own entertaining presence .
If he meant to dedicate his life to “ preserving the wealth of his viewers and readers , ” clearly he ’s been quite a miserable failure .
In terms of sheer lunacy , on the other hand , he ’s still got it .
But I , for one , am grateful the White House is n’t following the Jim Cramer guide to wealth creation .
And for those of you that are – I might advise you invest in a solid coin to flip , as it would apparently serve you better .

This story shows once again the growing global unease with the implicit policy of the United States to conveniently forget the torture and other abuses of the Bush regime .
In England , police are investigating whether British intelligence officers knew about and prolonged the torture of Binyam Mohamed , the recently released Guantanamo detainee .
As Glenn Greenwald notes , other countries have not abandoned their commitment to the rule of law .

The end of the NY Times article shows why the US can hardly claim that Spain is acting irresponsibly beyond its own borders and violating the soveriegnty of other nations , because in one recent case we did almost exactly the same thing :
The United States for the first time this year used a law that allows for the prosecution in the United States of torture in other countries .
On Jan. 10 , a Miami court sentenced Charles Taylor , the former Liberian leader , to 97 years in a federal prison for torture , even though the crimes were committed in Liberia .
Last October , when the Miami court handed down the conviction , Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey applauded the ruling and said : " This is the first case in the United States to charge an individual with criminal torture .
I hope this case will serve as a model to future prosecutions of this type . "
So do I .

SAN FRANCISCO 
The Justice Department has begun an inquiry into the antitrust implications of Google ’s settlement with authors and publishers over its Google Book Search service , two people briefed on the matter said Tuesday .
Lawyers for the Justice Department have been in conversations in recent weeks with various groups opposed to the settlement , including the Internet Archive and Consumer Watchdog .
More recently , Justice Department lawyers notified the parties to the settlement , including Google , and representatives for the Association of American Publishers and the Authors Guild , that they were looking into various antitrust issues related to the far - reaching agreement .
The inquiry does not necessarily mean that the department will oppose the settlement , which is subject to a court review .
But it suggests that some of the concerns raised by critics , who say the settlement would unfairly give Google an exclusive license to profit from millions of books , have resonated with the Justice Department .
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department was not immediately available to comment .
A spokesman for Google declined to comment .
Representatives for the Association of American Publishers and the Authors Guild could not immediately be reached .
When a nanny with 10 years of experience was let go last year after her Hancock Park employers divorced , she had a hard time finding a new job .
After five months of looking , she changed her application at the placement agency from “ nanny ” to “ housekeeper ” -- and lowered her hourly rate .
It worked .
Soon she was hired at a 10,000 - square - foot house near Malibu as a housekeeper -- until the family ’s nanny was laid off .
For $ 3 more an hour , the housekeeper began steaming the carpets -- and feeding the dogs and making dinner -- with a baby on her hip .
When the family also let go its personal assistant , she took on grocery shopping , managing the gardener , directing the pool man , helping with the family business . . .
“ I definitely ca n’t say no , ” says the housekeeper - nanny - personal assistant , who asked that her name not be used for fear of getting fired .
After all , she has four children of her own to support .
Households everywhere are looking to economize at home , perhaps switching to generic products , starting up ( or letting go of ) a membership at Costco or dropping premium channels from their cable service .
But when these efforts do n’t make a material dent in the finances , they search for bigger cuts -- and that can mean the household staff .
Do they really need a nanny ?
Or a housekeeper ?
And for those lucky enough to have both , could n’t the jobs be combined ?
For people who went into the nanny business with a love of children and clearly defined boundaries about what they will and wo n’t do -- yes to making the kids ’ lunch , no to cleaning toilets -- the recession is blurring those lines .
The bosses ’ finances and nannies ’ own tenuous job security are forcing many workers to redefine not only what they do , but also who they are .
::
Nannies air their frustrations at the Nanny and Me group at the parenting center of Temple Beth Am in Los Angeles .
Gabrielle Kaufman facilitates the group , which started as a place where Spanish - speaking nannies could engage in educational play with their charges while learning about nutrition , safety and health .
It ’s also a place where nannies can swap stories , and Kaufman has noticed more anxiety creeping into their conversations .
“ Even though they ’re doing a lot more than they used to , ” she says , “ they feel they ca n’t complain .
They feel lucky to have a job . ”
Kaufman hears of nannies offering to take on more responsibilities in an effort to make themselves indispensable -- or to squeeze another household employee out of a job .
Joanna Brody of Culver City does n’t question the motives of her nanny , who offered to take on more cleaning duties while her toddlers napped .
“ She likes to keep busy , ” Brody says .
Although the extra help was appreciated , it put Brody in a difficult situation as it became clear she did n’t need twice - monthly cleaning service .
Now the service comes just once a month .
“ I feel bad for Philip , ” Brody says of the owner of the cleaning company she ’s been using for more than a year .
“ He ’s a hard - working entrepreneur , and he ’s always done a good job .
I do n’t want to take work away from him , but it just does n’t make much sense to keep them both . ”
Katie Vaughan , head of Westside Nannies , a high - end placement agency whose clients might seem recession - safe , has found lately that families new to the service have been asking for workers who can combine jobs .
“ They ’ll ask for a nanny who can do some cleaning or , even more , ” she says .
“ They ’re looking for a nanny who can take on assistant duties , like buying groceries and gifts , writing thank - you notes , party planning and secretarial work . ”
Realizing they need to compromise to get a job , prospective employees are more flexible than in the past .
“ The typical English nanny or governess used to roll her eyes when I ’d ask if she ’d be open to cleaning , ” says Claudia Kahn , owner of the Help Co. , another placement agency .
“ Now they ’re all saying , ‘ Send me on the interview . ’ ”
During these tough economic times , a nanny may agree to take on household chores to keep her job , but there are risks to asking for too much , says Lindsay Heller , a psychologist who consults on family and nanny issues and who runs the Nanny Doctor , a service aimed at improving relationships between the two parties .
“ It ’s tempting , financially , ” she says , but as a result the nanny may feel resentment .
“ You might see some passive - aggressive behavior , ” she says , such as showing up late for work .
Heller , who was a nanny for 10 years , warns that employers also could offend a nanny or housekeeper by suggesting that the positions are interchangeable .
They are professional roles , she says , and should be respected .
Not every nanny is a good housekeeper , and not every housekeeper can take on child - care duties .
“ If not done properly , ” she says , “ the child is at risk . ”
A housekeeper who has children of her own , she adds , is not necessarily qualified to become a nanny .
Driving record , language skills -- these become important as soon as duties are expanded to include transporting and caring for children .
“ The nanny ’s role is to provide a healthy and safe environment for children , ” Heller says .
“ They work out routines and schedules and arrange play dates and activities . ”
::
If you have to ask an existing employee to take on more responsibilities , Heller recommends being honest about your reasons .
If you ’re not , she says , the change in job description could be seen as a demotion , and resentment could build .
The employee should know if the change is short - term or permanent .
And though some adults may consider household help interchangeable , children rarely do .
Having a beloved nanny or faithful housekeeper change positions or leave a household can be emotionally difficult and requires conversations with the kids .
Above all , Heller says , if you ’re going to increase an employee ’s responsibilities , make sure to increase his or her salary accordingly -- or by as much as you can .
The housekeeper who saw her job expand to include nanny and personal assistant duties actually can muster some compassion for her employer ’s family .
“ I understand the economy is very bad , ” she says .
“ Maybe when the economy is more stable , they ’ll hire someone to help me . ”
Until then , however , it ’s hard for her to see the three luxury cars in the family ’s garage , the new landscaping going in around the pool and the media room under construction .
She ’s not sure which would be worse : keeping this job or looking for a new one .
Until she decides , her résumé is back on file at the placement agency .

It was reported yesterday that Jack Straw will today drop clause 152 of the coroners and justice bill .
This clause amends the Data Protection
Act to turn it into a government data - trafficking charter .
If true , no doubt this will be presented as a magnanimous realisation that the public and parliament needs further reassurance that " their
aim is good " .
Really it would be a victory for those of us who have furiously lobbied MPs and peers over the past couple of months about the ministry of justice 's mendacious presentation of profound changes in government power as a bit of administrative tidying up .
Do n't hold your breath , though .
Even if part eight of this bill is dropped completely , as rumoured ( slyly punishing the Information Commissioner for dissent on data sharing by losing the improvements to his powers at the same time ) , information sharing will be back .
It is at the core of current administrative fashion , and the cult of transformational government is still very much in charge at the cabinet office .

The graceful robotic penguins in the video above were unveiled by German engineering firm Festo this week .
Using their flippers , the mechanical penguins can paddle through water just like real ones , while larger helium - filled designs can “ swim ” through the air .
The penguins are on show at the Hannover Messe Trade Exhibition in Germany .
Each penguin carries 3D sonar developed by EvoLogics in Berlin , Germany , which is used to monitor its surroundings and avoid collisions with walls or other penguins .

Head turning
The bionic penguins can twist and turn almost as gracefully as their living counterparts because of the flexible glass fibre rods that control their heads .
The fibres are arranged around the side of each penguin ’s head , while motors inside the body pull on one or more of them to twist the penguin ’s neck in any direction and guide the swimmer , says Markus Fischer , who heads Festo ’s corporate design team .
That design has industrial applications , says Fischer .
It has been adapted by Festo to make a flexible , trunk - like arm with a gripper on the end for use in industrial applications .
The arm can twist up to 90° in any direction , giving it an unrivalled degree of dexterity .
Engineers are increasingly gaining inspiration from nature – earlier this year , a European - wide research group began work on a bionic octopus , and engineers think bird wings could help inspire more efficient aircraft .
A year ago , Festo used the same exhibition to unveil realistic swimming robot jellyfish .
Carrie Prejean , Miss California , ( you know , also crowned “ Miss Anti Same Sex Marriage ) had her Breast Implants Paid For By Miss California Organization just weeks before the Miss California Pageant earlier this month .
When asked in an interview recently if the Miss California organization paid for Carrie Prejean ’s breast implants , the organizations co-executive director , Miss USA 1995 Shana Moakler , confirmed that they had .
“ It was an option and she wanted it .
And we supported that .
Breast implants in pageants is not a rarity .
It ’s definitely not taboo .
It ’s very common .
Breast implants today among young women today is very common .
I do n’t personally have them , but you know – they are . ”
So let me get this straight – marital rights between two people of the same sex is not natural in the eyes of God , but having bags of silicone or saline surgically implanted in your chest to give the illusion of larger , more appealing breasts in the name of vanity is ??

If you think your eyesight could improve with practice , you ’re likely to see better according to a Harvard University study .
Science News say the study reveals that expectations of improved eyesight actually enhance visual clarity rather than just increasing alertness or motivation to focus on seeing .
What has gotten into Hillary Clinton ?
Since taking office on February 2 , Clinton has gone from being one of the most guarded public figures in the history of hemming and hawing , to one of the straightest - talking secretaries of state imaginable .
Over a few weeks and even more time zones , Clinton has not only told a number of hard truths , but told them in public and apparently on purpose .
In the Netherlands , on March 30 , on the billions of U.S. aid dollars wasted in Afghanistan : “ heartbreaking . ”
In Mexico , on March 26 , on America 's war on drugs : " Clearly , what we have been doing has not worked . ”
In South Korea , on February 19 , on human rights in China : “ Our pressing on those issues can't interfere with the global economic crisis , the global climate change crisis , and the security crisis . "
Who is this woman and what has she done with the old Hillary ?
When I covered her first race for the New York Senate in 2000 – the template for her later presidential bid -- the real Hillary was a fake Hillary , or rather , a Hillary who had long since had the authenticity drummed out of her by a relentless media beat .
For years , she had been legitimately probed on matters such as Whitewater , cattle futures , and health care -- but also mercilessly punished for nothing at all .
After making an off - the - cuff remark about preferring a career to staying at home baking cookies , she had to spend a decade swearing that she did n't hate homemakers .
Every time she changed her hair , she was accused of trying to change her personality .
For every Gennifer , Paula or Monica who surfaced , she had to . . . enough said .
By the time Clinton ran for office , she was such a lightning rod that her whole mission was to avoid generating heat .
The result was a determined lack of substance that was shocking in a woman renowned for her command of policy .
One example :
In the course of her Senate campaign , she devoted speeches , sound bites , everything but sonnets to the notion that she had spent “ more than thirty years ” fighting for poor children .
She devoted a total of less than two minutes , at the very end , to ( sort of ) addressing the impact of her husband 's sweeping welfare reform on poor children .
In her presidential race , the candor deficit owed less to Clinton saying nothing than to her apparent willingness to say anything .
“ In making different cases against Obama , ” James Fallows observed in The Atlantic Monthly , “ she reinforced the strongest argument against herself : that she would say whatever she thought might work at the moment . ”
Becoming Secretary of State might have exaggerated these tendencies .
The gutsiest marks Condoleeza Rice made were fashion statements , as when she wore those fab black knee - high boots to the army airfield in Wiesbaden , Germany .
Colin Powell was ever circumspect – except for that time he carried water for the Bush administration on WMDs and destroyed his credibility .
Perhaps Clinton has been freed by speaking for an administration that is not her own , as well as an administration that expressly wants to break the mold .
( It 's easier to bemoan the waste of Afghan aid money when an unpopular predecessor has done the wasting . )
Or perhaps it 's because when she 's on the world stage , she looks out at cheering audiences , secure in the knowledge that nobody thinks she killed Vince Foster .
Whatever the reason , it seems as if Clinton has stopped holding her breath at last .
Of course , Clinton is hardly a source of candor all the time .
Some of her highest - profile international appearances have been made on the celebrity softball field , such as Indonesia 's version of MTV , or the Turkish equivalent of The View .
And she can still break into fluent non-speak when she wants to .
Besides , just because a statement is true does not mean it ’s right .
One can applaud the U.S. for honesty about its stance on human rights in China , and still decry the stance as wrong .
But for a position to be challenged , it has to be articulated in the first place .
“ Maybe this is unusual because you are supposed to be so careful that we spend hours avoiding stating the obvious , ” Clinton said , explaining her acknowledgement , in February , that a thorny succession question was likely to flow from the stroke suffered in August by North Korean dictator Kim Jong - Il .
“ I think it ’s worth , perhaps , being more straightforward , trying to engage other countries on the basis of the reality that exists . ”
I still do n’t know who this woman is or what she 's done with the real Hillary .
But , then again , I do n’t care .
This one can stay .
TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) -- A 54 - year - old Japanese father was arrested after he tried to help his son pass an exam by impersonating the young man and taking the test for him , police said Thursday .
The father , who was not named , put on glasses and straightened his hair to look more like the picture on his son's identity card , said Masaaki Nakamori , a police official in the Nara prefecture in western Japan .
But as he took the test while trying to make sure the examiners did n't get a good look at him , one official noticed that the man looked much older than the picture on the card , Nakamori said .
The father then apologized and confessed .
Police said the man runs a company that distributes medicine and had passed an exam in August to earn a license to handle drugs
The man used the ruse because he wanted his son to work alongside him , Nakamori said .
The son did not know of his father 's intention , he said .
Police expect to charge the man with forging official documents .
They are unclear if the man will lose the license he rightfully obtained for himself .
It ’s not just members of the public and political pundits who are daring to speak the words ‘ marijuana ’ and ‘ legalization ’ in the same breath .
Even in Washington , DC , calls to regulate cannabis are growing progressively louder — as today ’s headline in The Hill indicates .
Webb :
Pot legalization ‘ on the table ’ in prison reform effort
via The Hill
The leader of a congressional effort to reform the criminal justice system said Thursday that all issues — including drug legalization — need to be on the table .
Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) , who has made criminal justice and prison reform a signature issue of his this year in Congress , is the most high - profile lawmaker to indicate openness to drug decriminalization or outright legalization .
“ Well , I think what we need to do is to put all of the issues on the table , ” Webb said this morning on CNN if asked if marijuana legalization would be part of his criminal justice reform efforts .
“ If you go back to 1980 as a starting point , I think we had 40,000 people in prison on drug charges , and today , we have about 500,000 of them , ” the first - term Virginia lawmaker said .
“ And the great majority of those are nonviolent crimes — possession crimes or minor sales . ”
NORML praised Senator Webb for his candor and political courage earlier this month when we endorsed Senate Bill 714 , the National Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2009 .
If you have not yet written or called your U.S. Senator in support of SB 714 , what are you waiting for ?
Fortunately , Senator Webb is not the only member of Congress speaking out in favor of pot law reform .
Other recent examples include :
California Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez suggests on CNN that the federal government should allow California to establish a “ pilot program ” taxing and regulating the use of marijuana by adults .
( Watch the video of her remarks here . )
U.S. House Representative Ron Paul ( Texas ) tells CNN that the use and distribution of pot should be regulated by the states , and that ending prohibition would dramatically decrease prohibition - related violence at the U.S. / Mexican border .
( Watch the video of his remarks here . )
Congressmen Dana Rohrabacher ( California ) and Jim McDermott ( Washington ) , speaking in The Hill ( “ Pot legalization favored by some to stem violence , ” April 19 ) declare , “ [ F ] rom a social policy , I do n’t see any reason not to legalize it , control it , sell it , [ and ] tax it ( marijuana ) . ”
And in the ‘ sign of how far we ’ve come , but how far we still have to go ’ department , there ’s this admission from Rep. Rohrabacher :
“ There are a lot of people who understand that [ the current war on drugs has been a failure ] . …
If it was a vote – a blind vote where nobody knew who was voting – you would have overwhelming support for legalizing marijuana out there , but they will never vote for it because they are afraid of taking on a controversial issue . ”
Hmmm , sounds to me like a whole lot more people need to write and call their members of Congress and tell them : Marijuana law reform is not a politically controversial issue , but opposing it is .
And while you ’re at it , why not write President Barack “ legalizing marijuana is off the table ” Obama and give him the same message .

The RNG outputs a series of numbers between 0-4294967296 .
Not sequentially , but in a known pattern , with no numbers repeated .
In Emerald each time the game is reset / restarted the numbers being generated begin at a known point , called a " seed " , and progress at a farily steady rate of 60 per second .
This lets us know , at a certain time after a reset , what number the RNG is going to produce .
If you 've seen the frame spreadsheets or the output of emloop this should make sense .
To clarify , think of exploiting the RNG in Emerald in the terms of taking a trip .
With a fixed starting point ( seed ) , route ( frame listing ) , and speed ( 60 frames per second ) it is easy to tell where you are going to be after a certain point in time .
Emerald always starts from the same location , and this is the magic behind all of the wonderful things that people are resetting and breeding .
The other games all travel the same route , but they mix things up by starting you at a different location on the route each time the game is reset .
Since your location at start is not known it is not possible to know where you are after any given time .
This thread documents how get our starting location ( seed ) and how to determine what actions we need to take to know what and it will output .
4th Generation Specific Information for RNG Seeding
The RNG is seeded when " Continue " is selected .
The seed of the RNG is not fixed , but is determined by your current date , current time , and the amount of time it took from reset until continuing .
The seed formula :
Given a date / time set the current variables :
Year ( 4 Digits , 2000 - 2099 )
Month ( 1 - 12 )
Day ( 1 - 31 )
Hour ( 0 - 23 )
Minute ( 0 - 59 )
Seconds ( 0 - 59 )
Delay =
Seconds between game start and hitting A on the continue screen * 60
* = Multiply
% = Mod ( divide and take remainder of )
0x = Numbers prefixed with this are Hexadecimal
((( Month * Day + Minute + Second ) % 0x100 ) * 0x1000000 ) + ( Hour * 0x10000 ) + ( Year - 2000 + Delay )
RNG Vs RNG
But wait , there 's more .
In addition to the RNG described above there is another , which uses a different algorithm , coded into the 4th Generation games .
This other RNG ( called the IRNG for the duration of this article ) is used solely for the generation of egg PIDs .

FAQ
1 . What does MOD mean ?
The US House of Representatives passed today , the 39th Earth Day , two bills that would aid some of the world ’s most embattled wildlife : the Great Cats and Rare Canids Act ( H.R. 411 ) and the Crane Conservation Act ( H.R. 388 ) .
Approved by a vote of 290 to 118 , the Great Cats and Rare Canids
Act protects twelve species of wild cats and dogs globally , including leopards , cheetahs , snow leopards , and African wild dogs .
Building on the existing Multinational Species Conservation Funds , the bill aims to lessen poaching and smuggling , protect critical habitat , and support education related to these charismatic species in their home countries .
If enacted , the bill will provide additional funding to private conservation organizations by as much as three to one .
The Great Cats and Rare Canids Act was sponsored by Congressman Jay Inslee from Washington state .
The cheetah is one of the endangered cats that would benefit from the Great Cats and Rare Canids Act.

“ The Great Cats and Rare Canids Act has enjoyed broad bipartisan support in Congress , ” said Bill Eichbaum , WWF vice president for U.S. Government Relations .
“ As it did last year , this bill passed the House today with overwhelming support .
We now look forward to the Senate taking up the legislation and sending it to the President to be signed into law . ”
The Crane Conservation
Act also passed easily : 288 to 166 .
The Act supports crane conservation both in the U.S. and around the world .
With eleven species of crane labeled threatened out of fifteen , cranes are considered the world ’s most endangered bird family .
The Act was authored by Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin .
“ We thank Congressman Jay Inslee and Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin for their leadership and dedication and also recognize the long - term commitment of the co-chairs of the International Conservation Caucus for their continued support to this effort ” said John Calvelli , Executive Vice President of Public Affairs at the Wildlife Conservation Society .

Obama blocks offshore oil drilling for now
( 02/11/2009 ) The Obama administration has shelved a plan by the Bush Administration to open U.S. coastal waters to oil and gas drilling .
The proposal , put forth on the last business day of the Bush Administration , had been vehemently opposed by environmental groups .
I 've known for a long time that this is a major problem for me .
I have a severe mistrust of people .
I never expect them to give back what I 've given .
I 've been disappointed many , many times , but honestly , I do n't know if I can say even that warrants my mistrust .
Over the past few years , I 've done things like turn off my phone after I call someone and leave a message , so as not to know if they called back or not , ( to avoid disappointment ) , which would inevitably lead to their saying in our next conversation , " I called you , but you never answer . "
Still though , I continue my self - destructive ways .
I remember one of the only times I 've ever thrown anything for myself , a few years ago for my 25th birthday ( I'm 29 now ) , and in my eyes it was a disaster .
No one except a couple reliable friends came , everyone else had an excuse .
Even a " close " friend ( our b - days are days apart ) who I was hosting the party with backed out at the last minute .
I was devastated .
It was one of the worst experiences of my life .
I felt devastated , like , " God , here I am , I made the effort , and it blew up in my face . "
So of course , I have n't thrown anything since , just attended other people 's gatherings .
I never get my moment in the sun because I 'm afraid people either 1 ) do n't know me enough to attend or 2 ) do n't care enough , both which would hurt like hell .
I do n't think I can take another 25th b- day party , I just do n't .
So I never even try .
But it makes me sad .
I do n't know if I 'll ever get married , but over the years , the only thing I 've obsessed over when thinking about that day is , " would anyone come ?
Could I handle being the center of attention like that ? "
Those thoughts scare the begeezus out of me , truly .
But I worry now because this was semi-okay when I was younger , but now it 's not a phase , it 's become a way of life , and it makes me feel like my life is passing me by .
Yet I do n't know how to trust others enough to include them in my life in a healthy , normal way .
I do n't know what to do .
Can anyone either 1 ) tell me what 's wrong with me or 2 ) tell me how to fix it ?
P.S. I went to therapy a few years ago ( after the 25th b- day debacle , surprise , surprise ) for about a year and I found it helpful , but I do n't know if that 's what I need anymore .
I do n't know what I need to get past this , I really do n't .
" Why do you do that ?
Stop it .
Let other people bless you .
You 're always supporting others , why do n't you let others show support for you ? "
This is what a co-worker said to me today when scolding me about my not wanting to have a promotion luncheon and moving to another area .
This has happened like three times in as many years .
After many excuses , I finally conceded to her " I do n't know . "

Former US Vice - President Dick Cheney has urged the CIA to release memos which he says show harsh interrogation techniques such as water - boarding work .
His comments follow the publication of memos written by Bush administration lawyers which justified the techniques .
Mr Cheney said that the decision to publish the memos was a mistake .
And it was misleading , he said , because the documents did not include those demonstrating that harsh interrogation delivered intelligence " success " .
" One of the things that I find a little bit disturbing about this recent disclosure is that they put out the legal memos ... but they did n't put out the memos that show the success of the effort , " Mr Cheney told Fox News .
JUSTIN WEBB'S BLOG
The real question - of course - is whether waterboarding is justified under any circumstances
Read Justin's thoughts in full " There are reports that show specifically what we gained as a result of this activity .
They have not been declassified .
I formally ask that they be declassified now . "
The American people should have a chance to weigh the intelligence obtained alongside the legal debate , he said .
Mr Cheney made his comments as US President Barack Obama visited the CIA headquarters just outside Washington .
In a move seen as an attempt to boost morale , Mr Obama told employees that the CIA remained key to protecting the country .
Do n't be discouraged that we have to acknowledge that potentially we 've made some mistakes
Barack Obama
Interrogation ' morass ' for Obama Q&A : Water - boarding Staff had faced a " difficult " few days , he acknowledged , but they had his full support and were key to tackling threats from groups such as al - Qaeda .
Mr Obama said he had had no choice but to release the Bush administration 's legal justification for interrogation techniques , which he considers to be torture - and has banned .
" Do n't be discouraged that we have to acknowledge that potentially we 've made some mistakes .
" That 's how we learn .
But the fact that we are willing to acknowledge them and then move forward , that is precisely why I am proud to be president of the United States and that 's why you should be proud to be members of the CIA , " he said .
The memos , detailing the range of techniques the CIA was allowed to use during the Bush administration , were released on 16 April .
Quoting one of the memos , The New York Times said water - boarding - or mock drowning - was used on two al - Qaeda terror suspects on up to 266 occasions .
Other methods mentioned in the memos include week - long sleep deprivation , forced nudity and the use of painful positions .
Mr Obama on Thursday said he would not prosecute under anti-torture laws CIA personnel who relied in good faith on Bush administration legal opinions issued after the 11 September attacks .
But he has been criticised by human rights organisations and UN officials , who say charges are necessary to prevent future abuses and to hold people accountable .
REACTION TO DICK CHENEY'S COMMENTS [ Dick Cheney 's request ] strikes me as eminently reasonable .
Up until now , the case against torture has been an easy one to make , since there 's been nothing in the way of solid evidence ( sorry , Marc Thiessen 's fulminations do n't count ) that waterboarding , walling , etc actually worked and produced useful intelligence .
It 's possible that these reports Cheney mentions wo n't amount to solid evidence either , but , at this point , all the evidence should be on the table ( with redactions where necessary , of course ) .
Jason Zengerle , New Republic Unfortunately for Republicans , Cheney 's primary mission - defending the Bush presidency from attacks against it - does almost nothing to further the broader goals of the GOP heading into 2010 and 2012 .
In fact , it is at odds with those goals .
Chris Cilizza , Washington Post Cheney is wrong to suggest that the released documents fail to describe the reported success of the harsh treatment .
The May 30 , 2005 memo by Steven Bradbury includes pages of description of the benefits of harsh interrogation ... Cheney present [s ] a scene out of 24 , the television shows .
Tough guy terrorists wo n't talk , until they think they are drowning .
Then they give up the store .
The accuracy of this vision is , from what is known publicly at present , still in dispute .
As Scott Shane reported Saturday in the New York Times , the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah , which is deemed [ a ] major success in the Bradbury memo , was seen as totally unnecessary and unproductive by others in the intelligence community .
Michael Scherer , Time Democrats are thrilled Dick Cheney has n't found a more productive way to spend his retirement .
The majority party would love nothing more than a political fight that boils down to Obama 's approach vs. the Bush / Cheney / Rove approach .
The former VP keeps making this easier .

" " Apollo 13 flight directors applaud the successful splashdown of the Command Module " Odyssey " after the spacecraft suffered an explosion that shut down almost every system necessary to sustain life onboard .
NASA
Apollo 13 was headed for the moon .
On April 11 , 1970 , the spacecraft lifted off .
Fifty - five hours and 55 minutes later , an explosion shut down almost every system necessary to sustain life onboard .
The string of events leading to the explosion began in 1965 , with an oversight involving the oxygen tank thermostats .
Tank No. 2 — which had been damaged before the launch — violently ruptured when a fan was turned on .
That set the stage for one of the most amazing collaborative rescues in history .
So many things went wrong on Apollo 13 , it's an engineering miracle that the crew — astronauts James Lovell , John Swigert and Fred Hayes — made it home at all , let alone alive and well [ source : Banke ] .

Minutes after the crew completed a television broadcast from space , telling America everything was going well , an explosion shook the spacecraft .
One disaster led to another .
When Tank No. 2 blew up , the force caused another oxygen tank to malfunction .
Immediately after , two of the craft 's three fuel cells shut down .
Apollo 13 was 200,000 miles ( 321,868 kilometers ) away from home , venting oxygen into space , and its normal supply of electric power , water , oxygen , heat and light had been cut off .
The ingenuity that followed is a testament to the genius of the human mind and spirit .
To conserve whatever power , food , water and oxygen was left , the astronauts aboard Apollo 13 survived on almost no food , water and sleep and in temperatures that dropped to near freezing .
The crew members lost a combined 31.5 pounds ( 14.3 kilograms ) in less than six days .
Meanwhile , the people on duty at NASA 's Mission Control center from April 11 through April 17 found a way to get the men home .
They did months of calculation in days .
They found a way to get the lunar module to support the crew and get the spacecraft back to Earth , although it was never intended for that purpose .
The canisters that removed carbon dioxide from the command module did n't fit the system in the lunar module .
So Mission Control found a way for the astronauts to make them fit using tools they had onboard : cardboard , plastic bags and tape .
Still , with no controls , no extended life support and no navigation system , the biggest problem of all was how to get the craft into a trajectory for an Earth landing .
Apollo 13 had already made the planned adjustments for a moon landing before the initial explosion .
Mission control developed a plan .
The onboard navigation was based on finding a key star .
That system was out .
In three hours , NASA found a way to use the sun instead , a series of calculations that would normally take three months ; and they found a way to use the moon 's pull to get the craft into the right position , because they had to save all of the power for the trip home .
The calculations based on the sun turned out to be accurate to within less than 1 degree .
Apollo 13 rounded the moon and descended toward Earth .
So much condensation had built up on the walls of the lunar module from the days of cold that when the spacecraft finally powered up -- and heated up -- for the trip home , it rained inside the cabin [ source : NASA ] .
Apollo 13 landed successfully on April 17 , 1970 , in the Pacific Ocean .
While all of the astronauts were fine , the spacecraft , of course , was not .
But that was typical for the time .
NASA did n't have a working reusable spacecraft until 1981 , when the first space shuttle , named Columbia , made history .
In CouchDB it ’s possible to query an external service ( I ’ll call it _external from now on ) which returns an HTTP response directly to the client that made the request .
Although this is already quite nice , it was n’t possible to combine such _external requests with a classical _view .
The need for an intersection of _view and _external
Sometimes you ’d like to exclude documents in a more dynamic fashion than a CouchDB _view supports it .
Examples would be geospatial queries , a simple search like “ exclude all documents that do n’t contain a certain string in the title ” or even fulltext searching .
Therefore I ’ve created a new handler called “ _mix ” .
The problem
As _external already exists quite a long time , it was clear that I would reuse the available functionality .
The basic idea is simple : take all documents from a _view and all from _external , intersect them and finally output the result .
The problem is that CouchDB can be used for huge data sets , where you do n’t want to keep a complete _view in memory to perform an intersection .
The goals were :
The output needs to be streamable
Do n’t keep all documents in memory
Use the existing functionality
The implementation
Over the past few months I had lengthy discussions with Paul Davis to find a suitable solution for the problem .
We were going through all our ideas over and over again .
The way I ’ve implemented it now works for me so far , but it is definitely not the ultimate one and only solution , it ’s just some solution .
As most of the functionality already exists , the current API of _view and _external is used .
The difference is that it is POSTed as JSON to the mix handler instead of a GET request .
Here ’s an example with curl :
curl -d ' { " design " : " designdoc " , " view " : { " name " : " viewname " , " query " : { " limit " : " 11 " }} , " external " : { " name " : " minimal " , " query " : { " bbox " : " [ 23,42,46,89 ] " } , " include_docs " : false}} '
http://localhost:5984/yourdb/_mix
At the moment most of the code is just copy and pasted from couch_httpd_view.erl and couch_httpd_external_* with some additional parsing of the POSTed JSON .
The only new thing is that there ’s an _external request before every document of a _view is outputted .
This requests contains either the document ID or the whole document ( if “ include_docs ” is set to “ true ” ) and needs to return “ true ” if the document should be outputted ( or resp . “ false ” if not ) .
I ’ve included a sample _external script which excludes documents randomly ( it can be found at src/ contrib/ minimal_external.py ) .
To have a play with it , you just need to enable _external and add that script .
How to do that can be found in the CouchDB Wiki .
Get it
All you need to do to have some fun with it is checking out my _mix branch at github .
Final words
And finally I ’d like to thank Paul Davis for his time to discuss the issues with the intersection of _view and _external .
Another “ thank you ” goes out to Adam Groves , he discovered a lot of annoyances with the parsing of the queries .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s Supreme Court sentenced a woman to death on Tuesday for killing four and making more than 60 ill by poisoning a large pot of curry at a summer festival in 1998 , a case widely covered in domestic media .
The incident shocked Japan , where crime rates are relatively low and mass killings extremely rare .
Public broadcaster NHK reported the Supreme Court upheld a lower court death sentence on Masumi Hayashi , 47 , for the crime that took place in the western Japanese city of Wakayama .
The Supreme Court called the crime “ cruel and despicable , ” NHK added .
Prosecutors charged Hayashi became enraged after being shunned by her neighbors and put arsenic in the curry when she was alone in the garage where it was being prepared , Japanese media said .
Hayashi has denied being involved in the deaths in recent interviews with several domestic media outlets .
Those are among the associations detailed in personal financial disclosure statements released Friday .
W.H. team discloses TARP firm ties
Lawrence Summers , a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama , pulled in more than $ 2.7 million in speaking fees paid by firms at the heart of the financial crisis , including Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan , Merrill Lynch , Bank of America Corp . and the now - defunct Lehman Brothers .
He pulled in another $ 5.2 million last year from D.E. Shaw , a hedge fund for which he served as managing director from October 2006 until joining the administration .

Thomas E. Donilon , Obama ’s deputy national security adviser , was paid $ 3.9 million last year by the power law firm O’Melveny & Myers to represent clients , including two firms that received federal bailout funds : Citigroup and Goldman Sachs .
He also disclosed that he ’s a member of the Trilateral Commission and sits on the steering committee of the supersecret Bilderberg group .
Both groups are favorite targets of conspiracy theorists .
And White House Counsel Greg Craig last year earned $ 1.7 million in private practice representing an exiled Bolivian president , a Panamanian lawmaker wanted by the U.S. government for allegedly murdering a U.S. soldier and a tech billionaire accused of securities fraud and various sensational drug and sex crimes .
Those are among the associations detailed in personal financial disclosure statements released Friday night by the White House .
The income reported on the forms mostly covers 2008 and in some cases the beginning of 2009 .
Presidential appointees are required to disclose information about their income , assets and investments , and those of their spouses and dependent children , within 60 days of starting work .
And the disclosure forms filed by many appointees to top agency jobs have been available for public inspection for some time , thanks to the federal Freedom of Information Act .
But the White House is largely exempt from the act , and Obama press aides dragged their feet on reporters ’ requests for the disclosure documents filed by officials in the Executive Office of the President .
Craig disclosed that his work for Williams & Connelly included representing Pedro Miguel Gonzalez Pinzon , a Panamanian lawmaker who allegedly murdered a U.S. soldier in 1992 , as well as Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada , a former Bolivian president who has lived in exile since 2003 , when clashes between protesters and the Bolivian military killed an estimated 70 people and wounded hundreds more .
During the presidential campaign , Craig , then serving as a senior foreign policy adviser to Obama , drew flak for representing Sanchez de Lozada .
Craig also listed among his clients Henry Nicholas , founder of microchip maker Broadcom , who is facing securities fraud charges in an alleged stock option backdating plot .
In June , the government unsealed an indictment also detailing a raft of drug and prostitution charges , which Craig called “ a kitchen - sink attack on Dr. Nicholas . ”
Valerie Jarrett , a senior Obama aide , reported $ 852,000 in salary and deferred compensation from Habitat Executive Services , a Chicago real estate development and management firm , plus nearly $ 350,000 in director ’s fees from groups including the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and USG Corp .
She also indicated that she served as vice - chairwoman of the committee seeking to lure the 2016 Olympics to Chicago , which paid a public relations firm owned by Obama political guru David Axelrod and to which White House social director Desiree Rogers , another member of the Obama ’s inner circle , donated more than $ 100,000 .
Other forms showed that White House ethics lawyer Norm Eisen earned $ 1.3 million from the firm in which he was a partner , Zuckerman Spaeder , and press secretary Robert Gibbs earned $ 156,000 from Obama ’s presidential campaign and also owns a pair of rental properties in Alexandria , Va. , worth as much as $ 1 million .

Someone handed me a book the other day - - a cult classic among music geeks -- and urged me to read it , and , when I had finished , sign my name in the front cover .
That way I could be added to the already long list of readers in the front cover , each of whom add added his or her scrawl to the book after having read it .
How charming !
Except for one thing : this is complete violation of the spirit of intellectual property law .
All these readers were sharing the same book instead of buying a new copy .
Think of the revenue lost to the publisher and the royalties lost to the author !
Why , if this gets out of hand , no one will ever write or publish again !
These readers are all pirates and thieves , and they should probably be subject to prosecution .
So goes the rationale behind intellectual property law .
It 's what economists call a " producers ' policy , " design to create maximum revenue for one side of the economic exchange , consumers be damned .
In that sense , it is exactly like trade protection , a short - sighted policy that stymies growth , robs consumers , and subsidies inefficiency .
It 's Bastiat 's " petition of the candlemakers against the sun " all over again .
Apply the IP principle consistently and it's a wonder we tolerate public libraries , where people are encouraged to share the same copy of a book rather than buy a new copy .
Is n't this also an institutionalized form of piracy ?
The defenders of IP would have to admit that it is .
They are often driven to crazy extremes in sticking the claim that copying is a form of theft .
I asked one emphatic correspondent about the ethics of the following case .
I see a guy in a blue shirt and like it , so I respond by wearing one too .
Is this immoral ?
No , he said , because the color blue occurs in nature .
What if a person draws a yellow happy face on the blue shirt ?
Can I copy that ?
No , he said , this would be immoral .
I must ask his permission and gain his consent .
Actually , it 's even worse than the this case suggests .
If even one person had previously worn a blue shirt with a happy face , no one else on the planet would be able to do that without seeking consent .
It should be obvious that if everyone were required to ask seek the permission for the use of every infinitely reproducible thing that " belongs " to someone else -- every word , phrase , look , vocal inflection , chord progression , arrangement of letters , hair style , technique , or whatever -- or if we were really to suppose that only person may possess the unique instant of any of these things , civilization would come to a grinding halt .
A young couple who tried to elope in one of the most lawless and conservative parts of Afghanistan have been publicly executed by Taliban gunmen after their parents handed them over to be tried by insurgents .
Officials from the south - western province of Nimroz say Gul Pecha , in her late teens , and her boyfriend Abdul Aziz , 21 , were shot by a firing squad outside a mosque in their home village of Lokhi on Monday .
The couple had fled to a nearby village and were planning to start a life together without the permission of their parents , according to the province 's police chief Abdul Jabar Pardeli .
But they were found by their parents and turned over to the Taliban , who held them for four days in Lokhi 's mosque before putting them on trial .
Ghulam Dastageer Azad , the governor of Nimroz , said the couple 's execution was " against Islam , against the law and against the constitution " .
An unofficial justice system , often dispensing brutal punishment to people found guilty of petty crimes or breaking the Taliban 's strict interpretation of Islamic values , has become the hallmark of areas where insurgents enjoy a high degree of influence .
A recent report by a human rights group said the Taliban systematically terrorise civilians with threatening " night letters " , executions and limb amputations in order to force communities not to support the government .
Taliban commanders are even issued with manuals telling them what techniques to use and who to target .
Officials say the couple 's home district of Khash Rod is under almost complete Taliban control .
Sadiq Chakhansor , the head of the provincial council , said he thought the couple were intending to flee to Iran , where many young people from the region grew up as refugees , enjoying a relatively liberal environment before returning to their much more restrictive homeland .
Although the provincial governor , chief of police and leader of the local council all claimed Taliban gunmen were responsible for the murders , a spokesman for the movement denied Taliban involvement .
" I have contacted our fighters in the area and I can say that none of them were involved , " said Qari Yousuf Ahmadi .
" But it was a very bad thing for these people to escape from their homes without permission and it is right that they should be punished according to Sharia law . "
There are almost no Afghan or foreign troops in Khash Rod , which is seen as a resting area and a passageway for militants moving through into neighbouring Helmand province where most of Britain 's effort in the country is directed .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a high school football coach who had been forbidden to join in pregame prayers led by his student athletes .
New Jersey high school football coach Marcus Borden had hoped the Supreme Court would take up his appeal .
The justices without comment on Monday refused to take up the appeal of Marcus Borden .
At issue was a school district policy that banned coaches or adults from participating in prayers initiated and conducted by students .
Borden sued officials in East Brunswick , New Jersey , after they ordered him to stop bowing his head and " taking a knee " as a sign of respect while his players prayed in the locker room before games .
He said such gestures were secular in nature , but the school said that as a municipal employee , Borden 's actions could be seen as government endorsement of religion , potentially subjecting the school to lawsuits or sanctions .
The school district said the coach had a long history of leading such prayers , even after complaints from several parents .
Officials in their appeal said Borden even arranged a chaplain for team dinners .
He had been coach of the East Brunswick Bears since 1983 but quit more than three years ago after refusing to comply with the school directive .
He compiled a 116 - 100 - 1 record .
A federal appeals court agreed the state policy was constitutional and that the school board had the authority to ban school employees from participating in prayer activities .
The Supreme Court 46 years ago banned school - sponsored prayer recited at the beginning of the class day .
Similar " moment of silence " laws , designed for students to engage in mediation or voluntary prayer , also were ruled unconstitutional when the purpose was viewed as a roundabout way to promote religion or return prayer to public schools .
Such a ban was reaffirmed in 1992 in a case involving prayer at school - sponsored assemblies .
Justice Anthony Kennedy concluded , " The Constitution forbids the state to exact religious conformity from a student as the price of attending her own high school graduation . "
In 2000 , a high court majority banned prayers at public high school football games , even if they were student - led and initiated .
The case involved Texas students using loudspeakers to conduct pregame prayers with the team and spectators .
Justice John Paul Stevens in that case concluded such a pregame prayer " has the improper effect of coercing those present to participate in an act of religious worship . "
Student - led prayers in the Borden case , according to the trial record , were conducted privately in the team locker room .
The case is Borden v. School District of the Township of East Brunswick ( 08 - 842 ) .

Sri Lanka 's forces are on orders only to take defensive action if necessary A temporary 48 - hour ceasefire seems to be holding in north - east Sri Lanka .
The army says that its troops have halted offensive operations and have not come under fire from the Tamil Tiger rebels .
The truce which came into effect at midnight ( 1830 GMT Sunday ) is meant to allow civilians to leave the conflict zone safely .
Pro-rebel sources said the truce was an " insult " and the aim was " imprisonment of civilians by the state " .
The UN has welcomed the pause as a chance to help civilians and deliver aid .
See map of the region Sri Lanka 's authorities have been under growing international pressure to allow time for tens of thousands of trapped civilians to leave the war zone safely , the BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan reports from the capital , Colombo .
The military says it has captured the entire Tamil Tiger - held territory in the north and pushed the rebels into a government - designated safe zone for civilians .
Separately , Sri Lanka says it has stripped former mediator Norway of a role in any peace process .
' A good first step ' Sri Lankan troops fighting the Tamil Tigers have been told to fire only if attacked .

A military spokesman told the BBC there had been no reports of any major fighting since the truce was called .
However , one soldier was killed and another injured in two separate incidents .
The spokesman said the army did not retaliate .
He said only a handful of civilians had left the safe zone on Monday morning .
Our correspondent says it is unclear what the government 's next move will be after the end of the two - day period .
The defence ministry says security forces have surrounded the no-fire zone on all three sides and troops are poised to enter the area to rescue civilians .
The pro-rebel TamilNet web site said the government 's move was " a mockery of a ceasefire " .
" The insulting ' festival diplomacy ' announcement of [ President Mahinda ] Rajapaksa was aiming for the imprisonment of civilians by the state , " it said , adding that the army wanted the " complete surrender of the Tigers " .
The main message [ to the Tigers ] has been ' please end the suffering of the people by allowing them to leave if they wish to leave '
John Holmes ,
UN humanitarian envoy " Rajapaksa knows very well that none of his expectations will take place , " the web site said .
President Rajapaksa had called the truce after a cabinet meeting .
Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama told the BBC that government forces would not engage in any offensive operations during the two - day Sinhala and Tamil New Year period .
UN humanitarian envoy John Holmes told the BBC he hoped the truce would mean more aid being allowed into the conflict zone .
" We would have liked a longer pause than this , a genuine humanitarian pause of a longer period than two days but this is a good first step , " he added .
Mr Holmes said he had spoken to Tiger representatives and urged them to let civilians go .
" The main message has been ' please end the suffering of the people by allowing them to leave if they wish to leave ' . "
Thousands of people , mostly Tamils , have been protesting in Western capitals to demand a full ceasefire .
Demonstrators occupied the Sri Lankan embassy in Oslo for a brief time on Sunday , Norwegian police said .
The government later apologised for failing to stop the crowd , put at about 100 .
However on Monday , Sri Lanka said Norway would no longer have any peace mediation role .
Norway helped broker a ceasefire in 2002 .
It later broke down and as the monitoring mission wrapped up its work at the start of last year , the new move is mainly symbolic .
Norway angered Sri Lanka recently by arranging a telephone call between a UN envoy and a Tamil Tiger representative .

The raging drug war in Mexico is about to command even greater attention inside the United States .
It ’s not just the gruesome tales of drug cartel violence to the south ; the US is far more caught up in the maelstrom than many north of the border may care to realize .
Today at the White House , Homeland Security Sec. Janet Napolitano laid out an Obama administration plan to throw additional money and manpower at the problem , amid mounting fears about “ spillover ” of violence and corruption into the United States .
On Wednesday , Napolitano will go to Capitol Hill specifically to address the crisis , while Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Mexico .
The administration is deploying big guns like Napolitano and Clinton with good reason .
As the Wall Street Journal reported recently , “ The government is girding for a possible Katrina - style disaster along the 2,000 - mile - long Mexican border that would involve thousands of refugees flooding into the US to escape surging violence in northern Mexico , or gun battles beginning to routinely spill across the border . ”
A recent story from international reporting start - up GlobalPost shows how joint US - Mexican operations have been implicated in the spreading violence , on both sides of the border .
Some relatively obscure testimony by senior officials from the ATF and DEA to a Senate subcommittee last week contains stark details about our country ’s role in the predicament .
Simply put , the US is serving as a vast weapons depot for the drug gangs .
Because firearms are not readily available in Mexico , cash - wielding drug traffickers have gone north to obtain many thousands of them .
According to the law enforcement leaders ’ testimony , 90 percent of traceable seized weapons have come from the United States .
The ATF reports disrupting the flow of more than 12,800 guns to Mexico since 2004 .
The weapons are n’t just coming from the US border region .
The law enforcement leaders cited a case from April 2008 in which 13 warring gang members were killed and five wounded : “ ATF assisted Mexican authorities in tracing 60 firearms recovered at the crime scene in Tijuana , ” they said .
“ As a result , leads have been forward to ATF field divisions in Denver , Houston , Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Phoenix , San Francisco and Seattle . ”
Sources of the weapons , they said , “ typically include secondary markets , such as gun shows and flea markets since — depending on State law — the private sale of firearms at those venues often does not require background checks prior to the sale or record keeping . ”
Military weapons are also a growing problem : “ In the past six months we have noted a troubling increase in the number of grenades , which are illegal to possess and sell , seized from or used by drug traffickers , and we are concerned about the possibility of explosives - related violence spilling into U.S. border towns . ”
Given that the global war on drugs is a proven failure , there was another striking aspect of the testimony :
The top revenue generator for the Mexican cartels is n’t cocaine , heroin or other hard stuff .
It ’s… marijuana .
Napolitano ’s message today included the assertion that the Obama administration is “ renewing our commitment to reduce the demand for illegal drugs here at home . ”
That comes on the heels of Attorney General Eric Holder ’s announcing that the federal government will no longer prosecute medical marijuana dispensaries in California and other states where they are legal under state law .
With the prospect of a day trip to Ciudad Juarez looking increasingly like a visit to Kabul , and with the violence ricocheting northward , perhaps those who have been advocating fundamental changes in the nation ’s marijuana laws will start to see some political traction for their ideas .

Quote : Chief progressing after a controversial article on 9 / 11
28 . April 2009 kl. 11:11
An article about the explosives in the World Trade Center was brought in a scientific journal without the editors were aware of it .
Now she draws , she tells the videnskab.dk .
By Thomas Hoffman
People in New York took the legs on his back , because dust cloud from the combination controlled the World Trade Center flew through the streets .
A controversial article on the dust will now have a chief to run the almost equally well to get away from her journal .
( Photo : Remko van Dokkum )
It caused great sensation , surprise and suspicion , as the journal The Open Chemical Physics Journal in April published a scientific article on the remnants of nanotermit , which had to be found in large quantities of dust from the World Trade Center .
One of the most surprised is apparently chief editor of the magazine .
Professor Marie - Paule Pileni hear the first article as videnskab.dk write to her to ask for her professional assessment of the content of the article .
This email will get her right away to slam the door to the magazine .
" I resign as the editor in chief , says the short answer in an email to videnskab.dk .
Printed without permission
A phone call reveals that chief Marie - Paule Pileni never been informed that the article would be put at The Open Chemical Physics Journal , which is published by the journal juggernaut Bentham Science Publishers .
" They have printed the article without my authorization else , so when you wrote to me , I did not mean that the article was published .
I can not accept , and I have written to Bentham , that I withdraw myself from all activities with them , " says Marie - Paule Pileni , which daily is a professor specializing in nanomaterials at the prestigious Université Pierre et Marie Curie in France .
She feels not only snigløbet but wonder also that the article on dust tests after the terrorist attack on U.S. 11 September 2001 have actually found their way to The Open Chemical Physics Journal .
" I can not accept that the issue is put in my journal .
The article is not about physical chemistry or chemical physics , and I could well believe that there is a political point of view behind the publication .
If anyone had asked me , I would say that the article should never have been published in this journal .
Sentence , " notes the former chief .
Dumpekarakter the journal
Chief Editor 's dramatic departure gives critics an extra reason to doubt the article 's conclusions , but Marie - Paule Pilini points out that because the issue is outside her expertise , she can not judge whether the article itself is good or bad .
In return get her publication to The Open Chemical Physics Journal dumpekarakter .
" I was really unsure about them in advance because I had repeatedly asked for information about the magazine without hearing from them .
It does not appear in the list of international journals and is a bad sign .
Now I see that it is because it is a bad magazine , " says Marie - Paule Pileni and continues :
" There are no references to The Open Chemical Physics Journal of other articles .
I have two colleagues who agreed to publish an article that never has been quoted anywhere .
If nobody reads it , it is bad magazine , and there is no need for it , " reads the harsh verdict .
The professor says that she a few years ago were invited to be editor of the journal , which would open new opportunities for new researchers , and because she supports the idea of open journals in which articles are accessible to all , she said yes .
" It is important to let people try to succeed , but we must not be allowed to all , and this is something decidedly rubbish .
I try to be a serious researcher , and I do not want my name associated with this kind , " ends Marie - Paule Pileni .
Does not alter the study
" It surprised me , and it is unfortunate if it discredits our work .
But her departure will not alter our conclusions , because it is a purely human thing , she is sur over .
I still believe that we have made chemical physics , and if there is something wrong with our investigation , she must love to criticize us for it , " said Niels Harrit , Associate Professor of Chemistry Institute of the University of Copenhagen .
The Niels Harrit co Steve Jones who has been in charge of contacts with Bentham , and so is the Danish researcher not offhand know what the editor responsible under the group have communicated with .
He knows to turn the names of two researchers - called referees - who have rated the article , but he would not disclose their names because they are ' in principle anonymous .
Dane withdrew from the magazine
Niels Harrit overall at the University of Copenhagen Nils O. Andersen itself has been in the pool of researchers who could be designated as under editor - ' editor ' - in an article that was published in The Open Chemical Physics Journal .
He has recently decided to withdraw from the journal ' Editorial Advisory Board .
He said to videnskab.dk that the decision has nothing to do with Niels Harrit article and that he in fact did not have time to make any experience with the magazine so that he can not throw further light on how the magazine works .
' Open access is an exciting development and principle should test the idea , because there is no reason why commercial publishers make money on our work .
But professional journal was the edge of my expertise , and since I had no thanks for being editor of two articles , I decided that I would rather spend my time on something else , " says physicist Nils O. Andersen , dean of Faculty of Science and editor at The European Physical Journal D.
It has not yet been possible to get a comment from Bentham Science Publishers .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
A suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to a crowded Shiite mosque just south of the capital on Sunday , killing at least 26 people .
It was the third suicide attack in Pakistan in 24 hours , in a sign that the Pakistani Taliban are overwhelming the nation ’s security forces .
The assault south of the capital , Islamabad , appeared to be carefully planned .
It took place in Chakwal , a town that has historically had strong ties to the Pakistani Army , and in a Shiite mosque .
The Pakistani Taliban have increasingly attacked Shiite mosques .
The latest bombing occurred about 12 hours after a suicide bomber struck in an upper - class neighborhood of Islamabad on Saturday night , killing eight paramilitary security officers assigned to guard foreign diplomats and wealthy residents .
On Saturday morning , a suicide bomber drove his vehicle into a group of civilians on the side of the road in Miram Shah , in North Waziristan , killing at least eight people , including schoolchildren .
In a telephone interview on Sunday , Hakimullah Mehsud , a powerful deputy to Baitullah Mehsud , the leader of the Pakistani Taliban , said the Taliban were responsible for the suicide attacks in Islamabad and Chakwal .
If there were ever a film ripe for the picking , in terms of movie piracy , it would 've been " Taken , " the Liam Neeson - starring thriller from 20th Century
Fox that has become the year 's biggest action hit , rolling up $ 109 million since its debut on Super Bowl weekend .
The movie has shown legs of steel , especially for an action film , opening at $ 24.7 million and averaging a drop - off of 19 % in the four weekends since its release , an amazingly modest number in an era where most action films suffer drops of 50 % or more after their initial release .
But the real reason " Taken " should have been a prime target for pirates is that it was released in almost every corner of the globe long before it arrived in America .
Produced by Luc Besson , France 's new action impresario , " Taken " was released in a host of countries , including France , China , South Korea and the Netherlands , way , way back in the spring of 2008 .
It arrived in much of the rest of the world -- including Australia , Italy , Russia , Brazil and the United Kingdom - - last fall , having done more than $ 70 million in overseas business .
In fact , " Taken " has been out so long that it was available on DVD in many countries before it arrived in theaters in the U.S .
So if piracy is such a dire threat to the movie business , as the Motion Picture Assn. of America is so - o - o - o - o - o- o fond of saying , how could " Taken " have had the world 's healthiest theatrical run in America , if pirated copies were clearly readily available virtually anywhere in the world ?
It seems to put a big dent in the MPAA 's operating assumptions about piracy .
But maybe , just maybe , I 'm wrong here .
To hear the other side of the story , I called up someone who 's a lot smarter than I am , Fox Co-Chairman Jim Gianopulos , whose studio released " Taken " and has been the industry 's leader in various anti-piracy efforts .
Gianopulos not only practices what he preaches ( he assures me that all of the thousands of blues songs on his iPod were downloaded legally ) but he had an intriguing explanation for how " Taken " escaped being ravaged by piracy .
" Here 's the simple way to put it , " he said , " When nobody knows what something is , nobody cares about stealing it .
You really only get pirated copies of movies online after you 've created the film 's value by putting it out into the marketplace . "
So even though " Taken " was a hit in many overseas territories , it was still an unknown quantity in America until Fox ramped up its marketing campaign for the film in the weeks leading up to its Jan. 30 release .
" You could actually say that this example puts a real focus on our dilemma , " he continued .
" The problem only comes when we spend tens of millions of dollars creating a presence and an enticing appeal for the film .
That 's when the pirates rush in to fill the void .
But until we did the marketing push , the film really did n't have the recognition here that it had in the rest of the world . "
I 'm not sure I 'm entirely convinced .
That would account for why the movie was n't pirated before its opening weekend .
But once
Fox 's marketing push established the film as a must - see action hit , why did n't piracy cut into its business during its third and fourth week of release ?
As I mentioned earlier , the film did n't do all its business in its opening weekend -- it still ranks No. 3 in the midweek box - office charts , which means people who presumably could have stayed home and watched a pirated copy are still flocking to the theaters .
Does anyone else have a theory about what 's happening here ?
If you have a smart explanation , please share it with us .
I think there 's more here than meets the eye .

MOVIE PIRACY LINKED TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM :
Politicians and communities from across the religious divide united yesterday in condemnation of dissident republican paramilitaries who shot dead two British soldiers outside their barracks near Antrim hours before their regiment was due to leave the province for a tour of duty in Afghanistan .
In a historic moment for Northern Ireland , Sinn Féin 's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness last night backed the police manhunt and denounced the attackers .
McGuinness , the deputy first minister , said : " I was a member of the IRA , but that war is over now .
The people responsible for last night 's incident are clearly signalling that they want to resume or restart that war .
Well , I deny their right to do that . "
In an emotional interview , he said : " I will stand for all democrats against their attempts to plunge us back into conflict ; to see soldiers on the streets ; to see more checkpoints ; to see houses being raided and to see people being dragged back to interrogation centres .
Those days are over .
They can never come back again . "
In an unprecedented statement , Adams said : " Sinn Féin has a responsibility to be consistent .
The logic of this is that we support the police in the apprehension of those involved in last night 's attack . "
As political leaders denounced the attack and pledged to keep the peace process on track , it emerged that the soldiers from 38 Engineer Regiment had been dressed in their desert fatigues , ready to fly to Afghanistan .
Two were killed and four other people injured after machine gun fire opened up on the barracks entrance as two cars brought a delivery of pizzas to the soldiers , who had ordered the food after being told their flight was delayed .
The two soldiers , from London and Birmingham , were shot again as their attackers stood over them .
The two pizza delivery men were among those injured , one critically .
Last night a reporter working for the Sunday Tribune in Belfast received a call with a recognised code word said to be from the Real IRA , claiming responsibility for the attack .
The same organisation claimed responsibility for the Omagh bombing which killed 29 people in 1998 .
In its statement , the Real IRA said it did not apologise for shooting the pizza delivery workers , because they had been " collaborating " with the British army .
The main road past Massereene barracks was reopened last night and more floral tributes were gathering beneath the two - storey security tower at the entrance to the military base .
The attack on Sunday night was the first time British troops had been killed in Northern Ireland by terrorists since 1997 .
But Northern Ireland has been on alert over the growing threat from an estimated 200-300 dissidents thought to be active in the province .
Sir Hugh Orde , head of the police service in Northern Ireland , confirmed last week that the level of threat from the Real IRA and other groups was at critical level , the highest since he took charge seven years ago .
Sunday morning prayers at churches across Antrim town were cut short as congregations came together in an ecumenical show of solidarity .
Hundreds walked silently to the edge of the police cordon and stood together amid floral tributes at the Massereene barracks .
The attack was condemned by the prime minister , Gordon Brown , as ministers made a concerted effort to dismiss it as the product of a small , self - obsessed group of thugs with no political support in Northern Ireland .
More Than 600 Architects Say 9/11 an Inside Job By Mark Anderson IRVINE , Calif .
—Noted San Francisco architect Richard Gage told the audience at Freedom Law School ’s annual health and freedom conference recently that his organization , Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth , is growing quickly and now has more than 600 structural experts who have grave doubts about the official story of what happened to the three World Trade Center buildings that were destroyed in New York City on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER VIDEO
AFP INTERVIEWS RICHARD GAGE OF ARCHITECTS FOR 9/11 TRUTH
“ We hope to have 1,000 members by September and have over 600 now , ” said Gage , a successful architect whose projects dot the California landscape .
The audience heard Gage describe the many problems with the official version , not the least of which is that fire is an “ organic process ” that could not have caused the symmetrical ( uniform ) destruction of the 110 - story Twin Towers that morning , and the fall of the 47 - story Soloman Brothers Building ( Building 7 ) more than six hours later .
These three buildings were part of the Rockefeller - inspired WTC complex , consisting of seven buildings on 16 acres .
Gage noted that the vaunted National Institute for Safety and Technology ( NIST ) study of the WTC buildings did not even look at the voluminous evidence of a controlled demolition of the three structures on 9 - 11 , so it ’s not as if the evidence was examined by NIST and declared inconclusive .
NIST instead only examined the event “ up to the point of collapse ” and went no further .
Thus , there is no way the government can objectively assess the entire catastrophic event .
“ How can you find what you are not looking for ? ”
Gage asked , adding that various forces that can destroy buildings — including fire and earthquakes — have obvious characteristics .
Fire does not devour a structure uniformly because it randomly branches out wherever there is , say , furniture and other “ fuel ” to consume .
Gage said the melting point of structural steel is around 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit , and that the short - duration Twin Tower fires reached no more than 1,400 degrees F ( although NIST claimed it reached 1,800 F ) .
So for the government to say that burning jet fuel within the Twin Towers not only uniformly melted structural steel to the point of collapse — but brought the huge buildings down at near freefall speed — is the height of absurdity , not to mention that it is categorically impossible for fire to pulverize concrete .
More than 90,000 tons of concrete was pulverized mid-air , along with metal decking .
Blast waves blew out windows in buildings 400 feet away .
That third building that many Americans still are only dimly aware of , Building 7 , really drives this issue home , in Gage ’s view .
“ Well , the 600 architects I represent are most concerned about the freefall collapse of Building 7 , the third skyscraper [ that was ] not hit by an airplane to fall on the afternoon of 9/11 .
This is a 47 - story skyscraper that in the first hundred feet of its fall is falling at freefall speed .
This is acknowledged by NIST .
That ca n’t happen unless the structure [ underneath ] is removed .
There is no resistance from the structure to that fall in the first 2.25 seconds .
So this of great concern .
Of course it falls symmetrically almost at freefall speed and collapses thereafter — the whole building is destroyed in 6.5 seconds , ” as he told AFP in an exclusive interview .
He added : “ NIST . . . claims that we have 10 fires [ in Building 7 ] , one of which was ‘ roaring ’ . . . and [ the fires ] ‘ expanded the beams , ’ knocking a girder off its seat and causing ‘ an internal cascading collapse ’ — which is ludicrous because we would have seen all kinds of deformation on the perimeter structure .
Anyway , they claim fires brought this building down , but fire is an organic process that does n’t bring buildings down symmetrically at freefall speed , in the manner of a classic controlled demolition .
So that ’s the No. 1 key point of evidence . ”
As for the Twin Towers , he said there are “ many similar features of controlled demolition , but very different as well .
It ’s explosive .
Everything is being ejected outside of the footprint – 95 percent of the debris .
Four - ton perimeter wall units are being hurled laterally 600 feet , which takes 55 miles per hour instant acceleration out of the sides of the tower .
Now underneath all three buildings we have several tons of molten metal [ which stayed hot for several weeks ] which is not created by jet fuel or office fires or anything else .
Where does all this come from ?
We have video evidence , photographic evidence .
The official government reports do n’t even talk about it ; nor do they talk about the dozens of explosions heard by 118 witnesses recorded orally by the chief fire commissioner of the City of New York . ”
Gage continued : “ It ’s extraordinary what we do n’t have in the [ NIST ] report , and that ’s what we focus on in Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth .
In addition in the towers we have 110 floors of four - inch thick concrete ; they are an acre in size each .
We ’re looking for some of those floors at the bottom of the pile .
The photographs do n’t reveal any of them — just a pile of debris two or three stories high . ”
“ Where did the ‘ pancakes ’ go ? ” AFP then asked Gage , referring to the government ’s “ pancake ” theory , wherein the heavy collapsing floors from the top overwhelmed the structure below and “ pancaked ” down to the bottom .
Counting both towers , 220 floors were missing on that “ Black Tuesday . ”
“ That ’s what we ’re looking for is pancakes , ” he replied .
“ We ’ve got the ‘ syrup , ’ we have no pancakes .
The ‘ syrup ’ is the molten metal . ”
He went on to say : “ Also we are looking at explosions that occurred 20 , 40 and 60 stories down — below the collapsing building !
Where are they coming from ?
NIST says they are ‘ puffs of air ’ because there are piledrivers pushing down the building and that air has to come out somewhere , right ?
They are not puffs of air ; they are pulverized building materials and they occur at 160 to 200 feet per second .
These are propelled by explosive speeds . ”
As determined by former Brigham Young physicist Steven Jones — and reiterated by Gage — the telltale signs of an ultra - hot incendiary known as thermite ( which becomes thermate with sulfur added ) were found in the dust at 4 - 5 distinct locations in New York .
Thermite can reach temperatures of 4,500 F and can be explosive when it ’s souped up .
Microspheres formed from molten iron constitute some of the evidence , as well as red chips comprised of unignited thermite .
Gage believes that nano - thermite is the most likely culprit , since it is a “ quieter ” but ultra-powerful explosive .
“ Al Qaeda probably did not have access to these buildings or to thermite ( or thermate ) , which was not made in a cave in Afghanistan , ” Gage commented , adding , however , that his organization [ www.AE911truth.org] does not formally probe who the perpetrators were .
But he fears whoever pulled it off could do it again because the truth has long been suppressed , leaving Americans vulnerable .
Gage ’s group supports a new , genuine investigation , whereas the official “ investigation ” did not even include establishing a crime scene at the WTC complex and ended with the official 9/11 Commission report that does even mention Building 7 .

What to do when someone wo n’t let you pass .
After a long three - year absence , the battle - scarred Confederate veteran of the American Civil War , Ethan Edwards , turns up on the remote and dusty Texan homestead of his brother , Aaron .
In high hopes of finding peace , instead , the taciturn former soldier will embark on a treacherous five - year odyssey of retribution , when the ruthless Chief Scar 's murderous Comanche raiding party massacre his family , burn the ranch to the ground and abduct his nine - year - old niece , Debbie .
Driven by hatred of Indians , Ethan and his young companion , Martin Pawley , ride through the unforgiving desert to track down their lost Debbie ; however , is the woman they lost and the prisoner in Scar 's teepee still the same woman the searchers seek ?

This Academy Award - winning actress , model and singer was born in Hawaii .
A high school dropout , she landed her first film role at age 16 .
She often plays cold , emotionally vacant characters .
She is scared of butterflies .
She currently holds the record for the most money paid per minute to an actor .
Who is she ?
Continue reading for the answer .
Nicole Kidman , known as one of Hollywood 's top Australian imports , was actually born in Honolulu , Hawaii , to Australian parents , giving her dual citizenship in the U.S. and Australia .
Kidman dropped out of high school to pursue acting full - time , and landed her first film role at age 16 , in the Australian holiday favorite Bush Christmas ( 1983 ) .
On her fear of butterflies Kidman is quoted as saying , " It 's so bizarre , I 'm not scared of snakes or spiders .
But I 'm scared of butterflies .
There is something eerie about them .
Something weird ! "
A three - minute commercial produced for Chanel No. 5 perfume made Kidman the record holder for the most money paid per minute to an actor after she reportedly earned $ 12 million for the 3 minute advertisement .

Throughout the Pirate Bay trial , which ended last week in a guilty verdict , the defendants posed on multiple occasions that Google could be used to find illegal torrent files – not just the Pirate Bay .
“ Bit torrent technology can be used for both legal and illegal means on Pirate Bay in the same way as by Google or MySpace , ” said defense lawyer Jonas Nilsson on the closing day of the trial .
The prosecution , and subsequently the judge , did n’t buy the argument and found the Pirate Bay guilty for its crimes against the entertainment industry .
Now someone who is out to prove that Google could be torrent - finding engine has made a simple tweak to a search string and has launched a site called the Pirate Google .
Entering a search term into the text field and hitting the go button will add the switch “ filetype: torrent ” and send the request to Google .
The search engine then results of the specific file type – voila , a torrent search engine using the completely legal Google .
The site makes its intentions clear with a note on its page , which reads :
Please Note :
This site is not affiliated with Google , it simply makes use of Google Custom Search to restrict your searches to Torrent files .
You can do this with any regular Google search by appending your query with filetype : torrent .
This technique can be used for any type of file supported by Google .
The intention of this site is to demonstrate the double standard that was exemplified in the recent Pirate Bay Trial .
Sites such as Google offer much the same functionality as The Pirate Bay and other Bit Torrent sites but are not targeted by media conglomerates such as the IFPI as they have the political and legal clout to defend themselves unlike these small independent sites .
This site is created in support of an open , neutral internet accessible and equitable to all regardless of political or financial standing .

On his detention and interrogation policies , Obama faces two right - wing critiques .
They are equally wrong , I believe , and also contradict each other .
The first is Cheney's :
Once you go into a wartime situation and it's a strategic threat , then you use all of your assets to go after the enemy .
You go after the state sponsors of terror , places where they 've got sanctuary .
You use your intelligence resources , your military resources , your financial resources , everything you can in order to shut down that terrorist threat against you .
When you go back to the law enforcement mode , which I sense is what they 're doing , closing Guantanamo and so forth , that they are very much giving up that center of attention and focus that 's required , and that concept of military threat that is essential if you 're going to successfully defend the nation against further attacks .
The second is a version of Victor Davis Hanson :
Guantanamo is still open , but there are no longer " enemy combatants " there ( Perhaps the name of the camp can be changed next ? ) ...
And this , rhetorically putting words into Obama 's mouth :
“ On matters of protecting civil liberties , I assure the American people that I have examined the Patriot Act , the FISA accords , and renditions and I have discovered that they , in fact , do not shred our Constitution .
I will , however , shut down Guantanamo Bay but must keep it open another year and appoint a task force to study the issue . "
The first critique is that Obama has taken the country back to an entirely pre-9/11 footing , and is abandoning the notion of a war against Jihadist terrorists altogether .
The second is that he is continuing Bush - Cheney policies but does n't have the intellectual honesty to say so .
Whatever else one might say about these two arguments , offered often in tandem on the right , the first thing to note is that they can not both be correct .
It 's still early days in the administration and the reviews of a complex policy thoroughly integrated over seven years into the federal bureaucracy have yet to be completed .
But we can say , I think , two things .
The first is that Obama absolutely has retained the concept of war as the definition of what he is doing against Jihadism .
That 's why rendition - not extraordinary rendition to torturers - but rendition of potentially lethal terrorists not easily or quickly prosecuted through the criminal law has been retained .
That 's why the Obama peeps have defended the right of the president to detain prisoners under the laws of war , at Gitmo temporarily , and elsewhere .
That 's why drone attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan continue .
So Cheney is simply misleading in a self - serving and lazy way .
Surprise !
The 2009 season sees the introduction of the most radical new rules to hit F1 in a generation .
Here ’s a quick guide to the major changes in the sporting and technical rules , including some potentially significant tweaks which have n’t had much attention .
Sporting
Drivers can only use eight engines during the ( 17 - race ) season .
If they have to use a ninth engine they will have a ten - pace grid penalty at the first race where they use it , and further similar penalties will follow if additional engines are used .
The pit lane speed limit in qualifying and the race has been raised from 80 kph ( 49.7 mph ) to 100 kph ( 62.1 mph ) .
All teams must declare the starting weights of their cars within two hours of qualifying finishing .
If a race starts behind the safety car , drivers must start the race on wet weather tyres .
The rules on what a team can do to a car which is starting the race from the pit lane have been changed ?
����ǣ teams can now make changes to ?���?�improve driver comfort ?���?� and the driver may do a reconnaissance lap .
The rule preventing drivers from being able to pit during a safety car until permitted to do so has been scrapped .
The FIA will now appoint three stewards per race ( instead of two ) , one of which will not have a vote .
It may also appoint an advisor as it did in 2008 ( Alan Donnelly ) .
The teams cannot do more than 15,000 km of testing and may not test between the first race of the season and the last day of the year .
There are two major exceptions : teams can do up to eight days of straight - line aerodynamics testing , and after the last race of the season they have three days in which they may test young drivers .
NB .
Distribution of points remains the same as in 2008 ( 10- 8-6-5-4-3 - 2 - 1 ) despite the FIA ?
������s recent attempt to introduce a system where the driver with the most wins would become world champion .
Technical
Grooved tyres have been replaced by slicks .
The tyres known as ?���?�standard wets ?
������ last year are now called ?���?�intermediates ?������ and ?���?�extreme wets ?������ are called ?���?�wets?������ .
At each race the softer of the two dry compounds available and the wet weather tyres will be marked with green rings .
Teams may use Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems ( KERS ) but it is not compulsory and they may run KERS and non-KERS cars at different races .
KERS may give them a power boost of up to 400 kilojoules per lap which roughly equals 82 bhp for 6.6 seconds , though the power could be used in different ways .
If a driver abandons their cars its KERS must be switched off .
KERS may be charged before the start of the race .
Engines may not exceed 18,000rpm ( reduced from 19,000 ) .
The cars ?
������ front wings may be adjusted while the car is moving a maximum of twice per lap by a maximum of six degrees .
There are new restrictions on the aerodynamic shape of the cars : front wings may now be wider , rear wings are narrower and taller , and many of the winglets and flip - ups that used to be on the cars have been banned .
Diffusers are more tightly limited in size and shape .
The cars must now have four onboard camera housings instead of two , so hopefully we should see more interested TV pictures this year !
How do you think the new rules for 2009 will affect the competition ?
Will cars be able to follow each other more closely ?
Will KERS cause more retirements ?
Have your say in the comments .

Cloaking devices and metamaterials are hot topics in the realm of science where optics blurs into materials science .
By crafting materials that can interact with specific wavelengths of light , researchers have been able to steer that light around small objects , essentially cloaking the object at those wavelengths .
The problem so far is that many of these materials are very specific about the wavelengths they work at , and none of those were in the visible spectrum .
Now , researchers have designed a cloaking material that operates across a range of the near - infrared , and suggest it should be possible to bring things down to the visible spectrum .
The material was used in a test setup that 's similar to one that was used in past work in the microwave range .
The setup can basically be described as a mirror with a bump .
When light hits it directly , the bump acts a bit like a funhouse mirror , distorting the reflection .
The cloaking device can be put down on top of the bump and steer light waves in a way that makes it look as if neither the bump nor the cloak were there , producing reflections as if there were a smooth , undistorted mirror in place .
It 's simple in principle , but actually steering the light waves is quite challenging .
Metamaterials can do the job , but only within a fairly narrow range of wavelengths , and some mathematical calculations suggest that doing much better than that might be impossible .
To create a cloak , the researchers had to craft a material with a carefully controlled index of refraction .
They did that by carefully drilling an irregular lattice of holes in a silicon substrate — the arrangement of the holes was calculated using what the authors term quasi- conformal mapping , and the holes were kept smaller than the wavelength of the incident light .
Once fabricated , the object was coated in gold in order to give it a reflective surface .
The authors found that their device could successfully cloak the bump in their test setup .
It did n't reflect the incident light with full efficiency ( only 58 percent efficiency was obtained ) , but the loss was ascribed to defects in the material rather than an inevitable outcome of the technique .
The most striking feature of their device , however , was the fact that it was effective across a wide range of wavelengths , from 1,400nm to 1,800nm .
All of that 's in the infrared range , but it 's not too far from the visible spectrum .
The dropoff below 1,400 nm is also a product of the fact that the wavelength of light is approaching the size of the holes drilled in the cloaking device ; smaller holes would drop things down into the visible range , provided the manufacturing technique was sufficiently precise .
It looks like there is going to be a race to visible wavelengths , too .
At the end of the publication , there 's a " note added in proof , " which typically is used to recognize the publication of related material during the awkward period between when a paper has passed peer review and before it 's formatted for publication .
This note points to a document which has been deposited in the arXiv that describes a related cloaking device .
Many details of that second publication are the same — using a " carpet " style cloak , made of a silicon - on - insulator material , that masks the presence of an underlying bump — but there are two key differences .
For one , instead of holes , the authors take the opposite approach , fashioning a forest of carefully spaced posts that protrude from the underlying surface .
The device also gets just to the edge of what 's a typically visible wavelength , cloaking everything from 950nm to 1500nm .
The visible spectrum is typically considered to end at 700nm .
So , it appears that we 're only a small development in process technology away from having devices edge down into the visible wavelengths .
Of course , at some point , someone will have to figure out a way to apply this to something other than a bump on a mirror .

PITTSBURGH , April 28 – Findings from clinical studies used to gain Food and Drug Administration approval of common antidepressants are not applicable to most patients with depression , according to a report led by the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health .
Published in the May issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry , the study suggests only a small percentage of people with depression qualify for these studies , and those who do not qualify are often treated with the same medications but may suffer poorer clinical outcomes .
A part of the National Institute of Mental Health - funded Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression ( STAR * D ) project – the largest study of the treatment of depression conducted in the United States – researchers compared symptoms and outcomes in depressed patients who met phase III study inclusion criteria to those who did not .
Phase III studies for antidepressants determine the effectiveness of the drug in comparison to a placebo .
The inclusion criteria for these studies are not standardized nor subject to federal guidelines , resulting in some variation from study to study in the profile of eligible patients .
Typically excluded are patients with milder forms of depression , who might be more likely to respond to a placebo drug , and those who may have chronic depression or psychiatric and medical co-morbidities – additional illnesses or conditions .
After assessing 2,855 patients treated with citalopram , a commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for mood disorders , study authors concluded that fewer than one in four , or 22.2 percent , of the patients met the usual criteria for inclusion in phase III antidepressant trials .
" Only a small percentage of depressed patients in our study would have qualified for inclusion in phase III efficacy trials of depression drugs , " said study lead author , Stephen Wisniewski , Ph.D. , professor of epidemiology and co-director of the Epidemiology Data Center , University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health .
" This raises major concerns about whether results from traditional phase III studies can be generalized to most people with depression , who also often suffer from anxiety , substance abuse and other medical and psychiatric problems . "
When Dr. Wisniewski and colleagues further assessed how well patients did on treatment , they found that those who met the eligibility criteria for phase III trials had better outcomes , including higher remission rates , less severe side effects and serious adverse events .
The depression remission rate in the patients who met the criteria was 34.4 percent , compared to only 24.7 percent in the ineligible group .
Additionally , the drug response rate also was higher in the eligible group – 51.6 percent compared to 39.1 percent of the ineligible group .
" Results from research studies suggest more optimistic outcomes than may exist for real - world patients receiving treatment for depression , " said Dr. Wisniewski .
Although phase III eligibility criteria could be changed to include a broader population of patients , Dr. Wisniewski cautions that this could come at the cost of more serious side effects in patients who have co-morbidities and are generally sicker .
These patients may not be able to safely tolerate the drugs being tested .
Instead , he suggests medical care providers who treat patients with depression use their professional judgment by noting that most phase III findings are based on patients who may be very different than those under their care .

The Conficker worm today has begun to phone home for instructions but has done little else .
Conficker was programmed to today begin actively visiting 500 out of 50,000 randomly generated web addresses to receive new instructions on how to behave .
Conficker has begun to do this , according to security company F - Secure , but so far no doomsday scenarios have emerged .
Among security experts , the consensus seems to be that very little will happen today .
This may be in part because of the high amount of publicity Conficker has received , but then again April 1 is not the first time Conficker has been programmed to change the way it operates .
Similar trigger dates have already passed with little change , including January 1 , according to according to Phil Porras , a program director with SRI International .
Security experts at Symantec , the maker of Norton Antivirus , also believe the threat is overblown and says Conficker today will " start taking more steps to protect itself " and " use a communications system that is more difficult for security researchers to interrupt . "
Technology companies and experts across the globe have been working together to halt the spread of Conficker , disrupt its communications and uncover who created the worm .
Microsoft has even issued a $ 250,000 bounty for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Conficker 's authors .
Despite the security sector 's best efforts , very little is known about the origins of Conficker or its purpose .
Nevertheless , some breakthroughs have been achieved .
On March 30 , Security experts with the Honeynet Project discovered a flaw in Conficker that makes it much easier to detect infection .
IBM researcher Mark Yayson also believes he has discovered a way to " detect and interrupt the program 's activities , " according to The New York Times .
Since the Conficker worm was discovered in October 2008 , the malware has only received programming updates from its author and worked to infect other computers .
Conficker is believed to have infected 10 million computers worldwide mostly in Asia , Europe and South America .
According to IBM , only 6 percent of North American computers have been infected .
While today may be a non-event , Conficker could be used to create harm in the future .
Possiblities include a massive botnet , which would give Conficker 's authors control over millions of computers worldwide .
The botnet could then be used to attack corporate or government networks , commit identity theft , or deliver massive amounts of spam .
Security experts warn that all Windows users must make sure their operating system and antivirus programs are up to date with the latest patches and virus protections .
So far , Windows is the only operating system known to be vulnerable to Conficker .

Conficker Worm Attack Getting Worse : Here 's How to Protect Yourself
( CNN ) -- NASA wo n't have to maneuver the international space station to dodge a piece of debris from a Soviet - era satellite spinning around Earth , the space agency announced Monday .
NASA says debris wo n't threaten the international space station , seen here from Endeavour in November 2008 .
Mission controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston warned earlier that a piece of the Kosmos 1275 was to pass about 1/2 mile from the space station early Tuesday morning .
But after further study , NASA determined no evasive action would be needed , said Paul Dye , flight director for the space shuttle Discovery , which is en route to the station .
" The latest tracking information showed it is outside of our area of concern , so the station is going to be right where we expected it to be , " Dye told reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas .
Discovery lifted off from Florida on Sunday for a scheduled docking at 5:13 p.m. ET Tuesday .
The spacecraft is not threatened by the debris , said LeRoy Cain , the shuttle program 's deputy manager .
The dimensions of the satellite debris were not known Monday .
The object was expected to pass " on the fringes " of the 2 km - by - 25 km - by - 25 km ( 1.25 mile - by - 15 mile - by - 15 mile ) safety zone controllers monitor , Dye said .
" It 's a very low probability of hit -- less than one in 100,000 , " he said .
The space shuttle Discovery is currently headed toward the station for a scheduled docking Tuesday , but the spacecraft is not threatened by the debris , said LeRoy Cain , the shuttle program 's deputy manager .
Last week , a piece of debris forced the space station 's current crew -- astronauts Mike Fincke and Sandy Magnus , and cosmonaut Yury Lonchakov -- to take shelter in its escape capsule , a rare close call for the orbiting platform , NASA said .
That object , a chunk of metal from a satellite rocket motor used on an earlier space mission , was about 5 inches across , and moving at nearly 20,000 mph .
It passed within 3 miles of the station early Thursday afternoon and was detected too late for the station to maneuver out of the way , controllers said .
iReport.com : See , share your photos of launches and space
Cain called the prospect of two close passes in less than a week a " random " occurrence , but said controllers have frequently had to maneuver around pieces of orbital junk .
" It 's part of the business , " he said .
" It comes with the territory , and we 'll continue to do whatever 's necessary to avoid debris . "
CNN 's John Zarrella contributed to this report .

I was just on the Today Programme on Radio 4 talking about dumbing down science in response to this piece in New Scientist by Kathy Sykes ( who I like , and regard with some hope as a bit of a mate by the way ) .

I wo n’t talk about it too much here since I ’m hopefully going to write something on the subject for either New Scientist ( if Graham Lawton gets back to me : hello Graham ! ) or elsewhere writing a piece on the same subject which will hopefully come out in the 9th May edition of New Scientist .
One thing though : asked why people in academia can sometimes be critical of their colleagues who work with the media , I used the examples of best practise offered by Kathy Sykes , of which Robert Winston , professor of the public understanding of science at Imperial , was one .
He is indeed a good example since , as an illustration of the very issue being discussed , many scientists were disappointed by his appearance in the adverts for an omega - 3 product where some felt it was unfortunate that with his medical reputation , and TV appearances , he was now promoting a commercial product .
These adverts were found by the ASA to breach their guidelines on substantiation and truthfulness and were subsequently withdrawn .
I ’m afraid I think many scientists quite rightly regard media scientists engaging in commercial endorsements with considerable concern , whether it is Lord Winston ( who since 2008 has had a new role of professor of the public understanding of science in Imperial ) or Susan Greenfield ’s personally endorsed range of computer games to improve your brain ( £ 88 and trashed by Which magazine ) , or any of the others .
I think it is problematic when the people who we hold up to promote the public ’s understanding of evidence , of how we know if something works or not , endorse commercial products in this fashion , and inevitably some other academics will think less of them for it .
This is the head of the Royal Institution , and a man who holds a professorship in the public understanding of science at Imperial , after all .
( Lord Winston has asked me to clarify that he did not personally profit financially from the money he was paid for appearing in the advertisement .
I am very happy to do so , although that issue is not my main concern .
” The money I earned from the omega - 3 episode was donated to Imperial College for research and to promote the public understanding of science ” . )

This is certainly not my only concern about dumbing down and the work of some media scientists .
This is me struggling to contain my massive logorrhoea so I can write about the issue properly later .
Oh but I will say , finally , as the programme ended , I pointed out ( into a dead microphone ) that the programmes which Kathy Sykes flagged up as good examples of science broadcasting were some time ago , and not on telly now .
In fact looking at iPlayer right now there are 14 episodes of snooker , each 2 hours long , and just one science documentary , about bee colony collapse .
This is presented by Martha Kearney , and repetitively restates the problem for the first 30 minutes , at which point I gave up and went to read a science blog instead .
Update 2 pm :
Graham Lawton of New Scientist has kindly taken a 550 word piece off me on this topic so I ca n’t say what I think about all this at length until 9th May .
Annoying , eh ?
Yes , he is the man behind the “ Darwin was wrong ” episode .
I quite like him as a bloke .

Cambridge University student Brian Roberts arrives in Berlin in 1931 to complete his German studies .
Without much money , he plans on making a living teaching English while living in an inexpensive rooming house , where he befriends another of the tenants , American Sally Bowles .
She is outwardly a flamboyant , perpetually happy person who works as a singer at the decadent Kit Kat Klub , a cabaret styled venue .
Sally 's outward façade is matched by that of the Klub , overseen by the omnipresent Master of Ceremonies .
Sally draws Brian into her world , and initially wants him to be one of her many lovers , until she learns that he is a homosexual , albeit a celibate one .
Among their other friends are his students , the poor Fritz Wendel , who wants to be a gigolo to live a comfortable life , and the straight - laced and beautiful Natalia Landauer , a Jewish heiress .
Fritz initially sees Natalia as his money ticket , but eventually falls for her .
However Natalia is suspect of his motives and cannot ...

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Almost 200 pilot whales and a small number of dolphins have beached themselves on an island near Australia ’s southern state of Tasmania , wildlife officials said Monday , with many already dead .
Rescuers were on their way to Naracoopa beach on King Island , between Tasmania and the Australian mainland , where around 194 pilot whales and seven dolphins beached late on Sunday , said Chris Arthur , from Tasmania ’s Parks and Wildlife Service .
Arthur said around 140 of the whales had already died , but authorities and civilian wildlife rescuers were confident the remaining mammals could be saved , with weather conditions calm .
“ These are fairly robust animals , pilot whales , ” Arthur told Australian state radio .
“ While there are animals alive , there is always hope , ” he said .
The latest mass beaching takes the number of whales stranded in Tasmania ’s northwest over the past three months to more than 400 , and follows the deaths of 48 sperm whales in January .
Pilot whales are among the smaller whales , typically up to about 5 meters ( 16 feet ) in length and dark with a grey underbelly .
Mass strandings of whales occur periodically in Australia and New Zealand for reasons that are not entirely understood .
Theories include disturbance of echo- location , possibly by interference from sound produced by human activities at sea .
Yet his appointment has not been greeted with universal rejoicing , for hanging over it is the awkward question of his sincerity .
Doubts have been muttered for some time in elite Catholic circles , but they were raised , brazenly , in the latest issue of The Tablet , the newspaper of Britain 's Catholics , in an article by deputy editor Elena Curti .
" Renowned for his openness and pastoral concerns , " she wrote , " he was also an espouser of liberal causes .
But , while his stock was high among more liberal Catholics , the decision - makers in Rome were said to be less impressed .
His mentor , the Archbishop of Liverpool , Derek Worlock , watched this in frustration .
He reputedly took ' Fr Vin ' to one side and told him : ' We can't get you into the hierarchy if you carry on like this .
You have to make yourself more favourable to Rome . ' "
While " New Moon , " the sequel to " Twilight , " is filming in Vancouver , B.C. , Oregonians can relive our moment in the pop phenomenon spotlight with the two - disc special edition " Twilight " DVD .
Rabid -- or is that bloodthirsty ?
-- fans of the human - meets - vampire romance scooped up copies of the DVD at midnight release parties as Friday night slipped into Saturday morning .
But you do n't have to be a " Twihard " to wonder what bits of local color turn up on the special features of the hit movie .
After all , Stephenie Meyer 's " Twilight , " first in her mega - selling series , is set in the rainy Northwest town of Forks , Wash .
The movie version was shot on location around the Northwest , in Portland , St. Helens , the Columbia River Gorge and Kalama , Wash . , among other sites .
So how does our corner of the world come off in the DVD commentaries and making - of documentary ?
Let 's listen in on some comments from stars Robert Pattinson , Kristen Stewart and director Catherine Hardwicke :
" It was freezing . "
" We were freezing cold . "
" It was like 20 degrees or something . "
" The weather was not our friend . "
" The roots ( in a forest scene ) were slippery .
... I still have a big scar from where I fell down . "
" ( The rain and wind ) were seriously heinous , " prompting the crew to complain of " inhuman conditions . "
" The weather kept changing . "
OK , tell us something we do n't know .
While the combination of sun , clouds , rain , hail and wind proved unpredictable and challenging for the filmmakers , the Northwest does get a little love in the DVD set .
In the prom scene , human teenager Bella ( Stewart ) appears to be shivering as she gazes at her vampire beau Edward ( Pattinson ) .
But at least the gorge 's View Point Inn looks nice .
Locals also can be on the lookout for such Oregon spots as the Carver Cafe ( with Meyer 's cameo ) ; the " Swan " house , which is actually in St. Helens ; and the stylishly modern home of Edward 's vampire family , which Hardwicke says belonged to a Nike executive .
" I was surprised he let us film there , " Hardwicke says .
Stewart adds , " We were n't allowed to touch his dining room table . "
In between comments by Pattinson obsessing over his plucked eyebrows and disparaging his appearance ( " wears lipstick , has a little bouffant , and does circus acts , " he laughingly says of his character ) , the DVD showcases the Northwest at its mossy finest .
The " unearthly , " as Hardwicke says , feeling of damp , foggy forest seems eerily romantic in sequences shot in Oxbow Regional Park ; behind the Stone Cliff Inn in Carver ; high in the treetops overlooking the gorge ; and the Shire , a historic site across the Columbia River from Multnomah Falls , which is also known as the John Yeon Preserve for Landscape Studies .
" This is such a beautiful location , " Hardwicke says , as a scenic shot of the gorge fills the screen .
OK , we knew that , too .
But it 's nice to hear , anyway .

Ender 's Game by Orson Scott Card ( 1985 )
Everybody can fall in love with the little boy who is the hero of this story and then enjoy his ascent to the leadership of the space navy .
This book is enjoyable without its three sequels , and I recommend it to those who may not normally read science fiction .

Little , Big ; or , The Fairies ' Parliament by John Crowley ( 1981 )
Praised by Harold Bloom ( who included it in The Western Canon ) and Ursula K Le Guin , who said that " all by itself it calls for a redefinition of fantasy " , this is a multigenerational story of families and fairies , all twined about their house in the country , Edgewood , though it takes sidelines - from the return of the Emperor Barbarossa to writing soap - operas in New York City .
It is a story about growing up and about falling in love , as well as what it 's like to be inside of a story ; it plays with echoes of Alice in Wonderland , Frances Yates and Shakespeare ( A Midsummer Night 's Dream ) , as well as fairy tales and the Tarot .

Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson ( 1999 - )
Steven Erikson 's Malazan Book of the Fallen ( eight volumes and counting ) is high fantasy in a weird , weird world which has many thousands of years of civilisation and war behind it , meaning the characters have held their grudges for a very long time .
You 're thrown into a battle between armies with no backstory , no long - winded explanations of historical allegiances and past wars , just smoke and blood and sorcery .
It admittedly takes an effort to get to the end of the first book , but after that your attention is repaid a thousandfold with an astonishingly wide canvas of characters and locations , asking difficult questions about religion along the way .
It 's absolutely bloody brilliant .
Made me cry a lot , too .

Lost Horizon by James Hilton ( 1933 )
The long - lived inhabitants of a community have pledged to preserve , in secrecy , the best of civilisation until the world is once again in a fit state to receive and understand what the best can teach us .
Hilton 's premise strikes a deep chord in today 's " everything is relative " society .
His utopia retains all its charm and , in his creation of Shangri - La , he added something permanently to the language .

Island by Aldous Huxley ( 1962 )
Huxley remains one of the most intelligent people ever to write a novel , and I see Island as his most important work .
While Brave New World is excellent at painting a picture of a humanity gone wrong , Huxley himself acknowledged that a much more difficult task was to create a novel in which humanity was the opposite ; awakened , enlightened , cured .
As such , Island reads both as a beautiful story and as a guide to living .

Canopus in Argos by Doris Lessing ( 1979 - 83 )
Lessing considers the five books in this series to be her finest works .
It would be hard to find better written or more profoundly explored utopias / dystopias that cast light on the state of the world we live in now .
The novels range across politics , global warming and personal relationships , particularly gender and sexual politics .
No list of SF and futurism would be complete without them .

The Boys From Brazil by Ira Levin ( 1976 )
A number of 65 - year - old male civil servants around the world are to be killed in order to fulfil " the destiny of the Aryan race " .
Gradually , we learn that this is part of a sinister experiment to reproduce another Hitler .
Written when cloning was still in the realms of fantasy , the novel explores genetics , environment and ethics .
Levin makes the premise disturbingly credible , setting the plot against the backdrop of real events and people - the rise of the Third Reich ; Josef Mengele , the angel of death ; and the Nazi- pursuer , a barely disguised Simon Wiesenthal .

The Case of Charles Dexter Ward by HP Lovecraft ( 1941 )
HP Lovecraft 's first novel ( though published posthumously ) concerns a young antiquarian , Charles Dexter Ward , in the 1920s researching his family history , especially an ancestor from witch - haunted Salem .
He unearths an abominable tale of necromancy , vampirism and other world horrors that start manifesting in the present age , affecting him mentally ( and even more strangely physically ) so that he descends into a deepening spiral of insanity .

The Wave Theory of Angels by Alison Macleod ( 2005 )
This novel defies bland categorisation : although it explores realms where science and dreams meet , it transcends both SF and fantasy .
Its journey in time moves the reader between medieval Beauvais and a research centre in modern Chicago .
Macleod 's is a powerful tale about various kinds of love and desire .
It is part - thriller , part - philosophical speculation , part - exploration of postmodern physics , and is quite beautifully written , combining play with poetry and with moments of deep emotion and powerful realism .

The Confidence Man by Herman Melville ( 1857 )
It 's April Fool 's day and the devil boards a Mississippi steamboat , sardonically named the Fidèle .
Under a number of guises he engages the passengers ( who make up a representative cross- section of antebellum society ) in dizzying philosophical and theological disputations on the subjects of trust and belief .
Punning on the concept of confidence , Melville 's last novel is a satire on 19th - century liberal optimism in all its varied manifestations .
That one of the devil 's avatars should be a broker who trades in non-existent shares merely lends added piquancy to a novel which has much to say to our own precarious times .

Tom 's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce ( 1958 )
Ostensibly a child 's book , this is a major work of literature which manages to make the impact of war , family cruelty and love , and Victorian mores accessible to all ages without sacrificing complexity and honesty .
The final meeting of Tom and Hatty ( as an old woman ) is unbearably moving .

Lord of Light by Roger Zelazny ( 1967 )
Set on a colonised planet in an unspecified future , where the gods of the Hindu pantheon use their very real powers to ensure a rigid caste system and stifle any independent thought , Lord of Light follows hero Sam , an archetypal trickster , as he is granted a second opportunity to challenge his fellow " gods " by reviving Buddhism as a challenge to their theocracy .
Imaginative and beautifully written , Lord of Light addresses religion as a tool for social control , yet balances this with heroic fantasy and hi-tech science fiction , all carried along by perfectly judged self - reflective humour .

Every Saturday we ask some of our favorite writers to fill in for us .
Today , we have former Cracked .com writer Anthony Layser , who is now the deputy managing editor of Asylum.com .
Being a production assistant in the film and television business is tantamount to being a food service employee who empties the deep fryer and scrubs the urinals .
It 's a position I held with the TV Guide Channel -- the entertainment industry equivalent of a taco stand .
To call the work mindless does n't appropriately explain the job ; it was anti-mind .
Yet like a lot of young people , I believed that being a PA would be my first step toward rising up the ranks , allowing me to one day achieve my goal of producing a sitcom featuring trained Komodo dragons .
Here 's how that went ...

1 Accepting a Job I Knew Little About Like any desperate comm .
school grad , I applied for the job because I was told they possessed a studio that recorded moving images .
At some point , a human relations rep probably explained that my position would essentially make me the entertainment industry equivalent of India 's " Untouchable " caste , but apparently that seemed like a fair trade off to me .
What I Should Have Done : Continue Reading Below Advertisement
It might have been advisable to actually watch the TV Guide Channel before signing on .
Not only were there no exotic trained animal shows or sitcoms , but the entire programming philosophy was to have a sycophant fawn over network and cable clips in nearly identical segments with names like " Watch This ! , " " What 's On " and " TV Circle Jerk ! "
Meanwhile , the advertisers were predominantly manufacturers of festive collectible plates and Elvis figurines .
2 Assuming Others Were Aware of Our Product 's Banality Continue Reading Below Advertisement
After a week on the job , I was already becoming friendly with the staff , most of whom seemed genuinely disinterested in the pap we were creating .
I soon felt comfortable enough to crack jokes about creating programming that 's sole focus was to encourage its viewers to watch something else .
Before I realized the production manager was not laughing along , she pulled me aside and said , " Some of us take our work seriously . "
I immediately felt sympathy for her .
What I Should Have Done : Kept my head down , and did my job .
If someone asked me what I thought about the TVGC , I did n't necessarily have to lie .
I could have simply told them , I was using it as a source of income until I sold my teleplay inspired by a harrowing stint on Master Cleanse .
( That was always my cover .
I would never blithely reveal my Komodo idea for fear of it being stolen . ) .
