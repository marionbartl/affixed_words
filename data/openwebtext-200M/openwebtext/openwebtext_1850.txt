COMPARING SALES COMPARING SALES
How music sales compare , year - to - date as of June 4 ( in millions of albums or equivalent ) : 2005 2006 Change Digital sales 13.4 23.7 77 % Album sales 238.6 231.7 3 % Sources : RIAA , Nielsen SoundScan RIAA chief says illegal song - sharing ' contained ' LOS ANGELES 
Nearly a year after the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling against online music file - sharing services , the CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America says unauthorized song swapping has been " contained . "
" The problem has not been eliminated , " says association CEO Mitch Bainwol .
" But we believe digital downloads have emerged into a growing , thriving business , and file - trading is flat . "
That 's an optimistic view from an industry that saw its numbers slide to near oblivion after the launch of the original Napster in 1999 .
CD sales fell as much as 30 % , and the RIAA pressed Congress and the courts for relief against what it said was rampant piracy .
After the Supreme Court ruled that the services could be liable for piracy by their users , the RIAA sent cease - and - desist letters to several firms .
Most — including BearShare , WinMX and Grokster — shut down .
EDonkey and others said they would switch to a licensed , paid model .
EDonkey , which along with BitTorrent is one of the most - used file - sharing services , has yet to make the switch .
Even with Grokster and WinMX shut down , their software programs still exist .
Eric Garland , CEO of Internet measurement firm BigChampagne , says that more people than ever are using file - sharing networks .
" Nearly 10 million people are online , swapping media , at any given time , " he says .
That May figure is up from 8.7 million people in 2005 , he says .
Garland says the RIAA has made some inroads .
" They have removed the profiteers from online piracy , " he says .
" They 've also embarked on a very successful education campaign .
Kids now know about copyright , and the consequences . "
The RIAA has sued just over 18,000 individuals for sharing songs online , with 4,500 settling for about $ 4,000 per case .
Album sales are still down — about 3 % this year .
But Bainwol says digital sales — up 77 % — make up for the shortfall .
The wide availability of legitimate alternatives to file - sharing services has helped wean computer users away , says Russ Crupnick , president of the music group for market tracker NPD Group .
Apple 's iTunes has sold more than 1 billion songs to consumers , and online stores Rhapsody and Napster are gaining traction .
Crupnick says digital store purchases have " almost doubled " while file - sharing is flat among computer users in 12,000 homes in an NPD survey .
Meanwhile , the RIAA is suing XM Satellite Radio , which introduced a portable $ 399 player ( from Pioneer and Samsung ) that lets subscribers record songs .
Bainwol says he does n't mind consumers acquiring songs on the device — it 's just that XM has n't licensed the songs for download .
" We love the technology and think it 's cool , but if you want to be an iTunes clone , you should pay for it , " he says .
XM has called the RIAA lawsuit a " negotiating " tactic .
About 1.5 billion songs are available for free swapping at any given time on file - sharing networks , says Garland , a mix of current hits and songs from such artists as the Beatles and Led Zeppelin that have yet to be released to the digital music stores .
That number is huge but has n't grown substantially , while video piracy has .
" The music industry is n't seeing double - digit growth in piracy anymore , but Hollywood is , " Garland says .
One of the 85 ‘ loyal Bushies ’ comes under scrutiny
Last year , Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle ( D ) , seeking a second term , was considered relatively vulnerable by the Republican establishment .
The GOP had successfully recruited then - Rep. Mark Green ( R - Wis. ) to be their gubernatorial candidate , they cleared the field so he could get the nomination , fundraising was brisk , and some early polling showed Green within striking distance .
Right around the time that Green officially became the GOP nominee in Wisconsin , U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic brought charges against a top official in Doyle ’s administration , accusing the state purchasing supervisor of corruption .
Were the charges politically motivated ?
It ’s hard to say for sure , but consider how quickly a federal appeals court dismissed the charges yesterday .
( thanks to reader D.D. for the heads - up )
Federal judges Thursday ruled that former state purchasing supervisor Georgia L. Thompson was wrongly convicted of making sure a state travel contract went to a firm linked to Gov. Jim Doyle ’s re-election campaign and freed her from an Illinois prison .
The three - judge panel in Chicago acted with unusual speed , ruling after oral arguments by Thompson ’s attorney and the U.S. attorney ’s office .
During 26 minutes of oral arguments , all three judges assailed the government ’s case , with Judge Diane Wood saying at one point that “ the evidence is beyond thin . ”
During a news conference later Thursday , Doyle , a former state attorney general , said the three judges did an “ extraordinary thing ” by entering an order finding Thompson innocent and ordering her immediate release .( emphasis added )
I ’ll spare you the minutiae of the case , but here ’s the story in a nutshell : Thompson , who was originally hired under Doyle ’s Republican predecessor , awarded a state contract to Adelman Travel , which became controversial because two of the company ’s officers had donated the state maximum to Doyle ’s re-election campaign .
There was no evidence that Thompson personally profited from the contract and nothing to suggest she approved the contract for political reasons .
Biskupic brought charges anyway and managed to win a conviction , which was thrown out swiftly yesterday .
Given the recent evidence involving the politicization of U.S. Attorneys ’ offices , the questions are unavoidable .
Indeed , it ’s worth remembering that Wisconsin Republicans used the bogus scandal during the gubernatorial campaign as a political defense when Green stood accused of accepting dubious contributions .
Just to be clear , I know of no evidence to suggest that the U.S. Attorney in this district was trying to influence the election .
I have no idea if Karl Rove gave Biskupic a call and said , “ You know , it ’s a close race .
Anything you can do would be helpful . ”
We do know , however , that shortly before a close election , Biskupic brought extremely thin criminal charges against a top Doyle administration official who apparently did nothing wrong .
It ’s one of the lasting problems of the administration ’s purge scandal — there are now constant suspicions about prosecutors ’ political motivations .
Now that the nation has learned that several U.S. Attorneys were pressured to bring politically - charged cases for Republicans ’ benefit , and some of those who refused lost their jobs , it ’s inevitable that prosecutions like this one will garner fresh scrutiny .
I recently started a list .
* Paul Krugman noted a couple of weeks ago , for example , that Chris Christie , the former Bush “ Pioneer ” who is now the U.S. attorney for New Jersey , issued subpoenas as part of an investigation against Sen. Bob Menendez ( D ) shortly before last year ’s election .
* In New Hampshire , Democrats want Congress to investigate whether prosecution of a Republican phone - jamming scheme on Election Day 2002 was intentionally delayed until after the presidential election two years later .
* Did the U.S. Attorney ’s office in Pennsylvania intentionally target Bob Casey allies to undermine his Senate campaign against Rick Santorum ?
* Why was the career U.S. Attorney in Guam removed in 2002 after he started investigating disgraced GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff ?
* Why has Western Pennsylvania ’s U.S. attorney , Mary Beth Buchanan , spent a disproportionate amount of her time launching public - corruption investigations against Democrats , while overlooking Republicans ?
* In July 2005 , the [ tag ] U.S. Attorney [ / tag ] in Denver decided not to pursue a matter in which bouncers at a Bush event impersonated Secret Service agents to throw out three law - abiding ticket - holders because of their bumper sticker ( the Denver Three controversy ) .
Did politics dictate the decision ?
As Bud Cummins , one of the purged prosecutors , recently explained :
“ [ T ] he public must perceive that every substantive decision within the department is made in a neutral and non-partisan fashion .
Once the public detects partisanship in one important decision , they will follow the natural inclination to question every decision made , whether there is a connection or not . ”
Bingo .
It ’s the consequence of the administration undermining public confidence in the system .

The tests are set for prospective science undergraduates .
The UK's Royal Society of Chemistry is offering a £ 500 prize to one lucky but bright person who answers the question below correctly .
It has also published a test used in a " well known and respected " English university - the society is not naming it - to assess the strength of incoming science undergraduates ' maths skills .
A glance at the two questions reveals how much more advanced is the maths teaching in China , where children learn the subject up to the age of 18 , the society says .
Schools and students are reluctant to consider A - level mathematics to age 18 , because the subject is regarded as difficult
Richard Pike
Pupils 'urged to drop maths '
It has sounded a warning about Britain 's future economic prospects which it claims are threatened by competition from scientists in China .
RSC chief executive Richard Pike says mathematics is seen as integral to the sciences in China and its economy .
" There , the concept of remedial courses at university would be inconceivable .
" UK chemistry departments are often world - renowned for their creativity ; however , mathematics tests set in England by many universities for undergraduate chemistry students in their first term to diagnose remedial requirements are disconcertingly simple .
" They encapsulate the challenge facing this country , " says Dr Pike .
But a maths professor in England , William Shaw , has said the emphasis in mathematics teaching varies from country to country and the RSC 's attack is " nonsense " .
Anyone wishing to enter the competition should go to the RSC website and send the correct answer by Friday 27 April to be included in a prize draw .

Yesterday I wrote about the climate crisis .
Today , let ’s start doing something about it .
Electricity , especially in the United States and China , turns out to be a pretty dirty energy source .
Most of our electricity is generated using coal , which despite promises of “ clean coal ” to come , burns dirty .
Not only does it contribute to global warming , but it also has been shown to have an adverse impact on health .
So let ’s start simple : reduce the amount of electricity our computers consume .
Even for an individual person , this can add up to quite a bit of energy ( and money ) savings in a year .
When you think about multiplying this over companies , server rooms , etc. , it adds up fast .
This works on desktops , servers , laptops , whatever .
The easiest way to save power is with CPU frequency scaling .
This is a technology that lets you adjust how fast a running CPU runs , while it ’s running .
When CPUs run at slower speeds , they consume less power .
Most CPUs are set to their maximum speed all the time , even when the system is n’t using them .
Linux has support for keeping the CPU at maximum speed unless it is idle .
By turning on this feature , we can save power at virtually no cost to performance .
The Linux feature to handle CPU frequency scaling is called cpufreq .
Set up modules
Let ’s start by checking to see whether cpufreq support is already enabled in your kernel .
These commands will need to be run as root .
# cd /sys / devices/system/cpu/cpu0 # ls -l
If you see an entry called cpufreq , you are good and can skip to the governor selection below .
If not , you ’ll need to load cpufreq support into your kernel .
Let ’s get a list of available drivers :
# ls /lib / modules / `uname -r`/kernel/arch/*/kernel/cpu/cpufreq
Now it ’s guess time .
It does n’t really hurt if you guess wrong ; you ’ll just get a harmless error message .
One hint , though : try acpi-cpufreq last ; it ’s the option of last resort .
On my system , I see :
acpi-cpufreq.ko longrun.ko powernow -k8.ko speedstep-smi.ko cpufreq-nforce2.ko p4-clockmod.ko speedstep-centrino.ko gx-suspmod.ko powernow-k6.ko speedstep-ich.ko longhaul.ko powernow-k7.ko speedstep-lib.ko
For each guess , you ’ll run modprobe with the driver name .
I have an Athlon64 , which is a K8 machine , so I run :
#modprobe powernow-k8
Note that you leave off the “ . ko ” bit .
If you do n’t get any error message , it worked .
Once you find a working module , edit /etc / modules and add the module name there ( again without the “ .ko ” ) so it will be loaded for you on boot .
Governor Selection
Next , we need to load the driver that tells the kernel what governor to use .
The governor is the thing that monitors the system and adjusts the speed accordingly .
I ’m going to suggest the ondemand governor .
This governor keeps the system ’s speed at maximum unless it is pretty sure that the system is idle .
So this will be the one that will let you save power with the least performance impact .
Let ’s load the module now :
# modprobe cpufreq_ondemand
You should also edit /etc / modules and add a line that says simply cpufreq_ondemand to the end of the file so that the ondemand governor loads at next boot .
Turning It On
Now , back under / sys / devices / system / cpu/cpu0 , you should see a cpufreq directory .
cd into it .
To turn on the ondemand governor , run this :
# echo echo ondemand > scaling_governor
That ’s it , your governor is enabled .
You can see what it ’s doing like this :
# cat cpuinfo_min_freq 800000 # cat cpuinfo_max_freq 2200000 # cat cpuinfo_cur_freq 800000
That shows that my CPU can go as low as 800MHz , as high as 2.2GHz , and that at the present moment , it ’s running at 800M Hz presently .
Now , check your scaling governor settings :
# cat scaling_min_freq 800000 # cat scaling_max_freq 800000
This is showing that the system is constraining the governor to only ever operate on an 800MHz to 800M Hz range .
That ’s not what I want ; I want it to scale over the entire range of the CPU .
Since my cpuinfo_max_freq was 2200000 , I want to write that out to scaling_max_freq as well :
echo 2200000 > scaling_max_freq
Making This The Default
The last step is to make this happen on each boot .
Open up your /etc/sysfs.conf file .
If you do n’t have one , you will want to run a command such as apt - get install sysfsutils ( or the appropriate one for your distribution ) .
Add a line like this :
devices / system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
= ondemand devices / system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq = 2200000
Remember to replace the 2200000 with your own cpu_max_freq value .
IMPORTANT NOTE :
If you have a dual - core CPU , or more than one CPU , you ’ll need to add a line for each CPU .
For instance :
devices / system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/scaling_governor
= ondemand devices / system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq = 2200000
You can see what all CPU devices you have with ls / sys / devices / system / cpu .
Now , save this file , and you ’ll have CPU frequency scaling saving you money , and helping the environment , every time you boot .
And with the ondemand governor , chances are you ’ll never notice any performance loss .
This article showed you how to save power using CPU frequency scaling on Linux .
I have no idea if it ’s possible to do the same on Windows , Mac , or the various BSDs , but it would be great if someone would leave comments with links to resources for doing that if so .
Updated : added scaling_max_freq info
In Haskell , there is a datastructure called Maybe .
Maybe is used where you would often use null pointers in languages such as C# or Python .
Python does n’t have null pointers as such , but it does have the None object , which in many cases has the same kind of patterns and problems associated with it .
Haskell needs
Maybe because no data types are nullable — unless you are writing code that interfaces to C , you never have the possibility of a null pointer .
Here is a brief explanation why Haskell ’s Maybe is infinitely better than null pointers .
First , a word about Maybe .
It is defined , at its most basic level , something like this in Haskell :
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show , Read )
On the left hand side , a stands for any type .
This definition means that a variable x which is , for example , of the type Maybe String is either Nothing or a Just y , where y is the actual string .
To work out which it is , we normally use pattern matching , or a utility function that uses pattern matching — but either way , we ca n’t use variable x as if it was a string , we have to explicitly unpack it .
This might seem laborious , especially when in other languages you get ‘ nullability ’ for free for most variables .
A few examples will highlight why Haskell ’s way is much better .
( By the way , the deriving clause tells the compiler to automatically generate methods for Maybe for testing equality , ordering , printing as a string and reading from a string ) .
Now , onto our examples .
Suppose you have a function that is like the lookup function of a dictionary — it takes a key , and may or may not return a value .
I ’ll use ‘ K ’ or ‘ k ’ for the type of the key .
In C# 2.0 , using generics , the function signature might look something like this :
interface ILookup < K , V > { V GetItem ( K key ) ; }
The idea is that GetItem ( ) will return a null if the item is n’t found — this is a typical in languages like C# , whereas Python would probably throw a KeyError .
( In both languages , we might do foo[key ] rather than foo .
GetItem ( key ) , which can be done easily in either ) .
A more functional implementation ( but less idiomatic ) would be to use delegates .
We would require a declaration like this :
delegate V Lookup < K , V >( K key ) ;
In Haskell , the function would be typed like this :
lookup :: ( Eq k ) => k ->
Maybe v
Haskell already beats both Python and C# for the following reasons :
The fact that the nullability is explicit in the signature means that you ca n’t forget that there is a possibility the object is ‘ null ’ .
Even if you do forget , the compiler wo n’t .
So all those NullPointerExceptions ?
You can say goodbye to them forever .
If you have ever seen a NullPointerException ( or NoneType object has no attribute ' blah ' in Python ) , and I ’m sure we all have , then you have all the evidence you need that programmers , even good ones , do forget to do these checks .
Even better than not producing NullPointerExceptions etc. is the fact that you can forget about whether a certain function can return null or not .
The compiler will always catch it for you , so you are free to concentrate on the programming .
This is a different point — the first means you are n’t producing programs that will ever crash with this error , the second means that as you are actually programming , you have less things in your mind to distract you , so you can keep your registers full with things you need .
But let ’s make things more interesting .
First , let ’s say our dictionary is caching results of potentially expensive database queries .
So , the key might be the SQL query string , and the value could be objects of various kinds .
In this case , Nothing is a valid value that the dictionary might hold — it means we have done the search already and found nothing .
The ‘ lookup ’ function in this case would return Just Nothing .
But what about the C# / Python versions ?
There is nothing to stop us putting a null value in against a certain key , but when we do the lookup , a null pointer or None object could now either mean ‘ we already did the search and we found nothing ’ , or ‘ we have n’t done the search ’ .
Let ’s add another level .
Suppose we are searching for a value in the database that is held in a column that can actually be NULL .
For example , we might be doing a search for Mrs Jones ’s age , and come back with the result that , although we do actually have a record for Mrs Jones , we do n’t have a value for her age .
In the C# version , we are really in trouble now .
We have 3 possible meanings for ‘ null ’ , with no way to tell them apart .
In Python , we could solve this either by throwing different types of exceptions ( as we could in C# ) , or by additional null objects — in Python there is nothing to stop you creating singleton null objects and assigning them to any variable .
We can then check for identity against these null objects to cope with our various errors .
Our Python solution suffers some limitations — both exceptions and additional null objects will give us headaches if we try to serialise and resurrect them ( None will resurrect OK , but for other singleton null objects you need a significantly more sophisticated mechanism than the ones normally used — try it ) .
But we also have to remember to document and handle all the possibilities .
And when it comes to writing generic code that can easily be reused and combined in novel ways , our hacks will get in the way .
We could decide to use a tuple to return ( success_boolean , actual_value_or_None ) at one or more levels , but this would be seen as unpythonic when the vast majority of code out there will either throw exceptions or return None .
By contrast , Haskell ’s Maybe mechanism is a breath of fresh air .
You can just wrap as many layers of Maybe as you need .
Our ‘ lookup ’ function would not need modifying , but would in fact be returning an object of type Just ( Just ( Just Int ) ) .
This could be :
Nothing , meaning we have n’t got a cached result for the search , Just Nothing to mean we have done the search , but not found a record for Mrs Jones at all , Just ( Just Nothing ) to indicate we have already done the search , and the result was the database does n’t know the age of Mrs Jones , or Just ( Just ( Just 43 ) ) , if Mrs Jones is 43 years old .
We wo n’t get confused with all these levels — for a start , each bit of code that adds or removes a Maybe wrapper is likely to only deal with one layer .
But the compiler will catch it for us anyway if we make a mistake .
Furthermore , we do n’t have to learn various different ways to cope with null — we only have one , and we can be sure that our code wo n’t need hacks to keep it working in different scenarios .
And , to add some icing to the cake , Maybe has been written as an instance of a Monad .
We all know the common pattern in code that is basically “ if the value I get at this point is null , then return null from this function ” .
Using Maybe as a monad , we can eliminate a lot of that kind of stuff — the monad encapsulates this pattern for us .
Sometimes it will be clearer to explicitly check for Nothing or Just x , but often you will be able avoid doing that .
Using monad notation what you effectively do is write a number of functions that are bound together using the ‘ bind ’ method of Monads ( though these functions look more like imperative statements in monad notation ) .
The Maybe version of ‘ bind ’ knows to abandon ship as soon as it gets a Nothing , and just return Nothing .
Of course , this way of doing things is just as type - safe , but it just allows us to avoid some of the explicit null handling .
In conclusion : this is one instance of Haskell ’s wonderfully designed type system .
If languages like C# , C++ , Java etc have put you off static typing , Haskell might be able to change your mind .
Spam Made Up 94 % Of All E - Mail In December
The Postini report says the rise of botnets and image spam is causing e-mail systems at some companies to melt down .
Legitimate e-mail now constitutes a rounding error when compared with spam , thanks to a standing army of more than a million zombie PCs waging war on in - boxes worldwide on any given day .
Some 94 % of all e-mail last December was spam , according to Postini 's annual communications intelligence report , which the managed e-mail security company released today .
In 2006 , the volume of spam rose 147 % by Postini 's measure .
The company attributes the surge in spam to PCs that have been commandeered by cybercriminals without the knowledge of their owners .
In and of itself , this sounds like the same mixture of marketing and reporting that messaging security firms have engaged in for years .
And it is that .
But that does n't diminish the real difficulties businesses face in coping with spam .
" There were two fundamental changes in the world of business communications in 2006 that are going to get even bigger in 2007 , " says Daniel Druker , executive VP of worldwide marketing for Postini .
" The major event in communications security is the emergence of botnets .
This has changed the game , the dynamics , and economics of the Internet security marketplace .
When the bad guys can now harness more than a million computers around the world and use them to push an increasing amount of attacks , that 's a major change . "
It 's not just the rising volume of spam that 's a problem , but the size of the spam messages .
Because botnets use stolen bandwidth , spammers can send files of any size at no cost .
And that 's just what they 're doing .
In order to defeat content filters that might block their messages , spammers are increasingly using images .
The result is that unsolicited bulk e-mail is getting bulkier .
The 147 % increase in spam that Postini observed in 2006 resulted in a 334 % increase in e-mail processing requirement for companies .
" This is causing the e-mail infrastructure of many businesses to melt down , " says Druker .
" Nobody budgeted for four - and - a - half times more infrastructure capacity in one year . "
Image spam does represent a growing problem , says Howard Schmidt , president and CEO of R&H Security Consulting and former White House cybersecurity czar , noting that in some ways , image spam is easier to filter .
" Probably the biggest issue is the use of botnets . "
The second major change , says Druker , " is there is a tremendously heightened concern about the regulatory environment and the increased litigation risk related to business communications . "
Now that 90 % of business communications are electronic , says Druker , " attorneys have figured out this stuff is gold . "
And thanks to the new Federal Rules for Civil Procedure that went into effect on Dec. 1 , businesses now have to comply with legal discovery requests quickly .
That 's something the majority of companies are n't prepared for , says Druker .
Implicit in Postini 's findings is a pitch for managed e-mail services such as those the company provides .
And while there may be compelling reasons to turn the dirty job of e-mail cleaning over to an e-mail security company , Schmidt is n't convinced that 's the only way to survive the bot assault .
" I 'm not sure I agree with that whole concept of ' you can't do it , somebody else has got to do it for you , ' " he says .
" I use a desktop tool which is basically a toolbar and it's been almost two years now since I 've had a spam , phishing e-mail , malware , any of that hit my in - box . "

Genentech :
The best place to work now
Wanted : Brainiacs with passion for science and contempt for business - speak .
Domagoj Vucic did n't come to Genentech for the rich stock options or the free cappuccino or the made - to - order sushi or the parties every Friday night .
He came from the University of Georgia seven years ago because he believed Genentech could help him answer a burning question :
What is it that keeps caterpillars infected with baculovirus alive for an entire seven days before they explode into a gooey puddle ?
Figuring that one out could , believe it or not , be a big step toward curing cancer .
Doctor - scientist Napoleone Ferrara did n't come for the perks either .
He joined Genentech in 1988 because the company would allow him to pursue an obsession : the study of the formation of blood vessels that feed , say , a tumor , and the search for an antibody to disrupt the process .
It 's not just the bio-scientists .
Ask Cynthia Wong , a mother of two , why she chose to settle at Genentech after working at Citibank and Towers Perrin , and she does n't even mention the onsite day care or the concierge service that can pull off a birthday party on a moment 's notice .
Instead the senior manager quotes a breast - cancer patient who had visited her sales department a day earlier .
" She has two little girls , " Wong says , getting tears in her eyes all over again .
" She wants to see them in braces .
She wants to be there when they pick out their prom dresses . "
With the help of a Genentech drug called Herceptin , she probably will .
Work that really matters -- it 's what makes Genentech the Best Company to Work For in 2006 .
But there 's plenty else to like about this low - key , high - tech biotech located just north of San Francisco International Airport .
For starters , 29 - yearold Genentech is not just the very first biotech ; it 's the brightest star in a promising industry that has chronically under - delivered .
The company 's yearend revenues should come to $ 6.6 billion , according to Wall Street estimates , triple what Genentech pulled in four years ago .
Its stock price has doubled in the past year , to $ 95 a share .
At one point in December it had a market cap of $ 102 billion , making it the 20th - most - valuable company in the U.S. , ahead of Merck , Lilly , and every other pharmaceutical company except Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer .
" There is only one drug company that has really come from nowhere to be a major force in this industry , and that is Genentech , " says Peter Tollman , a senior vice president and biopharmaceutical expert at Boston Consulting Group .
" It is the only drug company in the world that has created that much value without a merger . "
Genentech 's secret , anybody here will tell you , is its culture .
And that is what has propelled the company to the top of this year 's list .
With its storybook view of San Francisco Bay , the place feels more like a college campus than a pillar of the FORTUNE 500 .
Signs point to the North Campus , down by the water , and the South Campus , up on the hill .
Employees do n't get assignments , they get " appointments . "
They traverse the grounds by shuttle bus and bicycles provided by the company .
Every Friday night there 's at least one " ho - ho " -- Genentechese for kegger -- a tradition that began in the ' 70s when the workforce was mostly a handful of rowdy post - docs barely out of grad school .
At Genentech , every milestone calls for a party and a commemorative T - shirt -- and on very big occasions , very big celebrity bands .
A year and a half ago , after an unusual run of FDA approvals , the parking lot in front of Building 9 became the site of a rock concert featuring Elton John , Mary J. Blige , and Matchbox 20 .
All this would be way too dot - com to make business sense if it were n't for another performer who took the stage that day -- and who got about as much applause as the bands .
That would be Art Levinson , Genentech 's impish , brilliant scientist CEO , dressed for the occasion in tennis shoes and a black CLONE OR DIE T - shirt .
The 55 - year - old Levinson , who once bet his colleagues that five of them could fit inside an ice machine ( they did ) , has made mostly right bets for the company ever since he took the helm in 1995 -- championing its science , creating a stream of new drugs , and winning over employees by making clear to all that there would be no butt - covering culture at Genentech .
In fact , Genentech 's culture has a whole lot in common with those of two other Bay Area superstars : Google and Apple .
All three imbue employees with idealism .
Apple keeps a laser like focus on the customer .
Google 's motto is DO NO EVIL .
Genentech's : IN BUSINESS FOR LIFE .
All three companies flout conventional wisdom and take a damn - the - torpedoes approach to nay - sayers .
All three know one another well .
Levinson is on the boards of Google and Apple ; he and Steve Jobs are often seen hanging out at Genentech , deep in discussion .
( Google has n't been around long enough to qualify as a 100 Best Companies to Work for candidate ; Apple declined to participate in the survey . )
And all three put huge emphasis on attracting the best and the brightest .
Genentech awards sabbaticals to stave off burnout .
To keep creativity alive , both it and Google encourage their scientists and engineers to spend fully 20 percent of each workweek pursuing pet projects .
Many corporations think it 's terribly cutting - edge to maintain an arm 's - length relationship with employees .
These guys want you to move in .
Of course , it 's easy to be a generous , enlightened employer when profits are flowing and your stock seems to have nowhere to go but up .
IBM was that way for decades , once .
But the awful mathematical truth -- you do n't need a Ph.D. to figure it out -- is that high growth at this rate can't last forever .
Says David Botstein , former head of Genentech research and now a professor of genomics at Princeton : " At some point , someone , maybe Art , maybe his successor , is going to have to figure out how to transition Genentech into a steady - state company . "
Levinson says he wo n't worry about growth slowing until sometime after 2010 .
Right now , with the company averaging 151 new employees a month ( headcount at press time was 9,314 ) , he says , " The thing I worry about most is managing our growth . "
And protecting Genentech 's mission , focus , and culture .
" It 's much easier to get alignment when you have fewer people . "
Since the day the company was founded in 1976 , Genentech 's culture has been its competitive advantage .
Founders Bob Swanson , a 29 - year - old venture capitalist who studied the power of teams at MIT , and Herb Boyer , a pioneer gene splicer from the University of California at San Francisco , knew the success of their venture depended on luring and keeping big - brain bioscience talent .
Within two years Genentech had concocted human insulin , which in 1982 became the first biotech drug to go to market .
The company turned its first profit in 1979 , the year before it went public , and has remained profitable ever since -- despite a close call in the late 1980s , when it lost focus and stopped introducing new drugs , and the stock price flagged badly enough to make the company a takeover target .
( Swiss drug giant Roche took a majority stake in 1990 and has let Genentech run independently ever since . )
When Levinson was tapped to become CEO in 1995 , Wall Street was skeptical but insiders cheered .
Levinson was head of research , a top scientist , and astute at making calls on people and R&D .
During his first two years as CEO , Levinson persuaded the board to plow 50 percent of revenues back into research .
( You read that number right .
It 's why , he believes , four of the company 's 13 drugs are less than three years old , 30 more drugs are in the pipeline , and all eight of its clinical trials last year were successful . )
He also decided to focus the company 's science on " significant unmet needs " in the fields of oncology , immunology , and tissue growth and repair .
He got rid of projects ( and people ) that did n't fit the program and forced fiefdoms like product development and basic research to work closely together .
To head drug development , he tapped Susan Desmond - Hellmann , who had begun her career as an oncologist and has never forgotten what it 's like to tell a young mother with breast cancer that she has run out of options .
( Desmond - Hellmann is now president . )
Genentech pours tremendous energy into hiring people with that kind of passion .
In fact , it can take five or six visits and 20 interviews to snag a job .
The process is meant partly to screen out the free agents -- people preoccupied with salary , title , and personal advancement .
If candidates ask too many such questions , " Boom , wrong profile , " says Levinson .
The gantlet is also designed to let job candidates know exactly what they 're getting themselves into .
" We 're extremely nonhierarchical , " Levinson says .
" We 're not wearing ties .
People do n't call us doctor .
We do n't have special dining rooms . "
( They are n't even assigned parking spaces , and it 's hell in the morning to find a spot . )
Executive job seekers from Big Pharma , especially , find that a jolt , he says .
" A lot of them say , ' But I like being different !
I like being special !'
Well , you 're not going to be special here .
If that 's important to you , that 's fine .
But you wo n't be happy here . "
Genentech looks for people who are wired like Ellen Filvaroff , a senior scientist in molecular oncology .
Her walls are decorated with pictures of her patents and her toddler -- side by side .
The perks she likes most are little things -- like being able to buy birthday cards and stamps and to mail packages from the company store .
But the biggest kick by far , she says , is having colleagues who can help you crack the science more quickly .
Collaboration is easy and encouraged .
Once , when Filvaroff was n't sure how to set up an experiment , she caught Napoleone Ferrara in the walkway between buildings 10 and 11 .
By the time they reached the doorway Filvaroff had refined her thinking enough to conduct the experiment , which turned into a published paper .
Encounters like that , she says , " just bootstrap my science . "
As a mother of a young child , she 's the least likely person to attend ho - hos .
But the interplay of bioscience and brewski makes for un - usually rewarding keggers , so she goes when she can .
Here status is conveyed not by snagging the fanciest title or the biggest office ( CEO Levinson 's measures about 9 feet by 12 feet and is done up with low - end metal office furniture ) .
It 's defined by matching wits and taking chances .
Or seeing who can take the dare .
At Genentech nobody dresses up , except on Halloween .
This past Halloween , Desmond - Hellmann spent the day as Snow White , and Levinson and the rest of the management team dressed as the Six Dwarfs ( minus Dopey ) .
They were en route to hand out candy at another office across town when their SUV convoy drove by archrival Amgen .
Levinson hailed the driver to stop and told the group he wanted to have their picture taken on the Amgen front lawn , posed around the Amgen sign .
They did , but Levinson was not entirely satisfied .
What he really wanted , he told them , was a picture of Snow White and the Dwarfs inside the Amgen lobby .
Some of the Dwarfs chickened out , and Snow White was about to -- until Levinson goaded her .
" Oh come on , Sue , do n't be a weenie . "
They entered through the revolving doors and got a shot before security guards began to arrive and they had to abort and flee .
" We know the names of our patients , and a lot of them die , and I think that 's part of our loopiness , " explains Walter Moore , VP of government affairs .
Like Apple and Google , Genentech , despite the fun and games , is anything but relaxed .
Once or twice a year , staff scientists and researchers must defend their work before the Research Review Committee , the group of 13 Ph.D.s that decides how to allot the research budget .
Some find the experience nerve - wracking , and that 's okay , says Levinson .
" I do n't want people terrified , but it should not be a cakewalk either . "
The rigor is designed to vet the science , uncover the flaws , avoid the dead ends , and sift out politics and favoritism , so that in the end Levinson and Desmond - Hellmann have enough information to place the right bets on the research that will most likely lead to an actual drug .
Sometimes scientists fail , or the work is n't deemed sufficiently high priority , and the RRC puts an end to a project .
In those cases , not only are the researchers not fired ; they usually have a say in their next assignment .
True innovation takes guts .
Industry - wide , new drugs on average cost about $ 800 million and take up to 12 years to develop .
More than 90 percent of the drugs in clinical development never reach the market , including half of those that make it to late - stage clinical trials .
That 's why so many big drug companies are running out of new drugs .
For a long time it was easier and lucrative enough to pursue what Vishva Dixit , vice president of research , calls the " detergent " strategy -- creating me - too drugs in big established markets as if they were laundry soap , and then spending big bucks on marketing to steal share from rival pharmas .
At Genentech , using market data or return - on - investment analysis to drive the science is strictly taboo .
" At the end of the day , we want to make drugs that really matter , " says Levinson .
" That 's the transcendent issue . "
Not that this company considers itself a philanthropy .
By decade 's end , it aims to be the leading U.S. oncology company in terms of sales and a leader in both immunology and tissue - growth disorders , setting ambitious new product goals in each of those categories .
It has a salesforce of fewer than 1,000 and licenses with Roche and others to sell its products overseas .
Levinson really believes that if the company does the right thing , sales will follow .
The strategy : Fund enough basic research in targeted areas of interest , and the results will yield multiple drugs -- or drugs that can be used in multiple ways .
That makes Genentech an especially rewarding place to work for a scientist like Ferrara , whose 17 - year obsession -- launched with a breakthrough made on discretionary time -- led him to discover VEGF , a key to blood - vessel formation , which in turn enabled Genentech to develop an antibody that can choke off the blood supply to certain tumors .
Those discoveries laid the groundwork for two of Genentech 's newest drugs , Avastin , approved to treat colorectal cancer , and Lucentis , which is awaiting FDA approval for treatment of age - related blindness .
Avastin might have died a premature death when it failed clinical trials three years ago , causing the company 's share price to plunge nearly 10 percent overnight ( to a split - adjusted $ 14.45 a share ) .
But because Levinson and his lieutenants were so deep into the science , they knew better than to give up .
Avastin , approved in February 2004 , had sales of $ 774 million in the first nine months of 2005 .
Ferrara is studying VEGF alternatives for regulating blood supply that could lead to still more new drugs .
And Domagoj Vucic 's work that began with caterpillars has opened an area of anticancer research so promising that an executive calls it the company 's " search for the Holy Grail . "
It involves an effort to regulate apoptosis , the natural ability of cells to self - destruct when they 've lived out their lives or are stricken with disease .
For Vucic the quest is personal :
His friend and mentor at the University of Georgia , who helped launch the research , died of melanoma not long after Vucic left there .
It is the kind of long - term , high - risk research that makes Genentech employees proud -- and glad , they say , that they are n't at Big Pharma .
Scoffing at Big Pharma may be both great sport and an effective rallying cry , but everybody here is painfully aware that Genentech also runs the risk of getting too large .
By the end of this year , 40 percent of the workforce will have spent less than three years at Genentech ; another 40 percent of its managers will be new to their positions .
So the company is working furiously to acculturate the rookies .
New - hire orientation includes patient lectures , history lessons by Boyer and other old - timers , in - depth sessions on the company 's goals , its science -- and the fact that the place works " because of all the thousands of little decisions that are made every day , " says HR vice president Denise Smith - Hams .
The company polls its workers weekly to ferret out complaints and monitor whether all the new parties are aligned with Genentech 's goals .
When Levinson sees signs of culture atrophy , he pounces , as he did in an e-mail to senior managers in December about " the spread of unintelligible , gibberish - laden PowerPoint presentations ....
I have recently sat through several presentations that were simply incomprehensible -- mind - numbing , bloated discourses that were full of buzzwords and otherwise devoid of meaningful content .
This is a serious problem , and the worst part is that it 's spreading like the disease it is . "
( His abhorrence of corporate - speak helps explain why Levinson loathes consultants .
" They suck you dry , " he says . )
In case the memo alone does n't do the trick , Levinson invented a game called gBuzz Bingo .
Here 's how to play :
From the company intranet , download a bingo card featuring terms like " actionable , " " traction , " " value - added , " and " winwin . "
Take the card to any meeting where you expect the worst .
Check off boxes as the words are uttered .
First to complete a line wins , which of course requires that you shout out : " gBuzz ! "
The winner receives the smug satisfaction of silencing the b.s .
And DNA by the Bay , as Genentechers call their company , keeps its magic -- for one more meeting , at least .

This three - part series outlines a common sense , cost - effective approach to Website acceleration according to the two simple laws of Web performance :
Send as little data as possible Send it as infrequently as possible
If used properly , these basic principles should result in :
Faster Web page loads
Reduction of server usage
Improved bandwidth utilization
These techniques should not only improve user satisfaction with your site or Web - based application , but should also help you save money on site delivery costs .
The principles we will present in this series will not only be applied to developer - accessible Web page source including ( X ) HTML , CSS , and JavaScript , but will also address Web server configuration and modifications .
Some suggestions may touch on structural site changes or modifications to server - side programming environments , but our primary focus will be on relatively easy changes that can be made to existing sites .
The techniques derived from the two principles mentioned above fall into three major categories :
Client - side code optimization – dealt with in Part 1 of this series , which starts below .
Optimal cache control – Part 2 of this series Server - side modifications – Part 3 of this series
In the first part of this series , we ’ll focus on client - side code optimization — the easiest and generally cheapest to implement of the three site acceleration techniques .
As linked above , the subsequent parts of the series will deal with chache control and server side modifications in turn .
Part 1 – Client Side Acceleration
Code for Yourself , Compile for Delivery
Any application programmer knows that there are good reasons why the code we work with is not the code we should deliver .
It ’s best to comment source code extensively , to format it for maximum readability , and to avoid overly terse , but convoluted syntax that makes maintenance difficult .
Later , we use a compiler to translate that source code into some other form that ’s optimized for performance and protected from reverse engineering .
This model can be applied to Web development as well .
To do so , you would take the “ source ” version of your site and prepare it for delivery by “ crunching ” it down through simple techniques like white space reduction , image and script optimization , and file renaming .
You would then take your delivery - ready site and post it .
Now , presumably , this is n’t too foreign a concept , as you ’re probably at least working on a copy of your site , rather than posting changes directly to the live site .
If not , please stop reading right now and make a copy of your site !
This is the only proper way to develop , regardless of whether the site is a static brochure or a complex , CMS - driven application .
If you do n’t believe us now , you will some day in the very near future when you ruin some of your site files and can’t easily recover them .
As you build your site , you ’re probably focused on the biggest culprits in site download speed reduction — images and binary files like Flash .
While reducing the colors in GIF files , compressing JPEGs , and optimizing SWF files will certainly help a great deal , there are still plenty of other areas for improvement .
Remembering the first rule of Web performance , we should always strive to send as few bytes as possible , regardless of whether the file is markup , image , or script .
Now , it might seem like wasted effort to focus on shaving bytes here and there in ( X ) HTML , CSS or JavaScript .
However , this may be precisely where the greatest attention ought to be paid .
During a typical Web page fetch , an ( X ) HTML document is the first to be delivered to a browser .
We can dub this the host document , as it determines the relationships among all other files .
Once the XHTML document is received , the browser begins to parse the markup , and in doing so , often initiates a number of requests for dependent objects such as external scripts , linked style sheets , images , embedded Flash , and so on .
These CSS and JavaScript files may , in turn , host additional calls for related image or script files .
The faster these requests for dependent files are queued up , the faster they will get back to the browser and start rendering in the page .
Given the importance of the host document , it would seem critical to have it delivered to the browser and parsed as quickly as possible as , despite constituting a relatively small percentage of the overall page weight , it can dramatically impede the loading of the page .
Remember : users does n’t measure bytes , they measure time !
So what , specifically , do you need to do to fully prep your site for optimal delivery ?
The basic approach involves reducing white space , crunching CSS and JavaScript , renaming files , and similar strategies for making the delivered code as terse as possible ( see Google for an example ) .
These general techniques are well known and documented both on the Web and in books like Andy King ’s Speed up Your Site : Website Optimization .
In this article , we present what we consider to be the top twenty markup and code optimization techniques .
You can certainly perform some of these optimizations by hand , find some Web editors and utilities that perform a few of the features for you , or roll your own crunching utilities .
We do also somewhat shamelessly point you to a tool developed at Port80 Software , called the w3compiler .
This tool is the only one on the market today that provides a reference implementation for nearly all the optimizing features described here and that serves as a legitimate example of the “ real world ” value of code optimization .
Now , on with the tips !
Markup Optimization
Typical markup is either very tight , hand - crafted and standards - focused , filled with comments and formatting white space , or it is bulky , editor - generated markup with excessive indenting , editor - specific comments often used as control structures , and even redundant or needless markup or code .
Neither case is optimal for delivery .
The following tips are safe and easy ways to decrease file size :
1. Remove white space wherever possible .
In general , multiple white space characters ( spaces , tabs , newlines ) can safely be eliminated , but of course avoid changing < pre > , < textarea > , and tags affected by the white - space CSS property .
2. Remove comments .
Almost all comments , other than client - side conditional comments for IE and DOCTYPE statements , can safely be removed .
3. Remap color values to their smallest forms .
Rather than using all hex values or all color names , use whichever form is shortest in each particular case .
For example , a color attribute value like # ff0000 could be replaced with red , while lightgoldenrodyellow would become # fafad2 .
4. Remap character entities to their smallest forms .
As with color substitution , you can substitute a numeric entity for a longer alpha - oriented entity .
For example , È ; would become È ;.
Occasionally , this works in reverse as well : ð ; saves a byte if referenced as ð ; .
However , this is not quite as safe to do , and the potential savings are limited .
5. Remove useless tags .
Some “ junk ” markup , such as tags applied multiple times or certain < meta > tags used as advertisements for editors , can safely be eliminated from documents .
Questionable Markup Optimization Techniques
While the first five techniques can result in significant savings on the order of ten to fifteen percent , many tools and developers looking for maximum delivery compression employ some questionable techniques , including :
Quote removal on attributes
Doctype statement elimination
Optional close tag removal
Tag substitution like < strong > to < b >
While it is true that most browsers will make sense of whatever “ tag soup ” they are handed , reasonable developers will not rely on this and will , instead , always attempt to deliver standards - compliant markup .
Generally speaking , the problems associated with bypassing standards ( for example , diminished portability and interoperability ) outweigh the small gains in speed , and , in the case of missing closing tags , there may even be a performance penalty at page render .
While sites like Google have consciously employed many of these techniques on their homepage markup , you probably do n’t need to go that far .
We suggest that you avoid them unless you have extreme performance requirements .
CSS Optimizations
CSS is also ripe for simple optimizations .
In fact , most CSS created today tends to compress much more successfully than ( X ) HTML .
The following techniques are all safe , except for the final one , the complexities of which demonstrate the extent to which client - side Web technologies can be intertwined .
6. Remove CSS white space .
As is the case with ( X ) HTML , CSS is not terribly sensitive to white space , and thus its removal is a good way to significantly reduce the size of both CSS files and < style > blocks .
7. Remove CSS comments .
Just like markup comments , CSS comments should be removed , as they provide no value to the typical end user .
However , a CSS masking comment in a < style > tag probably should not be removed if you ’re concerned about down - level browsers .
8. Remap colors in CSS to their smallest forms .
As in HTML , CSS colors can be remapped from word to hex format .
However , the advantage gained by doing this in CSS is slightly greater .
The main reason for this is that CSS supports three - hex color values like #fff for white .
9 . Combine , reduce , and remove CSS rules .
CSS rules such as font - size , font - weight , and so on can often be expressed in a shorthand notation using the single property font .
When employed properly , this technique allows you to take something like :
p {font - size : 36pt ;
font - family : Arial ;
line - height : 48 pt ;
font - weight : bold;}
and rewrite it as :
p{font : bold 36pt/48pt Arial;}
You also may find that some rules in style sheets can be significantly reduced or even completely eliminated if inheritance is used properly .
So far , there are no automatic rule - reduction tools available , so CSS wizards will have to hand - tweak for these extra savings .
However , the upcoming 2.0 release of the w3compiler will include this feature .
10 . Rename class and id values .
The most dangerous optimization that can be performed on CSS is to rename class or id values .
Consider a rule like this :
.superSpecial {color : red ; font - size : 36pt;}
It might seem appropriate to rename the class to sS .
You might also take an id rule such as :
# firstParagraph {background - color : yellow;}
Here , you could use #fp in place of # firstParagraph , changing the appropriate id values throughout the document .
Of course , in doing this you start to run into the problem of markup - style - script dependency : if a tag has an id value , it is possible that this value is used not only for a style sheet , but also as a script reference , or even a link destination .
If you modify this value , you need to make very sure that you modify all related script and link references as well .
These references may even be located in other files , so be careful .
Changing class values is not quite as dangerous , since experience shows that most JavaScript developers tend not to manipulate class values as often as they do id values .
However , class name reduction ultimately suffers from the same problem as id reduction , so , again , be careful .
Note :
You should probably never remap name attributes , particularly on form fields , as these values are also operated on by server - side programs that would have to be altered as well .
Though not impossible , calculating such dependencies would be difficult in many Website environments .
JavaScript Optimization
More and more sites rely on JavaScript to provide navigational menus , form validation , and a variety of other useful things .
Not surprisingly , much of this code is quite bulky and begs for optimization .
Many of the techniques for JavaScript optimization are similar to those used for markup and CSS .
However , JavaScript optimization must be performed far more carefully because , if it ’s done improperly , the result is not just a visual distortion , but potentially a broken page !
Let ’s start with the most obvious and easiest improvements , then move on to those that require greater care .
11 . Remove JavaScript comments .
Except for the <!-- //--> masking comment , all JavaScript comments indicated by // or /* */ can safely be removed , as they offer no value to end users ( except those who want to understand how your script works ) .
12 . Remove white space in JavaScript .
Interestingly , white space removal in JavaScript is not nearly as beneficial as it might seem .
On the one hand , code like this :
x = x + 1 ;
can obviously be reduced to :
x=x+1 ;
However , because of the common sloppy coding practice of JavaScript developers failing to terminate lines with semi-colons , white space reduction can cause problems .
For example , consider the legal JavaScript below , which uses implied semi-colons :
x=x+1
y=y +1
A simple white space remover might produce the following :
x=x +1y=y+1
This would obviously throw an error .
If you add the needed semi-colons to produce :
x=x+1;y=y+1 ;
you actually gain nothing in byte count .
We still encourage this transformation , however , since Web developers who provided feedback on the Beta versions of w3compiler found the “ visually compressed ” script more satisfying ( perhaps as visual confirmation that they are looking at transformed rather than original code ) .
The also liked the side benefit of delivering more obfuscated code .
13 . Perform code optimizations .
Simple ideas like removing implied semi-colons , var statements in certain cases , or empty return statements , can help to further reduce some script code .
Shorthand can also be employed in a number of situations .
For example :
x=x+1 ;
can become :
x ++;
However , be careful , as it ’s quite easy to break your code unless your optimizations are very conservative .
14 . Rename user - defined variables and function names .
For good readability , any script should use variables like sumTotal instead of s .
However , for download speed , the lengthy variable sumTotal is a liability and it provides no user value , so s is a much better choice .
Here , again , writing your source code in a readable fashion and then using a tool to prepare it for delivery shows its value , since remapping all user - defined variable and function names to short one - and two - letter identifiers can produce significant savings .
15 . Remap built - in objects .
The bulkiness of JavaScript code , beyond long user variable names , comes from the use of built - in objects like Window , Document , Navigator and so on .
For example , consider this code :
alert ( window.navigator.appName ) ;
alert ( window.navigator.appVersion ) ;
alert ( window.navigator.userAgent ) ;
You could rewrite the above as follows :
w=window;n=w.navigator ; a=alert ;
a( n.appName ) ;
a( n.appVersion ) ;
a( n.userAgent ) ;
This type of remapping is quite valuable when objects are used repeatedly , which they generally are .
Note , however , that if the window or navigator object were used only once , these substitutions would actually make the code bigger , so be careful if you are optimizing by hand .
Fortunately , many JavaScript code optimizers will take this into account automatically .
This tip brings up a related issue regarding the performance of scripts with remapped objects : in addition to the benefit of size reduction , such remappings actually slightly improve script execution times because the objects are copied higher up into JavaScript ’s scope chain .
This technique has been used for years by developers who write JavaScript games , and while it can improve both download and execution performance , it does so at the expense of local browser memory usage .
The Obfuscation Side Effect of JavaScript Optimization
You ’ll notice that , if you apply these various JavaScript optimizations , the source code becomes effectively unreadable or , some might even say , obfuscated .
While it ’s true that the reverse engineering of optimized JavaScript can be difficult , it is far from impossible .
Real obfuscation would use variables like O1l1l1O0l1 and Ol11l001l , so that unraveling the code would be more confusing .
Some may even go so far as to employ light encryption on the page .
However , be aware that , in general , obfuscation and optimization can be at odds with each other , to the point that more obfuscated code may be larger than the original code .
Fortunately , lightweight code obfuscation is generally enough to deter casual code thieves , while still offering performance improvements .
File - Related Optimization
The last set of optimization techniques is related to file and site organization .
Some of the optimizations mentioned here might require server modifications or site restructuring .
16 . Rename non-user accessed dependent files and directories .
Sites will often have file names such as SubHeaderAbout.gif or rollover.js for dependent objects that are never accessed by a user via the URL .
Very often , these are kept in a standard directory like / images , so you may see markup like this :
<img src= " /images/SubHeaderAbout.gif " >
Or , worse :
< img src= " ../../../images/SubHeaderAbout.gif " >
Given that these files will never be accessed directly , this readability provides no value to the user , only the developer .
For delivery ’s sake it would make more sense to use markup like
<img src="/0/a.gif " >
While manual file - and - directory remapping can be an intensive process , some content management systems can deploy content to target names , including shortened values .
Furthermore , the w3compiler has a feature that automatically copies and sets up these dependencies .
If used properly , this can result in very noticeable savings in the ( X ) HTML files that reference these objects , and can also make reworking of stolen site markup much more difficult .
17 . Shorten all page URLs using a URL rewriter .
Notice that the previous step does not suggest renaming the host files like products .
html , which would change markup like this :
< a href= " products.html " >
Products </a>
to something like this :
< a href= " p.html " >
Products </a>
The main reason is that end users will see a URL like http://www.sitename.com/p.html, rather than the infinitely more usable http://www.sitename.com/products.html.
However , it is possible to reap the benefits of file name reduction in your source code without sacrificing meaningful page URLs if you combine the renaming technique with a change to your Web server ’s configuration .
For example , you could substitute p.html for products .
html in your source code , but then set up a URL rewriting rule to be used by a server filter like mod_rewrite to expand the URL back into a user friendly value .
Note that this trick will only put the new URL in the user ’s address bar if the rewrite rule employs an “ external ” redirect , thereby forcing the browser to re-request the page .
In this case , the files themselves are not renamed , as the short identifiers are only used in the source code URLs .
Because of the reliance on URL rewriting and the lack of widespread developer access to , and understanding of , such server - side tools as mod_rewrite , even an advanced tool like the w3 compiler does not currently promote this technique .
However , considering that sites like Yahoo !
actively employ this technique for significant savings , it should not be ignored , as it does produce noticeable ( X) HTML reduction when extremely descriptive directory and file names are used in a site .
18 . Remove or reduce file extensions .
Interestingly , there really is little value to including file extensions such as .gif , .jpg , .js , and so on .
The browser does not rely on these values to render a page ; rather it uses the MIME type header in the response .
Knowing this , we might take :
< img src= " images/SubHeaderAbout.gif " >
and shorten it to :
< img src=" images /SubHeaderAbout " >
If combined with file renaming , this might produce :

Do n’t be scared by how strange this technique looks ; your actual file will still be sA.gif .
It ’s just the end user who wo n’t see it that way !
In order to take advantage of this more advanced technique , however , you do need to make modifications to your server .
The main thing you will have to do is to enable something called “ content negotiation , ” which may be native to your server or require an extension such as mod_negotation for Apache or Port80 ’s pageXchanger for IIS .
The downside to this is that it may cause a slight performance hit on your server .
However , the benefits of adding content negotiation far outweigh the costs .
Clean URLs improve both security and portability of your sites , and even allow for adaptive content delivery whereby you can send different image types or languages to users based upon their browser ’s capabilities or system preferences !
See “ Towards Next Generation URLs ” by the same authors for more information .
Note : Extension - less URLs will not hurt your search engine ranking .
Port80 Software , as well as major sites like the W3C , use this technique and have suffered no ill effects .
19 . Restructure < script > and < style > inclusions for optimal number of requests .
You will often find in the < head > of an HTML document markup such as :
< script src= " / scripts/rollovers.js " ></ script >
< script src= " / scripts/validation.js " ></ script >
< script src= " / scripts/tracking.js " ></ script >
In most cases , this should have been reduced to :
< script src="/0/g.js " ></ script >
Here , g.js contains all the globally used functions .
While the break - up of the script files into three pieces makes sense for maintainability , for delivery , it does not .
The single script download is far more efficient than three separate requests , and it even reduces the amount of needed markup .
Interestingly , this approach mimics the concept of linking in a traditional programming language compiler .
20 . Consider cacheability at the code level .
One of the most important improvements to site performance that can be made is to improve cacheability .
Web developers may be very familiar with using the < meta > tag to set cache control , but ( apart from the fact that meta has no effect on proxy caches ) the true value of cacheability is in found in its application to dependent objects such as images and scripts .
To prepare your site for improved caching , you should consider segmenting your dependent objects according to frequency of change , storing your more cacheable items in a directory like / cache or / images / cache .
Once you start organizing your site this way , it will be very easy to add cache control rules that will make your site clearly “ pop ” for users who are frequent visitors .
Conclusion
You now have twenty useful code optimization tips to make your site faster .
One by one , they may not seem very powerful , but , apply them together , and you ’ll see an obvious improvement in site delivery .
In the next installment of this series , we ’ll focus primarily on caching , explaining how it is generally misused and how you can significantly improve performance with just a few simple changes .
See you then !
Part 2 – Effective Cache Control
In Part I of this series , we introduced the two basic laws of Web performance :
Send as little data as possible Send it as infrequently as possible
In the first installment , we focused on rule one and offered twenty tips to squeeze every byte out of delivered pages through code optimization , looking well beyond the obvious bandwidth - hogging images , to JavaScript , HTML , CSS , and even file name optimizations .
In this installment , we will focus primarily on rule number two , by means of better utilization of caching on the Web .
Once you start to design your sites with an eye towards effective caching control , you will dramatically reduce page load times for your users — particularly your most loyal , repeat visitors — while lowering your overall bandwidth consumption and freeing up your server resources .
The Many Types of Caches on the Web
The basic idea behind caching is simple : instead of wasting efforts by re-downloading a resource every time it is needed , keep a local copy , and reuse it for as long as it is still valid .
The most common example of Web caching is the browser cache , which stores copies of images and other page objects on an end user ’s hard drive for repeated use .
Though there are many other caches on the Web — at origin Web servers , along the network path , and even on the end user ’s local network — the purposes of all types of cache are essentially the same .
Looking out from a local browser cache , you might next encounter a proxy cache on your local network , implemented so that other users on the LAN do not have to access the Web to fetch the same site as you .
Next , your ISP or various transit ISPs further down the line might also employ a proxy cache to serve a site ’s objects to visitor on their network .
Finally , the actual Website may utilize a reverse proxy cache to hold generated pages in finished form , ready for delivery , in order to relieve the server of the burden of repeatedly generating and delivering frequently requested pages .
We can categorize all Web caches into two general varieties : private and public .
A private cache , most commonly a Web browser , is unique to a single user agent and is used to store items that should only be available for reuse by an individual end user .
On the other hand , proxy and reverse proxy caches are public caches .
These are used for shared resources — those items that can safely be reused by more than one end user .
The figure below shows the common cache types :
Cache Usage on the Web
This diagram illustrates a key point in our discussion : caches are found on the Web in many places and are constantly trying to hold your site content whenever possible .
While it ’s easy to remain ignorant and allow them to dictate caching behavior , from the standpoint of site performance , it is vital to engage the different forms of cache purposefully , dictating which objects should or should not be cached , and for how long .
Freshness and Validation
In order to make the best use of any cache , including browser cache , we need to provide some indication when a resource is no longer valid and should therefore be reacquired .
More specifically , we need the ability to indicate caching rules for Web page objects , ranging from setting appropriate expiration times , to indicating when a particular object should not be cached at all .
Fortunately , we have all these capabilities at our fingertips in the form of HTTP cache controls rules .
The key to cache awareness lies in understanding the two concepts that govern how caches behave : freshness and validation .
Freshness refers to whether or not a cached object is up - to - date , or , in more technical terms , whether or not a cached resource is in the same state as that same resource on the origin server .
If the browser or other Web cache lacks sufficient information to confirm that a cached object is fresh , it will always err on the side of caution and treat it as possibly out - of - date or stale .
Validation is the process by which a cache checks with the origin server to see whether one of those potentially stale cached object is fresh or not .
If the server confirms that the cached object is still fresh , the browser will use the local resource .
A Basic Example of Caching
The concepts of freshness and validation are best illustrated with an example ( in this case using a browser cache , but the core principles hold true to public caches as well ) :
Step 1
A remote site contains a page called page1.html .
This page references image1.gif , image2.gif , and image3.gif and has a link to page2.html .
When we access this page for the first time , the HTML and the associated GIF images are downloaded one - by - one and stored in the local browser cache .
Initial Cache Load
Once the data is downloaded to the cache , it is “ stamped ” to indicate where it came from and at what time it was accessed .
It may also be stamped with a third piece of information : when it needs to be reacquired .
But , as most sites do not stamp their data with this explicit cache control information , we ’ll assume that our example lacks this information .
Step 2
The user follows the link to page2.html , which has never been visited before , and which references image1.gif , image3.gif , and image4.gif .
In this case , the browser downloads the markup for the new page , but the question is : should it re-download image1.gif and image3.gif even though it already has them cached ?
The obvious answer would be no , but , how can we be sure that the images have not changed since we downloaded page1.html ?
Without cache control information , the truth is that we can’t .
Therefore , the browser would need to revalidate the image by sending a request to the server in order to check whether each image has been modified .
If it has not been changed , the server will send a quick “ 304 Not Modified ” response that instructs the browser to go ahead and use the cached image .
But , if it has been modified , a fresh copy of the image will have to be downloaded .
This common Not Modified request - and - response cycle is shown here :
Cache Check
From this basic example , it is apparent that , even when CSS , images , and JavaScript are fresh , we may not get the caching benefit we expect , since the browser still has to make a round trip to the server before it can reuse the cached copy .
The default “ Automatic ” setting in Internet Explorer partially reduces this continual chatter between browser and server by skipping the revalidation of cached objects during a single browser session .
You will notice that page load time is generally much quicker when you revisit the same page during the same browser session .
To see the performance penalty that would otherwise be incurred by all those 304 Not Modified responses , instead select “ Every visit to the page . ”
IE ’s Cache Control Dialog
Note : While IE ’s “ smart caching ” does cut down on unnecessary validation requests , it is also behind IE ’s continual reminders to users to clear their caches in order to see new content .
With caching , there is a trade - off for everything !
The Benefits of Caching
Minimizing round trips over the Web to revalidate cached items can make a huge difference in browser page load times .
Perhaps the most dramatic illustration of this occurs when a user returns to a site for the second time , after an initial browser session .
In this case , all page objects will have to be revalidated , each costing valuable fractions of a second ( not to mention consuming bandwidth and server cycles ) .
On the other hand , utilizing proper cache control allows each of these previously viewed objects to be served directly out of the browser ’s cache without going back to the server .
The effect of adding cache rules to page objects is often visible at page load time , even with a high bandwidth connection , and users may note that your sites appear to paint faster and that “ flashing ” is reduced between subsequent page loads .
Besides improved user perception , the Web server will be offloaded from responding to cache revalidation requests , and thus will be able to better serve new traffic .
However , in order to enjoy the benefits of caching , a developer needs to take time to write out a set of carefully crafted cache control policies that categorize a site ’s objects according to their intended lifetimes .
Here is an example of a complete set of cache control policies for a simple ecommerce Website :
As you can see , from the point of view of cache control , this site has six different types of objects .
As the logo and other corporate branding is unlikely to change , navigational and logo images are treated as virtually permanent .
Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript files are given freshness lifetimes to support a regular , semi-annual update schedule .
As fresh site content is important in terms of search engine optimization and user experience , the main header images are set up to be changed a bit more frequently .
The monthly “ special offer ” image is , of course , designed to stay fresh for one month .
There is also a personalized special offer image that remains fresh in a user ’s cache for two weeks after the initial visit ; note that this category is marked “ private ” to indicate that it is not to be cached by a shared / proxy cache .
Finally , the default policy for everything else on the site states that nothing else should be cached , which guarantees that text and dynamic content is served fresh for each request .
You need to be very careful not to cache HTML pages , whether or not they are statically generated , unless you really know what you ’re doing .
If anything , you should use cache control to make sure these pages are not cached .
If a user caches your HTML page , and you set a lengthy expiration time , they will not see any of the content changes you may make until the cached object expires .
On the other hand , if you focus on caching dependent objects , such as images , Flash files , JavaScript , and style sheets , you can replace that cached content simply by renaming the objects .
For example , let ’s say you have a policy to change your site ’s logo files once a year , but in the middle of that year , your company makes a significant branding change that needs to be reflected on the site .
Fortunately , if you have not set your HTML files to be cached , you can still serve the new logo by renaming the file from logo.gif to newlogo.gif and changing the associated HTML < img > references .
As the HTML is parsed , the browser will note that it does not have the new image in its cache and will download it .
Of course , the old image will still be in the user ’s cache for quite some time , but it will no longer be used .
After you ’ve considered carefully what site resources should and should not be cached , the next step is to implement those policies .
Taking Charge of Caching
There are three methods we can use to set cache control rules for the Web :
Specify cache control headers via a < meta > tag Set HTTP headers programmatically Set HTTP headers through Web server settings
Each of these approaches has its pros and cons .
< meta >
Tags for Basic Caching
The simplest way to implement cache control is to use the < meta > tag .
For example , we could set the Expires header to a date in the future :
< meta http-equiv= " Expires " content = " Sun , 31 Oct 2004 23:59:00 GMT " />
In this case , a browser parsing this HTML will assume that this page does not expire until October 2004 and will add it to its cache .
Because the page will be stamped with this Expires header , the browser wo n’t re-request the page until after this date or until the user modifies the browser ’s caching preferences or clears the cache manually .
Of course , while it is often advantageous to cache page data , as we mentioned above , there are instances in which you would not want to cache data at all .
In these cases , you might set the Expires value to a date in the past :
< meta http-equiv= " Expires " content = " Sat , 13 Dec 2003 12:59:00 GMT " />
You might be concerned about clock variations on the user ’s system and therefore choose a date that has long since passed , but in reality , this is rarely an issue since it is the server ’s Date response header response that matters for cache control .
The use of Expires with a past date in a < meta > tag should work for both HTTP 1.0 - and 1.1 - compliant browsers .
There are two more < meta > tags that are often used to make sure that a page is not cached .
The Pragma tag is used to talk to HTTP 1.0 browser caches , while the Cache - Control tag is used for HTTP 1.1 clients .
It never hurts to include both of these if you want to make sure that a page is never cached , regardless of browser type or version :
< meta http -equiv= " Pragma " content = " no - cache " />
< meta http-equiv= " Cache - Control " content = " no - cache " />
As easy as < meta > tags might appear , they suffer from one major problem — they are not able to be read by intermediary proxy caches , which generally do not parse HTML data , but instead rely directly on HTTP headers to control caching policy .
Because of this lost potential value , and given the fact that browsers will readily use HTTP headers , < meta > - based cached control really should not be a developer ’s primary approach to cache control .
Programming Cache Control
Most server - side programming environments , such as PHP , ASP , and ColdFusion , allow you to add or modify the HTTP headers that accompany a particular response .
To do this in ASP , for example , you would use properties of the built - in Response object by including code such as this at the top of your page :
<%
Response .
Expires = " 1440 "
Response.CacheControl = " max-age=86400 , private "
%>
Here , you ’re asking ASP to create both an Expires header ( for HTTP 1.0 - compliant caches ) and a Cache - Control header ( for HTTP 1.1 caches ) .
You are also specifying a freshness lifetime for this cached object of twenty - four hours ( note that the Expires property requires a value in minutes while CacheControl uses seconds ) .
As a result , the following headers would be added to the HTTP response ( assuming “ now ” is 8:46 PM on Friday , February 13th , 2004 Greenwich Mean Time ) :
Expires : Sat , 14 Feb 2004 20:46:04 GMT
Cache - control : max - age=86400 , private
By and large , it ’s much more efficient to rely on these kinds of server - side mechanisms , rather than < meta > tags , to communicate with caches .
So , when you have a choice between implementing cache - control policies using the < Meta > element , and doing so using a server - side programming environment like ASP , always choose the latter .
However , there is a different issue about which the server - side programming environment can do nothing .
Imagine that the ASP file for which we created the above code links to several images that , according to your cache control policies , have freshness lifetimes of a full year .
How would you implement the HTTP headers to tell caches that they can store those images for that long ?
You could try to use a server - side script to return the images programmatically , but this is both complex and wasteful .
A better approach to setting cache control information for static externals like CSS , JavaScript , and binary objects like images , is to set cache control information on the server itself .
Web Server - Based Cache Settings
Both Microsoft IIS and Apache provide a variety of facilities for cache control .
Unfortunately , each has a different approach to caching , and delegation of cache control policies is not cleanly in the hands of those who are most familiar with a site ’s resources — developers !
Apache Cache Control
When it comes to implementing cache control policies easily , users of the Apache Web server are somewhat better off than those running IIS , provided that the Apache module http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_expires.html mod_expires is installed .
With mod_expires , a server administrator can set expiration lifetimes for the different objects on a site in the main server configuration file ( usually httpd.conf ) .
As is often the case for Apache modules , both the Virtual Host and Directory containers can be used to specify different directives for different sites , or even for different directories within a given site .
This is much more convenient than having to use IIS ’s graphical user interface or metabase scripting objects .
Even handier is mod_expires ’s ExpiresByType directive , which allows you to set the expiration lifetime for all files of a given MIME type with a single line of code .
This directive allows you to easily set cache policies for all the scripts , style sheets , or images in your site .
Of course , you often need to craft more fine - grained policies based upon object type or directory .
In this case , the settings specified in the primary configuration file can be overridden ( at the server administrator ’s discretion ) by directives in a .htaccess file for a given directory and its children .
In this way , developers can write and maintain their own cache control directives without requiring administrative access to the server , even in a shared hosting environment .
If your Apache server was not built with mod_expires , the best way to enable it is to build it as a shared object ( using aspx is generally easiest ) and then to include the following line in your httpd .
conf file :
LoadModule expires_module modules/mod_expires.so
You can then put your configuration directives right into httpd.conf .
However , many administrators will want to locate these in an external configuration file to keep things neat .
We will follow this practice in our example , using Apache ’s Include directive in httpd.conf ( the IfModule container is an optional , but traditional , safety measure ) :
< IfModule mod_expires .c >
Include conf/expires.conf
</ IfModule >
We can now locate the directives that control how mod_expires behaves in a module - specific configuration file called expires .
conf .
Here is a sample set of such directives :
ExpiresActive On
ExpiresDefault " access 1 month "
ExpiresByType image / png " access 3 months "
The ExpiresActive directive simply enables mod_expires , while the ExpiresDefault directive sets up a default expiration lifetime that will be used to create Expires and Cache - Control headers for any files to which more specific rules do not apply .
Note the syntax used for specifying the expiration lifetime ; the time unit can be anything from seconds to years , while the base time can be specified as modification , as well as access .
Next is the very useful ExpiresByType directive mentioned earlier , here applied to all .png image files on the server :
< Directory " /usr/local/apache/htdocs/static " >
AllowOverride Indexes
ExpiresDefault " access 6 months "
</ Directory >
Finally , we have a Directory container that overrides all other rules for anything in the directory / static .
This directory has its own ExpiresDefault directive , as well as an AllowOverride directive that allows the settings for itself and its children to be overridden by means of .htaccess files .
The .htaccess file , in turn , might look like this :
ExpiresByType text / html " access 1 week "
Note that this overrides any directives that would otherwise have applied to files in / static and its children that have the MIME type text / html .
Using a combination of configuration file directives , and then overriding those directives using .htaccess , almost any set of cache control policies , no matter how complex , can be easily implemented by both administrators and , if properly delegated , developers .
IIS Cache Control
If you ’re setting cache control rules on Microsoft ’s Internet Information Service ( IIS ) , you need access to the IIS Metabase .
This is typically accessed via the Internet Service Manager ( ISM ) , the Microsoft management console application that controls IIS administrative settings .
To set an expiration time in IIS , simply open the ISM , bring up the property sheet for the file or directory that you want to configure , and click on the “ HTTP Headers ” tab .
Next , put a check in the box labeled “ Enable Content Expiration ” and , using the radio buttons , choose one of the options provided .
You can choose to expire the content immediately , set a relative expiration time ( in minutes , hours , or days ) , or set an absolute expiration time .
Note that both Expires and Cache - Control headers will be inserted into the affected responses .
The basic idea is shown here .
IIS Cache Control Settings
Despite the user - friendliness of the GUI , it is actually rather clumsy to set different cache control policies for different categories of files on IIS .
It gets much worse if the site ’s files are not neatly segregated into directories based on their desired freshness lifetimes .
If you happen to have designed your site with caching in mind , and put different classes of files in different directories , such as / images / dynamic , images / static , images / navigation , and so on , it ’s easy to set up caching policies via the MMC .
But , if you have n’t designed your site this way , or you ’re working to optimize an existing site , you may literally have to set the policy on each and every file , which would be quite a chore .
Even more troubling is that , unlike Apache , IIS offers no easy way to delegate to developers the authority to set cache policy , as modification of the required settings necessitates MMC access .
Fortunately , these gaps in functionality between IIS and Apache with mod_expires enabled can be closed fairly easily with a third - party tool such as CacheRight from Port80 Software .
Modeled after mod_expires , CacheRight creates a single , text - based rules file that lives in each Website ’s document root and allows both administrators and developers to set expiration directives for an entire site .
In addition , CacheRight goes beyond mod_expires by adding an ExpiresByPath directive to complement the ExpiresByType directive .
This functionality makes it trivially easy to set both a general cache control policy for files of a given type , and to override that rule with a more specific one for a subset of files of that type , as in this example :
ExpiresByType image /* : 6 months after access public
ExpiresByPath / navimgs /* , / logos /* : 1 year after modification public
Here , all images will have a freshness lifetime of six months , except those located in the navimgs and logos directories .
Like mod_expires , CacheRight lets you set the expiration times relative to the modification time of the file (s ) , as well as to the user ’s first access .
This flexibility can be very useful when publication or update schedules are not set in stone , which is , of course , all too common in Web development .
Regardless of which server you use , it ’s well worth the time to figure out how to manage cache control at the server level .
As with programmatic cache control , the directives will be respected by well - behaved intermediary caches and not just by browser caches , as in the case of the < meta > tag approach .
Furthermore , unlike programmatic or < meta > tag - based cache control , server - based cache control makes it easy to set caching policies for all the really heavy objects in a site , such as images or Flash files .
It is in the caching of these objects that performance gains are most obvious .
Conclusion
While we ’ve only scratched the surface of the complex topic of caching , hopefully we have shed some light on this under - appreciated facet of Website performance .
In particular , we hope that you better understand why it is vital to have a set of cache control policies for your site , and that you have gained some ideas about how to go about effectively implementing those policies .
The results of properly applied cache rules will be obvious — dramatically faster page loads for your end users , especially repeat visitors .
In addition , you will make more efficient use of your bandwidth and your server resources .
The fact that all these enhancements can be achieved through little more than a heightened attention to HTTP headers makes effective , expiration - based cache - control one of the most cost - effective performance optimizations you will ever make to your site .
Next week , we ’ll wrap up this series on cost - effective Website acceleration by focusing on Web server modifications , most notably standard HTTP compression .
We ’ll then present a case study that will illustrate the concrete performance gains that can be achieved by applying all the techniques together .
Part 3 – Server Side Modifications
In the first part of this series , we introduced the two basic laws of Web performance .
To refresh your memory , these are :
Send as little data as possible Send it as infrequently as possible
In that article , we focused on rule one and offered twenty tips to squeeze every byte out of delivered pages through code optimization , looking well beyond the obvious bandwidth - hogging images , to JavaScript , HTML , CSS , and even file name optimizations .
In the second installment , we turned to rule two and saw how to enhance site performance by using cache control headers .
We discovered that the best approach to cache control was at the server level .
So , in this final installment , we ’ll see what other server - side changes can be made in order to speed up site delivery , starting with HTTP compression .
What Exactly Is HTTP Compression ?
HTTP compression is a long - established Web standard that is only now receiving the attention it deserves .
The basic idea of HTTP compression is that a standard gzip or deflate encoding method is applied to the payload of an HTTP response , significantly compressing the resource before it is transported across the Web .
Interestingly , the technology has been supported in all major browser implementations since early in the 4.X generation ( for Internet Explorer and Netscape ) , yet few sites actually use it .
A study by Port80 Software showed that less than 4 % of Fortune 1000 Websites employ HTTP compression on their servers .
However , on leading Websites like Google , Amazon , and Yahoo ! , HTTP content encoding is nearly ubiquitous .
Given that it provides significant bandwidth savings to some of the biggest sites on the Web , progressive administrators owe it to themselves to explore the idea of HTTP compression .
The key to HTTP content encoding can be found in the Accept request headers sent by a browser .
Consider the request from Mozilla Firefox below , and note in particular the Accept , Accept - Language , Accept - Encoding , and Accept - Charset headers :
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host : www.port80software.com
User -Agent : Mozilla / 5.0 ( Windows ; U ; Windows NT 5.1 ; en-US ; rv:1.6 ) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8
Accept:text/xml , application/xml , application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9 ,
text / plain;q=0.8 , video/x-mng , image/png , image/jpeg , image/gif;q=0.2,*/*;q=0.1
Accept - Language : en-us , en;q=0.5
Accept -Encoding : gzip , deflate
Accept - Charset : ISO - 8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep - Alive : 300
Connection : keep - alive
These “ accept ” values can be used by the server to determine the appropriate content to send back using Content Negotiation — a very powerful feature that allows
Web servers to return different languages , character sets , and even technologies based on user characteristics .
Content negotiation is a very broad topic , so we ’ll focus solely on the element which relates to server - side compression .
The Accept - Encoding header indicates the type of content encoding that the browser can accept beyond the standard plain text response , in this case gzip - and deflate - compressed content .
Looking at Internet Explorer ’s request headers , we see similar Accept - Encoding values :
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host : www.google.com
User -Agent : Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1 ; .NET CLR 1.1.4322 )
Accept:image/gif , image/x-xbitmap , image/jpeg , image/pjpeg , application/vnd.ms-excel ,application/vnd.ms-powerpoint,application/msword,application/x-shockwave-flash,*/*
Accept -Encoding : gzip , deflate
Accept - Language : en-us
Connection : keep - alive
Given that nearly every major browser in use today supports gzip and deflate encoding ( and that those few that do n’t should not be sending the Accept - Encoding headers ) , we can easily modify Web servers to return compressed content to some browsers and standard content to others .
As an example ( illustrated below ) , if our browser tells Google that it does not accept content encoding , we get back 3,358 bytes of data ; however , if we do send the Accept - Encoding header , we get back compressed data of just 1,213 bytes along with a response header saying Content - Encoding : gzip .
You wo n’t see any differences between the pages if you “ view source , ” but if you have a network trace , you will notice that the response is different :
Google Compressed / Uncompressed Comparison
While , in this case , the files are small , you can see that the reduction is still significant — in this case , a 74 % smaller file size .
Through a combination of HTML , CSS , JavaScript code optimization ( as discussed in Part I of this series ) and HTTP content encoding , Google achieves an impressive feat — fitting its page into a single TCP response packet !
While Google may have bandwidth concerns far beyond those of the average Website , HTTP content encoding can decrease HTML , CSS , JavaScript , and plain text file size by 50 % or more .
Unfortunately , HTTP content encoding ( the terms “ compression ” and “ content encoding ” are roughly synonymous ) really only applies to text content , as compressing binary formats like image files generally provides no value .
Even assuming that binary files make up the bulk of the payload of the average site , you should still see , on average , a 15 - 30 % overall reduction in page size if HTTP content encoding is used .
Server Support for HTTP Content Encoding
If you ’re already convinced of the value of HTTP compression , the next big question is : how do you employ it ?
In the case of the Apache Web server , it is possible to add HTTP content encoding using either mod_gzip or mod_deflate .
In the case of Microsoft IIS , things can get a little sticky .
While IIS 5 includes native support for gzip encoding , it is a notoriously buggy implementation , especially considering the fine - grained configuration changes that must be made to overcome a wide variety of browser nuances .
So , in the case of IIS 5 , third party compression add - ons in the form of ISAPI filters , such as httpZip , PipeBoost , and XCompress , are most often the best way to go .
IIS 6 built - in compression is much faster and more flexible , but it is still difficult to configure in more than a basic manner without getting into the IIS Metabase .
ZipEnable represents the first tool designed to allow for truly fine - grained management of IIS 6 built - in compression .
The Real Deal with Server - Side Content Encoding
There is an important trade - off to be considered when you implement HTTP compression ; if you configure your server to compress content on the way out , you may reduce bandwidth usage , but at the same time , you ’ll increase CPU load .
In most cases , this is not a problem , especially given how little work Web servers actually do .
However , in the case of a very highly trafficked Website running a large amount of dynamic content on servers that are already at the limit of available CPU cycles , the downsides of compression may actually outweigh the advantages .
Adding extra server hardware would , of course , alleviate the problem and allow you to enjoy the substantial bandwidth savings offered by compression .
It ’s up to you to determine whether the reduction in bandwidth expenses and other infrastructure costs ( fewer routers , switches , and dedicated lines ) outweighs the upfront investment in new hardware .
Ultimately though , the most interesting aspect of HTTP compression is what developers and administrators expect to see when rolling it out , versus what they actually see .
While you will definitely find that bandwidth utilization decreases , all your users may not enjoy dramatically faster page loads .
Because of the increased CPU load created by the compression and decompression process , time to first byte ( TTFB ) generally increases ; thus , browser ca n’t start painting the page slightly later .
For a user with a slow ( that is , a low bandwidth ) connection , this is still a good trade - off ; because the data is compressed into fewer , smaller packets , it will be delivered much faster , so the slight initial delay is far outweighed by the faster overall page paint .
Broadband users , on the other hand , will probably not see a perceptible performance improvement with HTTP compression .
In both cases , you will save money through bandwidth reduction .
But if perceived response time is your primary goal and you serve a lot of dial - up traffic , you may want to first focus on caching ( discussed in Part II ) as a performance enhancement strategy .
Another potential problem with HTTP content encoding relates to server - load from script - generated pages , such as those in PHP or ASP .
The challenge in this case is that the page content may have to be recompressed for every request ( rather than being compressed once and then cached ) , which will add significant load to the server beyond that added by the compression of static content .
If all your pages are generated at page load time , you should therefore be careful when adding HTTP content encoding .
Fortunately , many commercial compression add - ons will know to cache generated content when possible , but be aware that some cheaper solutions lack this vital feature .
However , this “ problem ” does point to a second , obvious server - side performance improvement — page pre-caching .
Dynamic Pages : Build Them Now or Build Them Later ?
Interestingly , many developers dynamically build many or all of their sites ’ pages at visit time .
For example , the URL http://www.domain.com/article.php?id=5 suggests that the page is being built from a database query or template fill - in .
The problem with this common practice is that , in many cases , building such a page at request time is pointless , because most of the time it is primarily static .
So - called static dynamic pages , or scripted pages , whose contents do n’t change for long periods of time , obviously do nothing to improve page delivery time .
In fact , on a heavily trafficked site they can needlessly bog down your server .
One approach to addressing unnecessary dynamic page generation would be to pre-build the page into a static content page complete with a .html extension every time it changes .
By preference , any such generated pages would not only be static HTML files , but would also be code optimized versions ( as discussed in Part I ) .
Not only does this make it easier for the server to deliver the page quickly , because it does n’t have to do any work before it returns it , but the technique actually makes the site more search engine friendly .
Unfortunately , in many cases , simply generating pages to static HTML is not possible because the pages do indeed have dynamic content that must be executed at page view time .
In this case , your best bet is to “ bake ” the page into a faster - to - execute form .
In the case of ASP .
NET , this would utilize the byte code format , which is much faster for the server to execute .
Unfortunately , you need to force the byte code by executing pages first , before you let your users access them .
Fortunately , upcoming versions of ASP .
NET 2.0 are going to help mitigate the tiresome task some developers currently undertake of “ touching ” all of their pages once to ensure quick first downloads for users .
In the case of PHP , you may find a product like the Zend optimization suite to be a wise investment .
Given the differing requirements of serving static and dynamic pages , or HTML and images , it seems wise to revisit the physical server and other hardware for additional acceleration ideas .
One of the more intelligent impulses that can lead people to add or beef up hardware for the sake of Web acceleration is the idea of specialization — that different elements are required to do different jobs with maximum efficiency .
Even though , in the name of cost - efficiency , our main focus through this series has been on the source code and the Web server ( and related ) software , let ’s now take a quick look at these other elements .
Turbo Charging Your Web Server
A good place to turn in order to speed up your site is the server software and hardware itself .
Starting with software , it is fairly unlikely that Web administrators are going to quickly dump IIS for Apache or Apache for IIS , even when security , ease of use , or performance are cited as reasons to leave one camp for another .
Put simply , the Web server and its associated operating system are often so intertwined with the Website (s ) that migration becomes an onerous and even risky task .
If you do start thinking about dumping one platform for another , you should also seriously consider alternate platforms , such as Zeus , particularly if speed is a primary concern .
When it comes to hardware , carefully consider the main tasks that the server (s ) performs .
In the case of a static Website , it is primarily to marshal network connections and to copy files from disk to network .
To accelerate such a site , you want to focus on building a Web server with very fast disk and network subsystems , as well as enough memory to handle simultaneous requests .
You may , in fact , choose to get very aggressive in adding memory to your system and try to cache all heavily used objects in memory , in order to avoid disk access altogether .
Interestingly , processor speed is not nearly as important as you might think in a site serving static files ; it does help , but the disk will often prove to be a bigger bottleneck .
When the site is serving dynamic as well as static pages , obviously , processor speed becomes more important , but even in this case , having a fast drive or dual NICs can still be more important .
On the other hand , the combination of a lot of dynamic page generation with other processor - intensive responsibilities like SSL and / or HTTP compression makes it more likely that the CPU is the resource in need of enhancing .
In other words , what the server does will determine how it can most effectively be beefed up .
Even if you do n’t have the budget to customize your server hardware or software , there might be some changes you can make fairly cheaply .
For example , you might consider tuning your operating system ’s TCP / IP settings for the most efficient use of those underlying TCP / IP resources on which HTTP is dependent .
This might be a matter of adjusting the TCP receive window to a size best suited to your application and your server ’s network connection .
You might make sure that TCP features that can be toggled , such as delayed ACKs or TCP_NODELAY , are used or not used , depending again on the characteristics of the application and the network environment .
Or it might simply be a matter of making sure your box is not suffering from port exhaustion due to excessive TIME_WAIT times or other causes .
However , before twisting the knobs on your network characteristics , both in the Web server and on the operating system , make sure to set up realistic load tests to verify that your improvements do n’t actually slow users down or cause excessive retransmits on your network .
In other words , do n’t try to implement these types of fixes unless you understand how to measure their value .
Acceleration by Division of Labor
Another consideration when addressing site acceleration is that not every form of site content has the same delivery characteristics .
Given that different content has different characteristics , we may find that dividing the specific serving duties of a site between several servers is better than simply duplicating site duties evenly across a server farm .
A simple example of acceleration via division of labor occurs when a site uses SSL encryption for a shopping cart or extranet .
In the case of SSL , you might find that your server bogs down very rapidly when you have multiple users in the https sections of your site , due to the significant overhead introduced by the encryption .
In this situation , it makes sense to offload this traffic to another server .
For example , you might keep your main site on www.domain.com and , for the checkout portion of the site , link to shop.domain.com .
The shop.domain.com server could be a special box equipped to handle the SSL traffic , potentially using an SSL acceleration card .
Segmentation allows you to focus the necessary resources on those users in checkout without bogging down those who are just browsing .
You might even find that serving your images or other heavy binaries like PDF files or .EXE downloads from one server might make sense , since these connections take much longer to shut down than ordinary connections and , in the meantime , hold valuable TCP / IP resources hostage .
Furthermore , you would not bother with HTTP content encoding on the media server , but would , of course , apply it to the primary text server for HTML , CSS , and JavaScript .
In this way , you maximize the use of that server ’s otherwise underutilized CPU for the sake of bandwidth optimization , while leaving the CPU of the media server free to do its job .
Segmentation can be further applied to generated pages .
You might consider serving generated pages from a box built for that purpose , offloading your static content to a different machine .
Already , many sites employ just such a scenario , using a reverse proxy cache such as Squid .
In this setup , the proxy serves static content quickly , while the back - end server builds the content that truly must be generated at page view time .
The cache control policies and rules discussed in Part II of this series become quite important in this type of setup ; you will want to make sure that the proxy server ’s cache stores everything that it is safe to store in a shared cache , and that it does n’t retain anything that is intended only for a particular user .
Speed for Sale
We have focused primarily on low cost acceleration techniques in this series , but as we get towards the end , costs appear in the form of new software and new hardware .
It is possible to spend quite a bit of money on Web acceleration by purchasing exotic acceleration appliances that perform connection offloading , compression , caching , and a variety of other functions for your site .
If you have an extremely high bandwidth bill , these solutions can be very effective , but most sites can stick with the cheaper approaches we ’ve discussed here , such as code optimization , caching , and HTTP encoding .
Yet , even if you did have a lot of money and were able to build out a specialized server farm and add exotic acceleration devices , you would eventually reach a limit to the benefits gained from compressing and caching content .
To improve your speed now you ’d have only one last option — to move the content closer to the user ( and , if possible , apply all the same techniques again ) .
You ’ve probably noticed that sites that offer downloads often mirror content so that users can download from multiple locations .
However , it is possible to provide content in a more geographically - sensitive manner , and to do so transparently .
Content distribution networks ( CDNs ) like Akamai allow us to move heavy content such as images and other binary downloads closer to users by taking advantage of thousands of edge caches located around the world .
While this technique provides significant performance improvements and is widely used by the world ’s largest sites , it certainly does not fit in the category of cost - effective , and thus we mention it only to follow our acceleration options to their logical conclusion .
Before you resort to these drastic and usually unnecessary measures , we conclude our series with a brief example of how the low cost ideas we have presented over the last three weeks can improve page load times , bandwidth usage , and server load for a real site , in this case , looking at the home page of SitePoint.com itself .
Applied Acceleration : SitePoint.com
Let ’s grab the SitePoint.com homepage using Internet Explorer 6.0 .
When we request SitePoint.com for the first time , we see that the homepage is actually made up of about 37 distinct objects .
But , we also notice right away several interesting things that SitePoint ’s developers are doing to accelerate their home page :
On the main or containing part of the page , the HTML content is compressed using HTTP content encoding ( specifically , gzip ) .
Without gzip , the original file size would be 28,218 bytes .
With it , the transferred size is only 7,774 bytes — a saving of about 72 % .
SitePoint ’s dial - up users will definitely thank them for that .
A closer look at the response headers tells us that this same page is also sent using chunked transfer - encoding , which can help mitigate the time to first byte penalty associated with HTTP compression .
This means that even broadband users might experience a faster page load .
Something else we learn from the response headers is that , while the home page is dynamically built using PHP , the developers have minimized the performance impact of this by using a third - party tool that pre-interprets the PHP script and caches the interpreted instructions in memory ( the giveaway is the response header X - Accelerated - By : PHPA / 1.3.3r2 ) .
With a script cache like this one , the page is still dynamic ( in the sense that its HTML output is not cached ) , but the server - side overhead of loading up the script and interpreting it into executable instructions every time it is requested is avoided — a nice compromise between full pre-generation and a purely dynamic page .
Is there anything else that SitePoint.com could do , on the cheap , to optimize things even further ?
There are several possibilities , which we have summarized in the following table :
This table ( click here for the larger version ) shows the effects of file size reduction in two stages — first , the application of source optimization described in the first installment of this series ( the byte count in the “ Optimized ” column ) , then the application of HTTP compression , which we covered in this article ( the byte count in the “ Gzipped ” column ) .
We ’ve given the compressed ( gzipped ) size for the main page ( index. php ) just as we got it in IE , but we have n’t applied source code optimization to it , since it is dynamic .
In addition , however , there are eight static external text files ( 5 CSS and 3 JavaScript ) that are not being compressed or code optimized at all , but that could definitely benefit from both .
We ’ve shown the results here , and as you can see in the Percentage Saved columns , the resulting overall savings are substantial — a 13 % saving for the whole home page ( all dependencies included ) just with source code optimization , and a 50 % saving with source code optimization plus HTTP compression .
These percentages could go even higher if the index .
php were source code - optimized as well ( which would probably yield an additional 1000 bytes or so ) .
The last two columns focus on the topic of the second article in the series : cache control .
Expiration - based cache control is n’t being used on the SitePoint.com home page , except for a few externally hosted or highly specialized resources .
The “ Reval ? ” column shows which of the files , as a consequence , need to be revalidated upon a return visit , even though they are present in the browser ’s cache .
SitePoint could consider making much wider use of explicit expiration times , especially for the plethora of relatively invariant images that make up the home page , as well as for the static external text files that contain CSS and JavaScript .
Authoring and implementing a good set of cache control policies for such objects would help to avoid some or all of the 31 separate client - server round trips required to revalidate already cached objects when a user returns to the home page in a new browser session .
That ’s 31 fewer 304 Not Modified messages in the server logs for every return page view , but more importantly , would also reduce return visitor page load times .
The last column shows that these revalidation round trips take between one and seven tenths of a second each .
Even though a number of them occur simultaneously when a user returns to the home page ( and take up a bunch of TCP resources on the server - side in the process ! ) , that ’s still a substantial wait compared to essentially instantaneous serving of those same objects from the browser ’s cache — which is where they wound up coming from in any case .
Conclusion
Our simple case study clearly demonstrates that , when used together , the techniques presented in this series can significantly improve the server load , bandwidth usage , and page load times of almost any Website .
All are relatively simple to implement and none require large expenditures on new hardware or software .
Granted , no acceleration technique is without its downsides ; code optimization requires a time investment from developers , caching requires increased coordination between development and administration , and compression can tax server resources in order to save bandwidth .
In conclusion , we hope we have provided you with a better understanding of the principles behind Website performance and a number of specific enhancement techniques that will help you to carefully put your foot on the gas .

Jon Stewart is very funny and on his cult US television show he 's a rare scourge of the rich and powerful , especially Bush and his court .
Gary
Younge puts it to him , is he really angry with America , or is he a man on a mission for the next joke ?
Back in early 2003 , as Democrats discussed setting up a liberal talk radio station to counter the right 's supremacy in the culture wars , there was concern that progressive values were inherently unsuited to a popular format .
" Progressives have this problem : they sound too erudite , it 's like eggheads talking at you , " Thomas Athans , co-founder of Democracy Radio , Inc , told the New York Times .
" Most liberal talkshows are so , you know , milquetoast , who would want to listen to them ? " said Harry Thomason , a Hollywood producer close to Bill Clinton .
" Conservatives are all fire and brimstone . "
Meanwhile , over on the cable TV channel Comedy Central , Jon Stewart appears to have cracked it , albeit in another medium .
His nightly formula of spoof news , sarcastic asides , satirical swipes and teasing interviews on The Daily Show has since 1999 been hammering away at political elites in general and , since his election , the Bush administration in particular .
In that time it has gained cult status and audience figures climbing to around 1.5 million .
Last month The Daily Show - a British equivalent would be somewhere between Have I Got News For You and The Fast Show - won Emmy Awards for best comedy and best writing .
Stewart 's book , America , a jokey guide to democracy , was the year 's nonfiction bestseller .
( Sample discussion question : " Which of the following is the best combination of reasons to vote for a candidate ? a ) Issues and eyes ; b) Party affiliation and hair ; c ) Background and teeth ; d) Religious zealotry and tits . "
Sample classroom activity : " Hold a mock election .
If you can't do this , mock a real election . " )
Less blunt than Michael Moore , but more politically engaged than late - night hosts Jay Leno or David Letterman , Stewart , 42 , combines the irreverence of Chris Evans with the wit of Armando Iannucci .
His show is anything but milquetoast .
While Stewart and his team will often lampoon Democrats and liberals , the show 's staple diet is the gaffes , contradictions , hypocrisy and hubris of the Bushites , and the pomposity of the mainstream media .
He makes no secret of his liberal leanings , but his duty as a comedian , he insists , is first and foremost to be funny .
" People 's sense of humour typically goes as far as their ideology , " he says , " but I do n't particularly think of ourselves as ideological here .
I do n't mean in the sense that we 're equal opportunity offenders - we 're not .
I think we consider those with power and influence targets and those without it , not .
But we 're not a liberal organisation , we are still clearly selfish observers .
We do not have a dog in the race .
And that is to our discredit , but to do what we 're doing , it 's also natural and necessary . "
Stewart did not come from a particularly politicised family .
" When I was younger , I considered myself more of a socialist .
But I came from a very suburban family of middle - class Jews who joined the great migration from the city to the suburbs during the early 60s .
There 's nothing in there that 's particularly activist .
We did n't sit around the table and debate , we much more followed the I'm OK , You 're OK paradigm . "
His mother was a teacher , his father a physicist .
Born Jonathan Stewart Leibowitz , he started using his middle name as his surname in 1987 .
" I 'm not a self - hating Jew , " he once said .
" Actually , to borrow a line from Lenny Bruce , I just thought Leibowitz was too Hollywood . "
He started his career doing stand - up ( his first big gig was as the opening act for Sheena Easton in Las Vegas ) and still goes on the road from time to time .
But the tone of The Daily Show is less a gagfest than a repertoire of shrugs , smirks , rolling eyes , raised eyebrows and damning asides , expressing frustration and despair at the powers that be .
Relating Bush 's decision to have a day of prayer following Hurricane Katrina , Stewart frowned .
" OK , " he said , followed by a long pause and plenty of laughs , " but - and I do n't want to be crass here - is n't a hurricane an act of God ?
Should n't we have a day of shunning ? "
When Condoleezza Rice admitted to the Senate that she had seen a presidential daily briefing in August 2001 ... " I believe the title was ' Bin Laden Determined To Attack Inside The United States ' " ...
Stewart just stared at the camera for 20 seconds .
Then he covered his face in his hands , lifted his head up and moaned .
" You 're fucking kidding me , right ?
Please say , please say , you 're fucking kidding me . "
Stewart began on The Daily Show just before the 2000 election .
The debacle of the Florida recount and the supreme court intervention provided ideal material .
The country was shifting .
With the brief respite of national unity following the September 11 terrorist attack , political discourse plunged to its most rancorous for more than a generation .
Into this culture war came Stewart - a nightly reminder , principally for the urban and urbane American liberal , that their leaders , not they , were insane .
In an era in which , having lost the presidential election and both houses of Congress , liberals have little to laugh about , he offers release .
Asked to compare his work with Michael Moore's , Stewart says : " He 's an activist .
We travel in the same sorts of manipulations to some extent , but we are more passive editorialists .
He 's an active editorialist .
I would go so far as to say that I do n't necessarily agree with a lot of the stuff that he says .
But I admire the fact that he puts himself out there and tries to change things . "
Despite bleeped - out expletives and single entendres about blow jobs and soft drugs ( " Dude , I totally want to smoke a bong with you , " Stewart told a Christian fundamentalist who had been explaining the theory of intelligent design ) , Stewart secures high - level interviews .
Over the past few years his guests have included former Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry , Bill Clinton , former Republican presidential challenger Bob Dole , counter - terrorism chief Richard Clarke and Bush adviser Karen Hughes - vice - presidential hopeful John Edwards announced his candidacy on the show .
Stewart has become a player , appearing on the covers of Newsweek , Rolling Stone and , most recently , Wired .
It 's just gone three o'clock and on the street outside The Daily Show 's offices on the west side of Manhattan , the day 's audience has started a two - hour queue to see the show .
They are young , mostly white and an even mix of men and women .
One man wears a T - shirt stating : " I bet God 's cock is huge . "
" It 's a short cut to the real news , " says another audience member , Shaun Field , 27 , explaining why he likes Stewart .
This is Stewart 's base .
Two - thirds of The Daily Show 's audience is aged 18 - 49 .
Fox News host Bill O'Reilly has described them as stoned " slackers " , but on election night the show attracted almost as many viewers in the 18 - 34 category as Fox .
Stewart knows his fans are out there , but ...
" One of the things we try not to do is to fall in love with the audience . "
He understands , to an extent , why he is popular - " If you feel like your philosophy is not being served by either the government or the media , then you will find comfort in a point of view that sounds or feels familiar " - but to pander to it would be counterproductive , he says .
The criteria are : " Is that funny ?
Is that smart ?
Is that good ?
Not will those people be mad at us , will they like it . "
In short , Stewart is self - conscious about being unselfconscious .
" The only skill I have is writing jokes , " he says .
" Like anything if you have an ability , ultimately you want to apply it to something you care about .
Otherwise , you 're just jerking off in your cage ... which also has its advantages . "
The show is produced by a team whose influences are The Simpsons , Late Night With David Letterman and The Onion ( a spoof magazine that blends the best of Viz and Private Eye ) , which is where both Ben Karlin and head writer David Javerbaum worked .
The show begins with Stewart summing up the top story of the day .
Then comes a spoof news segment in which a " reporter " stands against a fake , newsworthy landscape - a rubble - strewn street in Iraq , say - and pretends to be sending in a dispatch , usually as much a joke on journalists as it is on politicians .
Occasionally , they really do take to the road , carrying out Ali G - style interviews in which the reporter asks outrageous questions of people so bound up in their own agendas they are apparently unaware they are the object of ridicule .
From the vantage point of New York , it can look as if the " reporters " have gone in search of a backward foreign country to patronise and have pitched up in Middle America .
" You could run a Daily Show from Dayton , Tennessee , " says Stewart .
" People from Dayton could come to New York and cover the gay pride parade and they 'd also be covering a foreign country .
So much of what we do is deconstructionist and reductionist . "
Off - screen he sounds more like a funny academic than a brainy comedian .
After the " reports " there are more skits on regular themes such as " Mess O'Potamia " , the slugline for anything to do with Iraq , or " Evolution , schmevolution " , a recent week - long series on the debate over creationism .
Finally , Stewart has an interview with an author , politician , journalist or actor .
Regardless of whether it's a rightwing ideologue just days after the election or Kurt Vonnegut offering a stream of consciousness , Stewart 's tone is the same - polite and mildly mocking rather than abrasive .
He says he 's not comfortable being more than two minutes away from a joke .
That was the image most people had of him until October 15 last year , just a couple of weeks before the election , when Stewart appeared on CNN 's Crossfire .
This is a show that pits a Democrat commentator ( Paul Begala ) against a Republican ( Tucker Carlson ) ; they raise topical issues in rapid succession and bellow over each other in an attempt to score cheap points and earn applause from the studio audience .
Stewart was clearly invited on for some light relief , but instead started to berate the two hosts for their " partisan hackery " , substituting bluster for political discourse .
" Wait .
I thought you were going to be funny , " said Carlson .
" Come on .
Be funny . "
" No. No , " said Stewart .
" I 'm not going to be your monkey . "
Carlson went on to chide Stewart for putting lame questions to Kerry when he appeared on The Daily Show , insisting Crossfire would have given the Democrat a grilling .
Stewart responded : " If you want to compare your show to a comedy show , you 're more than welcome to ...
You 're on CNN .
The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls . "
Carlson concluded : " I do think you 're more fun on your show . "
Stewart shot back : " You know what 's interesting , though ?
You 're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show . "
In a highly scripted election , during which mainstream news rarely departed from the storyline set by the two main parties , the clash between Stewart and Carlson was electric .
Supposedly the election was a battle royal between Republicans and Democrats , and Crossfire was a symbol of it .
Stewart 's intervention - and the wide support he received - suggested there was an even deeper divide between political posturers and the public at large .
A few months later , CNN decided to take Crossfire off the air .
" Ultimately , people would respond a lot better to being treated like adults ... if politics was n't treated like marketing , " Stewart says .
This sounds like a great American fantasy .
Every few years
Hollywood produces a film , whether it is Warren Beatty 's Bulworth or Chris Rock 's Head Of State , in which a presidential candidate goes off - message , tells it like it is , and the voters respond warmly .
The last time we saw anyone try this was Howard Dean and he was dismissed for his lack of polish .
" But who said that ? " asks Stewart .
" The polishers .
So much of what these guys do is an attempt to consolidate power because they feel it slipping away .
They think Dean 's out there .
But George Galloway came here and completely blew away our congressmen .
We 're just not used to unvarnished rhetoric . "
If the parties and the media serve the country so badly , why do Americans put up with it ?
" Because for the majority of Americans life is pretty tolerable , " says Stewart .
" It 's very hard to organise reasonable people with moderate views .
Reasonable people with moderate views do n't usually light their torches and head out to town with pitchforks shouting , Be reasonable .
Shit has to get really bad before people stand up and take notice . "
And Stewart clearly regards himself as one of those reasonable moderates .
Indeed , for a man hailed as a liberal standard - bearer , he can sound rather complacent .
" In general , the more egregious flaws of our country have , over time , become less egregious , " he says .
" That 's not to say that we do n't have enormous problems of poverty and race , but they are no longer so clearcut as during the times of slavery , segregation or when women could n't vote .
In our big ticket items we 're down to gay people getting married .
That 's a lot of progress over the past few hundred years , considering where we came from . "
Two close elections may have given the impression of a divided America - a nation riven between blue and red states , the secular and religious , town and country - but Stewart believes the divisions have been exaggerated .
" For the amount of ultimate difference in the country , it is remarkably stable .
Only one civil war in 200 years ?
Boy , that 's something to be proud of . "
The big picture from outside America looks somewhat different , and Stewart recognises that .
" The thing that probably upsets the world more than anything is the sense of American exceptionalism , " he says .
" But it is important to keep perspective .
Whatever response to 9/11 that was ham - handed or arrogant or larger than may have been required by our government , it was in many respects , regarding our history , pretty restrained .
In the second world war , we interned our Japanese citizens on the west coast .
Right after the revolution they had the alien and sedition acts .
We dropped an atomic bomb on a country .
As much talk as there is about over - reaction in our history , this has been a mild form of that .
Iraq probably being an exception . "
The thing that surprises him about the election last year is not that the Democrats lost , but that they came so close to winning .
" Americans are loth to abandon the captain in a time of war .
It 's almost remarkable that Bush had to fight so hard to get re-elected , given the fact that the worst attack on American soil happened three years earlier ; 100,000 votes in Ohio and the Democrats would have won it .
They absolutely could have won it .
It is shocking . "
Stewart voted for Kerry , although he hardly seems enamoured of the Democratic party .
" I do n't really know what they want .
The Democratic party appears to be the party of reaction .
The difference between the Democrats and the Republicans is the difference between driving towards a brick wall and trying to avoid hitting a deer .
The Democrats appear to try to avoid hitting things that might dart out in front of them .
Whereas the Republicans clearly have plotted a road and if there 's something in their way , they 're just going to blow it up .
Sometimes literally . "
The key dividing line in America , he says , referring to the New Orleans flood , is poverty .
" I have to say poor is poor .
And in this country that 's where people really get screwed .
If that had been in Appalachia [ a poor white area of West Virginia ] , it would still have been a real fuck - up because they 're the people that people think about last . "
So , as the host of The Daily Show , does he think about those people first ?

The cat is out of the bag , so here ’s the full disclosure edition of the current security vulnerability .
With Rails 1.1.0 through 1.1.5 ( minus the short - lived 1.1.3 ) , you can trigger the evaluation of Ruby code through the URL because of a bug in the routing code of Rails .
This means that you can essentially take down a Rails process by starting something like / script / profiler , as the code will run for a long time and that process will be hung while it happens .
Other URLs can even cause data loss .
We ’ve backported a fix to all the affected versions for those of you that ca n’t update .
You ’ll have to apply the diff for your version :
These patches ( and 1.1.6 ) will break applications using the 3rd party engines idea .
So if you ca n’t upgrade because of dependencies to those , you can also add the following URL blocking while engines are being updated .
Here ’s how to do it with mod_rewrite under Apache :
RewriteRule ^( app|components|config|db|doc|lib|log|public|script|test|tmp|vendor ) / - [ F ]
Here ’s how to do it under lighttpd :
url.rewrite-once = ( " ^/(app|components|config|db|doc|lib|log|public|script|test|tmp|vendor ) / " => " index.html " )
Unfortunately , the 1.1.5 update from yesterday only partly closed the hole ( getting rid of the worst data loss trigger ) .
After learning more about the extent of the problem , we ’ve now put together a 1.1.6 release that completely closes all elements of the hole ( using the same technique as the backports above ) .
So if you upgraded to 1.1.5 yesterday , you need to upgrade again .
The approach stays the same , but since the Rubyforge gem server can be very slow at distributing gem updates , you should grab this fix straight from the Rails server :
sudo gem install rails -- source http://gems.rubyonrails.org
--include - dependencies
If you ’re running of trunk ( also known as edge ) using revision 4394 or later , you ’re not affected by all this in any form .
We ’ll follow up with more information as it becomes available .
Needless to say , this is all the Rails core team is working on right now and we ’ve recruited a whole band of testers to help us play this out .
We ’ll make sure to evaluate all the feedback that ’s been coming in and develop some scar tissue a policy for dealing with security issues in the future .
Thanks for your continued understanding .
We ’ve also started #rails - security on Freenet for people with IRC available to get and share more information .
UPDATE : If you ’re floating on gems ( do n’t have vendor / rails ) , then make sure you update RAILS_GEM_VERSION in your config/environment.rb .
Otherwise you ’ll still be bound to that earlier version of Rails even as you install the new gems .
UPDATE 2 : Rails 1.1.6 is now available on the official gem server , so you no longer need to add the — source http://gems.rubyonrails.org parameter .

Why ?
How ?
Antipattern
It ’s so easy to mark a class with extended description of its name .
We end up with class Transaction Manager marked as Represents a Transaction Manager .
Would this be descriptive enough ?
No sense to include this in comments at all .
I can read a class name by my own .
I would be more happy to see Transaction Manager marked as Manages ( creates , disposes and provides ) transactions .
manages
Antipattern
Someone might want to describe here how other classes are going to communicate with our class .
I would move this information into corresponding class .
When ?
Should I write comments ?
What is good comment ?
Is it possible to write comment for a class in 5 minutes ?
I would discuss these questions .
I would be happy if , after reading , you will be thinking that good comments are an important thing to your project success .
I must admit that I hated to write comments .
I was finding them boring and unnecessary .
And the worse thing is that I was afraid that during my design some of my methods or classes might go away together with my time spent for writing my good comments .
So the first thing I would discuss is Here is the first reason for comments .
Comments can make your design clearer .
You could mark the class with its responsibilities using comments .
You can check then how much your class respects its responsibilities , and that it do n’t do something which is not its responsibility .
Moreover , you can check how much your class respects Single Responsibility Principle and make some decisions to improve the design .
But I think that primary reason which can force you to write comments is to make your code understandable for others .
The rule is simple .
If you will hide your code for forever - nobody is going to know if it is commented or not .
As soon as you are going to share your code with some other person - unless you are not writing it all together from the beginning - he or she will be happy to see your class comments .
Of course you could be happy to explain it to everyone personally .
But you want to avoid phone calls asking what your class does while you are on vacation .
Do you know any other reasons which make you to start writing comments ?
If yes - I will be happy to include them here .
Personally I find an important reason to have a good rest on vacation .
So the next question will be - What is good comment ?
Should we judge how good the comment is by its word count ?
Should we have each method commented ?
I would say we do n’t , or else our comments could end up time - consuming for us and being boring for our readers .
Personally I find very useful an old proven approach for class comments .
CRC cards was used for a long time ( since at least 1989 ) and hugely adopted with modern techniques like Agile Development ( see http://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html and http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/agileModelingXP.htm ) .
We can take two good things from there and supply our comments with : class responsibilities , and class names our class is planned to communicate with .
Note that OO design tells our class to respect Single Responsibility Principle .
Here is where your comment becomes an important design tool .
If you find it impossible to name your class ’s responsibility with a single combination of verb and noun – it is a good chance your class is taking too much on itself and should be split .
One trick here is - use ofhelps .
We should end up with class comments which are pretty short but descriptive enough .
And what about method comments ?
No clear recommendation for now .
I would recommend to name a method as much descriptive as possible .
It could make its comment unnecessary .
I would mention some exception situations however .
For example , I would describe what the method does if no item with given key available .
Will it return null ?
Will it throw an exception ?
Ok !
Now we know which kind of comments we are going to write .
Now the question isI dislike doing something which will be thrown away .
I dislike writing comments which will be thrown away .
During my design , I create new classes , play with them , throw them away and create new instead .
I would find a way to save my time and write a comment when I have a decent hope my class will remain within the system .
The point to start writing comments is ... when the code is ready to be presented for others .
This could be the time before commit to a main source repository , or insert your case here .
For this time , I have pretty stable class design , and good chance my comments will live long .
I am pretty sure with my class ’s responsibilities and what classes it will collaborate with .
I can spend as much as 2 minutes writing this information as a class comment .
Everybody ’s happy !
DEAR STRAIGHT PEOPLE ,
Why do you hate gay people so much ?
Gays are hated .
Prove me wrong .
Your top general just called us immoral .
Marine Gen. Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs , is in charge of an estimated 65,000 gay and lesbian troops , some fighting for our country in Iraq .
A right - wing political commentator , Ann Coulter , gets away with calling a straight presidential candidate a faggot .
Even Garrison Keillor , of all people , is making really tacky jokes about gay parents in his column .
This , I guess , does not qualify as hate except that it is so distasteful and dumb , often a first step on the way to hate .
Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama tried to duck the questions that Pace ’s bigotry raised , confirming what gay people know : that there is not one candidate running for public office anywhere who dares to come right out , unequivocally , and say decent , supportive things about us .
Gays should not vote for any of them .
There is not a candidate or major public figure who would not sell gays down the river .
We have seen this time after time , even from supposedly progressive politicians such as President Clinton with his “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy on gays in the military and his support of the hideous Defense of Marriage Act .
Of course , it ’s possible that being shunned by gays will make politicians more popular , but at least we will have our self - respect .
To vote for them is to collude with them in their utter disdain for us .
Do n’t any of you wonder why heterosexuals treat gays so brutally year after year after year , as your people take away our manhood , our womanhood , our personhood ?
Why , even as we die you do n’t leave us alone .
What we can leave our surviving lovers is taxed far more punitively than what you leave your ( legal ) surviving spouses .
Why do you do this ?
My lover will be unable to afford to live in the house we have made for each other over our lifetime together .
This does not happen to you .
Taxation without representation is what led to the Revolutionary War .
Gay people have paid all the taxes you have .
But you have equality , and we do n’t .
And there ’s no sign that this situation will change anytime soon .
President Bush will leave a legacy of hate for us that will take many decades to cleanse .
He has packed virtually every court and every civil service position in the land with people who do n’t like us .
So , even with the most tolerant of new presidents , gays will be unable to break free from this yoke of hate .
Courts rule against gays with hateful regularity .
And of course the Supreme Court is not going to give us our equality , and in the end , it is from the Supreme Court that such equality must come .
If all of this is not hate , I do not know what hate is .
Our feeble gay movement confines most of its demands to marriage .
But political candidates are not talking about — and we are not demanding that they talk about — equality .
My lover and I do n’t want to get married just yet , but we sure want to be equal .
You must know that gays get beaten up all the time , all over the world .
If someone beats you up because of who you are — your race or ethnic origin — that is considered a hate crime .
But in most states , gays are not included in hate crime measures , and Congress has refused to include us in a federal act .
Homosexuality is a punishable crime in a zillion countries , as is any activism on behalf of it .
Punishable means prison .
Punishable means death .
The U.S. government refused our requests that it protest after gay teenagers were hanged in Iran , but it protests many other foreign cruelties .
Who cares if a faggot dies ?
Parts of the Episcopal Church in the U.S. are joining with the Nigerian archbishop , who believes gays should be put in prison .
Episcopalians !
Whoever thought we ’d have to worry about Episcopalians ?
Well , whoever thought we ’d have to worry about Florida ?
A young gay man was just killed in Florida because of his sexual orientation .
I get reports of gays slain in our country every week .
Few of them make news .
Fewer are prosecuted .
Do you consider it acceptable that 20,000 Christian youths make an annual pilgrimage to San Francisco to pray for gay souls ?
This is not free speech .
This is another version of hate .
It is all one world of gay - hate .
It always was .
Gays do not realize that the more we become visible , the more we come out of the closet , the more we are hated .
Do n’t those of you straights who claim not to hate us have a responsibility to denounce the hate ?
Why is it socially acceptable to joke about “ girlie men ” or to discriminate against us legally with “ constitutional ” amendments banning gay marriage ?
Because we cannot marry , we can pass on only a fraction of our estates , we do not have equal parenting rights and we cannot live with a foreigner we love who does not have government permission to stay in this country .
These are the equal protections that the Bill of Rights proclaims for all ?
Why do you hate us so much that you will not permit us to legally love ?
I am almost 72 , and I have been hated all my life , and I do n’t see much change coming .
I think your hate is evil .
What do we do to you that is so awful ?
Why do you feel compelled to come after us with such frightful energy ?
Does this somehow make you feel safer and legitimate ?
What possible harm comes to you if we marry , or are taxed just like you , or are protected from assault by laws that say it is morally wrong to assault people out of hatred ?
The reasons always offered are religious ones , but certainly they are not based on the love all religions proclaim .
And even if your objections to gays are religious , why do you have to legislate them so hatefully ?
Make no mistake : Forbidding gay people to love or marry is based on hate , pure and simple .
You may say you do n’t hate us , but the people you vote for do , so what ’s the difference ?
Our own country ’s democratic process declares us to be unequal .
Which means , in a democracy , that our enemy is you .
You treat us like crumbs .
You hate us .
And sadly , we let you .

When Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld told reporters last December that he expected U.S. troops to remain in Iraq for another four years , he was merely confirming what any visitor to the country could have surmised .
The omnipresence of the giant defense contractor KBR ( formerly Kellogg , Brown & Root ) , the shipments of concrete and other construction materials , and the transformation of decrepit Iraqi military bases into fortified American enclaves — complete with Pizza Huts and DVD stores — are just the most obvious signs that the United States has been digging in for the long haul .
It ’s a far cry from administration assurances after the invasion that the troops could start withdrawing from Iraq as early as the fall of 2003 .
And it is hardly consistent with a prediction by Richard Perle , the former chairman of the Defense Policy Board , that the troops would be out of Iraq within months , or with Iraqi National Congress leader Ahmed Chalabi ’s guess that the U.S. occupation would last two years .
Take , for example , Camp Victory North , a sprawling base near Baghdad International Airport , which the U.S. military seized just before the ouster of Saddam Hussein in April 2003 .
Over the past year , KBR contractors have built a small American city where about 14,000 troops are living , many hunkered down inside sturdy , wooden , air - conditioned bungalows called SEA ( for Southeast Asia ) huts , replicas of those used by troops in Vietnam .
There ’s a Burger King , a gym , the country ’s biggest PX — and , of course , a separate compound for KBR workers , who handle both construction and logistical support .
Although Camp Victory North remains a work in progress today , when complete , the complex will be twice the size of Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo — currently one of the largest overseas posts built since the Vietnam War .
Such a heavy footprint seems counterproductive , given the growing antipathy felt by most Iraqis toward the U.S. military occupation .
Yet Camp Victory North appears to be a harbinger of America ’s future in Iraq .
Over the past year , the Pentagon has reportedly been building up to 14 “ enduring ” bases across the country — long - term encampments that could house as many as 100,000 troops indefinitely .
John Pike , a military analyst who runs the research group GlobalSecurity.org , has identified a dozen of these bases , including three large facilities in and around Baghdad : the Green Zone , Camp Victory North , and Camp al - Rasheed , the site of Iraq ’s former military airport .
Also listed are Camp Cook , just north of Baghdad , a former Republican Guard “ military city ” that has been converted into a giant U.S. camp ; Balad Airbase , north of Baghdad ; Camp Anaconda , a 15 - square - mile facility near Balad that housed 17,000 soldiers as of May 2004 and was being expanded for an additional 3,000 ; and Camp Marez , next to Mosul Airport , where , in December , a suicide bomber blew himself up in the base ’s dining tent , killing 13 U.S. troops and four KBR contractors eating lunch alongside the soldiers .
At these bases , KBR , a Halliburton subsidiary that works in cooperation with the Army Corps of Engineers , has been extending runways , improving security perimeters , and installing a variety of structures ranging from rigid - wall huts to aircraft hangars .
Although the Pentagon considers most of the construction to be “ temporary ” — designed to last up to three years — similar facilities have remained in place for much longer at other “ enduring ” American bases , including Kosovo ’s Camp Bondsteel , which opened in 1999 , and Eagle Base in Tuzla , Bosnia , in place since the mid-1990s .
How long is “ enduring ” ?
The administration insists that troops will remain in Iraq as long as it takes to install a functioning , democratic government , quell the insurgency , and build an efficient Iraqi fighting force .
Given the elusiveness of those goals , many military experts believe that Rumsfeld ’s hope that the troops might be out by 2008 is wildly optimistic .
Retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni , the top U.S. commander in the Middle East from 1997 to 2000 , recently predicted that American involvement in Iraq would last at least 10 more years .
Retired Army Lt. General Jay Garner , the former interim administrator of reconstruction efforts in Iraq , told reporters in February 2004 that a U.S. military presence in Iraq should last “ the next few decades . ”
Even that , some analysts warn , could be an underestimate .
“ Half a century ago if anyone tried to convince you that we ’d still have troops in Korea and Japan , you ’d think they were crazy , ” says Pike , the military analyst .
Suspicions also run deep both inside Pentagon circles and among analysts that the Department of Defense is pouring billions of dollars into the facilities in pursuit of a different agenda entirely : to turn Iraq into a permanent base of operations in the Middle East .
If true , this scheme is fraught with danger .
The presence of U.S. troops is a powerful recruitment tool for the Iraqi insurgency — as well as a source of bitter anti-American feeling throughout the Middle East .
Politically , the occupation is becoming increasingly untenable : Practically every significant Iraqi political figure — from Shiite spiritual leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani to Iraqi president Ghazi al - Yawar , an influential Sunni Muslim — opposes the occupation and wants the troops out , and any leader who hopes to maintain credibility will have to make that a priority .
“ The presence of bases there is going to be a source of instability and anger for the Iraqi people , whether they are currently for the insurgency or not , ” says Jessica Matthews , the head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington , D.C. “ It will convince people across the Arab world that we went there to install an American regime in the Middle East . ”
The other great danger of “ enduring ” bases , say critics , is that they tend to operate according to a well - tested axiom :
The deeper you dig in , the harder it is to dig out .
That ’s hardly reassuring to the 11,400 U.S. soldiers who ’ve had their enlistments extended through the stop - loss clause in their contracts , and to others who ’ve been forced to serve multiple tours in the combat zone .
One indication of an open - ended U.S. occupation is the amount of money that has already been spent on bases in Iraq .
KBR ’s first big building contract there , in June 2003 , was a $ 200 million project to build and maintain “ temporary housing units ” for U.S. troops .
Since then , according to military documents , it has received another $ 8.5 billion for work associated with Operation Iraqi Freedom .
By far the largest sum — at least $ 4.5 billion — has gone to construction and maintenance of U.S. bases .
By comparison , from 1999 to this spring , the U.S. government paid $ 1.9 billion to KBR for similar work in the Balkans .
Does the Department of Defense have a bigger agenda in Iraq ?
Brig .
General Robert Pollman , chief engineer of base construction in Iraq , caused a stir — and forced his superiors to engage in damage control — when he told the Chicago Tribune last spring that the bases could be a “ swap ” for bases in Saudi Arabia .
The United States has been closing bases and drawing down its forces in the kingdom in response to the growing unpopularity of the American presence there and repeated terror attacks .
In mid-2003 , roughly 4,500 U.S. troops reportedly redeployed from Saudi Arabia to Qatar , leaving only about 500 in the kingdom .
Karen Kwiatkowski , a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who served in the office of the Secretary of Defense until spring 2003 , and has since become an outspoken critic of the war , says that the neoconservative architects of the Iraq invasion definitely foresaw a permanent , large - scale presence .
Kwiatkowski says that Pentagon planners view the bases as vital both for protecting Israel and as launchpads for operations in Syria and Iran .
The Pentagon , she says , went into the war assuming that once Saddam was toppled a so - called Status of Forces Agreement , like those the U.S. government signed with Japan and South Korea , could be quickly reached with Iraq .
The growth of the insurgency and the vocal opposition to a prolonged U.S. occupation among Iraqi leaders have n’t changed the plan , Kwiatkowski insists : “ We ’re pouring concrete .
We ’re building little fiefdoms with security , moats , and walls … .
Eighty percent of Iraqis will grouse , but they have no political power , ” she says .
“ We ’ll stay whether they want us to or not . ”
Other American officials heartily dispute that assertion .
One U.S. official who served alongside L. Paul Bremer in the Coalition Provisional Authority insists that base construction has been an ad hoc effort , reflecting the changing facts on the ground , not long - term strategy .
“ At no time did I ever overhear any meaningful discussion about ‘ permanent bases , ' ” he says .
“ I remember asking Bremer about it from time to time , and he would say , ‘ That ’s ludicrous . ’
Maybe there are some military guys brainstorming .
But it just is n’t on the agenda . ”
The official concedes that permanent basing in Iraq “ makes sense ” from a strictly strategic perspective , given the steady reduction of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and the potential volatility of U.S. relations with other Gulf allies , like Qatar , Kuwait , Oman , and Bahrain , which currently have , all together , an estimated 30,000 U.S. troops stationed within their borders .
But he agrees the consequences of such a move would be disastrous : Permanent bases “ would be under siege , a temptation for terrorists , a symbol of U.S. occupation .
It would totally undermine our political strategy in Iraq . ” Adds Senator Jack Reed ( D - R.I. ) , who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee , “ The next Iraqi leadership has to show they are truly sovereign and independent .
And that ’s hard to do if they lease significant parts of Iraq to the United States .
We ’ve already seen the ability of these insurgents to target our facilities and attack them .
I ’d be very reluctant to say this is a good place to base our troops . ”
That ’s not to say that the Pentagon is n’t keen to maintain at least some American presence on the ground .
According to one intelligence source in Baghdad , maintaining a quick reaction force in Iraq would be essential to prevent , for example , a coup against a friendly Iraqi government .
And the Pentagon sees Iraq as possibly playing a role in its global realignment of U.S. forces — a shift away from the static , Cold War basing arrangements in Europe to smaller , more flexible deployments in volatile regions like the Middle East .
One model they point to is Camp Lemonier , which was built in the Horn of Africa country Djibouti in 2002 and houses about 1,300 troops as well as facilities for fighter planes .
A high - ranking military officer in the Middle East says that the Pentagon envisions a small number of bases in Iraq that “ in no way approximates what we have there now . ”
He insists that “ we are not planning to occupy the country .
We ’re talking about a small , unobtrusive presence — it could simply be facilities that give you the capability to come in and out . ”
That version of “ Occupation Lite ” may eventually come to pass .
For the foreseeable future , however , it is difficult to imagine anything other than an enduring status quo : a heavy troop presence , big bases spread across the country , and a steadily rising body count .
The mainstay of the oil - and gas industry workforce will retire in the coming ten years .
While there is a fair amount of thinking about how to fix this huge problem in the oil - and gas industry , this factor is being ignored in the energy scenarios of the International Energy Agency and Energy Information Administration .
This posts looks at the numbers and potential effect on oil production of the retirement in the oil - industry .
The retirement of the workforce in the industry is normally referred to as “ the big crew change ” .
People in this sector normally retire at the age of 55 .
Since the average age of an employee working at a major oil company or service company is 46 to 49 years old , there will be a huge change in personnel in the coming ten years , hence the .
This age distribution is a result of the oil crises in ‘ 70s and ‘ 80s as shown in chart 1 & 2 below .
The rising oil price led to a significant increase in the inflow of petroleum geology students which waned as prices decreased .
Chart 1 - Petroleum Degrees Granted in the USA and Oil Price from 1972 to 2006
Chart 2 - Age distribution of Society of Petroleum Engineers ( SPE ) members from 1997 to 2004 .
The SPE is an international network of Petroleum Engineers with more then 60,000 members .
The problem has been aggravated due to the loss of in - house training programs in many large oil companies and the loss of research centres in many major oil companies .
This was a response to the lower oil prices which caused overall contraction in the industry after the oil crises .
The recent fall in oil prices in 1998 / 1999 which bottomed at 12 dollars per barrel also prompted many companies to reduce or abandon drilling .
Leading to the early retirement of thousands of thousands of workers at the end of the 20th century .
There are not enough new students to replenished the senior experts .
This takes place in an age were incrementally more people are needed to supply an increasing number of oil to the world economy .
The problem is accelerated because drilling is taking place in far more complex environments then before .
The “ easy oil is gone ” as Shell and Chevron now commonly state in their PR campaigns .
To learn the necessary competences to oversee project development in the industry one needs around 10 years of training in the various disciplines .
According to management consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton :
That the issue is not singled out to just North America has been quantified in a study by Schlumberger Business Consulting : “ Surviving the skills shortage ” .
This study published in 2006 has surveyed the worldwide workforce demand and supply in petrotechnical expertise ( geologists , geophysicists and reservoir engineers ) until 2016 .
They looked at 115 Universities which covers more than 70 % of all relevant universities .
The study found that annual deficits resulting from the balance between supply & demand of petrotechnical graduates over the coming decade exist in :
North America – annual shortage of 420 ;
The Middle - East – annual shortage of 350 ;
Russia – annual shortage of 160 .
The study found that there is a surplus of petrotechnical personnel in :
China - annual excess of 410 ;
Indonesia - annual excess of 900 ;
India - annual excess of 100 ;
Venezuela – annual excess of 500 ;
Mexico – annual excess of 100 .
The figures from Schlumberger are an average over the next ten years .
So on a net basis there is no shortage of workforce in itself , but on a regional basis in North America , the North Sea , The Middle East and Russia there is .
Whether there will be sufficient transfer of personnel remains to be seen in the light of cultural barriers .
The bigger problem that comes to light from this study is the capability shortage .
The most experienced geologists , geophysicist and petroleum engineers will retire .
One study from the Society of Petroleum Engineers estimated that the cumulative experience loss will amount to 231,000 years .
Schlumberger summarises this as :
“ There are insufficient personnel or ‘ mid - carrers ’ between 30 and 45 with the experience to make autonomous decisions on critical projects across the key areas of our business : exploration , development and production .
This fact slows the potential for a safe increase in production considerably ”
" Nearly half of our workforce [ Saudi Aramco ] is less than 30 years of age .
Furthermore , surveys suggest that in the next few years more than 60 per cent of our engineers will have less than 10 years of experience . ”
The problem was recently addressed at the 15th Middle East Oil and Gas Show in Bahrain .
Senior Vice President of Exploration and Production .
Abd Allah Al - Saif spoke about the capability shortage in Saudi - Arabia telling the audience that :
These problems cannot be solved on short notice and will have a serious effect on oil production .
Companies look at partial solutions to the problem through drilling automation and knowledge transfer .
Recently Schlumberger consulting and businesses wrote a report called : which talks about remote automated drilling from a distance , .
Other consultants write about eLearing which leads to fast knowledge transfer :
Such problems may help but will hardly ameliorate the lack of years of experience .
The study from Booz Allen Hamilton describes the issue and the partial solutions as follows :
“ Until now , companies have been able to work around the growing talent gap with increasing automation , process efficiencies and by turning to universities and outside service companies for incremental operating and project delivery capacity .
But these adjustments alone are increasingly inadequate to make up for the growing shortage of skills and knowledge as activity levels rise and senior employees leave the industry .
In many companies the 2007 planning cycle will likely show growing staffing and skills gaps opening up over the next 5 years . ”
In essence , fewer oil fields can be developed because of this problem .
Projects delays that are already quite common , as shown in chart 3 below , will become more widespread .
Chart 3 - Project delays as outlined in the February medium term oil outlook update of the International Energy Agency
The bad news is that this will lead to an earlier peak and subsequent sharper decline in the short term as less projects are developed .
The good news is that more projects are left to develop , leading to a slower decline on the long term .
1 Me : {writing equations on a whiteboard , in front of a group of people} Divergence of the electric field is charge density on epsilon - subscript - zero .
Divergence of magnetic field is , however , zero , meaning there are no magnetic monopoles .
2 Me : Curl of the electric field is minus the rate of change of magnetic field , while curl of the magnetic field is mu-subscript - zero times current density ...
3 Me : ... plus the all - important displacement current term , which gives rise to the propagation of light !
So ... what do you think of that as an idea for a comic ?
4 Audience member :
It 's a bit formulaic .
Maxwell 's equations are a set of four equations that describe the relations between electricity and magnetism .
Written more neatly , they look like this :
To understand the mathematical notation here , you need to know vector calculus .
I believe , however , that anyone can understand Maxwell 's equations , and why they are so important and amazing , if they 're explained clearly enough .
Ready ?
James Clerk Maxwell was a Scottish physicist who lived in the mid-19th century .
He became interested in the then - fairly - new sciences of electricity and magnetism , and the intriguing hints that the two were somehow related to one another - hints that arose through the work of earlier scientists such as Hans Christian Ørsted , Michael Faraday and André - Marie Ampère .
Ørsted had noticed in 1820 that the magnetic needle of a compass jumped away from pointing towards north when a nearby electric circuit supplied by a battery was switched on or off .
This observation came as a complete surprise ; up until then nobody had suspected that electricity had anything to do with magnetism .
Ampère soon heard of Ørsted 's discovery , and within a week had formulated a mathematical theory to describe it .
He posited that an electric current could generate a magnetic field , and that turning the current on or off meant that the magnetic field changed ( from not being there to being there , or vice versa ) .
This change in the magnetic field affected the compass needle .
Faraday , meanwhile , worked on the opposite idea : that a changing magnetic field might cause an electric current to flow in a wire .
He proved his theory and used it to invent the electric dynamo , an electricity generator essentially similar to the ones used today in electrical power stations .
See , this stuff is important , and we have n't even reached Maxwell yet !
Maxwell formalised and extended the work of Ampère and Faraday , combining their discoveries into an interlinked set of equations that described fully every aspect of electricity and magnetism as they were then understood .
Maxwell 's equations still form the basis of electromagnetic theory as learnt by generations of physics students , and underpin everything we know about electromagnetism and do with it .
Equation One
The first equation says , in words , " the divergence of the electric field equals charge density divided by ε o . "
Okay , so what does that mean ?
The ε o ( that 's the Greek letter epsilon and a tiny zero subscript ) is just a number ; we 'll get to that in a minute .
Electric field is , in broad terms , a measure of how much electrical influence there is somewhere .
If you 've ever been to a science museum and stuck your hand on one of those electrostatic generators which make your hair stand on end , you know what an electric field feels like .
( I 'm deliberately simplifying and not using precise scientific definitions here , so people who understand formal electromagnetic theory , cut me some slack in my descriptions , okay ?
Thanks . )
Divergence is a mathematical measure of how much stuff comes from somewhere .
For example : when you turn on a tap , water comes out .
Mathematically , the divergence of water at the tap opening is a positive number .
The divergence of water at the plughole in the sink where it vanishes is a negative number .
Furthermore , as long as you 're not taking water out of the system by filling a glass or something , the divergence of the whole shebang ( tap plus plughole ) adds up to zero , which means that you 're removing exactly as much water with the plughole as you 're adding from the tap .
So , the divergence ( that 's the triangle and the dot in the equation ) of the electric field ( the letter E ) is how much electric field is coming from somewhere .
This is equal to the electric charge density ( the Greek symbol ρ , " rho " ) at the same place , divided by that ε o number .
Okay , now we know what the equation says , but what does it actually mean ?
The amount of electric field coming from a region of space is equal to the total electric charge in that region of space , ( divided by a number ) .
Electric charge is a property of subatomic particles , such as electrons and protons .
Electrons have a negative charge , while protons have a positive charge .
If a region of space has more protons than electrons , the total charge is positive , and the electric field coming from that region is positive .
Protons are like taps for electric field .
Electrons , on the other hand , are like sink plugholes for electric field .
If a region of space has more electrons than protons , the total charge is negative , and the electric field coming from the region is negative - in other words the electric field goes into that region rather than " coming out " of it .
* Science is full of clever analogies .
The most fun ones are where you compare something ( say electric field ) to something else ( say , a flow of water ) , except for the fact that some major property of the something else ( that the water moves ) simply is n't there .
Another example : Using a cellular phone is like speaking through a string so someone far away can hear you , but without the string .
**
Yes , volts per metre .
If you take two wires , one grounded and the other at 100 volts , and stick them a metre apart , you are generating an electric field of 100 volts per metre between them .
You can indeed think of the electric field as a flow of water , except that *.
However , if you stick an electric charge , say a proton , into an electric field , it will be carried along by the field , away from the tap and towards the plughole - i.e. away from areas of positive charge and towards regions of negative charge .
An electron , being a negative charge , is carried in the opposite direction , away from the plughole ( negative charge ) and towards the tap ( positive charge ) .
This explains something you may have learnt in high school science classes : why things with the same electric charge are repelled from each other , while things of opposite electric charge are attracted to one another .
Pretty cool , huh ?
Now , what about that dangling ε o ?
This number is called the permittivity of free space .
It is a constant , but its value depends on what units you use to describe electric charge and electric field .
( If that seems odd , think of a car driving at a constant speed .
The speed is constant , but it can be 50 miles per hour , or 80 kilometres per hour , depending on what units you use to measure it . )
Physicists usually measure electric charge in units called coulombs , and electric field in units called volts per metre **.
Anyway , in those units , ε o turns out to be approximately 0.0000000000088541878176 .
Remember that number .
Equation Two
Maxwell 's second equation is a doddle now .
The only new thing you need to know is that the letter B represents the magnetic field .
Why B and not M ?
Heck if I know , but that 's what it is .
Anyway , knowing that , you can now read this equation yourself .
The triangle and dot says " divergence " like in equation one .
So the equation reads : " the divergence of the magnetic field is zero " .
Easy !
Ah , I hear you ask , but what does that actually mean ?
It means that for magnetic fields , there are no things that act as taps or plugholes .
Magnetic field does n't come from anywhere or go away anywhere .
But it certainly exists .
How is this possible ?
Magnetic fields " flow " from magnetic north poles to magnetic south poles ( in the way that electric fields " flow " from protons to electrons - nothing actually moves . )
But magnets always come with both a north pole and a south pole .
If you cut a bar magnet in half , you do n't get just a north pole and a separate south pole , you create two smaller magnets , each one with a north and south pole .
Magnetic fields do n't come from north poles and go away at south poles .
What happens is the magnetic field comes out of the magnet at the north pole , flows through space to the south pole , goes back into the magnet , and flows through the inside of the magnet back to the north pole , where it comes back out again .
Magnetic fields go around in loops , never beginning , never ending .
This is why if you cut a magnet in half you do n't end up with single separate north and south poles .
The half containing the original north pole still has a north pole at the same spot , where the magnetic field comes out , but the magnetic field has to go back into the magnet at the other end , and where the magnetic field goes into the magnet is a south pole !
In other words , single magnetic poles - or magnetic monopoles - do not exist .
A magnetic monopole would be the magnetic equivalent of an electron or proton - a particle where magnetic fields emerge , or vanish from space .
Now , there 's actually no strong theoretical reason why magnetic monopoles should n't exist .
They just do n't seem to .
We 've never seen one , despite many scientists looking for a long time .
If they do turn out to exist , it 's no disaster .
All we need to do is add a " magnetic charge density " to Maxwell 's second equation , in place of the zero , analogous to the electric charge density of equation one .
Magnetic monopoles are thus good candidates for " exotic particles " in hard science fiction stories .
You could probably do some cool things with them , if you could just find one .
Equation Three
On to equation three , which states that " curl of the electric field is minus the rate of change of the magnetic field " .
On the left side , E is our old friend the electric field .
The triangle and cross represent the mathematical operation known as " curl " , which is pretty much what is sounds like .
The curl of the electric field is a measure of how " curly " it is , how much it twirls around in circles .
In terms of our water flowing analogy , if you look at a river , most of the water has no curl , as it's flowing straight along the riverbed .
In some spots , however , the water swirls around in little eddies and whirlpools .
At these spots , the curl of the water flow is non-zero .
You can measure the curl of flowing water by sticking a tiny paddlewheel in it .
If it spins around , the curl is non-zero ; if it does n't , the curl is zero .
The curl of the electric field is equal to ... minus the rate of change of magnetic field .
( The ∂ symbols and the t on the bottom are the mathematical symbols meaning " rate of change " . )
Rate of change is exactly what it sounds like : how fast the magnetic field is changing .
If the magnetic field is n't changing , then the rate of change is zero , and the electric field is non-curly .
If the magnetic field is changing , then the electric field goes curly .
If the magnetic field is getting weaker , the rate of change is negative , and the electric field curliness is positive .
If the magnetic field is getting stronger , the rate of change is positive , and the electric field curliness is negative - this just means that it rotates in the opposite direction .
How does a magnetic field get stronger or weaker ?
Well , we 're talking about the magnetic field at some point in space .
If the magnetic field there is zero , and we bring a magnet close , the magnetic field gets stronger .
If we take it away , it gets weaker .
Basically , if we wiggle magnets around , we generate changing magnetic fields .
Changing magnetic fields generate curliness in the electric field .
But what does a curly electric field mean ?
Curliness in the electric field pushes electric charges around in circles .
Pause there for a second .
Electric charges going around in circles is an electric current .
Join the dots ...
Wiggling .
Magnets .
Around .
Generates .
Electric .
Currents .
This is the basis of Faraday 's breakthrough invention : the electric generator .
He realised that if you got some wires , and wiggled some magnets around near them , you would generate electricity .
If you get something , say a steam engine , or a water wheel , to wiggle the magnets for you , you have a modern day coal - fired or hydroelectric power station .
Without James Clerk Maxwell , his predecessors , and his equations , our lives would be very , very different .
I hope you 're starting to understand just how important these equations are ( if you did n't already know ) .
And we still have one equation to go .
Equation Four
By now you should be able to read almost all of equation four by yourself .
" The curl of the magnetic field equals μ o times the letter J , plus μ o times ε o times the rate of change of electric field . "
Correct !
The new term J refers to current density , which I 'll explain in a minute .
This equation is a bit of a mouthful , so let 's take it one bit at a time .
In fact , let 's start with the curl of the magnetic field .
How curly is a magnetic field ?
Well , we 've already seen that magnetic field always goes around in loops , from north pole , to south pole , and then back to north pole inside the magnet .
Yes , that means it 's always curly .
The stronger the magnetic field , the tighter the loops are - and the more curly it is .
In fact , the curliness of a magnetic field is basically a measure of how strong it is .
So the curliness ( or strength ) of a magnetic field is equal to μ o times current density ( plus the other bit , which we 'll get to in a moment ) .
Current density is how much electric current is present somewhere .
What this part of the equation says is that if you have an electric current , there is always a magnetic field curling around it .
*** What happens when you switch an appliance on ?
You suddenly go from no electric current to some electric current .
That means before there was no magnetic field , and suddenly you are generating a magnetic field .
The magnetic field is getting stronger .
Remember equation three ?
A changing magnetic field generates an electric current ...
This is the source of potential interference between your electrical appliances .
This is why operating your blender makes your TV go fuzzy .
This is why your computer cables are shielded , to prevent all the changing magnetic fields in your house from futzing with your precious data .
Imagine a wire carrying electric current .
Wrap your fist around the wire , curling your fingers around it .
Your fingers are curling in the same way as magnetic field is curling in circles around the wire .
This is how electromagnets work .
They have lots of wires , and when electric current passes through them , they generate a magnetic field .
All the active wires in your house are generating magnetic fields too , though relatively weak ones .***
Again , like ε o , the μ o ( Greek letter mu and a subscript zero ) term is just a constant number that makes the units of measurement come out right .
It 's called the permeability of free space .
When the magnetic field is measured in teslas and current density in amperes per square metre , μ o equals about 0.000001256637061 .
Again , remember that number .
Notice that this equation is to magnetic field what equation one is to electric field .
Equation one says that the amount of electric field depends on the amount of electric charge .
Equation four says that the amount of magnetic field depends on the amount of electric current .
Curiouser and curiouser ...
Now , what about that last extra term : " μ o times ε o times the rate of change of electric field " ?
By now , this should n't be too hard to understand .
If there 's an electric field that gets stronger or weaker , it generates magnetic field .
That was easy !
That last bit was Maxwell 's major achievement , his crowning glory , his enduring and profound addition to our understanding of the universe .
What it says is that to generate a magnetic field , you do n't even need to have any electric current at all .
All you need is a changing electric field .
I hope you 'll excuse me if I guide you by the hand through the implications of this .
If you have a changing electric field , you will generate a magnetic field .
Imagine you have an electric field that oscillates , wobbling back and forth from positive to negative .
That will generate a magnetic field .
What 's more , because the electric field 's rate of change has to change in order to allow it to wobble back and forth , the magnetic field will not be constant , it will change over time .
But remember what equation three told us : if you have a changing magnetic field , you generate an electric field .
The wobbling magnetic field will generate a wobbling electric field .
That wobbling electric field generates a wobbling magnetic field .
That wobbling magnetic field generates a wobbling electric field ...
You can do some mathematics with equations three and four if you assume the current density J is zero ( i.e. there are no electric currents ) .
I wo n't go into the algebra , but they turn into the following :
As you can see , these are completely identical , except that one refers only to electric field , while the other refers only to magnetic field .
In essence , what these two equations say is that an electric field that changes in time ( on the right ) generates an electric field that changes in space ( on the left ) in a precisely determined way , and likewise for magnetic field .
In fact , these equations describe the motion of ripples of electric and magnetic field , which travel through space like waves .
If you know much about differential equations , you can solve these equations to work out the speed at which these waves travel .
The speed works out to depend on those numbers ε o and μ o .
The speed is :
Imagine you are James Clerk Maxwell , in 1865 , formulating your theory of electricity and magnetism , and writing down your four equations for the first time in history .
You write down the terms of these equations based on your experiments with electric batteries , bits of wire , and magnets .
You realise you need to define some constants ( ε o and μ o ) to make the numbers come out right .
You can measure the values of those constants using your batteries and wires and magnets , and you do so .
The numbers do n't make any sense to you at the time - they 're just some sort of constants that nature seems to use .
They could be any values at all , as far as you know or care .
Anyway , you measure the numbers and you write them down .
You notice that if you apply some algebra to your new equations , you can generate an equation that only refers to the electric field , and an almost identical equation that refers to the magnetic field .
You solve them and realise that these equations describe the motions of waves of electric and magnetic fields .
You do the algebra to calculate the speed of the waves and realise it depends on those values you measured for ε o and μ o .
So you do the arithmetic .
You take the values you measured for ε o and μ o , multiply them together , take the square root , and then take the reciprocal .
The answer is a speed , so it has units of speed , in this case metres per second .
And the answer is very close to 300,000,000 metres per second .
Converted into miles , that 's a tad over 186,000 miles per second .
Being James Clerk Maxwell , and a brilliant physicist , you immediately recognise what this number is .
The speed of light .
Where the heck did that come from ??
You , James Clerk Maxwell , know in 1865 from the work of Isaac Newton and others that light has certain properties : that white light is composed of multiple colours of light mixed together ; that transparent materials such as glass bends rays of light and can be used to focus them into images , such as in telescopes ; and that light diffracts through small holes and around sharp edges .
This diffraction property can only be explained by supposing that light is made of some sort of waves .
But nobody in the world knows what sort of waves they are .
Nobody knows what light actually is .
You stop .
Nobody in the world - except you - knows what light actually is .
When you were writing down your equations , you were thinking about electricity and magnetism .
Light was the farthest thing from your mind .
You had not the slightest clue ( and nor did anyone else ) that light was related to electricity or magnetism .
But there it is , falling out of your equations .
You realise that you are the first person in all of history to know what light is made of .
Can you imagine that feeling ?
Maxwell 's equations gave humanity , finally , an understanding of what light actually is .
His discovery was stunning and revolutionary .
Light is electric and magnetic fields , wriggling through space together .
From this breakthrough have come countless other discoveries about the nature of light , as well as its sibling electromagnetic waves : radio , microwaves , infrared and ultraviolet , x-rays , and gamma rays .
All these forms of radiation are made of electric and magnetic fields , moving through space at the speed of light , exactly as described by Maxwell 's equations .
We now know that radio waves , for example , can be generated by switching an electric current on and off at high speed .
The electrons in the wires wiggle back and forth , creating wiggling electric fields , which create magnetic fields , and so on - the overall effect being radio waves .
And radio waves in turn wiggle the electrons in your radio or TV antenna , creating electric currents that various electric circuits turn back into sound and pictures .
I could go on with example after example .
Vast quantities of the technology we use every day makes intimate use of our knowledge of electromagnetism and its interaction with light .
Civilisation as we know it would simply not exist without James Clerk Maxwell and his four equations .
I hope I 've managed to give you some insight into how wonderful they truly are .
Well , there 's not much more I can really add to this in the reruns .
Something I can say is that this has been one of the most popular comic annotations that I have written .
It 's linked from around 200 different sites on the web , and has generated more complimentary email than almost any other strip I 've done .
( I do n't keep an exact count of how many emails I receive for each strip , so it 's possible there are one or two other more popular ones .
But this one is certainly in the top few . )
Which is very pleasing !
Sometimes it 's difficult for me to know whether people like my stuff more for the comic gags and story , or for the occasional informative annotations .
I do n't think there 's any doubt with this one .
In all the correspondence I 've received about it , I do n't think anyone has complimented the joke in the comic . :-)
ADDITIONAL NOTE : A reader has pointed out a very specific inaccuracy in my descriptions of electric and magnetic fields above .
As I stated , my wording was a little bit simplified and imprecise , but I think it 's worth mentioning this specific inaccuracy just to set the record straight .
When I talked about " electric fields " and " magnetic fields " , my language sometimes ( but not always ) implied that these were separate , localised things , and that there could be multiple electric fields or magnetic fields .
More accurately , there really is only one electric field , and one magnetic field - each one filling the entirety of the universe .
The electric field is really just the sum total of the electric field strength and direction measured at every point in space ( and similarly for the magnetic field ) .
When I talk about a wiggling magnet " generating an electric field " , what I really mean is that a wiggling magnet causes the strength of the electric field nearby to change .
And for the propagation of light , when I say " Light is electric and magnetic fields , wriggling through space together " , what I really mean is " Light is disturbances in the electric field and the magnetic field , wriggling through space together " .
If you take this into consideration when reading the above explanations of Maxwell 's equations , you 'll have a slightly more accurate picture of how electromagnetism works .
With 12 million Americans tuning in daily , controversial syndicated radio - show host Laura Schlessinger — known to all as “ Dr. Laura ” — is arguably the best - known Orthodox Jew in the United States .
Rather , she was .
In a shocking if little - noticed revelation , Schlessinger — who very publicly converted to Judaism five years ago — opened “ The Dr. Laura Schlessinger Program ” on August 5 with the confession that she will no longer practice Judaism .
Although Schlessinger said she still “ considers ” herself Jewish , “ My identifying with this entity and my fulfilling the rituals , etc. , of the entity — that has ended . ”
And with that , Orthodox Judaism lost its loudest mouthpiece and its most prominent “ rabbi , ” as it were , with the largest American pulpit — with the exception of , perhaps , presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman .
Syndicated nationally since 1994 , Schlessinger has won over listeners with her hard - edged advice and razor - sharp tongue .
Yet her brash style , not to mention her espousal of a strict “ moral health ” code — including controversial condemnations of homosexuality as “ a biological error ” — put her at odds with wide swaths of the Jewish community .
Many found her moralist , black - and - white , you ’re - with - me - or - against - me stance to be more representative of Evangelical Christians than of Jews , who were often among her most outspoken critics .
Nonetheless , even Schlessinger ’s detractors were shocked by the news .
“ I ca n’t tell you how significant this is , ” said fellow Jewish media star and “ Kosher Sex ” author Rabbi Shmuley Boteach , who has sparred with Schlessinger over her comments on homosexuality .
“ Dr. Laura always equated her morals and ethics with Jewish morals and ethics .
That placed the American Jewish community in a real fix ; on the one hand , she made Judaism very popular , on the other , she made it vilified and hated by many people . ”
“ I think Judaism is better off not being saddled and directly associated with Dr. Laura ’s means , ” he said , adding , “ although she is still a Jew . ”
Schlessinger ’s office said she was unavailable for comment .
Schlessinger began her August 5 program by noting that , prior to each broadcast , she spends an hour reading faxes from fans and listeners .
“ By and large the faxes from Christians have been very loving , very supportive , ” she said .
“ From my own religion , I have either gotten nothing , which is 99 % of it , or two of the nastiest letters I have gotten in a long time .
I guess that ’s my point — I do n’t get much back .
Not much warmth coming back . ”
Schlessinger even hinted at a possible turn to Christianity — a move that , radio insiders say , would elevate her career far beyond the 300 stations that currently syndicate her show .
“ I have envied all my Christian friends who really , universally , deeply feel loved by God , ” she said .
“ They use the name Jesus when they refer to God … that was a mystery , being connected to God . ”
In her 25 years on radio , Schlessinger said she was moved “ time and time again ” by listeners who wrote and described that they had “ joined a church , felt loved by God and that was my anchor . ”
Michael Medved , a conservative , nationally syndicated , radio talk - show host , celebrated the Sabbath with Schlessinger about a year ago .
“ We had talked about having Shabbat again , ” he said .
When he heard of Schlessinger ’s defection , “ My first response was to pick up the phone and try and expedite [ the visit ] . ”
“ I think it ’s a shame , ” he said .
“ Though , of course , she was controversial in some eyes , she is one of the most admired women in America .
Having the most admired woman in America speak joyously about Passover , Shabbat and Jewish lifestyle events — all of that was quite wonderful . ”
Of her conversion to Judaism , Schlessinger said , “ I felt that I was putting out a tremendous amount toward that mission , that end , and not feeling return , not feeling connected , not feeling that inspired .
Trust me , I ’ve talked to rabbis , I ’ve read , I ’ve prayed , I ’ve agonized and I came to this place anyway — which is not exactly back to the beginning , but more in that direction than not . ”
“ Was Laura naive to think , ‘ gosh , I ’ll be the queen of the Jews ’ ?
Yes , she was naive , ” said Medved .
“ Part of that comes from not growing up in the Jewish community .
It ’s so rare to find a celebrity embrace of Jewish religiosity of any kind , I can see why Laura would think her very public embrace would have led to a more enthusiastic reaction .
But given all the crosscurrents and controversies that divide our community , I can see why that expectation was wrong . ”
In 2001 , despite the controversy surrounding her , the National Council of Young Israel honored Schlessinger for her “ traditional American values . ”
Rabbi Pesach Lerner , the executive director of Young Israel , was surprised by Schlessinger ’s defection but declined to comment on it .
Born to a Jewish father and an Italian Catholic mother , Schlessinger was raised in Brooklyn in a home that was without religion .
Approximately 10 years ago , prompted by a question from her son during a viewing of a Holocaust documentary , Schlessinger , 56 , began exploring her Jewish roots .
Yet last week ’s revelation was far from the first time Schlessinger has been wracked with religious doubts .
Lacking a religious background , she has spent a lifetime searching for that missing something , and “ each thing I tried left me feeling empty , ” she told Philadelphia ’s Inside magazine in 1998 .
Having already undergone a Conservative conversion in 1997 , after a debacle with the Jewish Federation of Greater Dallas — a now - legendary affair in which she allegedly rejected three hotel suites , would n’t ride in taxis and offended the entire audience at a $ 500 plate fundraiser —
Schlessinger was tempted to give up on Judaism completely , but decided to undergo an Orthodox conversion instead .
“ A large part of me wanted to make a statement after that experience , to stand even taller about Jewish values , ” she told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in 2001 .
“ Besides , if you do n’t have an Orthodox conversion , you ca n’t get buried in Israel .
I want to be close to ground zero . ”
Rabbi Reuven Bulka , a fellow radio host who presided over Schlessinger ’s Orthodox conversion , said he was “ stunned ” by his friend ’s 180 - degree turn .
“ It did n’t make my day , shall we say . ”
“ She obviously has a tremendous impact , ” said the congregational rabbi from Ottawa , Ont .
“ When she went through the evolutionary stage of her journey , a lot of people were inspired by her own excitement about it .
I ca n’t tell you I know 100 people who became Sabbath observant because of it , but certainly it was a feel - good message for a lot of people .
That these feel - good messages wo n’t be coming anymore is certainly a loss . ”
Other Jews within earshot are far from sad to see her go .
“ I do n’t think this is any great loss to the Jewish universe , ” said Susan Weidman Schneider , the executive editor of Lilith magazine .
“ I do n’t think she was a particularly effective or useful spokesperson .
She doubtless alienated more people than she drew toward Judaism . ”
“ So , let her say she ’s no longer a practicing Jew , ” she added .
“ Let her be just a garden variety , anti-choice conservative . ”
“ I still see myself as a Jew , ” Schlessinger said on the air last week .
“ But the spiritual journey and that direction , as hardcore as I was at it , just did n’t fulfill something in me that I needed . ”
“ All I know is , in my experiences with her — which have been considerable — I have n’t known her to do anything less than 100 % , ” Bulka said .
“ Anything she did , she did fully .
The scary thing is if she said she ’s leaving , it ’s very forboding . ”
“ I thought she was a tough little lady — I did n’t think she ’d chicken out so easily , ” said Rabbi Isaac Levy , the chairman of Jews for Morality , who has staunchly supported Schlessinger ’s conservative agenda .
“ She ’s gotten a couple of kicks in the chin and she ’s succumbed to it . ”
“ It seems incredible that an ethicist and moralist of her standing would invoke such shallow arguments , ” said Boteach , who was en route to an appearance on the titillating syndicated television show “ Blind Date . ”
“ I never got great applause for my work from the Jewish community — but my people are my people , whether they love or hate me . ”
' Can I quit now ? '
FEMA chief wrote as Katrina raged
E-mails give insight into Brown 's leadership , attitude
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A Louisiana congressman says e-mails written by the government 's emergency response chief as Hurricane Katrina raged show a lack of concern for the unfolding tragedy and a failure in leadership .
Rep. Charlie Melancon , whose district south of New Orleans was devastated by the hurricane , posted a sampling of e-mails written by Federal Emergency Management chief Michael Brown on his Web site on Wednesday .
The Democratic lawmaker cited several e-mails that he said show Brown 's failures .
In one , as employees looked for direction and support on the ravaged Gulf Coast , Brown offered to " tweak " the federal response .
Two days after Katrina hit , Marty Bahamonde , one of the only FEMA employees in New Orleans , wrote to Brown that " the situation is past critical " and listed problems including many people near death and food and water running out at the Superdome .
Brown 's entire response was : " Thanks for the update .
Anything specific I need to do or tweak ? "
( Copies of e-mails posted by critic -- PDF )
On September 12 Brown resigned , 10 days after President Bush told him , " Brownie , you 're doing a heck of a job . "
Brown is still on the federal payroll at his $ 148,000 annual salary .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , saying Brown 's expertise was needed as he investigated what went wrong , agreed to a 30 - day extension when Brown resigned .
Chertoff renewed that extension in mid-October .
Brown took over FEMA in 2003 with little experience in emergency management .
He joined the agency in 2001 as legal counsel to his friend , then - FEMA director Joe Allbaugh , who was Bush 's 2000 campaign manager .
When Allbaugh left FEMA in 2003 Brown assumed the top job .
Before joining the Bush administration , Brown spent a decade as the stewards and judges commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association .
The e-mails Melancon posted , a sampling of more than 1,000 provided to the House committee now assessing responses to Katrina by all levels of government , also show Brown making flippant remarks about his responsibilities .
( Read how office e-mails can come back to haunt )
" Can I quit now ?
Can I come home ? "
Brown wrote to Cindy Taylor , FEMA 's deputy director of public affairs , the morning of the hurricane .
A few days later , Brown wrote to an acquaintance , " I 'm trapped now , please rescue me . "
" In the midst of the overwhelming damage caused by the hurricane and enormous problems faced by FEMA , Mr. Brown found time to exchange e-mails about superfluous topics , " including " problems finding a dog - sitter , " Melancon said .
Melancon said that on August 26 , just days before Katrina made landfall , Brown e-mailed his press secretary , Sharon Worthy , about his attire , asking : " Tie or not for tonight ?
Button - down blue shirt ? "
A few days later , Worthy advised Brown : " Please roll up the sleeves of your shirt , all shirts .
Even the president rolled his sleeves to just below the elbow .
In this [ crisis ] and on TV you just need to look more hard - working . "
On August 29 , the day of the storm , Brown exchanged e-mails about his attire with Taylor , Melancon said .
She told him , " You look fabulous , " and Brown replied , " I got it at Nordstroms .
... Are you proud of me ? "
An hour later , Brown added : " If you 'll look at my lovely FEMA attire , you 'll really vomit .
I am a fashion god , " according to the congressman .
The e-mails came from Chertoff , who oversees FEMA , following a request by Melancon and Rep. Tom Davis , R- Virginia , chairman of a House committee appointed to investigate what went wrong during Katrina , Melancon said .
Brown resigned amid accusations that FEMA acted too slowly after Katrina hammered Louisiana and Mississippi , killing more than 1,200 people .
He defended the government 's response and blamed leaders in Louisiana for failing to act quickly as the hurricane approached .
He acknowledged he made some mistakes as FEMA 's director , but he stressed that the agency " is not a first responder , " insisting that role belonged to state and local officials .
Brown could not be reached for comment Wednesday night on the e-mails and Melancon 's charges .
Although Chertoff has not turned over all the documents requested by the committee , Melancon charged that the material received so far contradicts testimony by Brown before the committee in which he described himself as an effective leader .

Melancon used an e-mail sent September 2 , four days after the hurricane hit , to illustrate his point .
On that day , Brown received a message with the subject " medical help . "
At the time , thousands of patients were being transported to the New Orleans airport , which had been converted to a makeshift hospital .
Because of a lack of ventilators , medical personnel had to ventilate patients by hand for as long as 35 hours , according to Melancon .
The text of the e-mail reads : " Mike , Mickey and other medical equipment people have a 42 - foot trailer full of beds , wheelchairs , oxygen concentrators , etc .
They are wanting to take them where they can be used but need direction .
" Mickey specializes in ventilator patients so can be very helpful with acute care patients .
If you could have someone contact him and let him know if he can be of service , he would appreciate it .
Know you are busy but they really want to help . "
Melancon said Brown did n't respond for four days , when he forwarded the original e-mail to FEMA Deputy Chief of Staff Brooks Altshuler and Deputy Director of Response Michael Lowder .
The text of Brown 's e-mail to them read : " Can we use these people ? "
Melancon also charged that few of the e-mails from Brown show him assigning specific tasks to employees or responding to pressing problems .
On September 1 , FEMA officials exchanged e-mails reporting severe shortages of ice and water in Mississippi .
They were to receive 60 trucks of ice and 26 trucks of water the next day , even though they needed 450 trucks of each .
Robert Fenton , a FEMA regional response official , predicted " serious riots " if insufficient supplies arrive .
Brown was forwarded the series of e-mails about the problem , but no response from him is shown in the e-mails provided to the committee , Melancon said .
Katrina came ashore along the Louisiana - Mississippi state line , after being downgraded from a Category 5 to a Category 4 storm .
It flooded 80 percent of New Orleans .
It was followed about a month later by Hurricane Rita , which caused more damage and flooding .
Melancon and several other Democrats from districts directly affected by Katrina were invited to participate as a ex-officio members of the Katrina investigative committee , though they have no formal role .
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi refused to appoint any Democrats to the panel after GOP leaders rebuffed Democratic demands for an independent probe .
This is the second time a congressional committee had dealt with e-mails relating to FEMA 's Katrina response .
A complete transcript of Brown 's e-mail traffic during the Katrina crisis has not been released by the Department of Homeland Security .
The market for digital music was repressed for nearly a decade prior to the arrival of Apple 's iPod .
Here 's why digital music languished for so long , how Apple was able to build a digital business , and why rivals are struggling to turn back the clock and return digital downloads into a legal black hole of onerous restrictions .
The Music World Before DRM
Throughout the 1980's , the word for portable music was Walkman .
Sony introduced its compact cassette tape player in 1979 , and maintained the popularity of its trademark for nearly twenty years .
Sony 's Walkman was simple , small , and easy for users to figure out .
There was no copy protection .
The cassette tapes used in the Walkman and similar players were actually originally introduced by Phillips in the early 60's .
Both blank and prerecorded cassette tapes were easy to find , relatively cheap , and worked in a variety of players , including non-Sony personal players , larger portable boom boxes , and home console stereo systems .
It was easy to create mix tapes from records , radio , or live recordings .
Rise of the Digital Machines
By the late 80's , the limitations of cassette tape began to show .
Sony and Phillips had introduced the optical digital Compact Disc back in 1982 , but it gained little adoption until the late 80s because of the high initial price for both players and media .
Further , there was no way for users to record their own content on CDs , and there would n't be for nearly a decade .
The physical shape of CDs also complicated the design and size of a portable player .
So while the CD was in many ways an improvement over vinyl records , it was not the ideal replacement for cassette tapes .
Phillips attempted to introduce a new consumer digital cassette format , and Sony and Phillips also worked together to create the higher - end Digital Audio Tape format , but both suffered from the flaws inherent with tape : physical wear and stretching , magnetic erasure , dust contamination , the complexity of mechanical tape transports , and tape spooling that made fast forwarding to find a song a very slow process .
In order to deliver the benefits of both cassette tape and CD , Sony introduced its own new format in 1991 : MiniDisc .
The new format offered a portable , compact form factor and could record like cassette tapes , but also offered the optical digital sound , media durability , and instant access of CDs .
Digital 's Death by Restriction
Unfortunately , the music industry was so worried that the MD , DAT , and other digital formats would be used to illegally duplicate music that it introduced severe use restrictions and complexity for digital players that ended up killing their adoption , particularly in the US market .
The RIAA had Congress pass the Audio Home Recording Act in 1992 , which demanded royalties on all digital recording equipment and blank media , and required Serial Copy Management System restrictions be included on all new consumer audio recorders , to prevent music from being digitally duplicated beyond one generation .
The legislation was supposed to ensure that consumers would have access to new digital recording technology for private noncommercial use without the threat of being sued by copyright owners , but the actual result was to drive up the price of digital recorders , while making them nearly useless to consumers due to the excessive built - in hardware restrictions .
The CD - R Revolution
The machinations of the RIAA and Congress were eventually skirted by the arrival of new technology .
The audio CD had been adopted for computing use as CD - ROM , a high density storage system at a time when the 650 MB capacity of CDs was many times larger than any available hard drive .
CDs were not originally designed to support recording , but the obvious applications for re-writable CD - ROM resulted in the development of technology to burn special blank CD media in a way that created discs that could be read by existing CD players .
Since CD - ROM was simply an audio CD with additional directory information , it was suddenly possible for consumers to create their own audio CDs .
The actual digital audio data of a CD was too big for users to manipulate ; until the mid 90s , copying an entire raw audio CD into a computer was simply impossible .
Users needed a way to compress the raw AIFF CD audio down to a manageable size , but this took a lot of processing power .
By the mid 90's , home computers were just gaining the CPU capacity required to quickly rip CD audio into a compressed MP3 audio file .
The MP3 format rendered the music on a CD into files a fraction of their original size , and unleashed new applications for audio use on computers .
The digital equivalent to the mix tapes of the 80s had been repressed by law and economics for so long that this new ability to rip music exploded onto the scene without any market to accommodate users , who wanted to use MP3 files in the same way they 'd used tapes a generation prior .
Instead of offering reasonably priced digital music , the music industry tried to lock everything down , either to hardware media or to proprietary formats with excessive use restrictions .
That left music trading sites the most practical way to obtain digital music .
The iPod Arrives
Digital files not only sounded better than cassette tapes , but could also provide other features .
For example , digital systems could index and display the name and artist of a song as it played .
Managing this meta data made creating the digital equivalent of a mix tape a more complex task .
When Apple introduced the iPod in October of 2001 , it was , like most competing digital music players , a simple device that played plain MP3 files .
Apple differentiated the iPod by leveraging its QuickTime technology to transfer much of the complexity in managing songs , meta data , and playlists to the integrated iTunes software running on a computer .
This not only made the iPod simpler , but allowed Apple to swallow the market by offering consumers something rivals were n't : a digital experience with the simplicity of an 80's mix tape .
While Apple worked to make its iTunes and iPod combination easier to use , rivals seemed hell bent on making things more complex : Sony with ATRAC , and Microsoft with Janus .
Killed by Complication
Sony , having acquired Columbia Records in 1988 , was now aligned behind music industry interests .
It had long sought to replace the open MP3 format with its own ATRAC audio compression scheme in order to retain control over digital music files and limit the potential for music file sharing .
However , its customers were turned off by having to re-encode all their music , and the software Sony provided was obtuse , clumsy , and problematic , in stark contrast to its often stylish and elegant hardware .
While Sony worked to establish ATRAC , Microsoft determined to take over control of digital music and media with its Windows Media by giving its existing DRM system godlike powers and the name of a deity : Janus .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. have partnered in the past to gain ground on Google Inc. , but Internet experts say a possible $ 50 billion deal to combine the two companies may not be enough to halt Google Inc .
Reports surfaced Friday that Microsoft may try to buy Yahoo .
According to analysts interviewed Friday , a Yahoo YHOO and Microsoft MSFT , - 1.04 % tandem still fails to significantly dent Google in a key area : Internet search , which has emerged as the most popular way of navigating the Web and the focus of a dominant share of online advertising spending .
Meanwhile , the merger wo n't address Google 's superior technology for determining the most relevant Web pages and search results .
Both Yahoo and Microsoft 's ad - serving technologies simply do n't measure up , say analysts .
" Here are two companies that are having difficulties at the same thing , " said Scott Kessler of Standard & Poor's .
" With a merger , you get one company still having difficulties at doing that same thing . "
Yet , Microsoft may be one of the few companies capable of fixing Yahoo's technology challenges , according to Deutsche Bank analyst Jeetil Patel .
" Even in the best of times , mergers are hard ; and this is very dynamic and competitive space , " said Forrester analyst Charlene Li .
" If one of the main reasons here is to fight and chase Google , I do n't think it 'll succeed . "
There are upsides , to be sure .
The new company would have the world 's largest Internet audience , thus giving it a greater chance of winning the kind of blockbuster Internet advertising and search deals usually swinging Google 's way .
A Yahoo - Microsoft combination would account for 38 % of all U.S. Internet searches , and raises Yahoo's share of Internet search advertising to about 28 % worldwide , according to various estimates .
But even with the combination , Google 's share of Internet search queries dominates , estimated at 60 % in the U.S. and 70 % worldwide .
Meanwhile , Microsoft 's Internet portal business needs to be re-energized , suffering from an eroding Internet search share , and it's " underperforming "
Internet ad - serving business , Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney said , in a note to clients .
Rather than an acquisition , Yahoo and Microsoft could partner and be just as strong a foil to Google , a number of Internet experts suggested Friday .
Susquehanna Financial analyst Marianne
Wolk says there 's a 50/50 chance of a Yahoo / Microsoft merger vs. a significant joint venture or business relationship .
Deutsche Bank analyst Jeetil Patel longs for a return to the kind of advertising deal Yahoo and Microsoft once had in place .
Under that relationship , Microsoft was using Yahoo to distribute ads alongside its search engine results and affiliated Web sites .
But that partnership has since dissolved , in favor of Microsoft building its own system and Yahoo upgrading its own .
" Making companies bigger does n't necessarily make them better , " said Scott Kessler , an Internet software and services analyst with Standard & Poor 's Equity Research .
The children were assessed after giving blood samples
A University of Siena team studied the level of pain reported by 69 children aged between seven and 12 as they gave blood samples .
Some were distracted by their mothers during the procedure , some had no distraction and some watched cartoons .
Those who watched TV reported least pain , the study - published in Archives of Disease in Childhood - said .
There is evidence to show you can reduce people 's perception of pain given the right sort of intervention
Dr Ray MacDonald
The 69 children studied were randomly divided into the three groups to have a blood sample taken .
None of the children was given any form of anaesthesia .
After the samples had been taken , the children and their mothers rated their pain scores .
Children who were given no distraction at all registered pain scores around three times higher than those who watched cartoons .
Even a mother 's attempts at distraction , for example by soothing or caressing the child , proved to be no match for the soothing effect of television .
The results suggested that , not only did watching television reduce levels of pain , it also improved children 's tolerance of the pain they did register , the team said .
Parental role
The researchers say it is not clear whether the key factor was the distracting power of television or the emotional involvement of mothers undermining their attempts to help their children .
Writing in the journal , they say : " The higher pain level reported by children during mothers ' efforts at distraction shows the difficulty mothers have in interacting positively at a difficult moment in their children 's life .
" This does not mean that the mothers ' presence is negative : although it does not reduce pain , the children will recall that they were not left alone on a stressful occasion .
" Children who are experiencing pain in health care settings of course need the supportive presence of a parent to help them cope effectively .
" Indeed , children state that having their parent present provides the most comfort when in pain . "
Researcher Dr Carlo Bellieni said watching television might simply divert attention but it was also possible that the pleasure it generated might stimulate the release of natural painkilling hormones called endorphins .
He said health workers should consider using television to minimise distress for children undergoing minor painful procedures .
He also warned the study underlined the potentially powerful effect of television - which might not be welcome in everyday life .
Dr Ray MacDonald , a psychologist at Glasgow Caledonian University , has carried out research showing that listening to music can counter the pain of undergoing a procedure called haemodialysis in adult kidney disease patients .
He said : " There is evidence to show you can reduce people 's perception of pain given the right sort of intervention and I can certainly see parallels between listening to music and watching television . "
Scientists can use the virtual model instead of working on real cells
They hope the computer model will allow scientists to tinker with metabolic processes to find new treatments for conditions such as high cholesterol .
It could also be used to individually tailor diet for weight control , the University of California team claimed .
Their development is reported in the journal , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
A team of six bioengineering researchers at the University of California analysed the human genome to see what genes corresponded to metabolic processes , such as those responsible for the production of enzymes .
They spent a year manually going through 1,500 books , review papers and scientific reports from the past 50 years before constructing a database of 3,300 metabolic reactions .
The information was then used to create a network of metabolic processes in the cell , similar to a traffic network .
You could make a metabolic model for an individual person which is a tantalising prospect
Professor Bernhard Palsson
Study leader Professor Bernhard Palsson said the network could be used to see what would happen if a drug was used to target a specific metabolic reaction , such as the synthesis of cholesterol .
Or it could be used to predict what would happen if you interfere with a metabolic reaction in a specific type of cell , such as a blood or heart cell .
And eventually it could even be used to create an individual network for a person .
" The new tool we 've created allows scientists to tinker with a virtual metabolic system in ways that were , until now , impossible , and to test the modelling predictions in real cells , " said Mr Palsson , who is professor of bioengineering and medicine .
" You can take a drug target and you can make the flow through that reaction more and more restrictive or you can calculate all the reactions that you have to go through to make a certain product . "
Metabolism
Metabolic reactions in cells include those which convert food sources , such as fats , protein and carbohydrate into energy and to make other molecules used by the body .
There are hundreds of human disorders which are a result of problems with metabolism .
One example is haemolytic anaemia , a condition where red blood cells are broken down too rapidly .
To test the computer model , the team ran 288 different simulations , such as the synthesis of hormones , testosterone and oestrogen , and the metabolism of fat from the diet .
" We all have natural variation in the capacity of these pathways , for example in our ability to make cholesterol , so you could make a metabolic model for an individual person which is a tantalising prospect . "
Keith Frayn , professor of human metabolism at the University of Oxford , said the model would allow scientists to spot potential problems with targeting certain reactions early on in their research .
" It 's increasingly recognised there are these networks of metabolism and we need to know if we target something how that will spread out and this is potentially a way of dealing with that . "
Dr Anthony Wierzbicki , consultant in specialist laboratory medicine at St Thomas 's hospital , has done a lot of work on the role of cholesterol in heart disease .
" This is a potentially interesting tool for investigating metabolism of which cholesterol biochemistry forms a part , " he said .
But he added that the model would have to be " sophisticated " enough to predict what happens in the production and breakdown of cholesterol as well how it is absorbed from the gut as the two were closely linked .

BBC News education reporter in Bournemouth
Delegates said the number of pupils with no respect for teachers was growing
The National Association of Head Teachers said parents had responsibilities as well as rights .
At its annual conference , it voted unanimously to work with the government to enforce a " respect agenda " and reduce harassment of school staff .
It also voted to improve support for pupils with behaviour disorders .
Delegates at the conference in Bournemouth said teachers and heads had a right not to be spat at , sworn at , harassed or blackmailed .
' Meltdown '
David Gray , a former head teacher , said there was a growing number of pupils with no respect for teachers .
The extreme end of behaviour has not had the attention it deserves
Dr Rona Tutt
He said soap operas and the humiliation of participants in reality television shows had played their part in eroding respect for others .
" It 's the meltdown of our society 's civilised values , " he told the conference .
And he raised concerns about the " dysfunctional upbringing being inflicted on children " , where discipline was not enforced .
Martyn
Fry , a delegate from Gloucestershire , said teachers mattered as well as pupils .
" The government must support heads in dealing with the pupils and the parents who abuse and harass teachers . "
Mr Fry said well - behaved pupils who were eager to learn also had educational rights .
Dr Rona
Tutt , former president of the NAHT , said the authorities were often reluctant to accept the word of head teachers over disruptive pupils .
" The extreme end of behaviour has not had the attention it deserves , " she told delegates .
The association voted unanimously to urge government and local authorities to review the support they offer to school leaders over violent behaviour .
Exclusions
The NAHT also called for better specialist provision for pupils with serious behavioural disorders who were being educated in mainstream schools .
Clarissa Williams , head teacher of Tolworth Girls ' School in Surbiton , Kingston - upon - Thames , said the government had had excellent intentions towards these children and had spent money to close the gap between the " haves " and the " have - nots " .
But she said more must be done to help some of society 's most vulnerable children who had been " rejected all their lives " .
Mrs Williams said changes to the rules on exclusions would only lead to a rise in permanent exclusions .
From September , schools will have to provide 25 hours of education to all children on short - term exclusions from the sixth day of their suspension .
" Unless schools get more resources , we will be forced to exclude permanently our most damaged and potentially most damaging young people , " said Mrs Williams .
" Some of our children are so badly damaged by their life experiences that we cannot contain them . "
Scandal , political tensions spur demands for Wolfowitz ’s ouster at World Bank
By Bill Van Auken
16 April 2007
Pressure for the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank escalated over the weekend in the wake of a Group of Seven ( G7 ) finance ministers meeting in Washington , where several participants suggested his position was untenable .
French Finance Minister Thierry Breton , for example , declined to say whether he believed Wolfowitz should be ousted but declared that the World Bank should be “ ethically irreproachable , ” an obvious reference to the seedy scandal involving a hefty pay raise and promotion for Wolfowitz ’s girlfriend , Shaha Riza , a Libyan - born British citizen who was a career bureaucrat at the World Bank before US President George W. Bush appointed him to head the agency a little over two years ago .
“ I fully trust the governing board to draw the consequences it must draw , ” added Breton .
Germany ’s development minister , Heidemarie Wieczorek - Zeul , stated that Wolfowitz must decide “ whether he still has the credibility to represent the position of the World Bank . ”
Swiss Economics Minister Doris Leuthard declared , “ It is not the World Bank ’s credibility , but Mr. Wolfowitz ’s credibility that is on the line . ”
Brazil ’s minister , Guido Mantega , echoed these sentiments , adding , “ We ’ll have to see if Wolfowitz will be able to retain the moral authority necessary to fulfill his duties . ”
Meanwhile , the World Bank ’s Development Committee , made up of 24 finance or development ministers representing the member countries on the bank ’s board , issued a statement declaring , “ We have to ensure that the bank can effectively carry out its mandate and maintain its credibility and reputation as well as motivation of staff .
The current situation is of great concern to all of us . ”
A day earlier , Wolfowitz was booed at a meeting with staff of the international lending agency , who overwhelmingly support his removal .
The World Bank Group Staff Association issued a statement Thursday declaring that it “ seems impossible for the institution to move forward with any sense of purpose under the present leadership , especially in our endeavor to assist governments and their people in improving their own governance . ”
The association added , “ The President must acknowledge that his conduct has compromised the integrity and effectiveness of the World Bank Group and has destroyed the staff ’s trust in his leadership .
He must act honorably and resign . ”
It is widely believed that the board , which in practice votes according to the dictates of the world governments that its members represent , will stall in making any decision on Wolfowitz ’s fate , in hopes that he will resign .
For its part , the Bush administration issued statements of strong support and confidence in its former second in command at the Pentagon continuing at the helm of the World Bank , an institution that employs some 13,000 people worldwide and lends approximately $ 25 billion annually .
It is becoming increasingly apparent that underlying this sharp difference over the personal and professional fate of Wolfowitz are profound and deepening tensions between US and European capitalism , not only over the role of the World Bank but a host of economic and political issues .
The appointment of the former US assistant defense secretary and key architect of the US war of aggression against Iraq had been opposed from the outset by the majority of the World Bank ’s professional staff — an April 2005 poll showed 90 percent of staffers against it — as well as the bulk of the world ’s governments that participate in its deliberations .
Wolfowitz was and remains irrevocably identified with the lies about “ weapons of mass destruction ” and terrorist ties employed by the Bush administration to justify launching the 2003 US invasion of Iraq — a war that Wolfowitz had supported well before the September 11 , 2001 attacks and before the election of Bush himself .
The appointment was widely perceived as another gesture of the right - wing US administration ’s contempt toward the rest of the world , as well as its determination to subordinate every international institution to its own militarist campaign to assert US global hegemony .
In two years , Wolfowitz has managed to fully live up to these expectations .
The scandal involving preferential treatment for someone with whom he was romantically involved is only the latest — and most personally embarrassing — of a series of controversies that have surrounded Wolfowitz ’s tenure at the World Bank .
Nonetheless , this affair has its own unmistakable significance , both in what it says about the personal mores of those who make up the top echelons of capitalist politics in America and about the broader cynicism and hypocrisy that pervades US foreign policy .
Wolfowitz disclosed his relationship with Riza in the spring of 2005 , during his negotiation of a lucrative five - year contract to serve as the board ’s president .
The bank ’s ethics committee determined that maintaining her on staff in a position over which Wolfowitz would effectively exercise managerial control would violate the bank ’s conflict - of - interest rules .
As the Washington Post revealed in an article by Karen DeYoung Sunday , the deal that Wolfowitz cut for his girlfriend was part of an aggressive and avaricious campaign to reap unprecedented compensation and perks for himself and his cronies .
In his own case , this involved the negotiation of clauses allowing him to earn a substantial second income through lecture and book deals .
In the case of Riza , Wolfowitz issued a personal order to the bank ’s director of personnel to increase her annual salary to $ 193,590 — a $ 60,000 hike — while she was reassigned from the World Bank ’s Middle East press office to the US State Department .
She worked — making more than Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice herself — under the supervision of Vice President Dick Cheney ’s daughter Elizabeth , who had been given her own nepotistic appointment to the number two position in the State Department ’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs only two months earlier .
There Cheney ’s daughter — who left the post last year — was reportedly a leading proponent of US aggression against Syria and Iran .
No doubt , the awarding of a salary increase that amounts to more than the total annual income earned by 75 percent of American households seemed like no big deal to Wolfowitz at the time .
At the Pentagon , he had presided over multi-million - dollar corruption involving his Iraqi ally Ahmed Chalabi and the principal military contractor in Iraq — formerly headed by Dick Cheney — Halliburton .
With the release of the details of his girlfriend ’s pay deal — described by the staff association as “ grossly out of line ” with personnel policy — his office circulated a false claim that the arrangement had been approved by the World Bank ’s relevant boards .
In fact , as is now documented , Wolfowitz — together with Riza ’s lawyer — dictated the terms , overriding the recommendations of the institution ’s ethics committee and barring relevant personnel from any negotiations on the contract .
Riza , incredibly , has issued a statement claiming that she was “ victimized ” by this lucrative arrangement , and has demanded “ an end the unwarranted and malicious public and private attacks . ”
Similarly , Wolfowitz brought with him to the World Bank two right - wing Republican White House operatives — Robin Cleveland and Kevin Kellems — whom , the Post reports , he “ installed in senior positions and rewarded with open - ended contracts and quarter - million - dollar , tax - free salaries , despite their lack of development experience . ”
Significantly , just months after his installation at the World Bank , Wolfowitz named Suzanne Rich Folsom — an attorney and Republican activist — to head the agency ’s Department of Institutional Integrity , which conducts internal corruption investigations .
The appointment was made in the wake of the bank ’s own search committee ’s selection of nine suitable candidates , all of whom were rejected in favor of the Bush administration loyalist .
Wolfowitz ’s arrogance and apparent personal corruption were all the more striking given his attempt to make a campaign against government corruption internationally the signature issue of his tenure at the World Bank .
Like the “ war on terror ” and the crusade for “ democracy , ” this campaign became more and more obviously a cover for the pursuit of US global interests .
Corruption was invoked as a pretext for cutting off loans to countries under conditions in which it served Washington ’s foreign policy purposes , while ignoring corruption whenever it would have cut across American interests .
Thus , Uzbekistan , which had received half a billion dollars in loans from the World Bank since 1992 , had an aid package suddenly revoked on Wolfowitz ’s orders in September 2005 , just two months after the country ’s dictator , Islam A. Karimov , terminated a US basing agreement , ordering American troops and warplanes out of the country .
When it came to Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan and other regimes of strategic importance to US military operations , however , the concern for corruption went out the window .
According to the Washington Post , “ Both [ World Bank ] staff and management also have raised concerns over what several described as Wolfowitz ’s insistence that the bank accelerate its lending to Iraq and open an office there . ”
The Iraqi government is universally acknowledged to be among the most corrupt on earth , and in the end , the World Bank proved unable to recruit qualified personnel to staff any such office , because of justified concern over the civil war conditions prevailing in the country .
Wolfowitz ’s international critics have ample cause to press for his removal from the World Bank .
However , underlying the firestorm over the unethical and reactionary policies pursued by a man who is by the strictest definition a war criminal are powerful international economic and political tensions that are increasingly coming to the surface .
The crisis confronting Wolfowitz at the World Bank is inseparable from the debacle created by the criminal enterprise with which his name will always be associated : the US war in Iraq .
The turn against him by the ministers of one government after another is a further indication of the political isolation of the Bush administration both at home and abroad .
More fundamentally , the ex-Pentagon official ’s predicament is a manifestation of the changed position of US capitalism in global economic and political affairs .
The World Bank — together with the International Monetary Fund — was one of the key institutions set up under US hegemony in the aftermath of the Second World War for the purpose of reconstructing European capitalism and creating the conditions for the further expansion of American capitalism itself .
Given Washington ’s preeminent role in the institution ’s creation , as well as the predominance of US finance capital in world economic affairs during the postwar period , the US government was given the right to appoint the president of the World Bank , as well as a share of the votes on its board of directors that amounted to effective veto power .
This share , however , has been reduced because of the relative decline of US economic preeminence and the rise of powerful capitalist rivals in Europe and Asia .
While Washington held just over 37 percent of the voting rights at the foundation of the World Bank , today its share has been reduced to a little more than 16 percent .
The four next most powerful shareholders in the bank — Japan , Germany , France and the United Kingdom — can now outvote the US .
China , which still is allocated less than 3 percent of the votes , is making a strong case for strengthening its position at American expense .
Nonetheless , the bank remains headquartered in Washington , and the US government continues to exert decisive influence over its decisions .
But to the extent that American imperialism remains the dominant global power today , it is not on the basis of its economic might or productive capacity .
Rather , it is attempting to compensate for its relative economic decline by military means .
This inevitably generates immense inter-imperialist conflicts and tensions .
While for the most part , Washington ’s rivals in Europe and Asia have bowed to US militarism , they have not done so without bitter resentment of Washington ’s dominance and a determination to pursue their own interests as capitalist powers .
In the ugly scandal surrounding Paul Wolfowitz , they have found a means of furthering these aims .
Simply put , if conservative realists and liberal realists form a Reality Coalition , we have the numbers and the connections to win .
We are the networks .
It is already happening on the Internet .
Bold activists have posted videos of Paul and Gravel on YouTube and spread links to information using Digg .
Now I ask you to join the movement .
We need to engage our fellow Americans in the conversation .
We need to shout the truth to the rooftops .
Let every blogger spread the word about Gravel vs. Paul 2008 .
Even if you have not been political in the past there is no reason that you can't start now .
The only way to ensure success is to create an inverse of the 2004 election , as your model for the 2008 election .
As they ran Bush vs. Kerry , so now if we wish to save our democracy , we must run Ron Paul ( R ) vs. Mike Gravel ( D ) in the 2008 Election .
Post articles , post comments , add links to your signature , send e-mails , post stories to Digg , write letters to the editors , become a maven , hand out fliers , print posters and stickers , and above all tell your friends , tell your community .
Your voice may be small , but once thousands of voices begin shouting , there is no way to stop them all .
Please join me and spread the word .
Ensuring that independent political candidates win both nominations for the major parties is the only way to ensure the election of an independent candidate in 2008 .
Thank you for your time .

A Proposal for a Christian Pornography
Many readers have written in to ask us about pornography .
Is it acceptable for Christians to view adult entertainment ?
Our stance on pornography is directly informed by our position on sex and sexuality with regards to Christianity .
Depending on the circumstances , the act of intercourse can be either a defilement of the body and soul through lust and indulgence of the senses , or it can be a celebration of God - given sexuality that uplifts the bodies and spirits of both partners .
Likewise , pornography could be either degrading and sinful ( as it almost always is ) , or it could depict acts that , when viewed appropriately , could enhance the sexual and sensual relationships of believers .
Consider the Song of Solomon , a deeply sensual and erotic book of the Bible , which describes in lyrical detail the sexual and romantic relationship between a bride and bridegroom .
Their dialogue relates to spiritual matters , but relates spirituality through a loving physical relationship between husband and wife .
This is the model of erotic “ edutainment ” that we are proposing .
We believe that under the right circumstances , and given the correct content , such adult media has the potential to enrich the sexual lives of married Christian partners .
Of course , there is little , if any adult entertainment currently on the market that reflects these values and would be a good choice for Christians .
That leads us to call for a new kind of porn – porn that upholds the Christian ethos .
Christ - centered porn , made to be viewed by Christians and tailored to their unique needs .
We challenge Christians in the adult industry ( yes , they do exist – and you know who you are ) to step up and truly walk their walk and live their faith by producing pornography that men and women of God can view without compromising their relationship with their Savior , or their relationship with their spouse .
Christians have so many questions about sexuality : what is acceptable or not , how to express sexual desires to their husband or wife , how to have a more fulfilling sex life , and much more .
Unfortunately , few in the church are willing to talk openly and in detail about these matters .
Most sexual guides for Christians are vague or coy , glossing over graphic details .
Believers need sexual resources that are unafraid to actually demonstrate and show them what healthy sexuality in a Christian marriage looks like .
For these reasons , we believe there is both a need and a demand for Christian adult entertainment , and so we are issuing this manifesto calling for a new paradigm in pornography .
It must depict only married couples engaging in sexual acts .
This means that any sexual partners in a Christian porn production must be husband and wife , both on and off screen .
All actors must be married in real life and portray married couples onscreen .
And they must only be depicted having sex with their wedded spouses .
It must portray sex within the context of a Christian marriage .
It must be apparent through the actions , behaviors , and speech of the characters portrayed that they are Christian , lead a Christian lifestyle , and have a marriage in which their faith is central .
This could be depicted in a variety of ways , with scenes showing a couple praying together , studying the Bible , attending church or church functions , and generally relating to one another as loving Christian spouses outside of the bedroom .
It must be instructional .
Part of the mission of Christian pornography is to graphically educate married believers in how to achieve more sexual pleasure , intimacy , and closeness in their relationships .
It can do this by dramatizing various sexual techniques and positions so that couples can learn how to incorporate them into their lovemaking routines .
In their onscreen roles , the actors should model both correct sexual techniques and appropriate sexual attitudes , by being respectful and treating one another ’s bodies as the sacred gift from God that they are .
Husband and wife must both receive their due benevolence .
This is in keeping with the scriptural mandate of I Corinthians 7:3 , which says “ Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence : and likewise also the wife unto the husband . ”
This means that both sex partners must be shown getting equal pleasure and sexual attention from one another .
No extramarital sex , unless it is to illustrate the downfalls of adultery .
it is to illustrate the downfalls of adultery .
The spouses in a Christian porn production must never have adulterous relations , unless they ( and their partner in extramarital crime ) suffer and are punished fittingly for their sins .
( In deference to modern conventions , the punishment does not have to be one mandated by scripture , i.e. , being stoned to death . )
It must be uplifting and inspirational , focusing on strengthening Christian marriage and Christian faith .
Christian porn must have an overall positive message .
Of course , its primary message would be to demonstrate the sacred use of sexuality and sensuality to reinforce the bonds of Christian marriage .
But in all other respects , it should affirm Christian values of community , family , faith , honesty , charity , and so forth .
It should show that having a joyous and fulfilling married sex life is one of the fruits of following the path of righteousness .
No profanity .
Although exclamations of pleasure are acceptable , as are the natural sounds and vocalizations of lovemaking , Christian porn should contain no profanity or swearing .
The participants should address each other lovingly and respectfully at all times .
Of course , it goes without saying that the actors will not take the Lord ’s name in vain , nor that of his Son .
The point of Christian pornography is not to provide material for the fantasies of individuals to use for their own gratification or to fuel masturbation .
Although masturbation in itself is not wrong , the highest purpose of Christian porn is to enrich the sexual relationship between believers .
It is not primarily intended to be used by individuals to inflame their own desires or as a substitute for a relationship .
Under some circumstances , an individual might be justified in viewing this material on his or her own .
For example , if the purpose of viewing the pornography is ultimately in the service of the marriage , if a man wanted to become better instructed in how to please his wife orally , or if a wife needed help getting in touch with her sexuality in order to be more open to intimacy with her husband .
Likewise , a single person might find Christian porn instructional if it better prepares them for relating to their future spouse .
One of the complaints against conventional pornography is that it creates unrealistic expectations about sex and warps the viewer ’s attitudes towards sexuality and the opposite sex .
This argument could not be made against Christian porn , because it would be presenting a healthy and realistic representation of married Christian sexual life , and would be modeling correct and respectful husband - wife relationships , creating a positive vision for what can be expected in a future marriage .
Microsoft may aim for Yahoo !
acquisition
Software giant considering major purchase of Yahoo !
stock in effort to keep up with steamrolling industry leader Google , newspaper reports .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) - Microsoft has been in talks with Yahoo !
about potentially acquiring a major portion of the company , according to a report published Wednesday .
Members of the company 's top management are considering a deal despite Microsoft 's history of winning over major technology markets - think Web browsers - on its own , The Wall Street Journal said .
Microsoft has tried to compete in the burgeoning online search and Web advertising categories on its own but made little progress as Google has made massive gains as the industry leader , according to the story .
Microsoft executives hope that Yahoo's strength in search and advertising categories would give the company a stronger foothold on the Web , the report said .
So far , millions of dollars invested in search - engine technology and online ad systems have yielded little in the way of revenue or market share for the company , according to the Journal .

Red and purple , by the way , suggest power .
Wear them to work and act like a big shot ; people will subconsciously obey .
Everyone responds to sound differently , but hearing your favorite music -- whether it's Zeppelin or Fresh Aire - - will energize , motivate , and relax .

As I see it , these are some of the things we can expect in the next seven months in Iraq : 1 . The last of the “ surge ” forces ( American ) , will arrive by mid June ; 2 . About 1400 British soldiers , well trained and adept at urban conflict , will leave the South of Iraq .
As one can see by reviewing icasualties .org ’s latest listings , 13 ( at least ) , British and / or Polish troops stationed in the South have been killed , almost all by hostile fire .
Ths is a increase in British hostile fire losses , and comes when the prospect of Iraqi or American troops entering the fray in the south would pose a dilution of the surge forces .
No Americans have really ever been stationed in the south of Iraq , among predominantly Shia populations .
The methodology the UK forces have used has been learned in Northern Ireland , and is much more sophisticated than any approach Americans have used .
As a result , units which may have been in Iraq previously , but are now peopled by a fair number of new grunts , will cut their teeth in the southern Iraq .
Because of much more heavy handed approaches , lack of sophisticated skills in urban war , and an increase in various Shia militia more radical than Moqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army , the Americans will cause one incident of cause celébre in the South ; 3 . More EFP ’s ( Explosive Formed Projectiles ) , manufactured and assembled by more radical Shia militia , will take a serious toll on Americans moving in behind British troops leaving ; 4 . The U.S. WILL have more difficulties as they step between rival Shia groups in the south , and elsewhere ; 5 . As was demonstrated by an entire school being wired as a complete booby trap , insurgents with good inside intelligence are anticipating American - Iraqi troops taking over abandoned schools , police stations , etc. , as “ outposts . ”
Even if Americans inspect these facilities early , with sophisticated devices , there is no guarantee that stay behind explosives experts among the insurgents wo n’t trigger these massive booby traps — killing American and Iraqi inspection teams ; 6 . At least one more outpost will be attacked by al - Qaeda , or others , as we recently saw , where 9 Americans were killed and two dozen or more wounded .
Al - Qaeda will try a Khobar tower attack , where they used an 18 - wheeler fully loaded with tons of explosives .
This will depend on whether an outpost is sufficiently distanced from the local population enough to destroy the outpost , but not killed any more Iraqis than necessary ; 7 . improved rocket and mortar fire will continue to hit the Green Zone with greater accuracy .
As a result , we will see a “ time on target ” attack against the Green Zone , where multiple katyusha rockets or heavy mortars will fire , simultaneously , on a mark , on the Green Zone , with any number of rockets or mortar rounds hitting simultaneously .
There is evidence that the mortar and rocket fire is becoming more accurate .
That implies insiders gauging the accuracy and feeding that data back to the gunners .
Multiple rockets / mortars fired from multiple azimuths on the compass will make counter battery fire more difficult ; 8 . Every attempt will be made in the next seven months to cause at least two dozen or more American fatalities in one event , plus many more wounded ; 9 . As the Army and Marine Corps troops are told that they will stay the entire 15 month tour , and the follow on forces get notified of deployments for same , it will become evident that President Bush WILL NOT reduce American numbers in Iraq in 2007 .
His arrogance and stubborness will cost him support by year ’s end among the GOP ; 10 .
It will become increasingly clearer that Maliki , and his Shia dominated government , have no intent on handing back any substantive power to Sunnis or even Kurds ; 11 .
As the Kurds become more disillusioned and embittered at not receiving substantive increases in their real power , they will make moves which will draw severe warnings from Turkey of intervention if Iraqi Kurds stir up Turkish Kurds ; 12 .
If the Sunnis do not cooperate with the Kurds , they will be ejected from the Kurdish north , or at least threatened of that possibility .
If so , more violence could erupt in those areas which thus far do not present a severe test for American occupiers ; 13 .
More attempts will be made to capture Americans and hold them hostage .
Additionally , in a symbol of resistance that will become a cause for rally , more Iraqis will booby trap their doors or front gates , so that the scene of Americans kicking in doors , or knocking them open with battering rams will be less prevalent as some Americans are blown up performing that task .
A simple tactical response to the occupation such as that will lead to a slow down in American offensive operations as more Americans are killed or wounded , and they become more hesitant to perform such duties .
This will become the counter part to Americans crawling down into tunnels in Vietnam — a very nasty and undesirable task which had to be performed , but which was psychologically very anxiety producing ; 14 .
At least one event will occur where Sunnis with ground - to - air missiles will take out more than two choppers in one fire fight ; 15 .
If any additional Iranian officials are captured by Americans ( like the four captured whom the Iranian Government say are Iranian diplomats ) , another ambush will occur where Americans are killed or captured ; 16 .
The effects of the recent DOD study on the increasing number of mental health risks American soldiers and marines face in Iraq will be one more very serious reason for at least a few more congressmen or women to call for a real change in the level of forces maintained in Iraq ; 17 .
Some Republicans will demand that if the “ surge ” is deemed to “ be working , ” that that be used as a positive reason to lower American force presence in Iraq .
Bush wo n’t do it ; 18 .
At least one high level intelligence failure will occur do to infiltration or manipulation by an Iraqi “ agent in place ” which will cause the loss of American lives ; 19 .
Some Democrats , and certainly , many night time comedians will begin calling George Bush , Our Decider in Chief ; or , “ Our Commander Guy , ” or , His Majesty , King George II , or His Highness , when referring to our fearless leader ; 20 .
If the “ surge ” does not show appreciable improvement on the ground in Iraq , Bush will ABSOLUTELY refuse to bring any troops home by Christmas .
Very , very sadly , American soldiers or marines will show an increase in suicides , in Iraq , and among troops alerted for a second , third or fourth deployment .
There will be at least one family killing by an American soldier or marine slated to return for a multiple tour in Iraq .
A hapless US Air Force pilot had to be physically cut free from the cockpit of his F - 22A Raptor when the canopy resolutely refused to open , Flight International reports .
The mini-drama unfolded on 10 April at the 27th Fighter Squadron 's base at Langley AFB , Virginia , when the canopy " became stuck in the down and locked position and could not be opened manually after the pilot cycled the mechanism several times , following a pre-flight warning that the canopy was unlocked " .
Accordingly , an emergency team of ground operatives moved in after five hours and attacked the $ 134 m
Raptor with a decidedly unstealthy and low - tech chainsaw with which they unceremoniously sawed open the offending canopy .
The estimated repair bill is a whopping $ 180,000 .
The F - 22 Raptor was rolled out a couple of years ago after 19 years in development .
The US military and makers Lockheed Martin wasted little time in trumpeting the beast 's awesome capabilities , as LM 's blurb demonstrates :
No fighter in the world comes close to matching the F - 22 .
By every measure , the Raptor represents extraordinary breakthroughs in manoeuverability , stealth , sensor fusion - a wealth of parameters that define a new era in fighter capability .
Ahem .
The breathless eulogy concludes : " With the F - 22 , the era of US air dominance - against all ground and air - based threats - has begun . "
Yes indeed .
We look forward to the rumoured sequel to Top Gun which will feature Tom Cruise trapped for five hours in his F - 22 after which Nicole Kidman rolls up to tell " Maverick " : " Do n't you think this has gone on long enough ?
It 's time for you to come out of the cockpit .
You 're not fooling anyone . " ®
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Airline tycoon Richard Branson announced on Friday a $ 25 million prize for the first person to come up with a way of scrubbing greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere in the battle to beat global warming .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Flanked by climate campaigners former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and British ex-diplomat Crispin Tickell , Branson said he hoped the prize would spur innovative and creative thought to save mankind from self - destruction .
“ Man created the problem and therefore man should solve the problem , ” he told a news conference to reveal the Virgin Earth Challenge .
“ Unless we can devise a way of removing CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) from the earth ’s atmosphere we will lose half of all species on earth , all the coral reefs , 100 million people will be displaced , farmlands will become deserts and rain forests wastelands . ”
Branson rejected suggestions that he , as an airline owner , was being hypocritical in announcing the prize .
“ I could ground my airline today , but British Airways would simply take its place , ” he said , noting that he was investing heavily in cleaner engines and fuels .
Top scientists predict that global average temperatures will rise by between 1.8 and 4.0 degrees Celsius this century due to human activities like burning fossil fuels , putting millions at risk from rising sea levels , floods , famines and storms .
Gore , whose campaign film “ An Inconvenient Truth ” has helped spread the message , said all science showed something was drastically wrong but that Armageddon was not inevitable .
“ We are now facing a planetary emergency .
The planet has a fever , ” he said .
“ This is an initiative to stimulate someone to do something that no one knows how to do .
This is right at the cutting edge . ”
The prize will initially only be open for five years , with ideas assessed by a panel of judges including Branson , Gore and Tickell as well as U.S. climate scientist James Hansen , Briton James Lovelock and Australian environmentalist Tim Flannery .
The winner will have to come up with a way of removing one billion tonnes of carbon gases a year from the atmosphere for 10 years -- with $ 5 million of the prize being paid at the start and the remaining $ 20 million at the end .
If no winner is identified after five years the judges can decide to extend the period .
“ This is the world ’s first deliberate attempt at planetary engineering , ” Flannery said via videolink from Sydney .
“ We are at the last moment .
Once we reach the tipping point it will have been taken out of our hands .
He said 200 gigatonnes of carbon had accumulated in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution , raising concentrations by 100 parts per million .
The challenge was to find ways of bringing that back down again .

longjmpと例外
プログラムの流れを制御する手段として、いわゆる「構造化構文（for とか if とか） 」、悪名高い 「 goto 文」などがあるのは周知のことだが、かなり特殊なものとして、「setjmp , longjmp」による「非ローカル分岐」と呼ばれるものがある。この「非ローカル分岐」は「非ローカル」と言うだけあって、ある関数の中から、別な関数に制御を移すことができたりする。まあ、そのために乱用すべきではなく、注意して使わなくてはならないライブラリ関数なのだが、実はこれは
Java や C++ で言語の上で実装されている「例外」の基礎となるものである。だから、まずこの標準ライブラリ関数「setjmp , longjmp」について解説しよう。 → Java 講座の 「例外 」
setjmp , longjmp とは
setjmp , lognjmp は古典的に標準ライブラリ関数として実装されているＣライブラリ関数である。setjmp , longjmp はペアになって、関数の外にジャンプする機構を実現する。よろしいか、goto 文がたかが関数内部での制御の移動を実現するのに引き換え、この setjmp , longjmp は関数の間でのジャンプができるのである。だから、濫用すると、すぐに収拾がつかなくなるので、goto 文同様に禁止現場は多い 。
setjmp , longjmp それぞれの担当は次の通り。これらは setjmp.h でプロトタイプ定義がなされている。
int setjmp ( jmp_buf jmp ) ; まず、グローバル変数として jmp_buf 型のコンテキストバッファを定義しておく。これを引数にして setjmp ( ) を呼び出す。そうすると、setjmp( ) はすぐに戻り値 0 で戻って来る。これは現在の 「 実行コンテキスト」を jmp_buf 型のコンテキストバッファに保存したのである。 void longjmp ( jmp_buf jmp , int ret ) ; その後、何かの処理を呼び出す。この時、setjmp( ) を呼び出した関数から抜けても、あるいは setjmp ( ) の戻り値処理の if 文からも、抜けてはならない。そして、この setjmp が保存したコンテキストバッファが有効である限り、longjmp( ) を呼び出すと、制御が setjmp ( ) の先程は戻り値 0 で戻ったのだが、戻り値 0 以外で setjmp ( ) 関数から戻ったような動作をする。この時、第二引数 ret は、setjmp ( ) の戻り値として振舞うべき値を指定する（もし 0 だと setjmp ( ) が混乱するので、1 になる）。つまり、次の通りである。
jmp_buf jbuf ; void SubFunctions ( ) { if ( .... ) { longjmp ( jbuf , 1 ) ; /* NOTREACHED */ } } void SomeFunc( ) { if ( setjmp ( jbuf ) == 0 ) { SubFuntions ( ) ; /* このブロック内部の関数では、自由に longjmp を呼べる */ } else { /* longjmp によって、戻って来た */ } /* もう longjmp を呼ぶ関数を呼んではいけない */ }
では、 「実行コンテキスト」とは何だろう？ 何を保存しているんだろう？ とりあえず、jmp_buf の定義を見てみよう。（in setjmp.h）
/* 呼び出した環境。それに出来るならばシグナルマスクも保存する */ typedef struct __jmp_buf_tag /* C++ ではこのようなタグのない構造体は好まれない */ { /* NOTE : マシン依存の __sigsetjmp の定義は、jmp_buf が __jmp_buf で始まること を仮定している。だから、__jmp_buf を移動したり、この前にいかなるメンバも
追加してはならない。*/ __jmp_buf __jmpbuf ; /* 呼ばれた環境 */ int __mask_was_saved ; /* シグナルマスクが保存されているか？ */ __sigset_t __saved_mask ; /* 保存されたシグナルマスク */ } jmp_buf [ 1 ] ;
__jmp_buf の定義は 、Linux だと bits / setjmp.h にある。
# if defined __USE_MISC || defined _ASM # define JB_BX 0 /* それぞれ、レジスタの名前 */ # define JB_SI 1 # define JB_DI 2 # define JB_BP 3 /* ベースポインタ */ # define JB_SP 4 /* スタックポインタ */ # define JB_PC 5 /* プログラムカウンタ */ #endif #ifndef _ASM typedef int __jmp_buf [ 6 ] ; /* 要するに __jmp_buf は int 6個の配列 */ #endif
とりあえず、シグナルマスクについては触れない。これについて知りたい人は「シグナルとコールバック〜POSIXシグナルシステムコール」を参照されたい。この構造を単純化すると、jmp_buf の定義はこんなところである。
struct jmp_buf_tag { int register [ 6 ] ; } ; typedef struct jmp_buf_tag jmp_buf ;
単に int 値６個の配列に過ぎない。しかし、実はこの jmp_buf はアセンブリレベルで、現在の実行状態である特殊なレジスタをすべて配列の中に保存するのである。
コンピュータというものは、形式的に言えば「状態機械」である。つまり、複数の「状態」を持った機械であり、「状態」に応じてその動作が違うだけではなく、「状態」を書き換えて動作して行くものである。もし、このマシンの状態をどこかに保存しておいて、戻りたくなったら現在の「状態」を保存しておいた「状態」に書き換えれば、結果としてプログラム上は、ある関数からそれを呼び出した関数に、通常の return の構造とは無関係に戻って来るように見える。これが setjmp/longjmp の基礎である。
どうやって実現してるの？
この setjmp/longjmp 機構の関数は、だからアセンブリでしか定義できない。Ｃ言語のレベルではレジスタを直接いじることはできない（はず..）である。ここで、「状態」にはどんな種類があるのかを考えよう。
演算レジスタの状 態 ＣＰＵ のレジスタは、演算のために使われる特別なメモリであり、演算の中心的な役割を果たす。これは setjmp によって保存される。 現在の実行行 これ はＣＰＵ のレベルでは PC レジスタの値である。要するに PC レジスタの値（次に読んで実行すべきメモリアドレス）は、他のレジスタと違いがあるわけでも何でもない。つまり、JMP 命令と は 「 PCレジスタに値をセットする」命令に過ぎないのである。だから、これも演算レジスタと同じく保存できる。 スタックの状態 関数の呼び出しネストや自動変数は、スタックに取られている（ここらへんが怪しい人は「ポインタ虎の巻」を参照のこと）。しかし、スタックは関数の呼び出しネストに従って、「上に積み重なっていく」。だから、関数から別な関数を呼び出したとしても、呼び出し元関数のスタックの状態はそのままなのである。だから戻っても処理を継続できる。ＣＰＵのレベルでは、スタックのトップを示す特殊なレジスタ
SP レジスタがあり、スタックの状態を 「 巻き戻す 」ためには、単に SP レジスタの値を 「より古い」状態に書き換えるだけで済む。
通常の通りに関数から戻って SP が「巻き戻される」場合を例にとって、このようなレジスタがどう動いているのかを理解しよう。
PC レジスタが CALL 命令によって、そのサブルーチンの実行行の値になる（要するに、関数に入る）。この時、CALL 命令の次の命令のアドレスが、同時にスタックに積まれる。 まず、入ったばかりの時の SP レジスタの値を、特殊な役割に固定されているレジスタである
BP レジスタに保存する。だから 、BP の値は戻りアドレスの位置を示している。 自動変数を確保する。これは単にスタックにそれ用の領域が確保できれば良いだけである。PUSH した気になって 、SP だけをそれ用に必要な分だけ更新すれば良い。 それから、現在の他のレジスタの値をスタックに積んで保存する。これは戻る時に状態を回復するためである。昔はすべてのレジスタをいちいち
PUSH で積んでいた が 、Intel 80186 で PUSHA という、保存すべきレジスタを一括してスタックに PUSH する命令が追加された。まあ、どん なＣＰＵ でも便利なので、こういう一括レジスタ PUSH 命令があることが多かろう。 そして、さまざまな処理をする。では関数から戻る時にはどうか。 まず、保存しておいたレジスタの値を回復する。これも
POPA 命令があるので、これで一括してスタックからレジスタの値を回復する。 自動変数を破棄する。これも単に SP の値を BP に保存しておいた値に戻すだけである。 そうすれば 、SP の値はスタック上の戻りアドレスを指していることになる。ここで
RET 命令を発行する。そうすると、RET 命令は SP で示されるスタック上のアドレスから、戻りアドレスを取得し、これを
PC レジスタにセットする。平たく言えば、保存しておいた戻りアドレスにジャンプする。 これで、サブルーチンを実行し、呼び元（CALL 命令の次の行）に戻ったのである。
だから、setjmp/longjmp 機構が、このような通常の関数呼び出しに介入できる枠組が何となく理解できたのではなかろうか。 その他特殊なレジスタ たとえばフラグレジスタや、割り込み状態をマークするレジスタがあることだろうが、これらは特にいじらなくても問題がないだろう。
グローバル変数領域(データセグメント ) これについては、setjmp/longjmp 機構の取り扱い範囲外である。特に何もしないことが、その機能である。
だから、setjmp/longjmp は、このような通常の関数呼び出しの枠組みを「ダマす」ことによって実現可能なのである。大体の setjmp/longjmp の動作を疑似コードで示そう。
int setjmp ( jmp_buf jb ) { 必要なレジスタを取得し、それを jmp_buf（実は配列）のそれぞれの領域に保存 return 0 ; }
setjmp の動作はそれほど難しくない。では、longjmp はどんな動作をするのだろう？
void longjmp ( jmp_buf jb , int ret ) { ●jmp_buf のそれぞれの領域から、レジスタに値を書き戻す
割と順番などもあって、ホントは難しいが、通常の関数が
POPA する領域を jmp_buf の値で書き換えて 、POPA すると比較的やさしいかな？ ●戻り値を示すレジスタに、引数 ret の値をセット （Intel だと EAX レジスタ） ●そして、保存された戻りアドレスに JMP 、 あるいはスタック上の戻りアドレスを jmp_buf に保存された値に書き換えて、単に RET を発行する。 }
そうすると、longjmp からの戻りは、あたかも setjmp から戻って来たかのように見えるのである。この時、いくつかの条件があることを確認しよう。
当然、jmp_buf で保存される実行コンテキストを表す配列は、スタック領域に置くことはほぼ不可能である。普通はグローバル変数領域に置くが、以下に見る「例外の模倣」では malloc して使っている。 戻るべきスタックがすでに無効化していたら（要するに setjmp の if 文によるブロックの外から呼ばれた関数の中で、longjmp が呼ばれたら）、setjmp で戻っても有効に動作を継続できない。 当然、jmp_buf に値がセットされていないのに（言い替えれば setjmp の呼び出し無しに）、longjmp を呼び出せば、結果として全てのレジスタがゼロでクリアされて、即刻セグメンテーションフォルトが起きる。
setjmp/longjmp の利用例〜インタプリタ
よろしいかな？ 少し利用方法について触れておく。やはり goto 文と同様に、このsetjmp/longjmp 機構は、乱用すると著しくソースの可読性を損なう。だから、節度をもって使うことを心がけなくてはならない。一般に良く使われるのは、やはりエラー処理である。筆者はインタプリタが好きなので、大概次のようなコードを書く。
SyntaxTree st ; jmp_buf top ; while ( ( st = getNextSyntaxTree ( ) ) ) { if ( setjmp ( top ) == 0 ) { exec ( st ) ; /* エラーが起きれば、この中で longjmp が呼ばれる */ } else { if ( ErrorCode == STATUS_QUIT ) { break ; } else { /* エラー回復処理 */ } } }
インタプリタというものは、ユーザの入力が頻繁にエラーを引き起こしてくれるものである（これは皆さんもよくご存じだな）。実際に実行を行う exec ( ) では、実に複雑なプログラムが書かれることになるわけで、その多くは再帰関数である。だから、戻り値のチェックでやろうとすると、大変ミスりやすいし、エラー処理を統一的にするのが難しい。だから、こういう場合には setjmp/longjmp 機構を使った方のがソースの可読性を上げ、ミスを未然に回避できる。たとえば、このような longjmp のための関数を作る。
void warining ( int errcode , char * message ) { message_out ( mesasge ) ; ErrorCode = errcode ; longjmp ( top , 1 ) ; } void fatal ( int errcode , char * message ) { /* この中身は warning とほぼ同様 */ }
warning と fatal で分けているのは、可読性のためである。これらは次のように使う。
/* exec ( ) 内部から呼ばれ、割算の処理をする */ SyntaxTree do_divide ( SyntaxTree st ) { int d0 , d1 ; d0 = getFirstNodeAsNumber ( st ) ; /* 第１オペランドを取得（被除数）*/ d1 = getSecondNodeAsNumber ( st ) ; /* 第２オペランドを取得（除数）*/ if ( d1 == 0 ) { /* もし除数が０ならば実行を打ち切る */ warning ( ERROR_DIVISION_BY_0 , " division by 0 " ) ; /* NOTREACHED */ } d0 /= d1 ; /* 割算ができる */ return newNodeByNumber ( d0 ) ; /* 新しい値をセットしたオブジェクトを返す */ }
こうすれば、戻り値には実際に処理で扱うオブジェクトを渡すことができるのである。エラーの値として
NULL を戻すと、それぞれの引数、戻り値の NULL 処理に神経質にならざるを得なくなり、結果として場合分けが増えてソースも読みづらくなる。
ここでコメン ト /* NOTREACHED */ は、知らない人もいるだろうからちょっと注釈しておこう。gcc
では、正確なフロー解析を行い、初期値がセットされていない自動変数を指摘することは皆さんも御承知のことだろう。つまり、プログラムの流れが複雑に分岐していても、それの流れを辿って、すべての場合に変数が正しくセットされるかどうかをチェックしているのである。この時、基本的に関数は戻って来るものとして処理される。呼び出したらそこに戻らずに、どこかに行ってしまう関数は変態であり、そういうライブラリ関数は数少ないが、しかし、そのようなライブラリ関数をラップしたユーザ関数は、任意に作れるからである（warning () なんて良い例だが ...）。この時、「 ユーザ関数 warning ( )
は戻って来ない」ことをコンパイラに伝えてやれないと、フロー解析では戻って来ることを前提にするので、無意味に「初期値がセットされていない」という警告が発生することがある。だから、コメントのかたちで
/* NOTREACHED */ と書いてやると、コンパイラはこのコメントを認識し、このコメントには制御が移らないことを理解する。だからlongjmp
呼び出しをするユーザ関数の呼び出しの後には、このコメントを入れておくべきであるし、また、同様な戻らない関数 exec ( ) などにもこれは有用なわけである。
ちなみにこのようにコンパイラが認識する特殊なコメントとしては、switch 文の FALLTHROUGH を「判って書いている」ことを伝える /* FALLTHROUGH */ があることはご存知かな？
補 追1：setjmp ( ) if 判定文ブロック外から longjmp を呼んでいいの ？
と、最近のことだが、筆者のページをお読みになられた読者のブログで、この問題が取り上げられていた。どうやらその読者は、こういうコードを書いているようだ。
#include < stdio.h > # include < setjmp.h > # include < unistd.h > jmp_buf jb ; ...... if ( setjmp ( jb ) == 0 ) { .......... } else { printf ( " 戻って来たよ ！
" ) ; ...... } } ...... longjmp ( jb , 1 ) ;
で、この問題は実は凄く奥が深い。ちょっと冒険の旅にでかけようか。筆者がこの問題の検証のために書いたコードはこうだ。
#include < stdio.h > # include < setjmp.h > # include < unistd.h > jmp_buf jb ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { { int x = 777 ; if ( setjmp ( jb ) == 0 ) { printf ( " before : %p=%d
" , &argc , x ) ; } else { printf ( " after : %p=%d
" , &argc , x ) ; exit ( 0 ) ; } } { int y = 666 ; longjmp ( jb , 1 ) ; } }
....あれ？何か「 {」が多いぞ...と思われたのではないかと思う。要するに、ここでは「ブロック内変数」を使いたいのである。つまり、ブロック内変数として
x と y とを用意して、それぞれ別な値を持っている。少なくとも高級言語の常識として、こういう書きかたをすれば、x と y とは 「別な変数」に決まっている。コンパイルして実行してみるといい....
$ ./longjmpTest before : 0xbffff0c0=777 after : 0xbffff0c0=666
何たることだ！ ラッキ ー７( 777 ) が獣の数 字 ( 666 ) になってしまった.....高級言語のセマンティクス（意味論）としては、x=777 , y=666 以外の何者でもないはずなのだが、こういう怪奇現象が起きてしまうのである！
これのタネ明かし。こうしてごらん？
{ int y = 666 ; printf ( " y : %p=%d
" , &argc , y ) ; longjmp ( jb , 1 ) ; }
実行結果 は
$ ./longjmpTest before : 0xbffff0c0=777 y : 0 xbffff0c0=666 after : 0xbffff0c0=666
なのである。言い替えると、x と y とはまったく同じメモリ上の位置を示しているのである。この x と y がある場所は、言うまでもなくスタックだ。スタックに着目して、一連の動作を追ってみよう。
たとえば、最初は SP の値が 1000 としようか。 { int x = 777 ; スタック上に変数 x が確保を確保する 。SP を996 にして、領域を確保する。ここで &x = 996 であり、996 〜 999 の ４ byteの領域に 777 の数値が格納される。 if ( setjmp ( jb ) == 0 ) { setjmp ( ) で jb にこの位置の情報を保存する。この時、保存される
SP の値は 996 だ。 } スタックが破棄され、ブロック前の位置の状態に SP の値が戻り 、SP = 1000 となる。しかし、これは SP の値の変動だけのことで、 メモリがクリアされるとか、そういうことはない。 { int y = 666 ; スタック上に変数 y が確保される。先ほどと同様に確保するなら、&y = 996 であり、996 〜 999 の ４ byteの領域に 666 の数値が格納される。これは x と同じだとしても 、Cの文法上では問題はないはずだ。 longjmp ( jb , 1 ) ; longjmp する。そうすると、setjmp ( )
で保存されたスタック情報などが回復される。SP == 996 になる。これも SP の値が変わるだけで、特にスタックの内容が変わるわけではない。&x == &y を確保したスタックの内容（996〜999 ）は、y で上書きされたままである。 printf ( " after : %p=%d
" , &argc , x ) ; ここのコードでは、x のアドレス は 996 だと思っている。つまり、どんな経緯があったかは全然知らずに、単に「今の SP の値と同じ値 」 を「 x のアドレス」と捉えてコンパイルされているのである。だから、コードの上では
x にアクセスしているようでも、この変数 x は y = 666 によって上書きされたスタックを示しているので、y の値を出力してしまう。
要するに 、 「ブロック内変数」を使って見せたのは、これがスタック操作で確保される変数であり、同じ関数内であろうとも、その時どきの
SP の値によって適当な位置に取られるものなのである。計算の都合でスタックを変数代わりに使う最適化もある（レジスタが足りないとそうする）ので、ブロック内変数のような明示的なスタック操作がなくても、同様の現象が起きる可能性があるのである。
これは言い替えるならば、
スタック状態から見て、高い（よく積まれた）位置から、低い（積まれていない）位置へ longjmp するのは安全だが、逆はすでに無効なスタックが復活し、ゴミを拾う可能性がある。
ということなのだ。筆者が 「 あるいは setjmp ( ) の戻り値処理の if 文からも、抜けてはならない」と書いたのは、
if ( setjmp ( jbuf ) == 0 ) { SubFuntions ( ) ; /* このブロック内部の関数では、自由に longjmp を呼べる。 なぜなら、ここでどんなスタック操作をしようとも、setjmp( ) を呼んだ スタック位置から下がることはないからである！ */ } else { /* longjmp によって、戻って来た */ }
..ということなのである。
で更にこの現象を考えてみれば、こういうことになるのではないのだろうか？
高級言語というものは、変数を「メモリ上のどこかに確保される、値の単なる入れ物」として扱うことに最大のメリットがある。それが関数内では不変であることを保証された
BP で参照される引数やローカル変数だろうと、固定したアドレスを付与されるグローバル変数だろうと、あるいは、スタックに相対的に確保されるブロック内変数だろうと、「別な名前で呼べば別なもの」という人間にとって判りやすいルールのもとで、効果的にプログラム開発をするための「考え方」なのである...が、longjmp
を誤用すると、ここらへんの舞台裏が見えてしまい、「別な名前ならば相互に独立！」という大前提が崩壊してしまう...
わけだ。筆者に言わせれば、「 高級言語を使いたいのならば、longjmp( ) を呼ぶのは、setjmp( ) if 判定文の範囲内であるべきだ」というのが結論である。
とはいえ、批判をなさった方の意見によると、筆者の書いた怪奇現象は、
対応するsetjmpマクロの呼出しを含む関数中の、volatile修飾型でない自動記憶域期間をもつオブジェクトの値が、setjmp呼出しとlongjmp呼出しの間に変更された場合に不定となることを除いて、すべてのアクセス可能なオブジェクトはlongjmpが呼び出された時の値を保持する。
の結果である...とご指摘頂いたが、こりゃまあその通りである。がまあ、こういう問題が出る...というのは、やはり特殊体質過ぎるようにも思う。そういう「特殊体質」を避けるための、モデルがやはり「例外のように使おう」という筆者の提言（みたいなもの）の趣旨なんだけどね。
補 追2 : 伝説の COME FROM
じゃあ、まあ思い切って、 「 筆者が良いなんて全然思わな い setjmp/longjmp の使い方」の解説でもしちゃおうか。ただし、面白くないと書いてて詰まらないので、「伝説の
COME FROM 」という話だ。「 COME FROM 」 って聞いたことがあるかな？ GO TO じゃないよ 、COME FROM だ。
Jargon File によると 、COME FROM ってこういうものだ 。
` go to ' と両輪をなす半分架空の言語構文
。COME FROM < ラベル >
とすると参照されたラベルが一種のトラップドアとして働くようになり、プログラムがそのトラップドアに到達すると、制御が黙ってオートマジカルに
COME FROM の次の文に移る 。COME FROM が初めて提唱されたのは 、1973 年の「 Datamation 」誌に掲載された R.L.Clark の 「 A Linguistic Contribution to GOTO - less programming 」 の中でだった。この論文は当時吹き荒れていた「構造化プログラミング」をめぐる聖戦を茶化したものだ。代入型
COME FROM とか計算型 COME FROM という架空のバリエーションもある。同じラベルに基づく複数の
COME FROM 文を用意すれば、当然マルチタスキング（あるいは非決定性）を実現できるはずだ。（中略）COME
FROM は15年たってやっと本来の名前でサポートされたが、それは
C-INTERCAL でだった。見識ある人々は、いまだにショックから立ち直れないでいる。（引用は「ハッカーズ大辞典」(Raymond編：福崎俊博訳)による）
ふーん、やってみようじゃないの。とはいえ、まずはこういうコードから始めよう。
#include < stdio.h > # include < setjmp.h > # include < unistd.h> jmp_buf jb [ 3 ] ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { if ( setjmp ( j b [ 0 ] ) > 0 ) { printf ( " return from longjmp # 1
" ) ; return 1 ; } if ( setjmp ( j b [ 1 ] ) > 0 ) { printf ( " return from longjmp # 2
" ) ; return 1 ; } if ( setjmp ( j b [ 2 ] ) > 0 ) { printf ( " return from longjmp # 3
" ) ; return 1 ; } longjmp ( jb [ 1 ] , 1 ) ; return 0 ; }
筆者は良いとは思わないが、if ( setjmp ( ) ) { } から外れたところで longjmp ( ) を 呼び出すタイプの使い方だ。これだと、longjmp( ) に渡される jmp_buf によって、戻って来る場所が違う...というのはご理解頂けると思う。これにちょっくらマクロをまぶして、セマンティックスを明確にしてやろう。
#include < stdio.h > # include < setjmp.h > # include < unistd.h > # define level_No1 0 # define level_No2 1 # define level_No3 2 jmp_buf jb [ 3 ] ; # define come_from( lab ) if ( setjmp(jb[ level_##lab ] ) > 0 ) /* こんな風に書けたら面白いが出来ない(再帰も気をつけないといけないし... ) # define come_from( lab ) if ( setjmp(jb[ level_##lab ] ) > 0 ) # define lab lab:longjmp( jb[ level_##lab ] ,1 ) ; */ void sub( int n ) ; int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { come_from ( No1 ) { /* No1 タグから 「 来い！ 」 */ printf ( " return from longjmp No1
" ) ; return 1 ; } come_from ( No2 ) { /* No2 タグから 「 来い！ 」 */ printf ( " return from longjmp No2
" ) ; return 1 ; } come_from ( No3 ) { /* No3 タグから 「 来い！ 」 */ printf ( " return from longjmp No3
" ) ; return 1 ; } sub ( 2 ) ; return 0 ; } /* タグが 「 黙ってトラップドアになる 」 */ #define No1 No1:longjmp(jb[level_No1],1 ) ; No1_dummy # define No2 No2:longjmp(jb[ level_No2],1 ) ; No2_dummy # define No3 No3:longjmp(jb[ level_No3 ]
,1 ) ; No3 _dummy void sub ( int n ) { switch ( n ) { case 1 : No1 : /* これが化けるので、 */ printf( " not reach No.1 " ) ; /* 到達しない */ break ; case 2 : No2 : printf ( " not reach No.2 " ) ; break ; case 3 : No3 : printf ( " not reach No.3 " ) ; break ; } }
残念なことに、C プリプロセッサでは不定のマクロを定義する手段（define文の中でddefine を定義する）がないので 、「 COME FROM < ラベル >
とすると参照されたラベルが一種のトラップドアとして働く」というのが素直に実現しにくいのだが、大体こんなもので
COME FROM の雰囲気は味わうことができよう（m4 あたりのプロセッサを噛ませれば出来るが...）。
まあ、そうしてみると、こういう風に複数の jmp_buf を使って、 「それぞれの場合で出口が違う....」というのも書いて書けないわけではないのだが、これってやっぱり「伝説の
COME FROM 」みたいな感覚である。要するに「こうしないために、longjmp()
の第２引数がある」というあたりが実装の意図なんではなかろうか。言い替えると、longjmp( ) の 第２引数の値が、戻った setjmp ( ) の戻り値になる、という仕様は、このような「複数のjmp_bufは使わないように...」という言外の意味を込めているように思う。
あ、勿論これは 「 書きゃ書けるけど ...」という悪ノリで書いたものだ、ということは、ちゃんと認識しておいてくれたかな？
勿論こんなコードは書くべきではない。
「 例外」との関 係
C++ や Java では、このような非ローカル分岐は try 〜catch 構造によ る
「例外」として、文法機能に組み込まれている。そのため、setjmp/longjmp
で気をつけなくてはならなかったような、さまざまな制限事項がコンパイル時に静的にチェックできたり、あるいは動的にチェックできたりしている。
一般に例外は次のかたちを取る。これ が setjmp/longjmp 構造を焼き直したものであることは、もはや皆さんには明らかであろう。
void sub ( ) { ............ throw ( new Exception ( ) ) ; /* 要するに longjmp ( ) */ } int main ( ) { ................ try { /* if ( setjmp ( ) == 0 ) { */ sub ( ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { /* } else { */ /* エラー処理 */ } /* } */ }
しかし、setjmp/longjmp の場合には longjmp ( )
の第二引数で区別してエラー種別を判定することができるに過ぎなかったが、例外の場合には複数の例外オブジェクトがあり、その「投げられた」例外オブジェクトの種類によって、try〜catch 構造が入れ子になっている階層を「
上に辿って」、自分を処理する try 〜catch 構造を見つけ出して、そこにまで「戻る」のである。つまり、実行環境が jmp_buf を統一的に管理し（だから jmp_buf は宣言しない）、try〜catch 構造の階層に合わせた jmp_buf の層を陰で持っているのである。
この jmp_buf の層はどういう風に実現されているのか、と考えれば答えはすぐに出る。「 スタック」である。つまり、try , catch , throw が実際に何をしているのか、は次のようなものである。
try これは、そのブロックがキャッチする例外の種類と jmp_buf をセットにしたデータを作り、 「 例外スタック 」に積む。また、この try ブロックから出る時には、積んだデータを 「 例外スタック」から POP して破棄する。 catch setjmp ( )
の例外時の戻り値（オブジェクト指向では例外オブジェクト）が、自分が扱う例外の種類かどうかをチェックして、一致すれば処理する。一種の if 文である。 throw 例外スタックの上から順に POP していき、それが投げる例外種別と一致するものを探す。それが見つかれば、その jmp_buf を使って longjmp ( ) する。
ちょっとしたトリックとして、以下のプログラムでは「例外スタック」に積まれるオブジェクト
StackEntry は、次のような定義をする。
int kind メンバ 例外種別を表す。しかし、kind == NoException ( 0 ) の時にだけ、次の jmp_buf jmp がセットされている。つまり、その他の例外種別は、単にキャッチする例外種別を表すのみとする。これは、try〜catch ブロック毎に一括して複数の例外ハンドラを廃棄しなければならないし、そのブロックで catch する例外がいくつあるか判らないからである 。
また、kind == Exception ( - 1 ) の時は、ワイルドカードとしてすべての例外種別と一致することにする。 jmp_buf jmp メンバ 上記のように、kind==NoException (0 ) の時にだけセットされている 。
try 〜catch風動作の実現
では、このような例外をＣ言語で模倣してみよう。まず、例外スタックの定義から。これを estack.h というヘッダにしておく。
#include < setjmp.h > /* 念のため include ... */ struct StackEntry { jmp_buf jmp ; /* 実行コンテキスト */ int kind ; /* 例外種別 */ } ; /* 例外種別 */ #define Exception - 1 /* 総称型例外。すべての例外とマッチする */ #define NoException
0 /* マーク用に使い、この時にだけ jmp がセットされている */ #define IOException 1 /* ファイル入出力などのエラーに使おう */ #define ArithmetricException
2 /* Division by 0 に使おう */ #define MyException 3 /* 自分で定義したもの */ /* などなど、投げたい例外種別を定義する
*/ /* プロトタイプ */ struct StackEntry * start_tryBlock ( void ) ; void catch_exception ( int kind ) ; void end_tryBlock ( void ) ; void throw ( int kind ) ;
では例外スタックを定義し、スタックとして操作する下請け関数は次の通り。常識的なスタックのプログラムである。これは estack.c としておこう。また、StackEntry のオブジェクトを作成して返すルーチンも必要だ。ホントは分けた方がいいが、これも突っ込んでおく。
#include < stdio.h > # include < unistd.h > # include < malloc.h > # include " estack.h " # include " estackproto. h " /* このファイルの関数のプロトタイプ（省略） */ #define EXCEPTIONSTACKSIZE
128 static struct StackEntry * ExceptionStack [EXCEPTIONSTACKSIZE ] ; /* 勿論、ホントは可変長配列であるべきである */ static int StackEntrySP = 0 ; int isEStackEmpty ( void ) /* is Empty ( ) 操作 */ { if ( StackEntrySP > 0 ) { return 0 ; } else { return 1 ; } } void EStackPUSH ( struct StackEntry * se ) /* PUSH 操作 */ { ExceptionStack [ StackEntrySP ++ ] = se ; /* ホントは StackOverFlow を処理して、動的に配列を拡大する */ } struct StackEntry * EStackPOP ( void ) /* POP 操作 */ { if ( isEStackEmpty ( ) ) { fprintf ( stderr , " Stack UnderFlow !!!
" ) ; exit( 1 ) ; /* 処理に困る... */ } return ExceptionStack [-- StackEntrySP ] ; } struct StackEntry * newStackEntry ( ) /* 新しい StackEntry オブジェクトを作成 */ { void * ret ; ret = malloc ( sizeof ( struct StackEntry ) ) ; if ( ret == NULL ) { fprintf ( stderr , " cannot malloc StackEntry ! ! ! " ) ; exit( 1 ) ; /* 処理に困る... */ } return ( struct StackEntry *) ret ; }
では、実際に try , catch , throw を模倣するプログラムは次の通り 。
#include < stdio.h > # include < unistd.h > # include < malloc.h > # include < setjmp.h > # include " estack.h " # include " estackproto.h " struct StackEntry * start_try Block ( void ) /* ブロックの開始をマーク */ { struct StackEntry * at = newStackEntry ( ) ; at -> kind = NoException ; /* jmp_buf のセットは後で */ EStackPUSH ( at ) ; return at ; /* 呼び元でやるから、そのために返す */ } void catch_exception ( int kind ) /* catch する例外を登録 */ { struct StackEntry * at = newStackEntry ( ) ; at -> kind = kind ; EStackPUSH ( at ) ; } void end_tryBlock ( void ) /* 結局使わなかった例外スタックを破棄 */ { struct StackEntry * at ; while ( ! isEStackEmpty ( ) ) { at = EStackPOP ( ) ; if ( at -> kind == NoException ) { free ( at ) ; break ; } free ( at ) ; } } void throw ( int kind ) { /* 投げる！！！ */ struct StackEntry * at ; /* まず引数の例外種別を扱う例外スタックエントリを探す */ while ( ! isEStackEmpty ( ) ) { at = EStackPOP ( ) ; if ( at -> kind == kind || at -> kind == Exception ) { free ( at ) ; /* 総称例外は何でも一致 */ break ; } free ( at ) ; } /* POP しながら free していることに注 意 */ /* 扱う例外スタックエントリが見つからない...
トップレベルの処理 */ if ( isEStackEmpty ( ) ) { fprintf ( stderr , " Exception caught by Top Level
" ) ; exit( 1 ) ; /* 終ってしまえ！！ */ } /* さて、そこから実際の jmp_buf の入った NoException を探す */ while ( ! isEStackEmpty ( ) ) { at = EStackPOP ( ) ; if ( at -> kind == NoException ) { break ; } } /* jmp_buf の入った NoException が見当たらない ... 翻訳のバグである */ if ( at -> kind !=
NoException ) { fprintf ( stderr , " Illegal StackEntry !!!
cannot longjmp
" ) ; exit( 1 ) ; } longjmp ( at -> jmp , kind ) ; /* longjmp できる！！ */ }
で、使う場面では次のように翻訳していく。
#include < stdio.h > # include < unistd.h > # include < setjmp.h > # include " estack.h " int sub ( int n ) { if ( n == 0 ) { throw ( MyException ) ; /* ここで投げる */ } else { printf ( " sub : n=%d
" , n ) ; } } int main ( ) { struct StackEntry * se ; int ret ; se = start_try Block ( ) ; /* try -- まず最初のオブジェクト*/ catch_exception ( IOException ) ; /* -- 例外の登録 */ catch_exception ( MyException ) ; if ( ( ret = setjmp ( se-> jmp ) ) == 0 ) { /* { -- setjmp をここでする */ int i ; /* setjmp ( ) からの戻り */ for( i = 10 ; ; i-- ) { sub( i ) ; } end_tryBlock ( ) ; /* } -- 例外スタックの破棄 */ } else { /* longjmp ( ) からの戻り */ free ( se ) ; /* オブジェクトの破棄..
ちょっと変な位置でせざるを得ない */ if ( ret == IOException ) { /* catch ( IOExceptoin e ) { */ printf ( " IOException occured
" ) ; } else if ( ret == MyException ) { /* } catch ( MyExcepiont e ) { */ printf ( " MyException occured
" ) ; } /* } */ } /* この時点では、例外スタックにはもう何も積まれていない */ return 0 ; }
要するに、 「 例外」とは setjmp/longjmp 機構を形式化したものに過ぎないことがおわかりだろう。つまり、goto文を構造化する手段として、if , for , while のような構造化構文が導入されたように、setjmp/longjmp
を 「構造化」するために、「例外」が導入されたと考えてもよいのではないか、と筆者は思っている。筆者は実は setjmp/longjmp 機構も、「例外」機構も大変好きである。皆さんの理解が深まり、一部にある偏見（あるんだよな、これ）が取り除かれんように祈る。（ただし、乱用しちゃいけないよ！）

Crunch time for One Laptop Per Child scheme .
Nicholas Negroponte 's much hyped ' One Laptop Per Child ' ( OLPC ) scheme inspires or infuriates according to taste .
The idea of revolutionizing education by distributing millions of ' $ 100 laptops ' to children in the world 's poorest countries can be seen as Soviet - style social engineering or as visionary California dreaming , mass empowerment or pointless frivolity .
However you see it , though , the project is facing real problems — and competition .
Negroponte , who founded the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and heads the non-profit OLPC Foundation , admitted last week that in the near term the laptops will cost not US $ 100 , but at least $ 175 .
And although he is still confident that the first 3 million machines will be shipped by the end of 2007 , an earlier estimate for the same timeframe was 10 million .
Meanwhile , as PC markets in industrialized nations become saturated , Intel , Microsoft , and other computer companies are turning their sights on developing countries , hoping to find the next billion computer users .
“ We are at the most critical stage of OLPC 's life , ” Negroponte told a meeting with industry analysts in Cambridge , Massachusetts , on 26 April .
“ A year and a half ago , we were selling a dream , but it 's easy to sell dreams if you 're passionate and can share that passion with other people .
But that was dreams , and now we have got to launch . ”
Unique approach
To launch , Negroponte needs money .
OLPC has an unorthodox business model : it sells only to governments and demands minimum orders of 250,000 machines at a time — down from its original demand of one million units .
The idea is to achieve scale instantaneously , and to pass distribution and marketing costs on to the purchaser .
Nicholas Negroponte hopes to get computers to children in developing countries through his One Laptop Per Child scheme .
Credit : M. EULER / AP
How much those extra costs will push the bill up is not clear .
The OLPC project is based on the idea that just providing computers can make a huge difference , as children will spontaneously use them to make up for what they lack in books and other equipment and experiences .
But many education researchers dispute this theory .
And the more that classroom structure and teacher training is needed to maximize the computers ' benefit , the more the programme will end up costing governments .
“ We need classrooms and teachers more urgently than fancy tools . ”
So far no countries have actually paid for their computers , let alone revamped their education efforts to prepare .
Libya has come closest , signing a memorandum of understanding to buy 1.2 million laptops .
Rwanda and Uruguay have said that they are committed to the project , and several other countries have expressed interest .
But some are firmly ruling themselves out .
“ We cannot visualize a situation for decades when we can go beyond the pilot stage , ” Sudeep Banerjee , India 's education secretary , said last year .
“ We need classrooms and teachers more urgently than fancy tools . ”
In March , in an investment report on OLPC and related companies — such as Quanta , the Taiwanese firm contracted to build the foundation 's $ 100 laptop — investment analysts at Merrill Lynch concluded that “ despite the hype , we urge investors not to chase stocks related to OLPC ” .
Low - end laptops can already be made at a cost of $ 400 , the report pointed out , and OLPC 's lower costs come from using less - powerful components and eliminating distribution and after - sales service , both of which impose burdens on the end user .
The report also points out that OLPC is not the only show in town .
Intel is rolling out its $ 400 Classmate PC to schools in Brazil and Mexico this year , and has pilot schemes in 25 other countries .
Over the next 5 years it is investing $ 1 billion to promote access to information technology in developing countries .
Microsoft , loathe to see the next billion computer users running the open - source Linux operating system that the OLPC computers use , last week announced that it would offer developing countries a software package that includes XP and Office for $ 3 for every new school PC bought .
No one denies that the rugged OLPC laptop contains some serious technological innovation .
It runs on just 2 watts of electricity — around a twentieth of a typical laptop 's needs — and can be charged off - grid in various ways .
Its display can be read in bright sunlight , and nearby laptops automatically create a wireless network between themselves with which , among other things , they can share an Internet connection .
Ashok Jhunjhunwala , a former director of the Indian Institute of Technology in Chennai , and one of the India 's top experts in information technology sees the OLPC machine as “ a great technological effort ” .
But “ proper support is a must .
Nothing works without support , management and maintenance ” .
Change in focus
Poor countries have other public spending priorities , Jhunjhunwala argues , and initiatives such as OLPC should start where they can have a real effect — among the market of emerging middle classes and schools that can afford the computers for themselves .
The OLPC will otherwise be irrelevant to developing countries ; in the poorest strata of society “ this toy will just be sold or stolen ” .
Jhunjhunwala himself is the brains behind the netPC and netTV computers built by Novatium , a Chennai - based company , which embraces the idea that PCs no longer need large , expensive hard drives and stacks of memory , but can instead act as gateways to computing power elsewhere on the Internet .
Users are expected to access free web - based word - processing and spreadsheet software and storage , as offered by web services such as Google Office , or to take out a subscription for Microsoft Office and other paying software served over the web by Novartium 's own central servers .
Whatever the future for the OLPC project , the fact that the next billion computer users will be in developing countries looks set to drive a new phase in computing innovation — one that could have repercussions in developed markets too .
Last week , for the first time , Negroponte said that he was considering selling the computers to US children via their state governments , an idea he had previously rejected .
The educational information appliance of the future might turn out to be a mobile telephone , or some sort of hybrid , but no one can rule out Negroponte 's vision of one laptop per child coming true worldwide .
That does not mean , though , that his specific approach will get much further .

Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney spoke out against 2005 ’s Republican - led effort to intervene in the Teri Schiavo case :
TAMPA — He ’s campaigning hard for support from Republican social conservatives , but presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Saturday he disagreed with the government ’s intervention in the Terri Schiavo case .
“ I think it ’s probably best to leave these kinds of matters in the hands of the courts , ” Romney said in a television interview airing today .
Polls showed most voters , including most Republicans , opposed Congress and the Florida Legislature intervening in 2005 to bypass court rulings and force the profoundly brain - damaged Pinellas woman ’s feeding tube to be reinserted .
Romney ’s position puts him at odds with a portion of the Republican base he is courting aggressively and with former Gov. Jeb Bush , many of whose key advisers and Florida donors are backing the former Massachusetts governor .
“ I generally think that it ’s not a good idea for courts to legislate .
Nor is it great idea for legislatures to adjudicate in a specific circumstance , ” Romney said in the taped interview that airs at 11 a.m. on Bay News 9 in the Tampa Bay area .
The study found babies knew what they should be seeing
A team of Israeli and US scientists scanned the brains of 24 babies aged six to nine months as they were shown puppet displays .
The infants looked longer at unexpected outcomes - if there were too many puppets - and their brain activity was like that seen in adults after errors .
The study is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The babies are recognising where things are and where they should be .
Dr Stella Acquarone , British Psychological Society
Previous research has found babies look longer at the unexpected .
But researchers were not certain that meant they were actually surprised by what they saw .
In this study , 24 infants were shown two puppets which were then obscured by a screen .
The babies then saw a hand remove one of the puppets , and the screen was then removed , revealing either one puppet , as would be expected , or two , which would not .
In those situations , the researchers used an electroencephalogram ( EEG ) to measure brainwave patterns through electrical signals from the brain .
Development test
It was found that infants looked for over a second longer when the " incorrect " number of puppets were revealed .
Adults given a similar " correct or incorrect " mathematical presentation showed a faster version of the same response .
Writing in PNAS , the team led by Dr Andrea Berger of Ben Gurion University of Negev , said : " This study demonstrates that this error detection system may be present in the brains of infants and is activated when they are surprised by an incorrect arithmetic solution . "
The researchers said that their work showed babies could detect errors before the end of their first year of life , an ability linked to having the capacity to regulate their behaviour and emotion later on .
Dr Stella Acquarone , a London - based psychologist and member of the British Psychological Society , who specialises in early development , said : " The babies are recognising where things are and where they should be .
" This could be used as a test to ensure this ability is present in babies of this age . "

I have written before about the critical need for Congress to reassert its authority over foreign policy , and for the American people to recognize that the Constitution makes no distinction between domestic and foreign matters .
Policy is policy , and it must be made by the legislature and not the executive .
But what policy is best ?
How should we deal with the rest of the world in a way that best advances proper national interests , while not threatening our freedoms at home ?
I believe our founding fathers had it right when they argued for peace and commerce between nations , and against entangling political and military alliances .
In other words , noninterventionism .
Noninterventionism is not isolationism .
Nonintervention simply means America does not interfere militarily , financially , or covertly in the internal affairs of other nations .
It does not mean that we isolate ourselves ; on the contrary , our founders advocated open trade , travel , communication , and diplomacy with other nations .
Thomas Jefferson summed up the noninterventionist foreign policy position perfectly in his 1801 inaugural address : " Peace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations — entangling alliances with none . "
Washington similarly urged that we must , " Act for ourselves and not for others , " by forming an " American character wholly free of foreign attachments . "
Yet how many times have we all heard these wise words without taking them to heart ?
How many claim to admire Jefferson and Washington , but conveniently ignore both when it comes to American foreign policy ?
Since so many apparently now believe Washington and Jefferson were wrong on the critical matter of foreign policy , they should at least have the intellectual honesty to admit it .
Of course we frequently hear the offensive cliché that , " times have changed , " and thus we cannot follow quaint admonitions from the 1700s .
The obvious question , then , is what other principles from our founding era should we discard for convenience ?
Should we give up the First amendment because times have changed and free speech causes too much offense in our modern society ?
Should we give up the Second amendment , and trust that today 's government is benign and not to be feared by its citizens ?
How about the rest of the Bill of Rights ?
It 's hypocritical and childish to dismiss certain founding principles simply because a convenient rationale is needed to justify interventionist policies today .
The principles enshrined in the Constitution do not change .
If anything , today 's more complex world cries out for the moral clarity provided by a noninterventionist foreign policy .
It is time for Americans to rethink the interventionist foreign policy that is accepted without question in Washington .
It is time to understand the obvious harm that results from our being dragged time and time again into intractable and endless Middle East conflicts , whether in Iraq , Iran , Syria , Lebanon , or Palestine .
It is definitely time to ask ourselves whether further American lives and tax dollars should be lost trying to remake the Middle East in our image .

Click to viewOf all the booth babes we 've ever seen , Samsung wins the all - time prize for this gorgeous body - painted leopard girl , holding court in the Samsung booth so convention goers could test out the company 's digital SLRs .
It turns out every guy in the convention center wanted to test out his own personal equipment on the Samsung jungle set , taking those pics home for later , uh , use .
So with apologies in advance to women 's and animal rights groups , and with our apologies to our heathen gods for all the evil things we want to do to this young leopardess / temptress , we offer you this first photo , with the promise of many more - revealing ones after the jump ( definitely NSFW ) :

At first , the news deflated stock prices on Wall Street .
Investors quickly shook off their worries and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average high enough to come within 11 points of 13,000 — a high point it has never crossed .
But at the close of the trading day stocks finished mixed , with the Dow closing up 34.54 points , to 12,953.94 .
The Realtors association ’s report reflected a housing market that became increasingly unfriendly to those looking to sell their homes last month .
While the number of unsold existing homes for sale fell 1.6 percent in March , to 3,745,000 , it took longer to sell a home .
There was a 7.3 - month supply of unsold properties last month , up from a 6.8 - month supply in February .
The backlog grew even as prices dropped .
The median price of an existing single - family home decreased 0.9 percent last month , to $ 215,300 , compared with a year earlier .
Total sales compared with a year earlier were off 11.3 percent .
“ Because demand is weak , and because inventories remain high , there ’s little ability for prices to rise , ” said Celia Chen , director of housing economics at Moody ’s economy.com .
Ms. Chen speculated that the overall inventory number may have declined last month because sellers were pulling their homes off the market in frustration .
“ The overall trend in housing is still weak , ” she said .
The sharp fall in existing home sales last month was a sign that the increases earlier this year were not in line with the market ’s underlying path .
" Maybe people are finally catching on to me , " said Yankovic , in an interview promoting his five - month " Straight Outta Lynwood " tour , which started this week and comes to the House of Blues Atlantic City at Showboat tomorrow night .

The Symbolic Links Virtual Machine
More obfuscated programming
Typing the following in bash :
will create the Symbolic Links Virtual Machine .
This is a virtual machine whose programs are expressed as directory trees containing nothing but symbolic links .
Note that , apart from the while loop , the only commands used in the above expression are ln and ls .
The following is an implementation of Conway 's Game of Life :

Features and Benefits of Studying History at Assumption
Tyler Cowen at Marginal Revolution asks a good question :
Why is the UK so expensive ?
A loyal MR reader , Erik Alberts , writes : I 've made several trips to the UK in the past few months in preparation and it amazes me how much more things cost there ( in London ) then here in California .
What I 'm trying to understand is why .
I realize that some things like gasoline cost more in the UK due to taxes .
But for other things , it appears that prices in the UK are 40 to 50 % higher .
How would you explain this ?
... I realize that higher taxes and higher labor costs may be factors ( although at my company UK labor is cheaper than it is in California ) , but I find it difficult to believe that this would explain a 50 % difference .
Could this be a sign of currency imbalance like the big mac index , a supply and demand issue , or are UK consumers simply used to paying more ?
I have wondered the same about Switzerland .
The standard explanation is that expensive countries are extremely productive with their tradables ( North Sea oil and London finance ? ) .
That appreciates their exchange rates and renders non-tradables quite dear .
This is the flip side of cheap barbers and prostitutes in Thailand .
But are the Brits really so productive ?
If so , why can't they get both hot and cold water coming out of the same tap ?
And are n't some of the expensive goods tradables rather than non-tradables ?
One factor for sure is that American retailing is the most efficient and most productive in the world .
Perhaps the Brits are especially inept in this regard .
A further factor may be that foreigners , even those who are considering moving , sample British prices in biased fashion .
We see lots of hotel rooms , cab rides , and restaurants .
Fish and chips is still pretty cheap outside of London .
As for Marmite I could not say , but that is exactly the point .
Your preferred consumption basket will always look expensive in another country ; just try getting Ocean Spray grapefruit juice in Western Samoa .
Your thoughts ?
Erik Alberts mentions two obvious candidates : higher taxes and labour costs .
1 . Higher wages :
More expensive living costs and a minimum wage well above the United States is reflected in higher wages .
( Consolation : you do n't have to tip ) .
2 . High sales tax : VAT is 17.5 % , well above what you would pay in most US states .
It 's in the purchase price , so you may not even know it 's there .
Tyler mentions three more :
3 . Strong sterling :
The pound has long been quite buoyant , much to the annoyance of UK manufacturers .
But it is particularly perky at the moment , reflecting both a quite robust British economy and an ailing greenback .
( But the Euro is n't cheap for American tourists either .
If you want your dollars to go further , try Asian countries pegged to the US dollar like China and Hong Kong ) .
4. Retail competition .
I do n't think British retailers are " inept " , as Tyler claims .
But supermarkets account for a smaller market share , because of cultural preference and planning restrictions .
And a country with one - third one - fifth the population obviously wo n't have the same economies of scale as in the US .
So yes , retail margins are often higher , and so are prices .
5. Biased consumption bundle / information asymmetry .
Tourists do indeed " sample British prices in biased fashion " .
But their experience of feeling ' ripped off ' also reflects information asymmetry .
Tourists often catch black cabs or the Underground ( rather than buses , which are half the price ) because they do n't know their way around .
They rely on well - known chains because they do n't realise the shop around the corner sells coffee or sandwiches for half the price of Starbuck's .
They pay far too much for mediocre restaurant meals .
Local knowledge saves money and time .
All of these are true .
But while high wages , high sales taxes and a strong currency all matter , the biggest single factor is almost certainly property prices .
6. Property prices : Tourists visiting London tend to cluster around Zone 1 in central London , where property prices are higher than Manhattan ( thanks to height limits , heritage listing and other restrictions ) .
The result ?
Very expensive hotels ( by US standards ) , and retailers paying eye - bleeding rentals - which they inevitably pass onto you and I .
Three other factors are also worth mentioning :
7. Transport .
In Britain it invariably takes longer or costs more to get to your destination than it should .
Britain has fewer roads and trains than the rest of Europe ; the result can be road congestion and exorbitant train fares .
Many Britons find it easier and cheaper to holiday abroad than in their own country .
Moaning about the transport system is a national past time .
Incredibly , some now look back on the once - despised British Rail with nostalgia .
8. Weak consumerism .
British consumers are used to being mistreated , lied to and cheated ( think Basil Fawlty ) .
What surprises many American visitors is how seldom locals make a fuss about bad service or poor quality goods .
Consumer law and advocacy is weaker than in the US - fraud is widespread , enforcement can be patchy , and class actions are not allowed .
Financial fraud is called ' mis - selling ' , as if it were just an accident !
We have no Ralph Naders .
9. Inequality .
London has more of the world 's super - rich than anywhere else on the planet , and it shows .
Luxury goods and services abound .
The place is full of chauffeurs waiting around , ' ladies who lunch ' , Arabs spending up big , and City boys who think nothing of paying US $ 200 for a meal and drinks .
Many Londoners are not price conscious ; they 're willing to spend a lot for positional goods .
That affects prices .
Sadly , it also means paying a lot wo n't guarantee good quality .
My advice to visitors to London ?
First , take the time to do some research .
For hotels , TripAdvisor is generally reliable - you may not find the best hotel in London , but you will certainly avoid some of the worst .
As for food , either ask a local , or try Square Meal or London Eating .
And be on the alert for thieves and con artists .
Enjoy your stay !

Why suicide attackers have n't hit U.S. again By Rick Hampson , USA TODAY NEW YORK 
After the bombings in London and Sharm el - Sheik , Egypt , the question that rivets America is one that has no sure answer :
Why have n't Muslim militants executed another suicide terror attack on the U.S. home front ?

If suicide bombers can strike daily in the Middle East and hit the capitals of Europe , why does 9/11 remain a spectacular exception ?
There are theories about why the United States still has n't had a homegrown attack like the ones last month in London .
Suicide bombing is n't that easy .
The USA is n't that vulnerable .
American Muslims are n't that militant .
Foreign terrorists are n't focused , not yet , on a domestic strike .
Over the past four years , Jeremiahs as varied as Dick Cheney and Osama bin Laden have said another attack is inevitable .
It could come at any time , and it could come from within ; homegrown suicide terrorists are notoriously difficult to identify before they strike .
Robert Pape , a University of Chicago political scientist who has studied suicide terrorists , says most are " walk - in volunteers who decide to do it only months beforehand .
They 're not long - term criminals you can track . "
He cites the July 7 London bombers — wage earners , family men , cricket fans and , apparently , suicides .
Contrary to popular stereotype , most are not poor , ill - educated , disturbed or disconnected .
Suicide terrorists are men and women , young and old , rich and poor , educated and ignorant .
If anything , they tend to be relatively well off and , to outward appearances , well adjusted .
Mohamed Atta , ringleader in the Sept. 11 attacks , was a college graduate and the son of a lawyer .
" There is no accurate criminal profile for them .
Anyone who tells you differently is trying to get on TV , " says Mia Bloom , author of Dying to Kill , a study of suicide terror .
" And if we had a profile , the terrorists would learn about it and use it against us . "
The other explanations — not all reassuring and not all compatible — for why there 's been no repeat of Sept. 11 include the following : • Suicide terror takes a team .
Such attacks in the Middle East usually are executed by a group that recruits the bomber , gets the explosives , builds the bomb , surveys the target and gets the bomber there undetected .
Sometimes there 's even a video crew .
But the USA lacks such a " suicide terrorist infrastructure , " says Bloom , a University of Cincinnati political scientist .
There 's no cottage industry in " suicide belts , " as on the West Bank , where such a package of wearable explosives goes for less than $ 200 .
To the contrary , police in the New York City area visit chemical and demolition suppliers to ask about large purchases of explosives by new customers .
Home Depot stores automatically tell authorities about any sale of more than 500 pounds of fertilizer , which can be used to make bombs .

The United States has assimilated immigrant Muslims more successfully than Western Europe , where there is a higher proportion of poor , alienated Muslims , according to Ahmed Bedier of the Council on American - Islamic Relations .
American Muslims seem to have more of a stake in keeping peace .
" No one wants to attack their own people , " Bedier says .
" Muslims here see themselves as Americans more than Muslims in France see themselves as French . "
Last week a council of leading American Muslim scholars issued an edict condemning those who commit terrorism in the name of Islam as " criminals , not ' martyrs . ' " Bloom , who has worked with the New Jersey Office of Counter - Terrorism , says the state 's Arab and Muslim communities are " hotbeds of dissent .
But they 're not taking it to the next level .
When a rabble - rouser comes to a mosque , he 's met with a great deal of resistance .
People in that community say ( to the authorities ) , ' Please come get this person . ' " Example : Last August , police charged two Muslims — one the American son of an Egyptian man , the other an illegal immigrant from Pakistan — with conspiring to bomb the Herald Square subway station .
The suspects came to the attention of the New York police intelligence unit through tips from Brooklyn's Islamic community .
Bedier says an experience last month left him modestly optimistic about relations between Muslims and non-Muslims .
He stopped his car outside a house in Pinellas Park , Fla. , that had a toilet in the front yard and a sign : " Koran flushing , 1 p.m . "
Bedier , 31 , a native of Egypt , asked the homeowner , Mike Allen , what he was trying to say .
Allen invited him inside , where he complained that Muslim Americans were not condemning terrorism .
Bedier went to his car , got his laptop , and showed Allen what his own group had done .
After a long talk , they parted amicably .
" He realized we have the same issue , " Bedier says .
" We 're both against terrorism . "
Allen told the St. Petersburg
Times that he had taken down the display because Bedier was " so nice . "
Tom Ridge , the former homeland security secretary , points out , however , that it might not take a team : " You do n't need too many committed to martyrdom to wreak havoc . "
• The U.S. homeland is better protected .
America has become a land scoured , probed , patrolled and fenced by a web of informers , computers , guards , spies , tape recorders , detectors , sensors , Jersey barriers , concrete planters and bomb - sniffing dogs .
It may have nipped some plots in the bud and deterred others .
" We look differently as a country now to the terrorists , " Ridge says .
" We have created security measures unlike the terrorists have seen before , and we continue to upgrade them . "
In New York City , for instance , the police department has increased its counterterrorism squad from a few dozen officers to about a thousand .
People who run parking garages , marinas and hunting stores routinely report anything unusual .
Arabic , Pashto and Urdu- speakers , working with law enforcement authorities , monitor online chat and chatter on the airwaves .
" I do n't want to give a sense of false security , " says Pape , author of a new book on suicide terrorism , Dying to Win , " but right now we 're doing pretty well . "
• Al - Qaeda Central is dead .
Since 9/11 , the world 's most notorious terrorist organization has lost its headquarters and training centers in Afghanistan .
Most of its leaders are dead , in prison or on the run .
Time and energy once devoted to elaborate terror attacks are spent staying alive and at large .
Al - Qaeda has become less of an organization and more of a movement , Pape says .
Sometimes there 's coordination among leaders , or among leaders and followers .
Sometimes things percolate from the bottom up .
" The old centralized al - Qaeda is gone , " agrees Bloom .
" It 's become more like a franchise operation . "
But terrorists do n't always need directions from the home office .
Last week a screen at a news media briefing at New York City police headquarters bore a list of lessons learned from the London bombings .
No. 1 : " This Can Happen Here . "
As Commissioner Ray Kelly put it , " The recipe to make a bomb , unfortunately , is as available on the Internet as a recipe for meat loaf . "
• Bin Laden is patiently planning another blockbuster .
The man who brought down the World Trade Center likes to bide his time .
If this is a struggle of centuries , as bin Laden has argued , what are four years ?
Eight years elapsed between attacks on the Trade Center .
Ridge says that could explain why al - Qaeda has n't struck again — " they 're just not ready . "
" That they would attack again soon after 9/11 was our expectation , not their expectation , " Bloom adds .
" If they wanted to send a guy into Wal - Mart with an AK - 47 , they could have a long time ago .
But usually they wait until they can do something shocking , maybe three or four simultaneous attacks .
You need time to do that . "
Intelligence gathered after the invasion of Afghanistan stoked the U.S. government 's fear of smaller suicide attacks on " soft " domestic targets such as shopping malls .
By late 2003 , however , information indicated a new focus on one spectacular plot .
The detonation of a radioactive or " dirty " bomb in a suitcase in Times Square would panic the entire metro area .
In minutes , the years of seeming immunity would be forgotten .
• Muslim terrorists are focused on U.S. allies in Europe and U.S. troops in Iraq .
In 2002 - 03 , Australians and Europeans whose nations had troops in Afghanistan or Iraq became al - Qaeda 's most frequent suicide attack targets .
This was before the Madrid train bombings last year , and the attacks on the London transit system and the Egyptian resort last month .
Pape , who has charted the hundreds of suicide bombings worldwide since 1980 , says al - Qaeda even put its current strategy in writing .
In 2003 , a Norwegian intelligence agency discovered what appeared to be an al - Qaeda planning document on a radical Islamic Web site .
It said direct attacks on America would be insufficient to compel U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and recommended attacks on its European allies to get them to withdraw their forces — thereby increasing the burden on the United States .
Specifically mentioned : Britain and Spain .
The other focus of suicide terrorism is Iraq .
From a would - be martyr 's perspective , what 's better than killing a " crusader ? "
The Iraq war , Pape argues , inflames al - Qaeda 's real dispute with the West — the presence of " infidel " troops in Arabia .
It 's also an effective way to tie down the United States in an unpopular war — a view bin Laden himself expressed in a videotape released before the 2004 election .
Bin Laden 's strategy effectively dovetails with the Bush administration 's , which is to take the war on terrorism to the enemy by fighting over there instead of back here .
Most suicide bombers in Iraq are not Iraqis , Pape says , suggesting that the war may be sucking up the supply of international suicide bombers .
But Pape and Bloom say that by inflaming Muslim sensibilities , the war will only create more suicide bombers .
The war , Bloom says , is " less a flame drawing the moths than a chrysalis in which many more are being created . "
• We 've been lucky .
Ridge speculated last year that the homeland 's post - 9/11 immunity from terror attack may simply have been luck .
Bloom says there has been luck — certain clues and leads .
But she does n't believe in luck " if it means that if there 's another attack , we were just unlucky .
If there 's another attack , it means we messed up . "

Falluja suffered great damage during the offensive
" It was used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants , " spokesman Lt Col Barry Venable told the BBC - though not against civilians , he said .
The US had earlier said the substance - which can cause burning of the flesh - had been used only for illumination .
BBC defence correspondent Paul Wood says having to retract its denial is a public relations disaster for the US .
Col Venable denied that white phosphorous constituted a banned chemical weapon .
White phosphorus is an incendiary weapon , not a chemical weapon
Col Barry Venable
Pentagon spokesman US military interview
Washington is not a signatory to an international treaty restricting the use of the substance against civilians .
The US state department had earlier said white phosphorus had been used in Falluja very sparingly , for illumination purposes .
Col Venable said that statement was based on " poor information " .
' Incendiary '
The US - led assault on Falluja - a stronghold of the Sunni insurgency west of Baghdad - displaced most of the city 's 300,000 population and left many of its buildings destroyed .
Col Venable told the BBC's PM radio programme that the US army used white phosphorus incendiary munitions " primarily as obscurants , for smokescreens or target marking in some cases .
" However it is an incendiary weapon and may be used against enemy combatants . "
WHITE PHOSPHORUS
Spontaneously flammable chemical used for battlefield illumination Contact with particles causes burning of skin and flesh Use of incendiary weapons prohibited for attacking civilians ( Protocol III of Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons ) Protocol III not signed by US
Rai interview
And he said it had been used in Falluja , but it was a " conventional munition " , not a chemical weapon .
It is not " outlawed or illegal " , Col Venable said .
He said US forces could use white phosphorus rounds to flush enemy troops out of covered positions .
" The combined effects of the fire and smoke - and in some case the terror brought about by the explosion on the ground - will drive them out of the holes so that you can kill them with high explosives , " he said .
San Diego journalist Darrin Mortenson , who was embedded with US marines during the assault on Falluja , told the BBC's Today radio programme he had seen white phosphorous used " as an incendiary weapon " against insurgents .
However , he " never saw anybody intentionally use any weapon against civilians " , he said .
' Particularly nasty '
White phosphorus is highly flammable and ignites on contact with oxygen .
If the substance hits someone 's body , it will burn until deprived of oxygen .
Globalsecurity.org , a defence website , says : " Phosphorus burns on the skin are deep and painful ...
These weapons are particularly nasty because white phosphorus continues to burn until it disappears ... it could burn right down to the bone . "
A spokesman at the UK Ministry of Defence said the use of white phosphorus was permitted in battle in cases where there were no civilians near the target area .
But Professor Paul Rogers , of the University of Bradford 's department of peace studies , said white phosphorus could be considered a chemical weapon if deliberately aimed at civilians .
He told PM : " It is not counted under the chemical weapons convention in its normal use but , although it is a matter of legal niceties , it probably does fall into the category of chemical weapons if it is used for this kind of purpose directly against people . "
When an Italian TV documentary revealing the use of white phosphorus in Iraq was broadcast on 8 November it sparked fury among Italian anti-war protesters , who demonstrated outside the US embassy in Rome .

If you ’re a schemer , expressing iteration by means of tail - recursion and named lets has probably become second - nature to you .
I find this idiom both natural and elegant , but as Olin Shivers points out in his DanFest presentation below , it has some drawbacks .
For instance , the code in a typical named let will work only for a given sequence type ( e.g. , a vector or a list ) ; and , as Olin explains , its ‘ goto - nature ’ does not mix well with lexical scope .
In other words , tail - recursive schemy iteration is too low - level and , according to Olin , a higher - level abstraction hiding details and providing a modular interface and proper lexical scope is called for .
In his presentation , he outlines his solution to this problem , which , as you will see , amounts to defining a looping domain - specific language ( actually , a couple of them ) .
A more detailed explanation is given in his paper The Anatomy of a Loop .
As an extra , the first few minutes of the video below will get you acquainted with the mysterious Dan effect .
But Olin ’s is not the only solution to looping in scheme .
Alex Shinn wrote and excellent survey on Scheme iteration methods in his Yow ! LOOP macros are LOOPY ! , which discusses at length current approaches to solve the problems mentioned above ( like srfi - 42 eager comprehensions or Jonathan Amsterdam ’s iterate macro ) .
For extra fun ,
Alex includes implementations for most of the loop constructs he reviews , a good way of improving your macro programming .
( Also worth reading in this context are Oleg Kiselyov ’s thoughts on collection traversal APIs , where he draws a clear distinction between enumerators ( such as scheme ’s for - each or fold ) and cursors ( such as C++ iterators , i.e. , objects maintaining internally the “ current element ” of the collection being traversed ) .
As you will see , he makes a pretty good case for enumerators . )
So , you see , there ’s many a way to loop a cat !
High Switching Costs : Porter defines switching costs as a barrier to entry that involves the one - time inconvenience or expense a buyer incurs to change over from one product or service to another .
Buyers in these cases often need a big improvement in either price or performance to make the switch to another product worthwhile .
Medical - device companies Biomet and Stryker benefit from high switching costs because , for example , a surgeon would have have to forgo the comfort and familiarity of doing procedures with one artificial joint product .
And because the surgeon would have to be trained to use competing products , he or she would also have to contend with lost time and money resulting from not performing as many surgical procedures .
The Network Effect :
The network effect occurs when the value of a particular good or service increases for both new and existing users as more people use that good or service .
It can also occur when other firms design products that compliment an existing product , thereby enhancing that product ’s value .
For example , the fact that there are literally millions of people using eBay is the thing that both makes eBay ’s service incredibly valuable and makes it all but impossible for another company to duplicate its service .
Intangible Assets : Intangible assets generally refer to the intellectual property that firms use to prevent other companies from duplicating a good or service .
Of course , patents are the most common economic moat in this category .
In techland , Qualcomm ’s patents give it a strong moat in the cellphone industry … A strong brand name can also be an economic moat — just consider consumer - product companies like Coca - Cola and Gillette .

KIEV ( Reuters ) -
An explosion destroyed a 30 - metre section of the trunk gas pipeline taking Russian gas across Ukraine to Europe on Monday , but Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom said flows of gas had not been affected .
A spokesman for Ukraine ’s Emergencies Ministry initially said the blast had stopped the flow of gas along to Europe , which gets a quarter of its gas from Russia , but another spokesman later said a by - pass pipeline had come on stream and gas flows to Europe were unaffected .
Gazprom said it was fully meeting its obligations to supply customers and its gas flows via Ukraine had not been disrupted .
Emergencies Ministry spokesman Oleksander Trigub said the blast occurred at 2:25 p.m. ( 12:25 p.m. British time ) on the trunk pipeline to Europe , near the village of Luka .
The pipeline takes gas from Urengoi in Russia via Pomary to Uzhgorod on the border with Slovakia .
The cause of the explosion has yet to be determined .
“ There was a powerful explosion that destroyed 30 metres of the pipeline .
The line is closed down for now .
A fire broke out , but it is no longer burning .
There are no casualties and no threat to local residents , ” Trigub said by telephone .
“ The line is not operating .
You can imagine what 30 metres of destroyed pipeline means .
I cannot say how long it will take to restore the flow of gas . ”
According to the latest MSNBC / Newsweek poll , George W. Bush has the worst approval rating of any President since Jimmy Carter , and he ’s holding the entire GOP Presidential field back :
May 5 , 2007 – Itâ€™s hard to say which is worse news for Republicans : that George W. Bush now has the worst approval rating of an American president in a generation , or that he seems to be dragging every â€™08 Republican presidential candidate down with him .
But According to the new NEWSWEEK
Poll , the publicâ€™s approval of Bush has sunk to 28 percent , an all - time low for this president in our poll , and a point lower than Gallup recorded for his father at Bush Sr.â€™s nadir .
The last president to be this unpopular was Jimmy Carter who also scored a 28 percent approval in 1979 .
This remarkably low rating seems to be casting a dark shadow over the GOPâ€™s chances for victory in â€™08 .
The NEWSWEEK Poll finds each of the leading Democratic contenders beating the Republican frontrunners in head - to - head matchups .
Just as Carter ’s downfall was the Iranian Hostage Crisis , it seems that the Iraq War , which remains increasingly unpopular among all segments of the public , is Bush ’s downfall and he ’s dragging the Republican Party down with him .
Even William F. Buckley , Jr , the conservatives conservative , had this to say about the Administration ’s Iraq policy and it ’s impact on the party :
[ B] eyond affirming executive supremacy in matters of war , what is George Bush going to do ?
It is simply untrue that we are making decisive progress in Iraq .
The indicators rise and fall from day to day , week to week , month to month .
In South Vietnam there was an organized enemy .
There is clearly organization in the strikes by the terrorists against our forces and against the civil government in Iraq , but whereas in Vietnam we had Hanoi as the operative headquarters of the enemy , we have no equivalent of that in Iraq , and that is a matter of paralyzing importance .
All those bombings , explosions , assassinations : we are driven to believe that they are , so to speak , spontaneous .
(…) General Petraeus is a wonderfully commanding figure .
But if the enemy is in the nature of a disease , he cannot win against it .
Students of politics ask then the derivative question :
How can the Republican party , headed by a president determined on a war he canâ€™t see an end to , attract the support of a majority of the voters ?
General Petraeus , in his Pentagon briefing on April 26 , reported persuasively that there has been progress , but cautioned , â€ œI want to be very clear that there is vastly more work to be done across the board and in many areas , and again I note that we are really just getting started with the new effort.â€ 
The general makes it a point to steer away from the political implications of the struggle , but this can not be done in the wider arena .
There are grounds for wondering whether the Republican party will survive this dilemma .
Some will say that Buckley is being overly dramatic , and he probably is .
The Iraq War may not bring about the end of the Republican Party as an organized entity , but it could very well force it into the same kind of permanent minority status that it saw in the aftermath of the Great Depression .
From 1932 until 1952 , not a single Republican was elected President and , even then , it was n’t a GOP politician who won but a war hero .
Politically , though , the lesson is clear .
Republican candidates will suffer at the poll to the extent they are associated with the policies of George W. Bush .
Eventually , some enterprising , charismatic Republican somewhere is going to see an opportunity in that fact .
President Bush ,
It has become extremely difficult to give you the benefit of the doubt on Lebanon , for you have left no doubt in our minds .
We are now certain — like many of us have always been — that your foreign policy is completely biased towards Israel , and you have made no effort to hide this fact .
Just out of curiosity : are they also drafted in Tel Aviv ?
It is your choice , Mr Bush , to support Israel , just like it is our — the entire Arab and Muslim world ’s — choice to support Lebanon .
You insist that Israel has the right to defend itself .
Defending oneself , I believe , is a universal right , not exclusive to Israel .
" The first Qana massacre did not quench the Israeli thirst for blood , " it is said , graphically describing yet another Israeli crime against the innocents of Lebanon .
In Qana , 57 armless , defenseless civilians died in an Israeli air strike , 37 of them were children .
Maybe these numbers do n’t matter to you , Mr Bush ; they are mere numbers of the nameless Lebanese dead .
But they matter to more than 200 million Arabs in the Middle East .
I quote our late president , Shaikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan , who in 1973 had said , " Arab oil is not dearer than Arab blood . "
But it seems that Iraqi oil is dearer than American blood .
I am somewhat relieved to arrive at this conclusion .
At least there ’s no racism against a certain group of people .
Everybody is a potential sacrifice to secure US interests , even if it means sacrificing a whole nation .
No , Mr Bush , we will not accept , nor will we allow the sacrifice of more Lebanese civilians .
A ceasefire should have been enforced two weeks ago .
Was there a need for 37 children to die before you decided it was time for a ceasefire ?
How many more , Mr Bush , should die before you decide to stop sending those bloody weapons to Israel ?
Perhaps we can afford a sacrifice that will rein in your generosity towards Israel permanently .
We have a dream for a new Middle East .
Not the " New Middle East " that you ’ve been brainstorming in your Oval Office .
It is the new Middle East that Middle Easterners have been dreaming of ; a Middle East with no violence , and no US - made weapons to fuel that violence .
It is a dream only we , Middle Easterners , are allowed to dream and realise it .
In Arabic we have a saying that goes , " They murder the murdered and walk in his funeral . "
Allow me to interpret this for you , Mr Bush : Your precision - guided missiles shipment has arrived in Tel Aviv .
These missiles will " precisely " fall onto Lebanese villages ; kill hundreds ; and displace thousands more .
( Evidently , we ’ve just witnessed the first " precise " target in Qana . )
Yet you have " compassionately " been able to send aid to Beirut , at the same time , with supplies for the thousands of people directly and fatally affected by your vocal , ( im ) moral and military support for Israel .
Please include US flags in your aid shipment to Beirut ; they must have burned all the US flags in stock .
Mr Bush , Lebanon can and will be rebuilt , but lost lives cannot be restored .
Your credibility and your government ’s credibility have long been lost — irretrievably lost like those lost innocent lives .
People will not forget this though .
They will not turn the other cheek ; they will retaliate — just like you had chosen to retaliate after 9/11 .
Retaliation is a value you have successfully promoted by putting it into practice , always .
I was born too late to see how the British Empire had collapsed , but right on time to see how the American Empire is falling apart .
Mr Bush ,
You will surely be remembered in history for hastening that process .
With no more respect to offer ,

On February 6 , 2003 , lobbyist Jack Abramoff sent an email to his former executive assistant Susan Ralston , who had since gone on to work for Karl Rove , requesting that she pass along an important message to her boss .
A Louisiana Indian tribe , the Jena band of Choctaws , was seeking to acquire land for a casino , a project at odds with the interests of Abramoff ’s tribal clients who feared it would siphon business from their own gaming establishments .
Abramoff wanted Rove to intercede and “ to get some quiet message from the WH [ White House ] that this is absurd . ”
After Ralston agreed to pass along word , Abramoff replied to thank her .
But he slipped up .
Instead of responding to an email account administered by the Republican National Committee ( sralston@georgewbush.com ) as he had intended , he sent the message to Ralston ’s White House address .
The following day Abramoff was alerted to his error by a colleague , Kevin Ring , who ’d spoken to a White House official to whom Abramoff ’s request had been forwarded .
“ She said it is better to not put this stuff in writing in their email system because it might actually limit what they can do to help us , especially since there could be lawsuits , etc. , ” Ring wrote .
Abramoff responded swiftly : “ Dammit .
It was sent to Susan on her rnc [ Republican National Committee ] pager and was not supposed to go into the WH system . ”
The significance of this intriguing exchange , which was among thousands of emails reviewed by investigators for the House Government Reform Committee as part of an extensive investigation into Abramoff , might have gone unrecognized had it not been for another scandal , this one involving the abrupt firings of eight U.S. Attorneys .
As the controversy intensified in early March and hearings were held , the Department of Justice was forced to release thousands of documents , including email exchanges between Alberto Gonzales ’ chief of staff Kyle Sampson , who resigned in mid-March , and Rove deputy J. Scott Jennings .
Here too was evidence that White House officials were conducting business using RNC email accounts , domains such as gwb43.com and rnchq.org .
But why ?
For one , as Abramoff was attempting to do , it is a way of bypassing the White House server and skirting its automatic archiving function , insuring that potentially damaging or incriminating emails will not be preserved for posterity by the National Archives , or worse , come to light through the efforts of a federal prosecutor or congressional investigator .
In a March 15 letter to Henry Waxman ’s Government Reform Committee , the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington noted that this practice might violate the 1978 Presidential Records
Act , which governs how the papers of presidents and their staffs are to be preserved , and urged an investigation .
“ This refreshed our memory about what we ’d seen in the Abramoff emails , ” says one Waxman aide .
A little over a week later , Waxman ’s Committee fired off its own letters to Mike Duncan , chairman of the Republican National Committee , and Marc Racicot , the former chair of the president ’s reelection committee , demanding that they preserve White House emails on their organization ’s servers “ because of their potential relevance to congressional investigations ” — ” multiple ” investigations the letter stressed .
“ The e-mail exchanges reviewed by the Committee provide evidence that in some instances , White House officials were using the nongovernmental accounts specifically to avoid creating a record of the communications . ”
( According to the Waxman aide , Duncan and Racicot have yet to respond . )
Steven Aftergood , the director of the Federation of American Scientists ’ project on government secrecy , says the use of RNC email accounts is interesting for another reason .
“ It shows how closely intertwined the White House is with its partisan allies , ” he says .
“ The fact that the White House and the RNC are working hand in hand and White House officials are using RNC emails is itself remarkable . ”
He added , “ Iran - Contra is getting invoked a lot these days and this may be another parallel , where the famous White House emails were recovered even after they were deleted from the White House server .
People may have learned that lesson . ”
Oliver North certainly did .
Back in 1986 , when most people had not even heard of email and the government ’s email system was still known as PROFS ( Professional Office System ) , he and John Poindexter attempted to purge their hard drives of electronic communications related to Iran - Contra .
( “ We all sincerely believed that when we send a PROFS message to another party and pressed the button ‘ delete ’ that it was gone forever .
Wow , were we wrong , ” North later remarked after his incriminating messages were resurrected . )
In 1993 then - National Archivist Don Wilson inked a secret agreement with George H.W. Bush in the final hours of his presidency giving him sole control over his administration ’s computer records .
( Wilson went on to become the executive director of Bush ’s presidential library ; a federal court later declared their agreement unconstitutional . )
Years later , with the embattled Clinton administration faced with numerous allegations of impropriety , including charges that it had illegally obtained FBI files on prominent Republicans for political purposes — this controversy became known as Filegate — a
White House whistleblower came forward claiming that the administration had suppressed 100,000 emails related to ongoing investigations .
Sheryl Hall , who helped to supervise the computer system in the Clinton White House , reported being told by a colleague that “ if the contents of these e-mails became known , that there would be different outcomes to these scandals , as the e-mails were incriminating and could cause people to go to jail . ”
Congressional Republicans , then in the majority , cast the alleged cover - up as a worse scandal than Watergate , concluding in a report by the House Government Reform Committee that “ the e-mail matter can fairly be called the most significant obstruction of congressional investigations in U.S. history . ”
( Democrats , led by Henry Waxman , fired back with their own report , which noted , among other things , that “ this Committee has a long history of making unsubstantiated allegations . ” )
In general , past administrations , Democratic and Republican , have chafed at the prospect of turning over their records , per the Presidential Records Act , says Bruce Montgomery , the director of the University of Colorado at Boulder ’s archives and an expert on presidential papers .
“ No president since Carter , who signed the Presidential Records Act into law , has looked kindly on that statute .
Carter did not want the Presidential Records
Act to apply to him .
The Carter Justice Department saw it as a breach of the separation of powers . ”
In 1985 , a young lawyer working in the Reagan White House questioned the constitutionality of the law in a memo to his boss , White House counsel Fred Fielding , who is currently reprising that role in the Bush administration .
That lawyer , John Glover Roberts Jr. , who we know as Chief Justice Roberts , noted that the “ existence of the Act serves to burden the full and frank exchange of advice . ”
That advice , he argued , “ is protected by the constitutionally based doctrine of executive privilege . ”
He fretted , however , that it was too early to mount a constitutional challenge .
That would have to wait until 2001 , when , after the 12 - year waiting period outlined in the law , the first batch of Reagan - era documents would be released .
When that moment arrived , scarcely a year into President Bush ’s first term , the president signed a controversial executive order that , among other things , claims broad authority to review and block the release of presidential papers and extends executive privilege to the heirs of the officeholder and to the Vice President .
The order was met with outrage by archivists and historians , some of whom argue that this statute effectively gives the administration the power to write its own history .
“ This is very much pre-Nixon in the sense that they want presidents and their families to control what people see and what they cannot see , what history they can write and what history they cannot write , ” says Montgomery , the presidential papers expert .
“ They want to manage their own historical legacy . ”
John Carlin , the former governor of Kansas who served as the national archivist from 1995 to 2005 , says the administration ’s expansion of executive privilege “ was probably the major issue where we as an agency disagreed with the White House . ”
Carlin , who was asked to resign from the National Archives in December 2003 by then - White House counsel Alberto Gonzales , no explanation given , says his agency was granted ample opportunity to object to the directive , but , in the end , “ We said our piece and they made their decision . ”
The president ’s executive order has long been the subject of bi-partisan concern in Congress and , in March , legislation passed the House that would essentially revoke it .
But even before the measure could come to a vote , the White House issued a veto threat , writing in a Statement of Administration Policy that “ executive privilege is not subject to Congressional regulation , but rather arises directly from the Constitution itself . ”
In this context , the news that at least some White House officials are using alternate email accounts to avoid creating an official record of their communications seems to fit a broader pattern .
But in many ways , says Steven Hensen , the past president of the Society of American Archivists and the technical director of Duke University ’s archives , this practice seems “ a bit more devious . ”
“ It clearly looks like an attempt to conceal official business , ” he says .
Asked about the use of RNC email accounts during a press briefing on March 27 , White House spokesperson Dana Perino played down this unusual practice .
“ What I know — I checked into this — is that certain White House officials and staff members who have responsibilities that straddle both worlds , that have responsibilities in communication , regularly interface with political organizations , do have a separate email account for those political communications .
That is entirely appropriate , especially when you think of it in this case , that the practice is in place and followed precisely to avoid any inadvertent violations of what is called the Hatch Act … .
Under an abundance of caution so that they do n’t violate the Hatch Act , they have these separate emails . ”
She added that “ people are encouraged , on official White House business , to use their official White House accounts . ”
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activity while on the job .
But , according to two lawyers I spoke with , both of them well versed in the details of that law , this rationale does n’t entirely hold water .
A lawyer who works for the Office of Special Counsel , the agency charged with investigating Hatch Act violations , told me that Senate - confirmed presidential appointees as well as staffers whose salaries are paid from an appropriation for the Executive Office of the President are exempt from some of the strictures of that law and are allowed to engage in political activity .
( No federal employee , however , is allowed to fundraise on the job , or solicit or discourage the political activity of people with business before their agencies . )
And even if they were n’t exempt , simply using a non-government email account would n’t make any difference , the lawyer explained .
“ Using my personal account or some other email account that ’s not a federal email account would not remove me from the prohibition if I ’m still either on duty or in a federal building . ”
Perino ’s explanation does n’t hold up on another level as well .
Since the administration has been so insistent that the eight fired U.S. attorneys were let go for performance rather than political reasons , how to explain why Rove aide J. Scott Jennings was using his “ political ” email account to push for Tim Griffin , a former Rove aide , to take over Bud Cummins ’ job as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas ?
“ The statements from the White House so far have been rather confusing , ” says the Waxman aide .
“ Very odd . ”
While some White House officials may legitimately be using RNC - issued laptops and BlackBerrys to conduct party business , it ’s clear that others are taking pains to use alternate email accounts simply to keep their communications from becoming public record .
In 2004 , U.S. News & World Report noted , in a three - sentence item , that many White House aides had begun using Web - based email in order to avoid the White House system .
“ I do n’t want my E - mail made public , ” one White House “ insider ” told the magazine .
“ It ’s Yahoo ! , baby , ” another said .
In the Clinton White House , according to an official staff manual circa 1997 , there was a strict prohibition against using anything but the official system .
In addition , a 2000 directive to White House staff states that “ the system designated for EOP [ Executive Office of the President ] mail … is to be used exclusively for E-mail communications within the EOP Complex and with outside parties .
Other applications ( e.g. , commercial E- mail services ) may not be used to send or receive E-mail . ”
Whether or not the use of non-governmental email accounts ultimately breaches the Presidential Records Act , it virtually assures an incomplete historical record of the Bush presidency .
“ The only way accurate history can be written is if the full records are available to evaluate , ” says John Carlin , the former national archivist , who did not want to weigh in directly on the current controversy .
“ Records undergird a democracy . ”
But the email controversy may be of significance not only to historians who will pour over the Bush papers in years to come , but to others who are working to provide present - day accountability .
Indeed , among other people , these revelations could be of particular interest to a certain federal prosecutor who recently won the conviction of the Vice President ’s former chief of staff , I. Lewis Libby , on charges of obstructing an investigation into the leak of Valerie Wilson ’s identity .
Contained in the lengthy docket of U.S.A. v. Libby is a January 23 , 2006 letter from special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald to Libby ’s defense team , who were then jousting over classified discovery .
In it , Fitzgerald advises Libby ’s attorneys , “ in an abundance of caution , ” that “ we have learned that not all email of the Office of Vice President and the Executive Office of the President for certain time periods in 2003 was preserved through the normal archiving process on the White House computer system . ”
Though the prosecution later received an additional 250 pages of records from the vice president ’s office , it remains unclear what the true nature of this archiving problem was or whether Fitzgerald received all of the documents that may have been relevant to his investigation .
( Fitzgerald ’s office declined to comment after being provided with a detailed request . )
Perhaps Fitzgerald , along with other investigators who have sought White House records , was looking in the wrong place .
He may want to check the RNC ’s servers .
The US government 's plan to boost energy savings by moving Daylight Saving Time forward by three weeks was apparently a waste of time and effort , as the technological foibles Americans experienced failed to give way to any measurable energy savings .
While the change caused no major infrastructure problems in the country , plenty of electronics and computer systems that were designed with the original DST switchover date ( first Sunday in April ) failed to update .
The inconvenience was minor , and the potential savings were great .
Or so we were told by the politicians behind the move .
As it turns out , the US Department of Energy ( and almost everyone else except members of Congress ) was correct when they predicted that there would be little energy savings .
This echoed concerns voiced after a similar experiment was attempted in Australia .
Critics pointed out a basic fact : the gains in the morning will be offset by the losses at night , and vice - versa , at both ends of the switch .
That appears to be exactly what happened .
Reuters spoke with Jason Cuevas , spokesman for Southern Co. power , who said it plainly : " We have n't seen any measurable impact . "
New Jersey 's Public Service Enterprise Group said the same thing : " no impact " on their business .
So while the US government pats itself on the back for at least looking busy , know that the main goal — energy conservation — has not been met .
We can still argue over other supposed benefits , like the supposed reduction in crime ( which returns in November ? ) and the fact that many people seem to simply like the change .
As far as the purpose of the move is concerned , that appears to be a total flop .
Congress is tasked with reviewing the change and its effectiveness .
With little to recommend it , the future of this latest DST change may ultimately hinge on Americans ' preference for when we all get out of bed in the morning .
Is n't arbitrary , mostly meaningless change great ?
Oh , and if you 're wondering why some of your colleagues showed up late for work yesterday , it 's because many devices - even patched devices - shifted an hour ahead Sunday , when the change would have normally taken place .

WHEN “ Mystery Science Theater 3000 ” was canceled after 11 seasons in 1999 , 146 distraught fans bought a full - page advertisement in Daily Variety urging another network to continue the show .
But the series was not revived , and today devotees cannot even tune in to reruns because its premise — a host and his two robot pals mock B movies — required securing those movies ’ broadcast rights , which expired after the show ’s demise .
But those self - described “ Misties ” are welcoming a resurrection of sorts .
Mike Nelson , the show ’s longtime host and head writer , has begun a new venture called RiffTrax , and he can now skewer virtually any movie without infringing on copyrights .
Recordings of him talking back at movies can be downloaded ( for fees ranging from 99 cents to $ 3.99 ) from rifftrax.com .
Start playing the DVD or VHS version of the movie and Mr. Nelson ’s commentary simultaneously , and the effect is that of a director commenting on a DVD — except that Mr. Nelson is inclined to say , as he does during a scene in “ Star Trek V : The Final Frontier ” in which William Shatner climbs a mountain , “ He ’s actually trying to scale his own ego . ”
So far there are more than 30 RiffTrax episodes , including “ The Matrix ” and “ The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring , ” with Mr. Nelson adding three or four more titles every month .
He said in a phone interview from San Diego , where he lives , that “ hundreds of thousands ” of the files have been purchased for download so far .
( A spokesman for Legend Films , which produces RiffTrax , declined to clarify or confirm Mr. Nelson ’s claim , saying the company considers sales figures proprietary . )
Giocangga was the grandfather of Emperor Nurhaci
Giocangga 's extraordinary number of descendants , concentrated mainly in north - east China and Mongolia , are thought to be a result of the many wives and concubines his offspring took .
Dr Chris Tyler - Smith , a geneticist working at Britain 's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , made the finding , based on a study of a set of genes on the male Y chromosome .
He told the BBC World Service 's Science In Action programme that these genes provided a " genetic surname " of the family to which each man belonged .
" What we did was analyse around 1,000 men from that part of the world , " he said .
" We noticed just two types of Y chromosome that were extraordinarily frequent - one of them making up around 3 % of our sample .
" When we looked at it more carefully , we found that it was not present in the majority population in that area , the Han .
But in the minorities , including the Mongolians , it was present at around 5 % . "
' Good chance of survival '
Scientists were then able to work out roughly where the special genes came from .
They established the origin was north - east China , around 500 years ago .
More accurate analysis then found that this particular genetic code first appeared just before the Qing dynasty , which came to the fore in 1616 and had conquered China by 1644 .
The Qing dynasty ruled China for several hundred years
" It was ruled by the Qing imperial nobility , who were a highly privileged elite class , and they had several wives and concubines .
" Because of the privilege , they could have had many children - and those children would have had a good chance of survival . "
At the time of Giocangga , the population of China was about 100 million - compared with 1.3 billion today .
This means that the average Chinese man at the time of Giocangga would only have around 20 descendants living today - in marked contrast to Giocangga 's 1.5 million men .
" The difference is accounted for by the large number of wives and concubines - and in particular , this practice being linked to the Y chromosome for many generations , " Dr Tyler - Smith added .

Scientists have developed a simple method of converting blood from one group to another .
The breakthrough could mean the end of transfusion shortages by boosting supplies of group O negative blood .
This is known as ' universal ' because it can be given to people of any group and is in high demand for emergencies .
Giving patients the wrong blood can result in a severe immune reaction and even death .
Writing in the journal Nature Biotechnology , an international team of researchers described how they converted blood from group A , B or AB to group O .
Blood is classified according to the sugar molecules , antigens , on the surface of red cells .
A damaging immune response can be triggered if a patient receives blood from a group carrying a different molecule to their own .
The scientists , led by Professor Henrik Clausen from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark , used bacterial enzymes as biological ' scissors ' to cut out the sugar molecules in only an hour .
This effectively changed the blood to antigen - free Group O .
Trials with patients will now take place before such converted blood is used in hospitals .
The phone can read invisible images on printed paper
Japanese firm Fujitsu is pushing a technology that can encode data into a picture that is invisible to the human eye but can be decoded by a mobile phone with a camera .
The company believes the technology will have spin off implications for the publishing industry .
" The concept is to be able to link the printed page into the digital domain , " said Mike Nelson , general manager for sales operations at Fujitsu Europe .
The technique stems from a 2,500 - year - old practice called steganography , which saw the Greeks sending warnings of attacks on wooden tablets and then covering them in wax and tattooing messages on shaved heads that were then covered by the regrowth of hair .
Fujitsu 's technique works by taking advantage of the sensitivities of the human eye , which struggles to see the colour yellow .
" The key is to take the yellow hue in the picture and we skew that ever so slightly to create a pattern , " said Mr Nelson .
" A camera is perfectly sensitive to that yellow hue but the human eye does n't see it very well .
" Any camera , even those in mobile phones , can decode it very easily . "
Pictures printed with the technique look perfectly normal but a camera can see the code printed into the image .
The technique can currently store just 12 bytes of information - soon to rise to 24 - the equivalent amount of data in a barcode .
That data could be a phone number , a message or a website link .
Printed materials can then connect to the online world by storing information which tells the phone to connect the web .
Almost any mobile phone can be used but a small java application must be downloaded before it can be used to decode the information .
Other devices such as PDAs with a camera could also be used .
Decipher data
Once installed the same program can be used to read other codes on other products .
It takes a few seconds for the phone to decipher the data .
And because most modern mobiles can connect to the net they act as a gateway to content that firms want to send to people who have decoded the steganographic pictures , such as music and video .
The first commercial use of the technology is in Japan where a Music Club has embedded codes into flyers it sends to subscribers .
Steganography can be embedded as part of the normal printing process
Mike Nelson , Fujitsu
" Through that flyer they can link through the pictures to music clips , " said Mr Nelson .
Any printer can be used to print the coded information inside a picture and Fujitsu is looking to license the technology to publishers .
There is also a small fee for the use of the decoding software which sits on the firm 's own servers .
Mr Nelson believes the technology is more useful than barcodes because of its invisibility and because it connects printed matter to the internet , via the phone .
" There 's a lot of printed material out there today whether it be food wrappers , billboards , catalogues , phone directories and business cards and they are not going to go away .
' Digital domain '
" We need an added dimension to that flat material and linking that to the digital domain is what we are trying to do . "
Mr Nelson does not believe steganography is competing with technologies such as RFID tags , tiny radio chips which can hold information and be scanned at a short distance .
" You have to physically mount a chip into the device - it 's expensive and time consuming .
" Steganography can be embedded as part of the normal printing process . "
Mr Nelson said he believed promotions and competition would drive take up of the technology as a prize would act as an incentive to use a mobile phone and download the decoding application .
The United States is now that weary Titan .
In the British case , the angst was a result of the unexpectedly protracted , bloody and costly Boer war , in which a small group of foreign insurgents defied the mightiest military the world had seen ; concern about the rising economic power of Germany and the United States ; and a combination of imperial overstretch with socio-economic problems at home .
In the American case , it 's a result of the unexpectedly protracted , bloody and costly Iraq war , in which a small group of foreign insurgents defies the mightiest military the world has seen ; concern about the rising economic power of China and India ; and a combination of imperial overstretch with socio-economic problems at home .
Iraq is America 's Boer war .
Remember that after the British had declared the end of major combat operations in the summer of 1900 , the Boers launched a campaign of guerrilla warfare that kept British troops on the run for another two years .
The British won only by a ruthlessness of which , I 'm glad to say , the democratic , squeamish and still basically anti-colonialist United States appears incapable .
In the end , the British had 450,000 British and colonial troops there ( compared with some 150,000 US troops in Iraq ) , and herded roughly a quarter of the Boer population into concentration camps , where many died .
In a recent CNN / Gallup poll , 54 % of those asked said it was a mistake to send American troops into Iraq , and 57 % said the Iraq war has made the US less safe from terrorism .
The protest camp outside President Bush 's ranch in Crawford , which grew around the mother of a soldier who died in Iraq , exemplifies the pain .
CNN last Sunday aired a documentary with top - level sources explaining in detail how the intelligence on Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction was distorted , abused , sexed up and , as the programme was entitled , Dead Wrong .
This will hardly be news for British or European readers , but the facts have not been so widely aired in the US .
In another poll , the number of those who rated the president as " honest " fell below 50 % for the first time .
This week , he has again attempted to bolster support for his administration and his war .
It does n't seem to be working .
A recent article in the New York Times plausibly estimated the prospective long - term cost of the Iraq War at more than $ 1 trillion .
If Iraqi politicians do finally agree a draft constitution for their country today , only the world 's greatest optimist can believe that it will turn Iraq into a peaceful , stable , democratic federal republic .
Increasingly , the Islamic Republic of Iran quietly calls the shots in the Shia south of Iraq .
As the Washington joke goes : the war is over , and the Iranians won .
Meanwhile , oil prices of more than $ 60 a barrel put the price of petrol at American pumps up to nearly $ 3 a gallon for basic unleaded fuel .
For someone from Europe this is still unbelievably cheap , but you should hear the shrieks of agony here .
" Gas prices have changed my life , " moaned a distressed Californian commuter .
If higher energy prices persist , they threaten not just a still vibrant economy but a whole way of life , symbolised by the Hummer ( in both its civilian and military versions ) .
Besides instability in the Middle East , the main force pushing up oil prices is the relentless growth of demand for energy from the emerging economic giants of Asia .
The Chinese go around the world quietly signing big oil supply deals with any oil - producing country they can find , however nasty its politics , including Sudan and Iran .
When a Chinese concern tried to buy a big California energy company , that was too much - American politicians screamed and effectively blocked the deal .
China and India are to the United States today what Germany and America were to Britain a hundred years ago .
China is now the world 's second largest energy consumer , after the United States .
It also has the world 's second largest foreign currency reserves , after Japan and followed by Taiwan , South Korea and India .
In the foreign reserve stakes , the US comes only ninth , after Singapore and just before Malaysia .
According to some economists , the US has an effective net savings rate - taking account of all public spending and debt - of zero .
Nil. Zilch .
This country does not save ; it spends .
The television channels are still full of a maddening barrage of endless commercials , enticing you to spend , spend , spend - and then to " consolidate " your accumulated debt in one easy package .
None of this is to suggest that the United States will decline and fall tomorrow .
Far from it .
After all , the British empire lasted for another 40 years after 1905 .
In fact , it grew to its largest extent after 1918 , before it signed its own death warrant by expending its blood and treasure to defeat Adolf Hitler ( not the worst way to go ) .
Similarly , one may anticipate that America 's informal empire - its network of military bases and semi-protectorates - will continue to grow .
The United States , like Edwardian Britain , still has formidable resources of economic , technological and military power , cultural attractiveness and , not least , the will to stay on top .
As one British music hall ditty at that time proclaimed :
And we mean to be top dog still .
Bow - wow .
Yes , we mean to be top dog still .
You do n't have to go very far to hear that refrain in Washington today .
The Bush administration 's national security strategy makes no bones about the goal of maintaining military supremacy .
But whether the " American century " that began in 1945 will last until 2045 , 2035 or only 2025 , its end can already be glimpsed on the horizon .
If you are , by any chance , of that persuasion that would instinctively find this a cause for rejoicing , pause for a moment to consider two things : first , that major shifts of power between rising and falling great powers have usually been accompanied by major wars ; and second , that the next top dog could be a lot worse .
So this is no time for schadenfreude .
It 's a time for critical solidarity .
A few far - sighted people in Washington are beginning to formulate a long - term American strategy of trying to create an international order that would protect the interests of liberal democracies even when American hyperpower has faded ; and to encourage rising powers such as India and China to sign up to such an order .
That is exactly what today 's weary Titan should be doing , and we should help him do it .

Story Highlights • Letter : Tenet culpable in mistakes made in lead - up to war in Iraq
• Tenet should give royalties of his book to Iraq veterans , CIA officers write
• Ex-CIA chief is " self - serving , " his former employees say
• " You failed the people of the United States , " officers write
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) --
In a letter written Saturday to former CIA Director George Tenet , six former CIA officers described their former boss as " the Alberto Gonzales of the intelligence community , " and called his book " an admission of failed leadership . "
The writers said Tenet has " a moral obligation " to return the Medal of Freedom he received from President Bush .
They also called on him to give more than half the royalties he gets from book , " At the Center of the Storm , " to U.S. soldiers wounded in Iraq and families of the dead .
( Watch Sec. of State Condoleezza Rice talk about Tenet 's book )
The letter , signed by Phil Giraldi , Ray McGovern , Larry Johnson , Jim Marcinkowski , Vince Cannistraro and David MacMichael , said Tenet should have resigned in protest rather than take part in the administration 's buildup to the war .
( Read the full letter )
Johnson is a former CIA intelligence official and registered Republican who voted for Bush in 2000 .
McGovern is a former CIA analyst .
Cannistraro is former head of the CIA 's counterterrorism division and was head of intelligence for the National Security Council in the late 1980s .
The writers said they agree that Bush administration officials took the nation to war " for flimsy reasons , " and that it has proved " ill - advised and wrong - headed . "
But , they added , " your lament that you are a victim in a process you helped direct is self - serving , misleading and , as head of the intelligence community , an admission of failed leadership .
" You were not a victim .
You were a willing participant in a poorly considered policy to start an unnecessary war and you share culpability with Dick Cheney and George Bush for the debacle in Iraq . "
Tenet 's ' lack of courage '
The writers accused Tenet of having helped send " very mixed signals " to Americans and their legislators prior to the war .
" CIA field operatives produced solid intelligence in September 2002 that stated clearly there was no stockpile of any kind of WMD in Iraq .
" This intelligence was ignored and later misused . "
The letter said CIA officers learned later that month Iraq had no contact with Osama bin Laden and that then - President Saddam Hussein considered the al Qaeda leader to be an enemy .
Still , Tenet " went before Congress in February 2003 and testified that Iraq did indeed have links to al Qaeda .
" You showed a lack of leadership and courage in January of 2003 as the Bush administration pushed and cajoled analysts and managers to let them make the bogus claim that Iraq was on the verge of getting its hands on uranium .
" You signed off on Colin Powell 's presentation to the United Nations .
And , at his insistence , you sat behind him and visibly squandered CIA 's most precious asset - credibility . "
The letter described Tenet as " one of the bullies . "
" You helped set the bar very low for reporting that supported favored White House positions , while raising the bar astronomically high when it came to raw intelligence that did not support the case for war being hawked by the president and vice president .
" It now turns out that you were the Alberto Gonzales of the intelligence community -- a grotesque mixture of incompetence and sycophancy shielded by a genial personality . "
The letter said Tenet 's failure to resist pressures from Cheney and then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld helped build public support for a war that has cost more than 3,000 American lives and many times that among Iraqis .
" You betrayed the CIA officers who collected the intelligence that made it clear that Saddam did not pose an imminent threat .
You betrayed the analysts who tried to withstand the pressure applied by Cheney and Rumsfeld .
" Most importantly and tragically , you failed to meet your obligations to the people of the United States . "
Tenet 's memoir , to be published Monday , covers his tenure as director from July 1997 to July 2004 .
In an interview to air Sunday on CBS News ' " 60 Minutes , " Tenet expressed outrage that senior officials including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have used his " slam dunk " reference in discussing Bush 's decision to go to war in Iraq over its weapons of mass destruction , which turned out not to exist .

" They never let it go .
I mean , I became campaign talk .
I was a talking point .
' Look at the idiot who told us and we decided to go to war . '
Well , let 's not be so disingenuous ...
Let 's everybody just get up and tell the truth .
Tell the American people what really happened . "
FEBRUARY 12-- As he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination , Rudolph Giuliani will have to contend with political and personal baggage unknown to prospective supporters whose knowledge of the former New York mayor is limited to his post - September 11 exploits .
So , in a bid to educate the electorate , we 're offering excerpts from a remarkable " vulnerability study " that was commissioned by Giuliani 's campaign prior to his successful 1993 City Hall run .
The confidential 450 - page report , authored by Giuliani 's research director and another aide , was the campaign 's attempt to identify possible lines of attack against Giuliani and prepare the candidate and his staff to counter " the kinds of no - holes - barred assault " expected in a general election rematch with Democratic incumbent David Dinkins .
As he tried to win election in an overwhelmingly Democratic city , Giuliani needed " inoculating against " the " Reagan Republican moniker , " the vulnerability study reported .
" The Giuliani campaign should emphasize its candidate 's independence from traditional national Republican policies . "
The final six words of that sentence are underlined in the study .
Additionally , the Giuliani report noted that the candidate needed to make it clear to voters that he was " pretty good on most issues of concern to gay and lesbian New Yorkers " and was pro-choice and supported public funding for abortion .
" He will continue city funding for abortions at city hospitals .
Nothing more , nothing less . "
Giuliani's stance on these issues , of course , may leave him vulnerable today with an entirely different electorate .
The campaign study was obtained by The Village Voice 's Wayne Barrett in the course of preparing " Rudy ! , " an investigative biography of Giuliani .
In its preface , the study notes that it is " tough and hard - hitting .
It pulls no punches . "
Perhaps that is why Giuliani , as Barrett reported , ordered copies of the vulnerability study destroyed shortly after it was circulated to top campaign aides .
He surely could not have been pleased to read that his " personal life raises questions about a ' weirdness factor . ' "
That weirdness , aides reported , stemmed from Giuliani's 14 - year marriage to his second cousin , a union that he got annulled by claiming to have never received proper dispensation from the Catholic Church for the unorthodox nuptials .
" When asked about his personal life , Giuliani gives a wide array of conflicting answers , " the campaign report stated .
" All of this brings the soundness of his judgement into question -- and the veracity of his answers . "
The internal study also addresses prospective charges that Giuliani dodged the Vietnam draft and was a " man without convictions " because of his transformation from George McGovern voter to a Reagan - era Justice Department appointee .
" In many ways Rudy Giuliani is a political contradiction ... He does n't really fit with the Republicans .
Too liberal .
Giuliani has troubles with the Democrats , too . "
On the following pages , you 'll find the vulnerability report 's cover and preface and sections on Reagan Republicanism , women and abortion , Giuliani 's first marriage and divorce , draft dodging , gay issues , racial polarization , and his party registration ' flip - flop . ' ( 27 pages )
NASSAU COUNTY --- A federal judge has rejected a 14 - year - old deaf boy 's request to allow his service dog to accompany him to classes .
East Meadow School District officials have refused to allow John Cave Jr. to bring Simba , a two - year - old Labrador retriever into the school , saying that service dogs are banned from the school " to foster a safe and effective school environment .
They claimed that the dog would pose a health and safety hazard to other students and staff .
Cave and his parents , John and Nancy Cave , have brought a $ 150 millions federal lawsuit against the school district , saying that the district is violating the Americans with Disabilities Act , and sought an injunction to allow the teen to bring the dog to school .
In denying the injunction , U.S. District Court Judge Arthur Spatt said that the deaf boy is provided with a sign language interpreter and other accommodation in order to receive a proper education .
The judge had conducted a hearing over six days before rendering his decision .
Cave 's attorney said the family will appeal the decision .
Simba became John Jr.'s service dog in December after receiving six months of training .
The federal litigation says that the dog's effectiveness as a service dog is impaired if he spends too much time away from the teen , saying that " Simba is alone six to eight hours a day and has been declining in his ability and training and as such is in serious risk of failing to provide the services he was trained to provide " , according to the lawsuit .
The state Division of Human Rights is investigating the matter .
A notice of state claim has also been filed in Nassau County Supreme Court alleging violations of civil rights and human rights law .
The Americans with Disabilities
Act defines a service animal as any guide dog , signal dog , or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability .
Federal and state anti-discrimination laws make it unlawful to deny or restrict access to services to an individual based on the fact that she or he is accompanied by a service animal .
Under the ADA , a place of public accommodation is defined as a private entity that engages in commerce .
Places of public accommodation under the ADA include places of education , such as a school .

The Republican Party has a new voter registration project in Fresno .
It involves luring people to sign a LEGALIZE MARIJUANA petition and then re-registering them as Republicans .
Legalizing Marijuana - A New Republican Strategy ?
By Mike Rhodes
The attractive young woman says to me , " would you sign our petition to legalize marijuana ? "
I do n’t have to think twice and say " sure , where do I sign ? "
That is when it got interesting .
She says , " Do you have your ID with you ? "
" Well , yes I do , but what does that have to do with ... "
I say as she responds with " oh , we just have to verify your ID . "
Thinking that this has something to do with making sure they have valid names for a ballot initiative I comply .
As I ’m filling out my name and address on the petition I notice that the young lady is filling out a very official looking form .
Probably just the ballot initiative form , I think to myself .
Then , she says " is it OK if I register you as a Republican ? "
" What ? ! ? "
I say " yes , I do mind !
What are you doing ? "
She says that if I register Republican she will get an extra 10 cents .
But , I complain , " I do n’t want to re-register . "
She explains that this is just to update the records for the County Clerks office .
I repeat that " I do not want or need to update my records . "
I am repeatedly told that it is OK and that they just want to update my voter registration records .
She also tells me that she is working for the Republican party , being paid hourly , and that the ploy about the " 10 cent bonus " was not accurate .
This Republican party employee goes on to tell me that she is there to attract people to the table that is set up in Fresno ’s Courthouse Park , and that the legalize marijuana petition is just a prop .
She confirmed that there is no ballot initiative to legalize marijuana .
She said that the petition will be given to an elected official in Sacramento .
I have my doubts about that .
At this point in the conversation , she called over her " boss " who was talking with someone a short distance away .
I introduced myself as the editor of the Community Alliance newspaper and said I was interested in writing a story about the petition campaign and their registering people with the Republican party .
I guess that was n’t the right approach to get him to open up to me .
The " boss " gave me no information .
He even refused to give me a copy of the marijuana legalization petition I had just signed .
Later that day I called Victor Salazar , the Fresno County Clerk .
Salazar said that the process sounded deceptive and that I might want to call the Secretary of State fraud investigation unit .
I called the number for the fraud investigation unit repeatedly today .
Apparently , nobody was in the office today and all I got was an answering machine .
I will continue to call .
I also went back to Courthouse Park today to see the Republican Party project was again in full operation .
They seemed to have different approaches to different groups .
To white men that looked like they might be attorneys , they asked if they were registered to vote .
When Latinos walked by they would throw out the legalize marijuana angle .
###
ON SEPTEMBER 13th 1848 a navvy called Phineas Gage was helping to build a railway in Vermont .
As gang foreman , he had the job of setting explosive charges to blast a path through the hills near a town called Cavendish .
While he was tamping down one of the charges with an iron bar , it went off prematurely , driving the bar clean through his head .
Accidents on construction projects happen all the time .
The reason that people remember Gage 's is that he survived it .
Or , rather , his body survived it .
For the Gage that returned to work was not the Gage who had stuck the tamping rod into that explosive - filled hole .
Before , he had been a sober , industrious individual , well respected and destined for success .
Afterwards , he was a foul - mouthed drunkard , a drifter and a failure .
His identity had been changed in a specific way by specific damage to a specific part of his brain .
Gage 's accident was intriguing because it cast light on the question of dualism .
This is the idea that although the mind — the self — inhabits the brain , it nevertheless has an existence of its own and thus should not be equated with the brain .
The sudden change Gage underwent suggested that brain and mind are not independent .
If the essence of individuality can be changed by a physical accident , it implies that the brain is a mechanism which generates the self , rather than merely an organ which houses it .
This observation moves the question “ who am I ? ” from the realm of philosophy into the realm of science .
Thirteen years after the incident in Cavendish , a French neurologist called Paul Broca systematised the study of how brain damage affects the mind with the discovery that certain sorts of speech defect are the result of damage to part of the brain called the left temporal lobe ( see article for a refresher course on brain anatomy and function ) .
Local brain damage of this sort is known to neurologists as a lesion .
Studying it therefore became known as the lesion method .
Broca 's new method was taken up quickly .
All sorts of strange neurological symptoms are now explained by specific brain damage .
For example , an inability to perceive movement ( even though the individual can see stationary objects ) results from damage to part of the temporal lobe , and an inability to recognise faces is caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus .
No one now questions the idea that particular parts of the brain specialise in particular activities .
Broca 's revolution , though , is incomplete .
On the face of things , its discoveries might have meant the end of dualism , but the world was not quite ready to embrace the mechanical explanation of self that the work of Broca and his successors implied .
For much of the 20th century , a watered - down version of dualism based on the idea of the psyche prevailed .
The distinction that psychiatry drew between neurological and psychiatric illness implied that there was a psyche ( whisper not the word soul ) that could somehow go wrong independently of physical symptoms in the brain .
When that idea was challenged by the effectiveness of physical drugs , such as antidepressants , in treating psychiatric illness , dualism returned in a different guise .
Many people , most of whom would not regard themselves as dualists , think of the brain as being like a computer , and the mind as being like a piece of software that runs on that computer .
But this analogy , too , is flawed .
You do not have to do much damage to a computer to stop it being able to run programs .
Yet as the case of Gage and numerous subsequent individuals has shown , the self can plod on , albeit changed , after quite radical brain damage .
The self in action
Broca 's heirs , though , now have a range of new techniques with which to investigate the question .
The best - known is a way of scanning the brain called functional magnetic - resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
What makes it so powerful is that it records activity as well as anatomy .
It can , if you like to put it that way , see the self in action .
All you need to do is put someone inside an fMRI machine , give them a task to do and see which bits of the brain light up .
Naturally , the revolution in neuroscience brought about by this new technology has its critics .
They point out that big conclusions are often drawn from small samples , that the changes in activity observed by fMRI are indirect ( the technique measures blood flow and oxygen consumption rather than the electrical activity of nerve cells ) and that the resolution is poor ( individual points in an fMRI picture represent two or three cubic millimetres of brain tissue , which means hundreds of thousands of nerve cells ) .
All these criticisms are justified .
But these are early days .
In science , time tells .
The good studies are repeated and make the textbooks .
The bad ones cannot be replicated and vanish down the memory hole .
Modern neuroscience has taken many directions , and this survey will not attempt to look at all of them .
Instead , it will concentrate on four areas that may shed light on individual identity : the study of the emotions ; the nature of memory ; the ways that brains interact with each other ; and the vexed question of what , exactly , consciouness is .
Such science is very much work in progress .
Indeed , it is science of a type that would have been familiar to Broca and his contemporaries , for in many cases the researchers have only the haziest idea of where they are going .
In the 19th century , when scientists were feeling their way towards big concepts such as the laws of thermodynamics , electromagnetics and the periodic table without really knowing what they were looking for , that was normal .
These days there seem to be fewer new big concepts around , and experiments are often conducted in the expectation of particular results .
But neuroscience is one area where big concepts certainly remain to be discovered .
And when they are , they are likely to upend humanity 's understanding of itself .
Interesting story out of Seattle today .
A local church was told by the government that it was operating illegally and that it needed to shut down .
I brought this point up yesterday , God may be above the law but church ’s are n’t .
St. Jude ’s Church did not apply for the necessary permits to operate and now the parish faces what could add up to $ 37,000 in fines .
The fines stem from the problem that the church decided that it did n’t need the permits and it had a religious obligation to the area to open .
The key thing here is that the church set up a tent city – they were not operating out of a building .
I do n’t know about you , but the permit process seems completely legit to me– I do n’t want to wake up one morning and find a circus tent next door .
Washington State Rep. Mark Miloscia , a Democrat , is introducing a measure to make it illegal for cities to prevent churches or synagogues from hosting a tent city .
Miloscia points out that churches should n’t be unfairly restricted as they go about trying to save lives by providing some measure of shelter for people .
Saving lives is one thing , hosting a tent revival in my backyard is another .
The alleged plot prompted a massive security clampdown
He has moved the case of Rashid Rauf , a Briton , from an anti-terrorism court to a regular court , where he faces lesser charges such as forgery .
Pakistan has presented Mr Rauf as one of the ringleaders behind the alleged plan to blow up flights out of London .
The British authorities say they foiled it with Pakistan 's help in August .
They say proceedings against suspects arrested in Britain will go ahead .
' Explosives '
The arrest of Rashid Rauf in Pakistan triggered arrests in the United Kingdom of a number of suspects allegedly plotting to blow up transatlantic flights .
The Pakistani authorities described him as a key figure .
But an anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi found no evidence that he had been involved in terrorist activities or that he belonged to a terrorist organisation .
As well as forgery charges , Mr Rauf has also been charged with carrying explosives .
But his lawyer says police evidence amounts only to bottles of hydrogen peroxide found in his possession .
Hydrogen peroxide is a disinfectant that can be used for bomb - making if other chemicals are added .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says the judge 's decision has reinforced the already widespread scepticism there about the airliner plot .
Several commentators said the threat was deliberately exaggerated to bolster the anti-terror credentials of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and that it helped to demonise British Muslims of Pakistani origin .
The Crown Prosecution Service in the UK said the dropping of charges against Mr Rauf in Pakistan would " make no difference " to the case against the men charged in Britain .
' Suspected conspiracy '
In August , the British government requested the extradition of Mr Rauf , a Briton of Pakistani origin who returned to Pakistan four years ago , in connection with a 2002 murder .
Scotland Yard declined to discuss which murder case the request related to .
The government in Pakistan , which has no extradition treaty with the UK , said it was considering the request .
Rashid Rauf was arrested in Pakistan earlier that month over the alleged plot to blow up US - bound aircraft , Pakistan 's foreign ministry said .
He has been described by Pakistan 's government as a " key person " in the " suspected conspiracy " .
The August arrests led to increased airport security around the world , causing major disruption .
Passengers on many flights were forbidden to take liquids aboard aircraft .
Congratulations , reader , you 're now an IT " expert ! "
IT is a field that is full of " experts . "
An " expert " is any old IT guy ( or gal ( ok , fine , guy ) ) that meets the minimum requirement for being called an " expert " — he refers to himself as one .
The nice thing about calling yourself an " expert " is that all non -IT people will believe you !
An " expert " is different than an Expert , though .
An Expert is a real expert , while the cocky knownothing guy sitting next to you is an " expert . "
Jeffrey worked with an " expert . "
Jeffrey 's coworker , who we 'll call " Dr. Ebenezer E. Expert Esquire , PhD , " blurred the lines between Experts and " experts . "
He had some impressive real - world qualifications : a PhD in engineering and a long history at the company , not to mention all the arrogance and laziness of a typical academic .
Jeffrey had to deal with Ebenezer on a regular basis ; they shared a cube .
The final straw came when a competent coworker asked Ebenezer how his deliverable was coming along .
Ebenezer threw up his hands and started yelling .
All of these people are so unprofessional !
he shouted , I 'll have it done five times faster than everyone ; I 'm an optimization expert !
It was time for a test .
Jeffrey intended to find out just how much of an expert his PhD - carrying coworker was .
Noticing that recent emails from Ebenezer resembled the output from SCIgen , Jeffrey got an idea .
If you 're not familiar , SCIgen is an application that generates technical research papers .
Of course , its output is all meaningless gibberish , but if you 're not paying attention and just skim over its output , it seems like a real , well - researched work .
Anyone who knows anything about IT , though , would realize it was garbage after a single paragraph .
Jeffrey kept clicking the " Generate " button on SCIgen until he got gold : " Lossless , Virtual Information for E - Business " ( click for full article , PDF ) .
Here 's an abstract :
Many cryptographers would agree that , had it not been for the evaluation of the location - identity split , the exploration of Moore 's Law might never have occurred .
Given the current status of interposable theory , biologists particularly desire the exploration of active networks , which embodies the robust principles of algorithms .
We concentrate our efforts on confirming that IP v4 and expert systems are often incompatible [ 1 ] .
Jeffrey printed it up and dropped it on the PhD 's desk with a sticky note that read " This paper looks interesting .
Do you think the author makes any good points ? "
The papers generated by SCIgen should be easy for anyone in IT to spot as fake .
Not Ebenezer , though .
Not even the references to UNIVAC in the paper clued him in .
Ebenezer sat in silence , absorbing every gibberish word of the gibberish paper , highlighting gibberish words for 30 gibberish minutes .
When Ebenezer had finished , Jeffrey asked him what his opinion was .
" It 's brilliant ! " replied Ebenezer .
" It 's the natural progression of all the ideas I presented in my incredibly insightful PhD thesis ! "
He then showed Jeffrey the first two pages of his most recent papers , citing the parallels between his paper and the SCIgen one .
Jeffrey did n't have the heart to tell Ebenezer that his ideas are precisely as insightful as those randomly generated by a computer — that 's a lesson that the " expert " will have to learn on his own .
Less ' Enticing ' Warsaw A Miniskirt Ban in Poland ?
One Polish legislator has announced plans for a bill that would ban miniskirts and other " enticements " -- with the goal of reducing street prostitution .
But the move is also part of a wider culture war .
Late last week the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project had a media event in Cambridge , and while I could n't make the event , I did tape a video interview for the BBC on the project .
During my preparation I kept coming across these claims that Microsoft and OLPC had partnered to put Windows XP Starter Edition on the OLPC , and according to one report , this was being done to get the XO laptop into US schools .
None of this jibed with what I had been hearing from sources , so I decided to look into it further .
As it turns out , a number of new outlets , including the AP , mischaracterized the situation .
According to Walter Bender , president of Software and Content at OLPC , there is no agreement in place between OLPC and Microsoft to offer XO laptops with any version of Windows .
Bender also indicated that Microsoft has not contacted OLPC regarding its $ 3 software bundling program , nor have any governments requested that the XO be outfitted with Windows .
In short , there is no existing collaboration between Microsoft and OLPC aimed at outfitting the XO laptop with Windows .
The XO in Nigerian colors
" We are a free and open - source shop .
We have no one from OLPC working with Microsoft on developing a Windows platform for the XO .
MS does n't get any special treatment from OLPC , " Bender told Ars .
How did the mix - up come about ?
Perhaps it is because Microsoft is one of over 1,500 developers accepted to OLPC 's developer program , and the company does have access to XO prototypes .
Microsoft has said that the company will develop for the XO laptop , but when asked if OLPC was aware of any tests of either XP Starter Edition or Vista Starter Edition on the XO , Bender said that he was not .
Reaction to the news that Microsoft might hop on board the XO was met with both cheers and derision .
Open - source advocates worried that this constituted a loss for the project and open - source ideals , but those fears appear to be unfounded now that the relationship between OLPC and Microsoft is clearer .
Correction : Reuters was named as a news outlet which reported the alleged Microsoft - OLPC hookup .
Reuters did not in fact do so .
yaws.conf設定マニュアル和訳
意訳です。修正歓迎。質問不可。→ しろいわ( shiroiwa3@gmail.com )
内容は保証できませんので、重要な設定を行う場合は必ず原文を確認してください。
原文はこちら 。
名称
/etc/yaws.conf - yawsサーバーの設定ファイル
概要
Yawsは速くて軽量なWebサーバーです。yaws.confでその動作の設定ができます。
設定は以下の2つパートからなります。
・全てのバーチャルホストに影響するグローバルな設定
・それぞれのバーチャルホスト用の設定
グローバルな設 定
logdir = Directory ( ディレクトリ ) 全てのyawsログがこのディレクトリのファイルに書き込まれます。
いくつかの異なるログがあります。
report.log yawsが吐き出した全てのエラーログ
Host.access Common Log Formatによるバーチャルホストのアクセスログ trace .http HTTP のトレース( 有効になっている場合 ) auth.log もし設定されていればhttp authのメッセージ trace .
traffic トラフィックトレース( 有効になっている場合 ) logdirのデフォルトは " . "
ebin_dir = Directory ( ディレクトリ ) このディレクティブでerlangのサーチディレクトリを追加できます。
このコマンドは設定ファイルで複数記述できます。
id = String ( 文字列 ) 同一マシンで複数のyaws サーバーを走らせることができます。
idはそれぞれのyawsサーバーをコントロールするために使います。
例えば、
# /usr/local/bin/yaws -- id foobar -- stop idがfoobarのサーバーを止めます。
各yawsサーバーは、各内部データを$HOME/.yaws/yaws/ID(サーバーのid)に保持します。
yaws は
$ {VARDIR} / run / yaws /ctl-$ {ID} というファイルも作ります。
ここにはサーバーがコントロールコマンドのためにリッスンしているポート番号が含まれます。
include_dir = Directory ( ディレクトリ ) このディレクティブでerlangコンパイラがインクルードファイルを探すディレクトリを追加できます。
これは我々のyawsのerlangコードに.hrlファイルを追加したくなった場合に必要です。
max_num_cached_files = Integer ( 整数 ) yaws はよくアクセスされるGIF 画像のような小さなファイルをメモリにキャッシュできます。
このディレクティブでキャッシュするファイル数を設定できます。
デフォルトは400です。
max_num_cached_bytes = Integer (整数 ) キャッシュのためのメモリサイズを指定できます。
デフォルトは1000000。1メガバイトです。
( 訳者注：これはサーバー一つあたりのサイズです。もし3サーバー定義していると、3MB必要になります) max_size_cached_file = Integer (整数 ) キャッシュされるファイルの最大サイズを指定できます。
デフォルトは8000。8キロバイトです。
cache_refresh_secs = Integer (整数 ) キャッシュはcache_refresh_secsで設定された秒数存在します。
デフォルトは30です。
これはdocrootのコンテンツを更新しても30秒経過しないと、変わらないということです。
サイト構築中はこの値を0にしておくと便利でしょう。
yawsスタート時にデバッグフラグ(-d)をつけておくと、この値は自動で0になります。
trace = traffic | http トラフィックまた はHTTP のトレースを有効にします。
yawsのコマンドラインフラグでも有効にできます。
auth_log = true | false auth.logを有効または無効にできます。デフォルトは有効です。
log_wrap_size = Integer ( 整数 ) yaws のログは全てラップログです。
オリジナルログがFile.oldにリネームされるのは1000000、1メガバイトです。
この値を設定できます。
tmpdir = Dir( ディレクトリ ) .yawsページを処理したときなど、動的コンテンツが処理された時に、ファイルが生成されます。
それらのファイルがtmpdirに保存されます。
デフォルトは $ HOME / . yaws です。
log_resolve_hostname = Bool( trueかfalse ) デフォルトではクライアントホスト のIP は( アクセスログで ) 解決されません。 fail_on_bind_err = Bool( trueかfalse ) リッスンしているソケットのbind に失敗した時に完全に失敗させるかどうか。
デフォルトはtrueです。
enable_soap = Bool( trueかfalse ) 有効であればyaws起動時 にSOAP サーバーが起動します。
デフォルトはfalseです。
php_exe_path = Path (パス ) PHPスクリプトを実行できるphp.exeへのパス。
デフォルトは php-cgi . です。
copy_error_log = true | false エラーログのコピーを有効にするかどうか。 embedded モードで走らせている時は、エラーログを記録するような他のシステムの処理がよくあるかもしれません。
しかし、通常のスタンドアロンモードで走らせている時は、report.logに書かれるerlangのエラーログが欲しいでしょう。
デフォルトはtrueです。
backwards_compat_parse = true | false 1.41 よりも上のバージョンのyawsでは parse_query と parse_post 関数の返り値が変わりました 。
以前のバージョンはキーが一意の {キー , 値} を使っています 。
これはDOS攻撃に対する弱点となります。
このフラグをセットすることは推奨されません。
1.41以降のキーは、list/stringです。
username = Username 実際yawsサーバーを運用する時は、rootでないユーザーで走らせるほうが安全だと思います。
この値 を" nobody " のようなシステム権限の無いユーザーに設定してください。
yawsは初めに、権限の必要なポートを適切にリッスンするためにrootで走らせる必要があります。
pick_first_virthost_on_nomatch = true | false yaws はリクエストを受けた時 、IP /ポートが同一の全てのサーバーからバーチャルサーバーを選択するため、リクエストの
Host : ヘッダーを参照します。
この設定は、その名前がマッチしなかった場合に、yawsが(yaws.confで設定された中から)最初のものを選択するかどうかを設定できます。
実際の運用においては、普通falseにしたいところですが、テスト・開発段階ではtrueにしたいものです。
use_fdsrv = true | false rootで走らせていなくても、1024以下のポートにbindすることができます。
これには、fd_server と呼ばれる Jungerl パッケージが必要です 。
この機能 はSSL では( まだ ) 動きません。
use_large_ssl_pool = true | false デフォルトで はSSL サーバーは許可処理のペンディングプールを持っています。
SSL 接続はユーザーインタラクションを含んでいます。
ある人がサーバー証明書を見るかどうかのダイアログボックスを見ている時、
我々が複数のSSL許可処理を走らせない限り、他の人は新しい接続を確立できません。
このデフォルト値は8で、もし我々が設定できるなら50にします。
多くの低速接続者が除外される環境下であれば、この設定ができるのも納得できます。
subconfig = File ( 設定ファイル ) 設定ファイルをロードします。 subconfigdir = Directory ( ディレクトリ ) ディレクトリにある全ての設定ファイルをロードします。
バーチャルホスト設 定
yawsは違うIPで複数のWebサーバーを運用するように、同じIPアドレスで複数のWebサーバーをホスティングできます。
SSL付きサーバーは個々のIPアドレスにつき、一つずつ可能という制限はあります。
それぞれのバーチャルホストは、< server ServerName > と </ server > で定義されます。
ServerName は Webサーバーの名称です。
下記のディレクティブはserver定義内に記述することができます。
port = Port ( ポート番号 ) 指定のポートをリッスンします。 listen = IpAddress ( IPアドレス ) このIPをリッスンさせることができます。
同一IP/ポート上で複数のサーバーをホスティングする時、ブラウザが
Host : フィールドを送信しないと、yaws は(この)設定ファイルに書かれた最初のサーバーを返すでしょう。
もしIPアドレス に 0.0.0.0 が記述されていたらyawsは記述されたポートで、全てのローカルIPアドレスをリッスンします。
rhost = Host [ : Port ] サーバーによる内部リダイレクト先をHostにします。
これはユーザーが接続するポートではないポートをリッスンしている場合に有用です。
例えば、80番ポートは権限を持つユーザーによってのみ開かれるので、権限の無いユーザーではリッスンできません。
その代わりにyawsは、高いポート番号、8000番をリッスンし、iptablesが80番へのトラフィックを8000番へリダイレクトします。
( ほとんどのNATファイアウォールもこの仕組みを利用しています)
rscheme = http | https サーバーによる内部リダイレクトが使うスキームを指定します。
これはyawsの前にSSL Offloaderやstunnelがある場合に有用です。
access_log = true | false falseにすると、このバーチャルサーバーのトラフィックログを記録しません。
デフォルトはtrueです。
dir_listings = true | true_nozip | false flaseにするとyaws による自動ディレクトリ表示が許可されなくなります。
ステータスコード403が返されるでしょう。 true_nozipにすると、自動生成されたall.zipエントリを避けます。
deflate = true | false サーバーのためのデフレート圧縮の有効・無効を設定します。 docroot = Directory ... サーバー がDirectoryから全コンテンツを提供するようにします。
スペースで区切りのディレクトリリストを記述できます。
その場合、リクエストされたファイルのために、個々のディレクトリが順に検索されます。
これはssiやyssiを構成する時にも、ssi/yssiインクルードのファイルを探す場合に使われます。
partial_post_size =
Integer yawsが巨大ないくつか のPOST を受ける場合に、それぞれのチャンクにおける受信総量を設定します。
デフォルト は10240です。
dav = true | false このサーバー でDAV プロトコルを有効にします。 tilde_expand = true|false falseを 設定すると、チルダー拡張を行いません 。
チルダー拡張と は
http://www.foo.com/~username
へのリクエストを 、
~username / public_html/
をdocrootとするリクエストへ変換するメカニズムです。
デフォルトはfalseです。
allowed_scripts = [ ListOfSuffixes ] 許可するスクリプトタイプを指定します。
「 yaws 」「 cgi 」 「 php」が認識されます 。
デフォルトは「 allowed_scripts = yaws」です。
appmods = [ ListOfModuleNames ] コンポーネントとし てListOfModuleNamesにある名前が、リクエストのパス中にある場合、パスリクエストのパースは終了し、そのモジュールが呼び出されます。
もし、内部のerlangモジュール名をURLパスの中にさらしたくなければ、appmodを記述するための両義的なシンタックスもあります。
以下のように書けます。
appmods = < Path1 , Module1 > < Path2 , Modules2 > ... このようにしたとすると、
http://www.hyber.org/myapp/foo/bar/baz?user=joe
このよう なURLを使えます。
モジュールfooをappmodとして定義している間、foo:out( Arg)という関数が、foo以下のファイルを探す代わりに呼び出されます。
Arg引数は、そのappmodデータフィールドにおいて供給されていた失われたパス部分です。
errormod_404 = Module 404 Not Found メッセージを扱うモジュールを指定できます。
Module : out404 ( Arg , GC , SC ) 関数が呼び出されます 。
引数は、
Arg は #arg{} レコード 、
GC は # gconf{} レコード ( yaws.hrlで 定 義 )
SC は # sconf{} レコード ( yaws.hrlで 定 義 )
関数は通常の out / 1 が行うのと同じことができるし、するべきです。
errormod_crash = Module サーバークラッシュメッセージのHTML生成を扱うモジュールを指定できます。
デフォルトでは整形済みクラッシュメッセージをブラウザに表示します。
これはデバッグでは有用ですが、実際の運用ではそうではありません。
Module:crashmsg( Arg , SC , Str ) 関数が呼ばれます 。
Strは文字列として整形された実際のクラッシュメッセージです。
arg_rewrite_mod = Module yaws サーバーの初期段階で、全て
のArg #arg{} レコードを書き換えるモジュールをインストールすることができます。
これはCOOKIEのチェック、パスのリライト、その他様々なことに利用できます。
start_mod = Module ユーザー定義のコールバックモジュールを定義できます。
サーバースタート時に 、Module : start /1 が呼ばれます。
#sconf{} レコード( yaws.hrlで定義)が入力引数として利用されます。
これにより、ユーザーアプリケーションに、ユーザーの記述した設定データ(<opaque>コンテキストの説明を参照)の取得に加え、スタートアップをyawsサーバーと同期させることができます。
revproxy = Prefix
Url yaws サーバーをリバースプロキシーにできます。
Prefix は内部のdocrootパス 、Url 引数 はPrefixパスで 「 マウント」したいウェブサイトを指すURLです。
例：revproxy = /tmp / foo http://yaws.hyber.org
は、hyberのサイト を /tmp/foo のもとに表示させます。
同一サーバー内で複数のリバースプロキシを持つことが可能です。
警告：この機能はまだ製品レベルの品質ではありません。
servername = Name いくつかのバーチャルホストを立てていて
、Host : ヘッダーとマッチさせたい場合、このディレクティブによって行うことができるようになります。
この名前は特定 のNATシナリオのもとでは、< server Name>の名前と同じである必要はありません。
滅多に使われない機能です。
< ssl > .... </ssl > このサーバーにおけるSSL設定の始まりと終わりを示します。 keyfile =
File 証明に使われるプライベートキーを含むファイルを指定します。 certfile =
File サーバー証明書を含むファイルを指定します。 cacertfile サーバーがクライアント証明書を必要とするセットアップであれば、ファイルを。
このファイルは、クライアント証明のための許可可能なサイン者の全ての証明書を含んでいる必要があります。
verify = 1 | 2 | 3 クライアント証明におけるサーバーの検証レベルを指定します。
1・・何もしない
2・・クライアントへ問い合わせるがクライアントが証明を提示しなくても失敗しない
3・・クライアントの証明を求める
depth =
Int クライアント証明の検証時に、サーバーがフォローできる証明書チェインの深さを指定します。 password =
String プライベートキーがディスクに暗号化されている場合には、文字列。
このpasswordは複合化するための3DESキーです。
ciphers = String SSL Cipher文字列を指定します。
SSL Cipher文字列のシンタックスは、それ自身が多少複雑なサブランケージ(sublanguage )です。
SSL マニュアル の" ciphers " でドキュメント化されています。
</ssl > SSL 定義の終わりです。 < redirect > ... </ redirect > リダイレクトマッピングを記述します。
続く項目は < redirect > </ redirect > 内で許可されています。
Path = [ Scheme ://]
Host [ : Port ]
Path への全てのアクセスが 、
[ Scheme : //]
Host [ : Port ]
Path へリダイレクトされます 。
Scheme と Port はオプションです 。
デフォルトでは、rsheme と rport が( もし定義されていれば ) 使用されます 。
サイトへの全ての参照をリダイレクトする場合は、 " / "
を Pathに指定します 。
< auth > ... </ auth > 認証構造を定義します。
続く項目は < auth > </ auth > 内で許可されています。
dir = Dir WWW - authenticateヘッダーで制御されるディレクトリを指定します。
このディレクトリにアクセスするにはユーザーはパスワードを入力する必要があります。
ディレクトリはdocroot内でなければなりません。
realm = Realm ここで定義したディレクトリ内における、WWW - Authenticate のRealmを指定できます。 authmod = AuthMod 認証モジュールが定義されていれば、そのディレクトリのアクセス時にAuthMod:auth( Arg , Auth ) が呼び出されます 。
auth / 2 関数は true 、false、 {false , realm} 、{appmod , Mod}、のうち一つを返さなければなりません 。
{appmod , Mod} が返された場合 、 Mod:out ( Arg ) の呼び出しがコンテンツの配信に使われます。
これは例えば 、COOKIEによる認証の実装に利用できます。
auth ( ) コールバックは、適切 なCOOKIE ヘッダーがあるかどうかチェックし、無ければ、{appmod , ?MODULE}を返し、同モジュール内の out /1 関数は {redirect_local , " /login.html " } を返します 。
user = User : Password このディレクトリ内では 、User は ブラウザに表示されるポップアップダイアログで Password を入力することでアクセスすることができます。
このディレクティブは一つの < auth > </ auth >内で複数記述できます。
実際の設定で 、User : Password の使い方は1.51をリリースした時に非難されました。
むしろ、そのディレクトリに .yaws_auth ファイルを置いたほうが良いのです。
. yaws_auth ファイルは file : consult/1 によってパースされうるファイルです。
ファイルの各行は以下のような項が含まれます。
{ User , Password} .
User、Password、共に文字列です。
. yaws_auth ファイル方式は(まだ ) 再帰的ではありません。
従って、サブディレクトリは自動的には保護されません。
.yaws_auth ファイルはディレクトリリスト内には表示されません。
pam service = pam - service pamが認証構造の一部である場合 、Yaws は pam service で示され た" pam " を使って認証を試みます 。
多くのサービス は /etc / pam.d 以下にあります。
大抵の値は " system - auth " などです 。
pam認証 はErlangポートプログラムによって実行されます。
このプログラムは普通、yawsのインストールプログラムによって、suid rootとしてインストールされます。
</auth > auth定義の終わりです。 < opaque > .... </opaque > このサーバーに対するOpaqueの設定をします。
「 Key = Value」 のディレクティブを記述できます 。
これらのディレクティブはyawsには無視されます(なので Opaque(不透明)と言う)が、これらは、#sconf.opaque レコードに { Key , Value}タプルのリストとして保持され、アクセスできます。
start_mod ディレクティブも参照してください。
この仕組みは各 . yaws ページに関連するアプリケーションへデータを渡すのに利用されます。
設定サンプ ル
下記の例は、80番ポートをリッスンする一つのサーバーを定義します。
logdir = /var / log/ yaws < server www.mydomain.org> port = 80 listen = 192.168.128.31 docroot = /var / yaws/www </ server >
そして、この例は上のと似ていますが、同一IPで二つのサーバーを定義しています。
logdir = /var / log/ yaws < server www.mydomain.org> port = 80 listen = 192.168.128.31 docroot = /var / yaws/www </server > < server www.funky.org> port = 80 listen = 192.168.128.31 docroot = /var / yaws/www_funky_org </ server >
この例は WWW 認証をして、アクセスログを取りません。
logdir = /var / log/ yaws < server www.mydomain.org> port = 80 listen = 192.168.128.31 docroot = / var / yaws / www access_log = false < auth > dir = secret / dir1 realm = foobar user = jonny : verysecretpwd user = benny : thequestion user = ronny : havinganamethatendswithy </ auth > </ server >
この例では、ユーザー設定に加え、最初にユーザー定義のモジュールを呼び出します。
< server www.funky.org> port = 80 listen = 192.168.128.31 docroot = /var / yaws/www_funky_org start_mod = btt < opaque > mydbdir = /tmp mylogdir = /tmp/log </opaque > </ server >
最後に、同一IPで二つのサーバーを立て、別のIPでSSLサーバーを立てる、という少し複雑な例です。
同一IP で一つ以上のサーバーがあり、それぞれ異なった名前を持つ場合、クライアントが
Host : ヘッダーを送信しない場合に、それらのうちから一つ選べるようにしなければなりません。
yawsはconfファイルで定義された一番最初のものを選ぶでしょう。
logdir = /var / log / yaws max_num_cached_files = 8000 max_num_cached_bytes = 6000000 < server www.mydomain.org> port = 80 listen = 192.168.128.31 docroot = /var / yaws/www </server > < server www.funky.org> port = 80 listen = 192.168.128.31 docroot = /var / yaws/www_funky_org </ server > < server www.funky.org> port = 443 listen = 192.168.128.32 docroot = /var /yaws/www_funky_org < ssl > keyfile =
/etc/funky.key certfile = /etc/funky.cert password = gazonk </ssl > </ server >

Why I hate race - baiting columns
2007-02-28 18:58:29 PST
-- WHAT PEOPLE in the news business want to know is :
How did the " Why I hate blacks " column by Kenneth Eng that ran in AsianWeek Feb. 23 ever make it by the paper 's editors ?
AsianWeek announced yesterday that Eng had been dismissed and editor - at - large Ted Fang acknowledged a " failing of our editorial process " at a press conference with the NAACP .
I still want to know : Did editors think that running a racist column would be cutting edge ?
That an Asian Ann Coulter wannabe would create buzz ?
That they could get away with running racist copy because it is a publication serving an Asian - American audience ?
Presumably AsianWeek management will provide an explanation at a Friday town meeting billed as an open discussion on " the media 's role and responsibility in fostering dialogue that leads to a greater understanding between Asian and African American communities . "
That 's high - minded language from a paper that published a column that listed among " reasons we should discriminate against blacks " the assertion that blacks are " weak - willed " and " the only race that has been enslaved for 300 years . "
No AsianWeek manager can claim surprise at the column .
Eng is a self - described " Asian supremacist , " who wrote a " Why I hate Asians " column in January .
In November he wrote , " White people hate us and will always hate us . "
Unlike the anti-black column , those columns sparked no Chronicle story and no City Hall resolution against AsianWeek .
" It 's kind of shocking that those two other articles did not bring the level of attention " to AsianWeek as the anti-black article , San Francisco Supervisor Ed Jew , who is an Asian American , told me .
Jew believes the anti-Asian and anti-white columns should have received the same scrutiny as the anti-black screed .
Except the Special City has a way of making excuses for bigotry and intolerance -- when they percolate from the left or ethnic groups .
Imagine if a white columnist or conservative politician had made the same remarks about African Americans .
You would n't see NAACP dons flocking to a post - slur town meeting .
It does n't hurt that AsianWeek is published by the politically wired Fang family .
How can it be racist for Joe Biden to say Barack Obama is " articulate , " but an opportunity when an AsianWeek columnist calls blacks " easy to coerce ? "
Yet that was the response to Delaware Sen .
Biden 's comments , while here in San Francisco , African American leaders ' response to Eng 's writings was that this was an opportunity for dialogue about race .
On the bright side , at least the purveyors of this ethnic slur are not trying to hide behind the First Amendment .
Be it noted , Eng has the First Amendment right to express his low opinion of black people .
As San Francisco State journalism professor Yumi Wilson explained over the phone , bloggers post this sort of racist rhetoric every day .
But it 's also important to note that AsianWeek has the First Amendment right to refuse to print Eng 's copy , as well as a responsibility not to print fact - free racist rants .
If the Eng column were not a collection of ignorant generalizations without qualifiers , Wilson noted , if it had been based on research and interviews , if Eng had addressed how some Asians feel about some blacks , that would be " a whole different story . "
Instead , Eng treated readers to sweeping and inaccurate stereotypes -- even as he bemoaned what he perceived as unacceptable Asian stereotypes .
" Blacks hate us , " Eng wrote .
" Every Asian who has ever come across them knows that they take almost every opportunity to hurl racist remarks at us . "
Wilson , who noted that Eng " did touch a chord with some Asian Americans , " also remarked on how inaccurate that unqualified statement about hatred was .
She knows :
Her father is African American father and her late mother , Japanese American .
News organizations have a responsibility to print copy that withstands vetting .
As for Eng 's work , Wilson noted , " It 's not journalism , and it 's not acceptable . "
How deep are we in it over the politicization of the Justice Department ( and probably others ) under the Bush " administration ? "
Way deep .
This is a planned disaster .
A burning of all bridges and a scorching of all escape routes .
In other words , the routine Republican m.o. : destroy all paths back to the status quo , so that even if our theories do n't pan out , nobody can pull them out by the roots -- they can only tinker with the ruins .
The invaluable Charlie Savage of the Boston Globe ( he of the " signing statements " reportage ) has a new blockbuster on the role played by Pat Robertson 's Regent University in the politicization of the federal government bureaucracy , and specifically the Department of Justice .
Josh Marshall David Kurtz gives us the key paragraph and what it means :
Sadly , I think the politicization of the Department of Justice is going to turn out to be even worse than we may have thought initially .
The Boston Globe has a long piece today on Regent University , alma mater of Monica Goodling and scores of other Bush Administration appointees .
Here 's the part that indicates how long the politicization has been going on and how deeply ingrained it may now be in the department :
Their path to employment was further eased in late 2002 , when John Ashcroft , then attorney general , changed longstanding rules for hiring lawyers to fill vacancies in the career ranks .
Previously , veteran civil servants screened applicants and recommended whom to hire , usually picking top students from elite schools .
Emptywheel draws a bead on Regent U. grad Monica Goodling 's activities :
I hate to keep harping on this point .
But it seems pretty damn likely that Monica Goodling was right at the center of the inappropriate politicization of career DOJ employees .
You see , I think it highly likely that one of the reasons Goodling is pleading the Fifth is because she caused Paul McNulty to commit perjury .
But another reason -- a much bigger one , given the centrality of the politicization of DOJ hiring to the scandal surrounding the USA purge , is because she committed regular violations of the laws in place to prevent the politicization of our career employees .
And to complete the tag - team , Atrios :
[ The next ] president is not only going to have to deal with this disaster in Iraq , but also a federal government which has been staffed from top to bottom with career ideological Bushies who will fully understand that their job in a Democratic administration is to take it down .
I wrote earlier about this unfolding scandal that Bush , Rove and Gonzales have now done for the prosecution of public corruption what they 've done for impeachment .
That is , just as they 've made it conventional wisdom to immediately reject the idea of impeachment out of hand as " partisan revenge for Clinton , " or " political tit for tat , " now so too will the investigation of public corruption cases be subject to such summary dismissal .
The long term effects of this scandal are incalculable .
At a time when Republicans are accused of engaging in rampant and systematic public corruption , Rove , Bush and Gonzales have succeeded in making corruption investigations into the same sort of partisan joke that Republicans made impeachment .
And as their crimes come to light in the closing days of their " administration " and into the next , they may well have made it impossible for a Democratic successor to actually pursue justice on behalf of the American people , since any such effort will undoubtedly -- and with a lack of shame that shocks the conscience -- be labeled as " partisan revenge . "
It now seems that the Monica Goodlings of this " administration " have been planting partisan " sleeper cells " among the career civil service ranks -- the very positions that are supposed to be non-partisan and are therefore protected in their tenure by law .
What this means is that the DoJ and other agencies of the executive branch are filled with people who understand that their role in the next Democratic administration -- which will be prohibited by law from rooting them out and firing them for political reasons -- is , as Atrios says , to take that administration down from the inside .
The only way to rid ourselves of them now may be ... to conduct what the false - equivalency merchants of conservative media will compare to exactly the type of politically - motivated purge that the Republicans have been conducting , and for which we now condemn them .
And if it happens , expect more " pox on both their houses ! " spin -- after all , conservatives want Americans to believe that government is the source of all their problems .
What message does this send to current career civil service employees hired during the Bush years ?
That the thoroughgoing corruption of this " administration " has made them suspect , even though they may still be overwhelmingly non-partisan and unconnected with the Bush cabal .
Could otherwise well - meaning and innocent civil servants go down for the Bush Gang 's crimes ?
It seems certain that at least some will come under scrutiny , and of course , nothing would please the Bush junta more than to see innocent bystanders pay for their transgressions in their stead .
What 's the best way to avoid such a fate ?
One way that comes to mind is this :
If you 're a career civil servant and you have evidence of Bush " administration " wrongdoing in your department , start getting ready to offer it up to Congressional investigators .
And if you do n't have it in hand yet , start looking for it .
And Congress ?
You 're going to need to step up with more and better whistle blower protections for these folks if you expect to ever be able to put this right .
Absent some overt declaration now that things have gone completely haywire within the executive branch -- and impeachment comes to mind here -- the next Democrat to win the White House will be unable to reestablish control over the executive without falling into this trap .
What does it mean to be to be ALT .
NET ?
In short it signifies :
You ’re the type of developer who uses what works while keeping an eye out for a better way .
You reach outside the mainstream to adopt the best of any community : Open Source , Agile , Java , Ruby , etc .
You ’re not content with the status quo .
Things can always be better expressed , more elegant and simple , more mutable , higher quality , etc .
You know tools are great , but they only take you so far .
It ’s the principles and knowledge that really matter .
The best tools are those that embed the knowledge and encourage the principals ( e.g. Resharper . )
When tools , practices , or methods become mainstream it ’s time to get contrarian ; time to look for new ways of doing things ; time to shake it up .
The minute Entity Framework surpasses NHibernate , I mean the very instant it empowers me to better express my intent , so long NHibernate .
It ’s been real , it ’s been nice , but I ’m on to the better thing .

As part of my work on Hoogle 4 I 've been bashing my deferred binary library quite a lot .
I encountered one bug which I had n't considered , and was able to come up with a solution , using phantom types .
I 've read about phantom types before , but never actually put them into practice !
The idea of the deferred binary library is that writing instances should be as short as possible - they do n't need to be massively high performance , and I wanted to see if I could do it with minimal boilerplate .
Each instance needs to be able to both save and load a value - which means it needs to do some sort of pattern - match ( to see which value it has ) , and have the constructor available ( to create a new value ) .
The shortest scheme I was able to come up with is :
The idea is that to save a value , you step through the list trying to match each constructor , using Control .
Exception .
catch to see if the value does not match .
Once you have matched , you save an index , and the components .
To load a value , you take the index and pick the correct construction .
This time , you deliberately do not mention any of the fields , and by remaining lazy on the fields , the pattern match is not invoked .
This solution took quite a lot of thought to arrive at , but does minimize the size of the instance declarations .
The instance relies crucially on the laziness / strictness of the functions - the load functionexamine any of its arguments ( or you will pattern - match fail ) , the save functionexamine at least one argument ( to provoke pattern - match failure ) .
After writing a description such as this , I am sure some users will have spotted the issue !
The problem here is 0 - arity constructors , the load code works just fine , but the save code has no fields it can demand to ensure the correct constructor has been reached .
I encountered this bug in Hoogle 4 - it is subtle , and in a pile of instance rules , these 0 - arity cases can easily be overlooked .
The solution is to introduce a new operator , (<

The Pentagon will extend the tours of duty for every active - duty soldier in Iraq and Afghanistan .
As ABC News first reported Tuesday , this plan was in consideration , but will be announced today by the secretary of defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs .
Forget small extensions and trickles of National Guard troops .
Under the plan , deployments for active - duty soldiers will be extended from the current 12 months to 15 months .
This will apply to all active - duty soldiers , but not to the National Guard and Reserve .
" These soldiers have paid the price for this policy for four years .
Now they are being given an additional burden to bear , and it will be a cause of concern for the soldiers and even more so for the families , " said retired Gen. William Nash .
The stress on the Army has been compounded by the surge of additional forces President Bush announced in January , a surge Iraq commander David Petraeus wants to extend .
Senior officials tell ABC News there is now consensus at the Pentagon and the White House that Petraeus is right .
The surge needs to be extended , until at least the end of the year .
Defense officials say extending the surge is simply impossible to do without extending the tours of those troops already there , or dramatically cutting the time soldiers spend back home .
The Army is proposing an across - the - board extension in part because it is considered to be fairer than imposing piecemeal extensions on individual units .
It will also erase uncertainty : Soldiers will know ahead of time how long they 'll be in Iraq .
" A clear policy that applies to all is greatly appreciated by soldiers , " Nash said .
" It is the unknown that is more of a problem . "
This plan will be unwelcome news to soldiers who have already had two and sometimes three deployments in Iraq , but officials say there is something of a silver lining :
Under the plan , soldiers will be guaranteed at least 12 months at home between deployments .
The plan will not affect the 25,000 Marines now serving in Iraq , although there has been discussion at the Pentagon of extending Marine deployments as well .
The Marines currently serve seven - month tours in Iraq .

評判は？それと副作用はないの？
結論から伝えると、私は効果がありましたので評判は間違いないです。
ただ、危ない？ダイエット薬みたいな1ヶ月で30キロマイナスとかはありません。
逆にそんなに痩せたらこわいですよね。
私の場合は、炭水化物の多い食べ物のまえにターミナリアファーストを1日１～2回飲んでました。
この時期なかなか外に出れないので運動しないでいいのは助かりますね。
食べ物はまったくと言っていいほど変えてません。
それだけで3ヶ月で体重が58キロから53キロになりました。
それでこの結果はじゅうぶんかなと思います。
また、副作用もありません。
薬ではないので当たり前ですね。

私がターミナリアファーストを3ヶ月間飲んでみた感想をおつたえしますね。
ターミナリアファーストを飲んでみた！1日目の感想
注文してから3日ほどで届きました。
さっそく食事の前に飲んでみます。
ニオイは漢方みたいなニオイで、味は水で飲んだからなのかあまり気になりません。
まあ、味わって飲むものでもないですしね。
あたりまえですが、特に変化はありません。
ターミナリアファーストを飲んでみた！1ヶ月目の感想
ターミナリアファーストを飲んで1ヶ月がたちます。
食事の前に飲むだけなので楽でいいですね。
一駅てまえから歩いて帰っている効果もあって2キロ減りました。
食事を制限しなくていいのが一番いいですね。
ターミナリアファーストを飲んでみた！3ヶ月目の感想
ターミナリアファーストを飲みはじめて3ヶ月がたちました。
結論からいうと、体重5キロ減りました。
お腹まわりもすっきりしてくびれができたのもいつぶりだろ。
何度か不規則なせいかつが続いて危なかったときもありましたが
欠かさずターミナリアファーストを飲んでなんとか乗り切りました。
同僚にも痩せたねって言われる機会が増えました。
食べることが大好きな私には、食べる前に飲むだけでかんたんだったのが続けられた秘訣だったのかな。
ラーメンや焼き肉もえんりょなく食べれたのは嬉しかった。

悪い口コ ミ
・毎回食事のまえに飲むのがめんどう
・においが苦 手
・ねだんが高 い
・ 1日や1週間では効果を感じられない
においは漢方みたいな感じです。
私はあんまり気にならなかったです。
ずっとにおいをかいでるわけでもないですし
飲むときにはにおいは気にならなかったので。
値段はちゃんと公式サイトから買えば割引もあるので
買う場所をちゃんとすればいいのかなーと思います。
すぐに効果を感じられないって声もありましたが
ほんと、1日とかで痩せたらそれはもう病気だと思います。
そんなサプリ怖くて飲めないですよね。
良い口コ ミ
・好きな食事をがまんしなくて良くなった
・食事後の眠さがなくなった。以前は食事後に眠くなることが多くて困っていた
・食べ過ぎたことによる罪悪感が減った
・食べる前に飲むだけなのでかんたんで続けることができた

A fan holds an album by " The Doors " near the tomb of Jim Morrison in Paris , in a file photo .
Two fans have asked Florida to pardon the rock bad - boy , who was convicted of exposing himself during a Miami concert nearly 40 years ago .
REUTERS / John Schults
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Two fans have asked Florida to pardon rock bad - boy Jim Morrison , the late lead singer for The Doors , who was convicted of exposing himself during a Miami concert nearly 40 years ago .
The two men , Kerry Humpherys of Utah and David Diamond of Ohio , sent a letter to Florida Gov. Charlie Crist last month asking him to issue a full pardon to Morrison on two misdemeanor charges of indecent exposure and using profanity .
“ I ’m a big Doors fan .
There are thousands of Doors fans out there who look up to Jim Morrison .
It was all trumped up and he should n’t have this hanging over him , ” said Humpherys , who runs a Doors fan magazine .
Morrison ’s trouble with the law stemmed from his notorious appearance at a Coconut Grove concert in 1969 at a time when Miami was a conservative southern city .
Police said Morrison rolled down his leather pants and simulated masturbation on stage .
Some witnesses disagreed , saying Morrison had only simulated exposing himself .
Morrison was sentenced to six months in jail and a $ 500 fine , but was released pending appeal .
The appeal had not been heard when he was found dead in the bath of his Paris apartment on July 3 , 1971 , apparently of a lethal mix of alcohol and drugs .
The Doors were one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s , with hits like “ Light My Fire , ” “ Hello , I Love You ” and “ Riders on the Storm . ”
Any pardon for Morrison would be decided by Crist , a Republican , and members of Florida ’s Cabinet .
The Miami Herald noted that both Morrison and Crist attended Florida State University , where sports teams are nicknamed the Seminoles .
“ He ’s a ‘ Nole ?
Well , given that fact , I ’m certainly willing to review it , ” Crist was quoted as saying in Tuesday ’s Herald .
The newspaper said Crist then sang a few lines of “ Light My Fire . ”
The United States and its Latin American allies are losing a major battle in the war on drugs , according to indicators that show cocaine prices dipped for most of 2006 and U.S. users were getting more bang for their buck .
Despite billions of dollars in U.S. antidrug spending and record seizures , statistics recently released by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy suggest that cocaine is as available as ever .
Cocaine users and law enforcement officials both care about price and purity .
Authorities work to choke off supply , driving up cost and dampening street sales .
Users want better coke at cheaper prices .
In 2005 , John P. Walters , the head of the drug policy office , made headlines touting a surge in cocaine prices and falling levels of quality .
Those figures indicated that U.S. drug control policies were working , he said .

But the new numbers issued by his office indicate that any victory was short - lived .
Retail cocaine prices last year fell more than 12 % from January to October , while average purity of cocaine seized by authorities rose from about 68 % to 73 % .
And this time , the drug policy office did little to publicize the figures , releasing them in a letter to U.S. Sen.
Charles E. Grassley ( R - Iowa ) .
The new statistics emboldened critics who say the Bush administration ’s antidrug strategies need to change .
“ You can spin this any way you want , but when prices go down and supply goes up , the fact of the matter is that this policy is not working , ” said U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern ( D - Mass. ) , a longtime critic who supports spending more on economic development .
Since the Iraq war began more than four years ago , the Pentagon has sharply reduced spending on air and sea surveillance of trafficking routes in the Pacific and Caribbean .
The centerpiece of the U.S. strategy against cocaine has shifted to Plan Colombia , which funds aerial fumigation of coca plants .
Colombian growers supply 90 % of U.S. users through Mexican smuggling rings that control the cocaine and marijuana trade .

“ Crop control is the most cost - effective means of cutting supply , ” according to the 2007 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , issued by the U.S. State Department .
Last year , Colombia reported it had destroyed more than half a million acres of coca plants .
But growers have responded to the fumigation by breaking up their crops into smaller areas in an apparently successful hide - and - seek strategy .
U.S. officials estimate that as much as 800 tons of cocaine still was exported from Colombia .
Patrick Ward , deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , said the Colombia eradication program kept 350 tons of cocaine from being produced .
But critics say that availability of cocaine in most U.S. cities is evidence of failure .

“ In 2005 , more coca was grown in Colombia than they had in 2000 , when Plan Colombia started , ” said Adam Isacson , a Colombia analyst for the Center for International Policy , a Washington think tank .
“ They can say , ‘ Look how much more coke we ’d have without fumigation , ’ but that sounds pretty lame . ”
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe traveled to Washington this week to lobby for continued U.S. support amid allegations of ties between his government and illegal paramilitary groups .
Colombia has received $ 4.7 billion since 2000 .
The continued high production in Colombia is also troubling news for Mexico , which reaps the cocaine trade ’s greatest profits and bears the brunt of its costs .
More than 2,000 deaths last year were attributed to an ongoing battle among rival drug gangs for control of smuggling routes .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon in December deployed the army to stem the bloodshed .
But the killings continue at or ahead of last year ’s pace .
In January , Mexico extradited several key drug trafficking figures to face trial in U.S. courts , including the alleged head of the country ’s east coast - based cartel .
More extraditions are expected .

But continuing violence and a steady supply of cocaine crossing into the U.S. from Mexico have many questioning Calderon ’s strategy as well as Washington’s .
“ The standard that economists would use on extradition would be that it frees up the market , ” said Peter Reuter , an economist and drug policy expert at Rand Corp .
“ If you ’re Mexico , you care about reducing the capability of these organizations to execute people in large numbers .
But the idea that it will stop cocaine is wrong . ”
Mexico ’s army operations , historically , have been effective only in the short term , said Jose Luis Pineyro , a military affairs expert in Mexico City .
“ After the military leaves , the narcos come back . ”

HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) --
Stocks slumped throughout the Asia - Pacific region Wednesday , with Japan 's benchmark Nikkei 225 ending 2.9 % lower after Wall Street 's sharp sell - off and the yen 's strengthening against major currencies .
Shares in Hong Kong , China and throughout the Asia - Pacific region also posted sharp declines .
And some analysts suggested the downtrend is n't over yet .
" We are seeing a domino effect ; the consolidation looks like it might continue for a while until the problems in the U.S. are resolved , " said Alex Tang , head of research at Core Pacific - Yamaichi in Hong Kong .
Tokyo's 225 - issue Nikkei average ( 1804610 ) declined 501.95 points to 16,676.89 .
The finish was its biggest single - day point drop and lowest closing level since March 5 , when the benchmark swooned 575.68 points to 16,642.25 .
The broad - market Topix index closed 2.9 % lower , or 50.49 points , to 1,674.94 .
Big losses on Wall Street for all the major U.S. indexes , along with growing uncertainty about the U.S. economy -- particularly in the housing sector and in the subprime lending market -- weighed on stock markets throughout the region .
Analysts said the downward momentum in Tokyo was fueled by futures - related selling and a lack of buying from institutional funds in the wind - down to the fiscal year - end .
" Stocks have been caught in downward selling spiral , and volume has been much lower this week , " said Yoji Takeda , head of Asian Equity Management at RBC Investment Management Asia .
" Usually domestic investors should be buying , but this is really close to the end of the fiscal year , so they can't really move . "
Hong Kong , China shares weaker
Hong Kong 's Hang Seng Index ( 1804580 ) ended 2.6 % lower at 18,836.93 .
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index , a gauge which tracks Hong Kong - listed shares of mainland companies , fell 2.9 % to 9,002.48 .
Core Pacific 's
Tang said he was concerned that problems in the U.S. subprime - mortgage market could catalyze a wider credit contraction , resulting in slowing growth in the world 's largest economy and Asia 's most important export market .
" The market will remain quite volatile in the short term , " he said .
" We are not expecting any major rally or comeback because of these overhangs . "
Tang said he expects the Hang Seng to find support at the 18,000 level .
Shares of Nikko Cordial ( 8603 ) closed 13 % higher after Citigroup C , - 2.12 % said Tuesday it would sweeten its buyout offer by 26 % to 1,700 yen a share , bringing its bid for all shares of Japan 's third - largest brokerage to $ 13.4 billion .
The revised offer follows the decision by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and other Japanese exchange operators not to delist Nikko Cordial following an accounting scandal that came to light in December .
The U.S. dollar fell into the upper -115 - yen area late Wednesday in Tokyo , reversing a mild rebound throughout the day after coming under strong selling pressure overnight .
Mortgage woes continue
Shares of HSBC Holdings Plc ( 5 ) HBC , +0.48 % fell 1.5 % .
Earlier this month Europe 's largest bank reported 2006 pretax profit in its U.S. personal - banking division fell $ 725 million , owing to rising loan defaults .
The U.S. Mortgage Bankers Association said on Tuesday that the rate of homes entering the foreclosure process in the fourth quarter hit a record 0.54 % and the delinquency rates on U.S. home loans rose to 4.95 % from 4.67 % in the preceding quarter .
Delinquencies among subprime mortgages , or those offered to poorer borrowers with lower credit scores , increased to 13.33 % , up from 12.56 % in the preceding quarter .
Elsewhere in Asia , Australia 's S&P / ASX 200 ended 2.1 % lower , and in Seoul the Kospi fell 2 % .

China 's retail sales rose 14.7 % in the first two months of the year , up from a 12.5 % gain in the same period a year earlier , government data showed Wednesday .
Exporters hit again
Japanese export - related shares declined for a second session on concerns that overseas earnings could be crimped by the more valuable yen .
A stronger Japanese currency makes exporters ' goods more expensive overseas while lowering the value of overseas sales when they are converted back into yen .
Shares of consumer electronics giant Sony Corp. ( 6758 ) SNE , +0.25 % ended 4.1 % lower , while Toyota Motor ( 7203 ) TM , - 1.29 % shares slid 3.2 % .

The deal will see two advanced pressurized - water units installed at TXU 's nuclear facility in Dallas .
The reactors are expected to come on line as early as 2015 , the report said .
Quick sell - off or protracted decline ?
Shares of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. , ( 388 ) operator of the city 's stock and futures exchanges , tumbled 4.9 % as investors reduced positions amid concerns the sell - off could just be the start of a protracted market decline .

The front - month April contract fell 98 cents to close at $ 57.93 a barrel in Tuesday 's trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
I was thinking about something today .
I really like dick .
I like the shape of it , the smell of it , the juice that it produces .
There 's nothing better than that feeling of initial penetration by a dick , feeling it part you , slide within , be gripped by your pussy muscles as if you were hugging it .
I really , really like dick .
I also really like tits .
As I was cruising through Victoria 's Secret and trying to get glimpses of the chests of the women who were shopping around me .
I was wondering which of them were benefitting from a great bra , getting their girls in prime shape .
I wondered which were padded , which had big nipples , dark areolas ... all that fun stuff .
I love to fondle my own tits and even know when their consistency changes .
So it hit me .
I really need to get myself a tranny for a lover .
The best of both worlds , especially in my case .
A pre-op who still has that beautiful cock as well as having a set of titties for me to play with .
It sounds great in theory .
In reality I understand that most pre-ops want to get rid of their dick and do n't like to identify with it .
They 're taking hormone replacements that would fuck with the size of that penis .
The breasts would be smaller or fake .
But it was a nice thought .
I 've always been fascinated with people who are gender dysphoric or in some other type of gender flux .
I 'm extremely transfixed by lesbians who look like hot young guys .
I feel intimidated by drag queens who look better than I do on my best day .
I can't look them in the eye , not because I 'm afraid but because I feel I 'm not worthy .
This really incredible creature who is willing to buck the ultimate system .
When you look at your gender and say : " Nope , this is n't me , " I just love that .
I think I nearly sweated straight through my panties when one night I opened a blog by one of my Myspazz buddies , and discovered that she 'd taken a series of pictures where she dressed in a suit and did a strip tease , slowly removing her clothing to reveal her chest bindings and then her DD chest .
( Nipple rings and all ! ! )
I giggled like an idiot for a couple hours afterward .
I could n't get over how much those pictures had twisted my mind in circles .
A boy who turned out to have tits ?
Dear Awesome !
I was in heaven at the possibility of it .
Sure , I understand that if those pictures were to have also contained pictures of her removing her pants , a vagina would have been at the pinnacle of her two long legs ... but damn .
I 'm more at ease around lesbians , even those who are rather butch .
I 've been hit on and approached by several over the years .
The flirtation is much more respectful than I 've ever had with men and I am never put off .
It 's extremely flattering and I end up apologizing profusely for not being gay .
I would if I thought I could pull it off .
However , I own several dildos and vibrators .
While they 're great and do their jobs just fine , I would be a sad camper if I had to live a life without a living , blood engorged cock in it .
I need that skin feeling , I need to feel that penetration .
I need to grab onto the person it 's attached to and hear them moan in my ear as they cum .
Men may have their issues and I may have my issues with them , but that moment where they are the most vulnerable is enough to make me forget those issues , if only temporarily .
I love a man 's orgasm .
I 'm feeling all over the place tonight , which is fitting for what keeps going on in my head .
I do n't want to feel sexual and yet my hormones are going crazy .
It 's so fucking troublesome .

Nikkos : " Why Sy Hersh is Wrong ( just this once ) "
Spot The Arab ( by their style of doorway )
Thanks to NIKKOS who contributed this great piece on Sy Hersh - THANKS NIKKOS !
Hersh 's latest piece in the New Yorker is as terrifying as usual .
Among
other things , it posits a shift ( the " redirection " of the article 's title )
in the Bush administrations ' strategy in the Middle East , specifically , an
explicit decision to support Sunnis rather than Shia .
If true , this would
represent a stunning reversal in alliances , considering it was the
virulently Sunni Al Qaeda that attacked the U.S. on 9/11 and that the U.S .
is currently fighting a counter - insurgency war against Sunnis in support of
the Shia Maliki government in Iraq .
However , for anyone that 's been watching
the unfolding disaster which is the Bush administration , these sorts of
vertigo - inducing paradoxes are par for the course .
As usual , it 's hard to tell if these are acts of stupidity , strategy or
desperation .
The mind reels and grasps for a " logical " explanation , a
narrative which can impose some semblance of order upon the chaos which Bush
and his cronies seem to foment everywhere they traipse .
And it is here where
I think Hersh - or more accurately and fairly , his sources - get it wrong .
They get it wrong because they seek to make to make sense out of what the
Bush administration is doing , when there is , literally , no sense to be made
of the situation .
Or , to use a favorite phrase of the President , " in other
words , " what 's going on here is not a rational re-alignment of alliances and
interests in the pursuit of some rational goal - democracy , peace and
stability in the Middle East , for instance .
Rather , as has been amply
documented , the Bush administration believes in " constructive chaos " in the
Middle East ; that is , the belief that , phoenix - like , a modern Middle East
can emerge only from the flames of destruction .
Therefore , conflict is to be
embraced , not feared , for it is only through conflict that the Middle East
can be reborn ( though there may be some " pangs , " as Condi pointed out ) .
When viewed in this context , then , Hersh 's reporting makes more sense : it 's
not that we are switching sides ; we 're merely making sure both sides are
properly armed and that as a whole , the region is left perpetually
off - balance and unable to respond with any unity to the increasing hegemony
of the United States .
The increased tempo of this destabilization may in
fact be part and parcel of an impending military strike against Iran - what
better way to blunt a unified Middle Eastern response than to make sure the
locals are busy fighting each other ?
Heck , it 's just like in the good ol '
days when we armed Saddam on the one hand and clandestinely armed the
Iranians on the other .
( Interestingly enough , Iran - Contra is back in the
news , with reports that Negroponte stepped down from DNI in order to go to
State precisely to avoid another Iran - Contra - like debacle which he saw
brewing . )
So , yes , it IS a redirection - but not the kind Sy Hersh 's sources envision .

That is an extraordinary concession compared with the Christian apologias that dominate conferences devoted to reconciling science and religion .
The " dialogues " implicitly begin with nonnegotiables -- " Given that Jesus died on the cross and was bodily resurrected into heaven . . . " -- then seek scientific justification for what is already assumed to be true .
The story of how someone so open - minded became the Tibetan Buddhist equivalent of the pope reads like a fairy tale .
When the 13th Dalai Lama died in 1933 he was facing northeast , so a spiritual search team was sent in that direction to find his reincarnation .
The quest narrowed further when a lama had a vision pointing to a certain house with unusual gutters .
Inside a boy called out to the visitors , who showed him some toys and relics that would have belonged to him in his previous life .
" It is mine ! " he exclaimed , like any acquisitive 2 - year - old , and so his reign began .
Once installed in Lhasa , the new Dalai Lama happened upon another of his forerunner 's possessions , a collapsible brass telescope .
When he focused it one evening on what Tibetans call " the rabbit on the moon , " he saw that it consisted of shadows cast by craters .
Although he knew nothing yet about astronomy , he inferred that the moon , like the earth , must be lighted by the sun .
He had experienced the thrill of discovery .
Before long he was dismantling and repairing clocks and watches and tinkering with car engines and an old movie projector .
As he grew older and traveled the world , he was as keen to meet with scientists and philosophers -- David Bohm , Carl von Weizsäcker , Karl Popper -- as with religious and political leaders .
More recently his " Mind and Life " conferences have brought physicists , cosmologists , biologists and psychologists to Dharamsala , India , where he now lives in exile from the Chinese occupation of Tibet .
He and his guests discuss things like the neuroscientific basis of Buddhist meditation and the similarities between Eastern concepts like the " philosophy of emptiness " and modern field theory .
In " The Universe in a Single Atom " he tells how he walked the mountains around his home trying to persuade hermits to contribute to scientific understanding by meditating with electrodes on their heads .
But when it comes to questions about life and its origins , this would - be man of science begins to waver .
Though he professes to accept evolutionary theory , he recoils at one of its most basic tenets : that the mutations that provide the raw material for natural selection occur at random .
Look deeply enough , he suggests , and the randomness will turn out to be complexity in disguise -- " hidden causality , " the Buddha 's smile .
There you have it , Eastern religion 's version of intelligent design .
He also opposes physical explanations for consciousness , invoking instead the existence of some kind of irreducible mind stuff , an idea rejected long ago by mainstream science .
Some members of the Society for Neuroscience are understandably uneasy that he has been invited to give a lecture at their annual meeting this November .
In a petition , they protested that his topic , the science of meditation , is known for " hyperbolic claims , limited research and compromised scientific rigor . "

For some reason I found most of these to be just as funny as they are interesting .
What did you think ?
In 1948 , Alan Turing wrote : " An unwillingness to admit the possibility that mankind can have any rivals in intellectual power occurs as much amongst intellectual people as amongst others : they have more to lose . "
Accordingly , comprehensive comparisons between the intellectual powers of great apes and humans are rare - perhaps because we feel safe in assuming that the human intellect is in all ways superior to that of other primates .
But recent work suggests this assumption may not be entirely sound .
For example , a recent New Scientist article ( via NeuroEthics ) contains a provocative statement by primatologist Tetsuro Matsuzawa , who argues that chimps may systematically outperform humans in certain tests of short - term memory .
Given a task in which subjects must press stimuli in the order in which they appeared , all of the adult chimps tested have been equal or superior in performance to humans .
This trend holds when the comparison is between adult chimps and adult humans , as well as between chimpanzee infants and human infants .
Perhaps just as surprisingly , children are frequently better at these games than adults , both in humans and chimpanzees .
This finding meshes well with previous indications that , like the great apes , children may in specific cases be intellectually superior to human adults .
For example , Elman has shown how limitations in working memory span - characteristic of children - can in some cases result in language learning benefits ( although the applicability of this model to the real world has been hotly debated ) .
Other work has shown that human children are in some cases better able to inhibit false memories than human adults are .
Finally , Fisher & Sloutsky have shown that children in some cases have better recognition memory than adults .
Mindblog has recently pointed out this new Science article by Pennisi , in which the author argues that the higher cognitive capacities of animals have been only recently appreciated , based on the recent emergence of the view that intelligence arises from the demands of social living .
According to this view , higher cognitive skills become an exaptation , in which they found use not only in social settings but also in more everday situations ( e.g. , finding ripe fruit and later remembering its location ) .
In the same article , Pennisi details how we managed for so long to overlook the startlingly advanced cognitive skills of higher primates .
" Apes rarely did well on self - awareness , memory , gaze - following , gesture , spatial learning , and other tests at which even young children excel , " writes Pennisi , but " 6 years ago , Hare and his colleagues showed that under the right circumstances , chimps could pass some of these tests with flying colors .
The secret was that chimps are exquisitely tuned in to their competition , particularly when food is involved , and will do everything they can to get a treat .
" The implications for developmental approaches to intelligence are startling .
We know that social interaction is a critical part of human development ; to what extent might the current lack of " social interaction " among artificial intelligences influence their potential ?
Of course , there are a few notable exceptions to the idea that current AI is socially isolated , but in large part , this aspect of intelligence development remains relatively unexplored .

In this article there are some interesting photos of a few Russian churches made in 1910 and today .
The fact that makes them more interesting the 1910 photos are color photos also !
Russian photographer Sergei Prokudin - Gorskii ( 1863-1944 ) received a few patents for his color photo technique .
He traveled across Russia in the beginning of the 20th century and made thousands of photos .
I visited his exhibition and the photos are really stunning , especially when you understand that they were made 100 years ago but are fully in color .
That ’s a real lost world of Russia before the Soviet era , before WW2 and WW1 .
Prokudin - Gorskii left Russia in 1918 , going first to Norway and England before settling in France .
By then , the tsar and his family had been executed during the Russian Revolution , and the Communist rule had been established over what was once the Russian Empire .
His unique images of Russia on the eve of the revolution — recorded on glass plates — were purchased by the United States ’ Library of Congress in 1948 from his heirs .
In 2001 , the Library of Congress produced an exhibition , The Empire that was Russia .
For this exhibition , the glass plates were scanned and color images were produced digitally from the scanned red , green , and blue monochrome images , using a process called Digichromatography which was developed by Walter Frankhauser .
In 2004 , the Library contracted with Blaise Agüera y Arcas to produce an automated color composite of each of the 1,902 negatives from the high resolution digital images of the glass plate negatives .
A complete description of his process and a list of other sites that have prepared digital color composite images are in the collection profile at the Library of Congress .
And here are the few photos of some churches in Seliger region that were made by Prokudin - Gorskii almost 100 years ago and each photo goes with a corresponding photo of the same place made nowadays .
Church in Ostashkov small town , 96 years ago .
Check out the horse coach on the right .
In the beginning of the 20th century when in the USA there were already 1,000,000 people in Russia there were only a few hundreds of passenger cars , the most common mean of transport was a horse powered transport .
Church in Ostashkov small town , today .
Today there are almost no horse coaches , and even some road signs .

Times goes by , buildings appear and disappear , people are born and pass away but the nature , the sun , the shades , the greener stays the same , and that can be clearly seen from these photos .

Hiring a car can now mean leaving a fingerprint .
And check - out staff are scanning the customers as well as the shopping .
Biometrics are entering every day life .
Getting your fingerprints taken would once have meant only one thing .
You were helping the police with their inquiries .
Now such " biometric " identification is entering the mainstream of every day life .
If you want to hire a car at Stansted Airport , you now need to give a fingerprint .
The scheme being tested by Essex police and car hire firms , is not voluntary .
Every car rental customer must take part .
No fingerprint , no car hire at Stansted airport
These are stored by the hire firms - and will be handed over to the police if the car is stolen or used for another crime .
Detective Sergeant Vic Murphy , from the CID team at Stansted Airport , says it 's a response to criminal gangs targeting airport car hire firms - where cars are driven away using false passports , false licences and false credit cards .
" It 's not intrusive really .
It 's different - and people need to adjust to it .
It 's not Big Brother , it 's about protecting people 's identities .
The police will never see these thumbprints unless a crime is committed . "
Print works
But it has n't been well received by all customers .
Ciaran Moore from Belfast was " astounded " when he was asked for his fingerprint .
He thought the staff were joking .
Making fingerprints compulsory , he says , is " disproportionate " and he has written to complain .
A shopper in Oxford using a finger scanner for payment
Mr Moore says that if a fingerprint is needed because cars are being hired with forged passports - then by the same logic , fingerprints should be required for getting on planes .
And he also has concerns about the storing of information such as fingerprints .
What happens if someone steals your biometrics ?
But the police say the extra security check is reducing fraud .
And Europcar , one of the participating firms , says it could be rolled out to all its other locations if the pilot scheme is successful .
In many ways this is the debate over biometrics and ID cards in microcosm .
On one side , there 's the pragmatic security approach - arguing that old - style checks are no longer effective in a highly - mobile , hi-tech society , and the innocent have nothing to fear .
And on the other , there 's an instinctive suspicion about handing over such personal information and about where this security - first approach will lead .
Touch paper
But regardless of any ideological arguments , the use of biometric technology - where someone is identified by a physical characteristic - is already entering the mainstream .
Biometric UK passports were introduced this year , using facial mapping information stored on a microchip , and more than a million have already been issued .
A shop in the Bluewater centre in Kent has used a fingerprint checking scheme to tackle credit card fraud .
And in Yeovil , Somerset , fingerprinting has been used to cut town - centre violence , with scanners helping pick out troublemakers .
It 's not just about crime .
Biometric recognition is also being pitched as more convenient for shoppers .
Pay By
Touch allows customers to settle their supermarket bill with a fingerprint rather than a credit card .
With three million customers in the United States , this payment system is now being tested in the UK , in three Co-op supermarkets in Oxfordshire .
Terror fears
Once a customer registers , and has their finger scanned , they can use a fingerpad for payment , with the money directly debited from their bank account .
In the United States , the firm has also launched a version for online shopping , with a touchpad attached to a home computer - with the aim of reducing identity fraud .
There have already been more than a million biometric passports issued
The drive towards using biometrics is also reflected in an acceleration of identification research .
" It seems as if it 's going to become part of everyday life , " says Dr Maria Pavlou , at the University of Sheffield , the base for the International Centre for Advanced Research in Identification Science .
But no system is without flaws - and this , rather than blocking the use of biometrics , will mean developing multiple checking systems in the future , says Dr Pavlou .
" If someone worked with their hands , such as a builder , there could be cuts or marks that make it difficult to use fingerprints , " she says .
So identification systems , such as for airport security , would need to be combined with iris or facial recognition .
Iris recognition - using an image of the eye - is particularly reliable , says Dr Pavlou .
And it 's already being tested in Manchester and Heathrow airports .
There are also projects investigating identifying individuals by their voice and how they walk .
Human rights
While the technology might be emerging , so are the difficult questions ?
Where will this information be stored ?
Who will have access ?
Should there be a centralised control ?
Why should the records of innocent people be kept in this way ?
Human rights organisation Liberty warns that there has been insufficient public debate about the expansion in use of biometrics - and that so far " there are many more questions than answers " .
" Is this technology really necessary for what they want to achieve ? " says a Liberty spokesperson .
" The technology is moving so quickly - but is society being consulted ? "
Once these biometric databases are gathered , will the police be able to gain access on " fishing expeditions " for information , asks Liberty .
And the campaigning group rejects the argument that " if you 've nothing to hide , you 've nothing to fear " .
" Just because you value your own privacy , it does n't mean that it 's about hiding criminality . "

On a recent trip ( for the first time ) to Disneyworld , Floriday , I was astounded to find that everyone had to be fingerprinted before even entering the park !
( and since there are a few separate parks , I was finger printed about 5 times in one day )
Does anyone else find this a bit excessive ?
Especially for a family theme park !
What extra protection could this possibly create ?
Liam , London
There is a huge element of Big Brother creeping into society without any say in it from the ordinary man in the street .
There is no longer any sense of dignity or respect for personal privacy , we are all being reduced to numbers .
The consequences of mistakes or even worse still , malign activity , are mind boggling .
The argument that if you have not committed a crime you have nothing to fear , is just ridiculous .
Most of us would have huge problems even beginning to fight back , if we were to be mistakenly accused of a crime based on being associated with a number .
Terry Ray , Milton Keynes
Nothing to hide , nothing to fear !
I 've worked in car rental for 8 years now , and most people are happy to oblige with security checks when they understand the reason .
Hire cars are frequently used by criminals and if I had anyone object to the security checks , then I would refuse rental on the grounds that they are hiding something .
I sometimes took great pleasure in doing this to the people that whinged about civil liberities !
In a number of shops in Belfast I was also asked to put my thumbprint on the store copy of the credit card receipt .
Again , I am no criminal , so it posed no threat to my civil liberties whatsoever , and if anything , helps protect other peoples liberities .
Steve , Stafford
Last time through Heathrow , I registered with the Iris recognition system , that was voluntary .
However this thumbprint requirement has just been sprung on people , take it or leave it and it is this aproach which I object to .
John Bibby , Oman
In the States it 's now common for you to give a fingerprint to cash a cheque at the bank .
This practice has been in place for a number of years as a precaution against cheque and cheque card theft .
Takes no time and if you are honest why should you worry .
My main worry is the reduction in our civil liberties , in even discussing issues openly and freely .
That 's where we need to fight for our freedoms ; this government is out to curtail Magna Carta and our freedom to speech and as individuals .
At least in the States , freedom of speech is enshrined in the Constitution .
Here it's at the whim of a political party who appears to want to stay in power at whatever cost to our civil liberties .
James , Northampton
If my credit card falls into the wrong hands I can , with proper procedures , cancel it and get another .
If my fingerprints go astray , and printing them onto a surgical rubber glove will fool a lot of technologies , where do I get a new set ?
Robin Almond , Chatteris
When I visited the USA in July they had great difficulty taking my finger prints , as I am a keen gardener and wear them away with sand and grit , but they let me in .
Maybe they would think twice about it now , in view of my address .
Brian , High Wycombe
Why are people so touchy about leaving you fingerprint when you hire a car .
I think this is great .
I would give it when flying as well .
Do n't you realise that your personal details are sold for profit , willy nilly by banks , phone companies etc and no - one squawks about that .
Do you approve of that ?
This is for my security and I welcome it as I do ID cards .
Criminals should be trembling in fear as security gets tighter safeguarding us from them and their activities .
Sharon , Sutton
I 'm not worried about my privacy as much as the security of my data once it 's been handed over .
Obviously this type of biometric data , if it can be digitally stored could be reproduced and abused or stolen and with it , my biological identity .
Jackie , West Midlands
I believe that the only people who will object to this is those that have something to hide .
Its not before time that the honest people of this country stop paying for fraudsters and the like .
ID cards and various other biometric tests will help to speed up the process of halting this fraud .
Ernie , Irvine
Wherever you go , whatever you do , you are under suspicion .
You have to leave personal details with this or that organisation almost every time you leave the house , just in case you do something .
You exist only at the tolerance of the authorities .
You have as much freedom does as a cow does in its field , tagged and traced .
You are only a number now .
All this treating people like livestock is at last starting to produce the society where it is truly only the criminals who are free .
Simon , Manchester
I used to be one of the ' I 'm innocent so I have nothing to fear ' brigade but with identity theft being rife these days I am becoming more and more reluctant to part with any personal information .
With banks being careless enough to dump bank statements who's to say that similar cock - ups wo n't happen in the future .

In Trokavec , 71 of the 72 who voted said no to the radar station
Only one of the residents voted yes , while 71 of the 90 eligible voters were opposed , said the mayor of Trokavec , 70 km ( 44 miles ) from Prague .
Villagers fear the area will become a military target .
The vote was largely symbolic and has no legal power .
The US plans the shield to prevent long - range missile attacks .
The programme has bases in the US , Britain and Greenland , and Washington wants more in Poland and the Czech Republic to complete the coverage .
The Czech government is in favour of the plan but needs the approval of parliament , where it has no majority .
Peace sign
Trokavec , which is less than 2 km ( 1.25 miles ) from the planned radar base , also fears the area may be affected by radiation .
Several hundred peace activists marched through Prague city centre
Mayor Jan Neoral told AFP news agency : " This is our message to the government and the government should take notice of the fact that our village wishes [ the radar site ] not to happen . "
He said more villages would hold symbolic referendums .
The BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague says the capital held a rally of several hundred peace activists .
They marched through the city centre and campaigners carrying burning torches formed a peace sign in the old town square , he said .
Jan Tamas , spokesman of the No To Bases group , told him : " If we want to have security , then we need to begin disarming not creating new weapons . "
However , a spokesman for a group backing the shield , Vaclav Marhoul , rejected claims that the plan would make the Czech Republic a military target .
" We believe that the EU or European civilisation could n't save ourselves without the United States , " he said .
Another set of PowerPoint briefing slides was released to the public recently .
The slides , which were obtained by the National Security Archive under the Freedom of Information Act , show what planners in 2002 projected might occur if the US invaded Iraq ( get all slides in PDF ) .
The slides contain " completely unrealistic assumptions about a post - Saddam Iraq ... " according to National Security Archive Executive Director Thomas Blanton .
These PowerPoint Slides were used to brief the White House and Donald Rumsfeld in 2002 .
( See CNN article and video report . )
These slides were likely never projected on a screen .
PowerPoint decks like this are instead often printed and used in the US government and military as a kind of document .
( See earlier posts related to slideumentation here , here , and here ) .
Slides like these would not make for good visuals , but they do not make for good documents either .
Even though the title of the slide ( err , " page " ) below is " Key Planning Assumptions , " the problem with presenting bullets like this is that important assumptions about each bullet point are left unstated and unexplained .
Since printed slides like these are acting as de facto documents to be left behind and examined later , why not present the information with more written explanation and greater clarity in a properly written document which adheres to the principles of good writing and good document design ?
Is the last bullet the most or least important ?
In a document like the one above , what is the relationship of the bullets ?
Is it sequential from the first to the last in order ?
Or is it priority from the most important to the least important ?
( Or the other way around ? )
Or is it that the bullets are just related in some way .
When most people look at such a long bullet list like the one above it's only natural to assume ( whether consciously or not ) that the last bullet may be of lesser importance than items higher up on list .
In this case the last item , " Iraq regime has WMD capability , " looks almost as if it were a parenthetical addition following the two - line acronym - filled bullet ( number nine out of ten if you 're counting ) on " forces in Turkey " placed above it .
WMDs , of course , would apparently move up the bulleted - list chain on future PowerPoint decks in Washington .
In the Cognitive Style of PowerPoint , Edward Tufte , citing the 1998 Harvard Business Review article ( " Strategic Stories : How 3 M is Reviewing Business Planning " ) , suggests that bulleted lists " can make us stupid " because bullet lists ( 1 ) are too generic , ( 2 ) they leave important relationships unspecified , and ( 3 ) key assumptions are left vague at best .
These briefing slides seem like pretty good examples of the kind of " documents " we should avoid subjecting our audiences to .
Bullet outlines dilute thought , says , Tufte .
Certainly if we are going to make a document to be left behind as a handout we have to do better than printing out slides of bulleted outlines .
Says Tufte :
" Instead of showing a long sequence of tiny information fragments on slides , and instead of dumping those slides onto paper , report writers should have the courtesy to write a real report ( which might also be handed out at a meeting ) and address audiences as serious people .
PP templates are a lazy and ridiculous way to format printed reports . "
( Emphasis mine . )
– Edward Tufte , The Conitive Style of PowerPoint
Above : POTUS = President of the United States .
SECDEF = Secretary of Defense .
The first bullet reads much differently if it is written " George Bush / Donald Rumsfeld directed effort ; limited to a very small group . "
I am not arguing with the content of the briefing slides , there are plenty of sites for that .
I am saying that the way in which it was presented is something that we ourselves should avoid doing at all cost .
Presenting paper documents like this — which violate rule after rule of good document design and good writing — will obfuscate our message , not clarify it .
You will need this : List of acronyms used in War Planning Slides ( PDF ) .
Thanks to my buddy Les in Australia for the heads up on these slides .
Blondlot and N-rays
One of the first things I did with every graduate student who worked with me is to convince them how difficult it was to keep oneself from unconscious bias .
*-- Michael Witherell , head of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
René Prosper Blondlot ( 1849 -1930 ) was a French physicist who claimed to have discovered a new type of radiation , shortly after Roentgen had discovered X - rays .
He called it the N-ray , after Nancy , the name of the town and the university where he lived and worked .
Blondlot was trying to polarize X - rays when he claimed to have discovered his new form of radiation .
Dozens of other scientists confirmed the existence of N - rays in their own laboratories .
However , N - rays do n't exist .
How could so many scientists be wrong ?
They deceived themselves into thinking they were seeing something when in fact they were not .
They saw what they wanted to see with their instruments , not what was actually there ( or , in this case , what was not there ) .
The story of Blondlot is a story of self - deception among scientists .
Because many people have the misguided notion that science should be infallible and a fount of absolutely certain truths , they look at the Blondlot episode as a vindication of their excessive skepticism towards science .
They relish accounts such as the one regarding Blondlot and the phantom N - rays because it is a story of a famous scientist making a great error .
However , if one properly understands science and scientists , the Blondlot episode indicates little more than the fallibility of scientists and the self - correcting nature of science .
Blondlot claimed that N - rays exhibit impossible properties and yet are emitted by all substances except green wood and certain treated metals .
In 1903 , Blondlot claimed he had generated N - rays using a hot wire inside an iron tube .
The rays were detected by a calcium sulfide thread that glowed slightly in the dark when the rays were refracted through a 60 - degree angle prism of aluminum .
According to Blondlot , a narrow stream of N - rays was refracted through the prism and produced a spectrum on a field .
The N - rays were reported to be invisible , except when viewed as they hit the treated thread .
Blondlot moved the thread across the gap where the N - rays were thought to come through and when the thread was illuminated it was said to be due to N-rays .
Nature magazine was skeptical of Blondlot 's claims because laboratories in England and Germany had not been able to replicate the Frenchman 's results .
Nature sent American physicist Robert W. Wood of Johns Hopkins University to investigate Blondlot 's discovery .
Wood suspected that N - rays were a delusion .
To demonstrate such , he removed the prism from the N - ray detection device , unbeknownst to Blondlot or his assistant .
Without the prism , the machine could n't work .
Yet , when Blondlot 's assistant conducted the next experiment he found N-rays .
Wood then tried to surreptitiously replace the prism but the assistant saw him and thought he was removing the prism .
The next time he tried the experiment , the assistant swore he could not see any N - rays .
But he should have , since the equipment was in full working order .
According to Martin Gardner , Wood 's exposure of Blondlot led to the French scientist 's madness and death ( Gardner , 345 n.1 ) .
Robert T. Lagemann ( 1977 ) puts the lie to that notion , apparently first put forth by William Seabrook in his biography of Wood .
Lagemann writes that he talked with E. Pierret , a retired chief assistant in the physics department at Nancy .
Pierret told him he had known the assistants who worked with Blondlot and he had " talked with Blondlot in 1926 , at which time Blondlot did not appear to have lost his intellectual powers .
Blondlot , he said , continued to believe in the existence of N rays after he stopped his active study of them in 1906 .... "
Actually , Blondlot continued in his post of Professor of Physics for six years after Wood ’s disclosure .
He retired in 1910 at the age of 61 , before the usual age of retirement .
He lived for 20 years in retirement , until his death in 1930 at the age of 81 .
During that period he held the title Professor Honoraires ( i.e. , emeritus ) and continued to live in his large home at 16 - 18 Quai Claude le Lorrain .
He continued to have associations with others at the University , as when for example , in 1909 , on the occasion of the unveiling of a monument of his friend , Ernest Bichat , Blondlot made one of the speeches .
In 1923 , a third edition of his book on thermodynamics appeared , and in November 1927 , he wrote a new preface for a third edition of his textbook on electricity .
Certainly his long will , frequently revised to accommodate changing conditions , which was duly accepted and probated upon his death , is one prepared by a sane man .
Nor is there any evidence that he committed suicide , as is sometimes inferred by those who read Seabrook .
Blondlot lived some 26 years after Wood ’s exposure .
Had he taken his own life , he probably could not have been buried in a Catholic cemetery with the full rites of the Church , as was indeed the case according to newspaper accounts .
Cemetery records show he is buried in the Cimetiere de Preville , the central one of the city .
So , Blondlot did not go mad and did not commit suicide , but he did persist in his N - rays delusion .
Were Blondlot and those who verified his N - ray experiments stupid or incompetent ?
Not necessarily , since the issue is n't one of intelligence or competence , but of the psychology of perception .
Blondlot and his followers suffered " from self - induced visual hallucinations " ( Gardner , loc. cit . ) .
What is the lesson from the Blondlot episode ?
James Randi writes
... science does not always learn from these mistakes .
Visiting Nancy recently and speaking on the subject of pseudoscience , I discussed this example and though I was in the city that gave the name to N - rays , no one in the audience had ever heard of them , or of Blondlot , not even the professors from the University of Nancy !
-- James Randi at Cal Tech
The fact that Blondlot is not remembered at Nancy ought to be taken as a sign that science does learn from its mistakes .
The fact that Blondlot is not considered a prophet in his homeland is a healthy sign that although scientists often make errors , even big ones , other scientists will uncover the errors and get science back on the right path to understanding nature .
Those who think that science should be infallible do not understand the nature of science .
Recent examples of " Blondlot 's Folly " are Pons and Fleischmann 's discovery of cold fusion ( 1989 ) , Jacques Benveniste 's water memory claims ( 1988 ) , and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California 's claim to have discovered ununoctium or element 118 ( 1999 ) , although the latter seems to be marred by faked data .

The Rise and Fall of N - Rays by Mike Epstein
The best insurance companies offer their clients more than just the insurance they want at a reasonable price - only good companies can do ...
Vse skupaj je opravila lokalna molitvena skupina , ki je tudi prva povezala Festival s Satanom , piše hrvaški Feral Tribune .
Očitno so prepričali tudi policijo , ki je z odločno akcijo razgnala presenečene goste – povečini tujce iz Zahodne Evrope - jim podrla šotore v katerih so spali in omogočila molitveni skupini izvajanje egzorcizma .
Molitvena skupina naj bi zaznala prisotnost Temnih sil
Na TechnoPartyRumpelthaenzechen bi sicer morali nastopiti DJ - i iz petnajstih držav , organizatorji pa so imeli tudi vsa potrebna dovoljenja .
Da se Festival vendarle ni zgodil je poskrbela Cerkev , točneje duhovnik Jakov Gel in njegova molitvena skupina .
V Livnu in okolici je v zadnjih nekaj letih prisoten trend ustanavljanja t.i. molitvenih skupin , kjer se sestajajo verniki , ki ure in ure preživijo v molitvi in odkrivanju vseprisotnih Satanovih del , piše hrvaški T - Portal .
Ena od takih skupin je vražjo prisotnost odkrila tudi v prihajajočem partyju , podporo pa so našli pri že omenjenem duhovniku Jakovu Gelu , ki je približno v istem času kot skupina zaznal , da se katoliškemu Livnu nevarno približujejo Temne sile .
Včasih so podporni stebri samo podporni stebri
Kmalu so na Radio Livno začeli klicati zaskrbljeni verniki , ki naj bi na odru za nastopajoče DJ - je opazili narobe obrnjen križ , kar naj bi bil nedvoumen znak , da so organizatorji pod vplivom Princa Teme .
Organizatorji so zaman ponavljali , da so to samo podporni stebri , ki ne morejo stati drugače .
Končalo se je tako , da je policija v Livnu pod pritiskom vernikov in Cerkve sprejela odlok o prepovedi javnega zbiranja pod pretvezo , da obstaja velika verjetnost za storitev kaznivih dejanj s strani obiskovalcev patyja , ter nato dopustila izganjanje hudiča .
Pa naj še kdo reče , da verski fundamentalizem v Evropi ne živi več .

Korean tycoon questioned by police ( AP )
Updated : 2007-04-30 09:02
SEOUL , South Korea - Police questioned one of South Korea 's richest men Sunday following media reports that he and his bodyguards abducted and beat eight people after his son was hurt in a scuffle with bar employees .
Kim Seung - youn , chairman and CEO of the Hanwha Group , South Korea 's ninth - largest business conglomerate , is surrounded by reporters after he arrived for questioning at a South Gate police station in Seoul , South Korea , Sunday , April 29 , 2007 . [ AP ]
Kim Seung - youn , chairman and CEO of the Hanwha Group , South Korea 's ninth - largest business conglomerate , and his bodyguards allegedly seized the men last month and took them to a mountainous area south of Seoul where they were threatened and beaten , the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported Saturday , quoting unnamed victims and witnesses .
Kim and the bodyguards were armed with steel pipes and shock devices , the paper said .
Kim , 55 , and his son , Kim Dong - won , later assaulted another man at gunpoint in a bar in central Seoul , the paper said .
That man was allegedly one of several off - duty bar employees who were involved in the scuffle with 22 - year - old Kim Dong - won in southern Seoul on March 8 .
The son required 11 stitches after the altercation .
Numerous other major papers carried similar reports with victims alleging Kim and his bodyguards were responsible for the attacks .
Police refused to discuss the case Sunday , confirming only that the elder Kim was prohibited from leaving the country .
His son has left South Korea for China , but was due back on Monday , according to Hanwha spokesman Ju Cheol - beom .
Kim , who agreed to be questioned after reportedly refusing earlier summonses by police , said he would " clear any allegations surrounding me during the police investigation , " according to the Yonhap news agency .
" I am very sorry for causing trouble over a personal issue , " Kim told reporters as he arrived at the police station Sunday .
Ju said Kim " denies all suspicions " surrounding his involvement in the case .
Details of the case have become front - page news in South Korea , where family - controlled conglomerates dominate the economy .
In a Saturday editorial , the mass - circulation Dong -a Ilbo newspaper likened the case to an " underworld gang movie . "
Kim , South Korea 's 10th - richest man , is worth about $ 850 million , according to Chaebul.com , a Web site that tracks the fortunes of the country 's conglomerate chiefs and their families .
Hanwha was established in 1952 as the Korea Explosives Corp .
It later developed interests in petrochemicals , finance , insurance , construction and retail .
It also owns the Hanwha Eagles professional baseball team .
The younger Kim is a student at Yale University .

The default architecture for Ruby on Rails , Model View Controller , can begin to break down as Controllers become bloated and logic begins to creep into view templates .
The Presenter pattern addresses this problem by adding another layer of abstraction : a class representation of the state of the view .
Presenter was inspired by the various GUI patterns documented by Martin Fowler The Presenter pattern addresses bloated controllers and views containing logic in concert by creating a class representation of the state of the view .
An architecture that uses the Presenter pattern provides view specific data as attributes of an instance of the Presenter .
The Presenter 's state is an aggregation of model and user entered data .
As non-trivial applications grow Controllers can approach sizes that compromise maintainability .
Complex controller actions may require instantiation of multiple objects and take on the responsibility of aggregating data from various objects .
A Presenter can encapsulate this aggregation behavior and leave the controller with more focused responsibilities .
This also allows for testing of aggregation or calculation behavior without a dependency on setting up a Controller to a testable state .
Since views are templates they can also contain behavior .
The most common behavior you encounter in a view is formatting ; however , since the view is a template you will occasionally see computations or worse .
Because this logic is stored in a template it can be problematic to test .
Presenters address this problem by pulling all formatting , computation , and any additional behavior into a class that can be easily tested .
Presenters do add an additional layer , and thus more complexity .
A presenter is not likely to be a automatic decision or standard .
Presenters are generally introduced when actions are required to act upon various models or the data in the database needs to be manipulated in various ways before it is displayed in the view .
The example used to demonstrate a usage of the Presenter pattern is a page that allows you to enter your address information , personal information , and user credentials .
To get to our example page ( and the following page ) we 'll need to add a few routes to routes.rb .
The example relies on three different models : address , user_account , user_credential .
The migration for creating these tables is straightforward .
The models need not contain any behavior for our example .
The template for our example view is also straightforward , and this is one of the large benefits for using a presenter .
And , the last example before we dive into the Presenter will be the controller .
The controller is also simple , thus maintainable , due to the usage of the Presenter .
Finally , the CompletePresenter aggregates all the data for the view .
The CompletePresenter does inherit from Presenter , but only to get Forwardable behavior and a constructor that allows you to create an instance with attributes set from a hash .
By using the presenter an easily testable layer has been created .
This additional layer can coordinate with the models that this view is responsible for .
The added layer also allows the models to be tested independent of any controller behavior .

Sayda Zeinab , Syria -- Omar Mohammad is busy watching Ali , his mentally retarded 4 - year - old brother , weave between dozens of other Iraqi refugees at a crowded Red Crescent clinic outside Damascus .
At first glance , Omar seems like any other curious 10 - year - old , but his dark eyes conceal a deep unease .
Although he is safe in this Shiite town from the sectarian violence that ravaged his Baghdad neighborhood , he can't get the war out of his head .
" I do n't want to ever go back to Iraq , " Omar said .
" But I wonder if I 'll see my friends again and if they are safe . "
Four months ago , Shiite militiamen stormed into Omar 's home in Mashtal in eastern Baghdad , ordering his Sunni family to leave the area .
Several days later , they joined the 1.2 million Iraqis who have flocked to Syria since the U.S. - led invasion began in March 2003 .
Among the refugees are countless children like Omar who struggle to cope with the emotional wounds of war .
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is working with local nongovernmental organizations to identify , refer and treat the most vulnerable .
" It 's challenging in Syria . ...
There are no international NGOs ( nongovernmental organizations ) and limited local ones , " said Mai Barazi , the U.N. agency 's assistant community services officer in Damascus .
" The country itself does n't have an existing system . "
The Syrian Red Crescent in Sayda Zeinab -- one of a handful of NGOs working with the United Nations -- is clearly overwhelmed .
Two waiting rooms teem with patients ; a woman in her eighth month of pregnancy sits on stairs near the clinic entrance while several middle - aged men perch against a wall waiting to be seen by a doctor .
In addition to treating physical ailments , the clinic refers only the most serious emotional problems to Damascus psychiatrists because of a lack of funding and resources .
Abdel - Aziz Taha , the facility 's general manager , acknowledges that most of the 250 patients who arrive daily need some kind of counseling .
" We send about five people ( to see psychiatrists ) every day , " he said .
" Most of them are very badly off . "
Many referrals are for traditional one - on - one therapy in the downtown Damascus clinic of Mohammad Sayed al - Hafez .
The 61 - year - old psychiatrist says most Iraqi adults are suffering from war trauma compounded by depression stemming from an inability to find work or fit into Syrian society .
He typically gives them anti-depressants .
But children like Omar , he says , require a different approach .
" They need family support and a community - based approach .
They do n't need medication . "
The Sisters of the Good Shepherd agree .
The nuns , who work with the U.N. agency in the Christian neighborhood of Masaken Barzeh on the outskirts of Damascus , hold group therapy sessions for children , headed by a local psychiatrist who asked not to be named .
He incorporates games , puppet shows and artwork into his therapy methods and plans to get more parents involved in helping their children cope with war - related stress .
" The nuns were seeing a lot of disturbed Iraqi children , " said the psychiatrist , who said he is not authorized by the state to work with Iraqi refugees .
" The aim is to let the community help itself . "
Every Saturday for seven months , a tiny chapel has been transformed into a clinic for 28 children , ranging in age from 7 to 14 .
" The children start laughing .
They make friends .
They have self - confidence again , " said Sister Therese Msallam , a wiry woman with graying hair .
In the meantime , Iraqi refugees are being blamed by many Syrians for straining education and health facilities , taking jobs from local workers and causing rising inflation .
Many are also worried the refugees will spark sectarian hatred in this secular society .
" These people came to Syria after sectarian bloodshed , " said Mohammad Habash , a member of parliament who also heads the Damascus Center for Islamic Studies .
" Maybe they 're looking for revenge .
The main danger is if they find themselves here with their enemies .
Syria cannot carry all these problems . "
Since there are no U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees - affiliated clinics in Sunni neighborhoods , Omar 's family must seek aid in Shiite towns such as Sayda Zeinab and wait for medical attention alongside Shiites .
" I 'm uncomfortable with that , " whispered Omar 's mother , Huda Mohammed , 41 .
" I gave my sons a Sunni name ( Omar ) and a Shiite name ( Ali ) .
I did n't know what sectarianism was before . "
For now , Omar worries about friends he left behind , misses personal mementos he could n't bring along , and laments the loss of another school year .
He had stopped attending class in Iraq last year because his parents feared he would be kidnapped or killed just for having a Sunni name .
Most important , he can't enroll in a Syrian school because his school records also were left behind .
Omar 's mother does n't want her children to feel hatred toward Shiites or any other Iraqi , but she knows Omar is resentful that a Shiite family now lives in their Baghdad home .
She is worried that four years of war has deeply traumatized her two sons .
" They were both terrified , 24 hours a day , " she said .
" If there 's a counseling service , I want them in it . "

Well , I think the reason it is the way it is , is that all the Java money went server - side , J2EE , etc .
Plenty of investment in JSP , JSF and other templating technologies for web - based stuff .
Swing GUIs became a bit passe .
I see a slight change though as people get bored with plain HTML and want RIAs .
If it is n't AJAX in the browser then I suspect that there is a fairly large minority of Java client apps whose GUI is built using some kind of declarative language .
There are quite a few options now such as SwiXML and Thinlets .
Personally I 'd like to see such a feature for Eclipse , or Spring RCP .

in response to Kit Davies Java is a very modulair build language which makes it ideal for basicly grouping these building blocks together and thus forming a GUI , no need to re-generate the same code over and over again IMVHO .
Just put the right " blocks " together .
The Bean Builder is IMO a very good example of that .
Another example , to a certain degree , is given by the NetBeans Swing GUI Builder which is formerly known as Project Matisse .
It basicly generates the entire method which creates the GUI and defines all of its listener methods and allows you to insert your own code in every method invoked by an event triggered by the GUI .
So while I do agree that these kind of code generators are scarce I seriously wonder if we actually need them .
IMO all you need are good building blocks .

The point of the post was that they are too prevalent .
What I do n't understand is why people will go to all the effort to write a generator to write code that will build a gui at runtime .
Why not just go one step further and write code that builds a gui at runtime based on structured input ?
It 's not much harder and it 's much more useful .

Ever try diffing two GUI resource files ?
It 's a nightmare .
Code generators are smart because at least you get type safety ( compile - time checking ) and they 're easier to DIFF .
The only thing that might require some improvement is more flexibility to insert user code around generated code and / or making generated code look a bit nicer .
Aside from that I honestly do n't see what your complaints are :)

If the generator wrote a simple ' script ' and not a ton of classes , I might be OK with it .
The problem is that it 's not nearly as flexible as creating a document that describes the gui .
That structure can then be rendered as needed in ( theoretcially ) any language and gui framework , even AJAX , perhaps .
That would be a more complicated task than what I 'm really imagining but you still get a good amount of flexibility even if it 's Swing specific .
As far as diffs are concerned , XML can sometimes be hard to diff because it's often munged onto a single line and the order of same type siblings is not significant .
I 've resolved these issues in the past with a pretty printer that sorted such siblings prior to running a diff .

in response to Konstantin Ignatyev but i found that in the end you just move your bugs to the much harder to debug xml file .
What is really needed is a wysiwyg editor , a bindings language and a hierarchical component model of those gui-xmls ( think of parameters for xml components )
Do n't know about vista but Interface Builder has been around for so many years and it still provides a so much better experience than anything on the pure java side .
apple has stopped to support their cocoa - java gui framework that was using Interface Builder on top of Swing - subclasses .
Technologies like Webobject 's direct - to - java ( the cousin of direct - to - web ) and Enterprise - Objects ( with client side code and properties ) never got enought attention .

You should check out BuoyBuilder ( www.buoybuilder.com).
It also serializes its components to XML , but provides both a layout tool to design your GUI using drag and drop and a document loader that actually loads the GUI from XML and , at runtime , dynamically attaches it to your controller .
The layout tool also has the ability to dynamically register callback methods for events so your controller does n't have to implement ActionListener interfaces and inspect events .
It also includes goodies like automatic localization , extended layout managers , and the ability to incorporate custom widgets .
From reading some of the posts the creators modeled it after Apple 's Cocoa and Interface Builder .

in response to Jack Rosenzweig Romaframework uses the MDA approach : create your domain object model and plug the other aspects .
Current release of Roma generates the GUI as Web Application ( 100 % Ajax , using Echo2 rendering engine ) .
The GUI is generate automagically reading your domain POJOs .
CRUD are generated by the Wizards ( code generator ) .
Customization of generated HTML is done by annotations in classes and by editing the stylesheet .

The controller code should be completely independent of the GUI code , and not be hampered in any way by the tool that generates the GUI .
Controller code is never independent of the GUI !
Its only purpose is to control the GUI .
The manipulations , one can make to the GUI , which do not affect the controller code , are really minor .
There is no single reason , why controller code should not depend on the GUI !
Things that will make GUI coding more efficient are : o Usage of meta information from the business model o
An intelligent data binding mechanism o Inheritance Ideally , you have a mechanism , that accumulates meta information from different sources : o Reflection ( properties and their types , enums , primitives are not nullable ) o OR - Mapping if applicable ( nullability , precision , scale , length , relations ) o Annotations ( format , validation ) o Authorization o Localization .. and automatically utilizes them , when building the UI .

I think the definition an " independent controller " is getting misunderstood .
Correct , the controller should receive events from the GUI , process them and update accordingly .
However , the Controller should not be concerned with laying out the GUI , localizing it , or even the structure of it .
Once your controller starts doing that , it really because an extension of the view .

This is a very good question given that Swing is completely designed for dynamic gui generation .
Using it to hard code guis makes very little sense .
Honestly , I think it comes down to a lack of imagination .
It 's not confined to this topic .
Take the ' pojo ' revolution .
It 's really the JavaBean revolution and JavaBeans are IMHO , the worst idea ever introduced into Java .
I do n't know exactly who came up with it but they must have confused Java with SmallTalk .
Hibernate and Swing work with objects that act as hard - coded maps with all the problems of map based design and almost none of the flexibility .
It 's beyond stupid that adding a new query to a system starts with ' write a class with getters and setters ' .
It 's the same thing as with Swing , let 's take something flexible elegant and dynamic and cut - off it 's legs with 10,000 lines of code .
It 's become the Java MO .
Sorry to get off - topic here but I needed to get that off my chest .

The client side is not just GUI Go to top ]
Posted by : S. Yayla
Posted on : November 30 2006 11:30 EST
in response to Jack Rosenzweig
The client side is not just GUI .
This is the one thing that is easy to loose out of sight .
If you think of the typical business system as a channnel of communication between the database and the user , the server side acts as a proxy between the database and the network , while the client side acts as a proxy between the user and the network .
This should remind us that objects handled by the program logic are as complex either side .
It is at this point that the biggest basic failure of user side designs materialize .
This is also why code generators become a problem , resource based GUI engines stay relatively unknown , and practically every major project choses to hand code their user side once again , inventing their own resource schemes , sometimes also GUI frameworks .
The problem becomes clearest when you consider complicated objects that for example are finite state machines .
For each significant state , the significant attributes , and the possible state transitions one needs mechanisms to communicate , check , remmber , bookkeep , apply business logic , show , and react to user inputs .
In this picture , the GUI specific code takes care of the verbs ' show ' and ' react ' .
The client specific code is , in addition to the GUI specific , possibly the business logic .
The rest is essentially similar to the server side .
Out of the whole the ' show ' and ' react ' bit is essentially a thin layer between the GUI library ( SWING , SWT , Motif , etc.. ) and the business objects handled .
The client is actually a server ( remember X - server ? ) serving reactions from the user as the database side ( serveside ) requests them .
It also has a model of the users point of view ( Window / Display manager ) .
It desperately wants to be asynchronous just like the user .
Most tools , platforms , techniques that are supposed to help building GUI 's , clients , user side applications only help at parts of this big picture .
In my opinion this is the problem .
The code generating GUI tools falls short because widgets / subpanels are shadows of the objects , not the other way .
The resource based GUI tools are useful but not fully so because objects of the business often can not be fully described with them .

I 'm not sure I follow but it seems to me that the entire swing architecture could easily be described with an XML schema which could then be used to script GUI construction .
Can you give an example of something that could not ?
The Action class ( often overlooked ) could be used to link the GUI to the code .
The big problem I 've seen in GUIs is that they have hard references to business processes at best and at worst they actually have business logic embedded in the code .

The problem that I am pointing at remains .
" Action class .. to link the GUI to the code " illustrates it neatly .
What you call " code " is the sunken part of the iceberg .
It is a bit too big and support is only partial .
Examples are custom widgets to represent your complicated objects by specifying their looks and behaviours in XML in such a way that you can connect these to details of messages to and from the database side with a minimum of custom code .
Most tools leave slightly complicated things to yourself .
The business of the database side is to keep , and watch the books / intelligence of the company .
The business of the user side is to present these to , and maintain the dialogue with the user in perfect cognitive ergonomy .
Mixing the business rules of one , into the logic of the other is likely to have a delayed cost .
May be I should have written " - user side - business logic " .

What are we talking about ?
Looking at all this discussion , I would like to ask this simple question - how much of guis do you need for your application and how complex should they be ?
From my personal experience , user interface in most cases is very simple and requires a very short list of fields with respective input from the user .
In that case what you call a resource based gui is much more preferrable and easy to implement .
The burden of bundling code with a gui form has a long history ( starting from 1977 when the first work on dialogue generators was published ) .
Smalltalk - 80 also added to it .
Projects like Thinlet are targetted in the right direction .
I am not sure you need XML ( with the burden of its parsing and conversion to XML ) for describing the gui forms or resources .
It can be done with much more primitive mark - up .
The advantage of separating resources or dialogue forms from code that deals with presenting them to the user is not new in its essence .
It was used starting from 1978 for building user interfaces on various hardware / software systems .
Simply this work is not known to the Western software community just because it was done in Russia .
There were a lot of comments about Struts as the nice way of building web applications .
Do n't you think that it is too heavy for them ?
There is a lot of statements that those frameworks utilize MVC , but nobody realizes that MVC is much more than just a pattern for guis .

I have had a lot of experience with GUI work ( including GASP !!
Visual Basic ) .
On my latest project though we have been building a GUI using Swing and the JGoodies libraries .
The binding library supports Martin Fowler 's Presentation Model .
The Forms library has a nice layout manager called FormLayout that has a very simple descriptor language .
I have to say after doing VB development I much prefer developing with these Java tools over the drag and drop method even VB provides .
You have more control over your code and it produces very nice looking GUIs .
I think it 's even possible to develop more functional feature rich apps like this over anything a drag and drop or a xml describe method can provide .
Before the project started we reviewed a couple of Java layout tools and none of them cut the mustard .
The most common problems were : 1 . They only handled the simpler problems GUIs tackle .
2 . They could n't handle odd user requirements .
Like dissimilar object graphs that needed to be joined together into the same view or grabbing values that are only related to the object graph during the user 's session .
3 . Inefficient code was generated .
4 . Aesthetically the screens did n't look nice and trying to tweak the descriptor ( i.e. XML ) language either was n't possible to make it look nice or produced other undesirable effects .
I think most people who speak up about rich GUIs are already biased against them because the Web has become the bread and butter for most .
There is however still a need for rich clients for things like high volume data entry .
I have seen data entry people make even native clients look like them perform badly .

I 've been working on a project in the Google Web Toolkit for the past couple months and I 've enjoyed how these problems are dealt with .
While it is a web tech , programming GWT feels just like programming Swing / SWT code .
It 's very impressive .
Better yet , after it 's compiled to javascript it 's styled with CSS .
It 's not perfect , but you can make a lot of design / layout decsions without touching a line of code .
Obviously this is a web tech so some things are different , but having a css-esque layer for swing to take care of positioning / alignment / etc would be appealing to me .

in response to Paul Casal Code generation has been pretty useful and met considerable success in the Java world .
I 've seen very few cases where it was really needed and it almost always hamstrung me where it was used .
It introduces that additional level of indirection that shields your code from the platform / s it 'll eventually run .
How does code generation shield your code ?
I 've seen very few cases where it was really needed and it almost always hamstrung me where it was used .

The core problem here is that still even more GUI builders for Java suck .
And the idea of making it run time configurable using XML is even more sick , IMHO .
Apple ( or rather next step ) has shown how to build guis easily using graphical tools years ago .
The one thing that is needed desperately to be really productive is not the storage anyway ( Netbeans can serialize the objects anyway ) , the problem is that there is no standard , high quality application model in the Java Space .
Also , of course , " standard " java still misses some standard ( non graphical ) components one would need to be really effective using this approach .

Hi Karl ,
If I uderstand you right , then I totaly agree .
What is lacking in java is a real component model .
By this I mean a way to link together objects after compile time .
It all started with C++ and the idea that you could have a viable component model by using a static language with complex runtimes like COM and CORBA .
It did n't work .
NextStep showed that for a viable component model what you really need is a late - bound , dynamic programming language .
Objective - C as used in OSX and NextStep is a late - bound , dynamic , OO language .
The web guys have caught on to the benfits of late - binding and are using http , and URLs to create mashups from re-usable web components , yet we still do not have a viable way of doing the same thing with Java objects .
I agree that Spring and XML is no subsititue .
When will the mainstream wakeup to this basic fact ?
Paul .

How about JMS as the binding ?
You will still need to configure JMS though .
Hi Satilmis , Strange as it sounds , JMS would be a move in the right direction .
Pure OO languages are based on message sends .
So binding to another object is a matter of sending a message at runtime .
To do this you do not need to know anything about the recieving object such as its class .
Using message sends leads to true polymorphism , where the recieving object can take any form as long as it suppports the message protocol used by the sender .
The anology with the web is clear .
You can post to any URL what ever message you like as long as the receiving page supports the message protocol at runtime .
Unfortunately like I said before this was a basic misunderstanding in C++ , and the idea of object Class ( implementation ) became confused with Type ( interface ) and we ended up with the virtual function call instead of a message send as a way of meeting the needs of an optimising static compiler .
Objective - C avoided the C++ route and stuck to pure message sends , Java did n't , and the rest is history .

Perhaps it was inevitable .
When two leading internet pioneers came together this week to propose a set of guidelines that would filter out offensive and abusive comments from blogs , they were met by a torrent of offensive and abusive comments .
Images of excrement were abundant amid the reaction yesterday to the proposed " bloggers ' code of conduct " .
The anonymous blogger bynkii ( motto : because misanthropy is fun ) likened the idea to " troll faeces , specifically designed to create a special group of self - satisfied , smug , condescending dingalings looking down their noses " .
The new media site 910 am described it as " weapons of mass stupidity " and carried the health warning " do not read on a full stomach " .
The text that has got the collective bowels moving of these and many other bloggers is a draft set of rules on introducing the concept of civility to the blogosphere .
It is the combined work of Tim O'Reilly , inventor of the phrase Web 2.0 to describe the next generation of interactive communications , and Jimmy Wales , founder of the communal encyclopaedia Wikipedia .
They have posted a seven - point programme that would attempt , they say , to address the plethora of abusive comments on the web , while preserving the free spirit of the medium .
Point one of the code is that anyone signing up to it would commit themselves to a " civility enforced " standard to remove unacceptable comments from their blog .
Unacceptable is defined as content that is used to abuse , harass , stalk or threaten others ; is libellous or misrepresentative ; or infringes copyright , confidentiality or privacy rights .
Anonymous postings are also to be removed , with every comment requiring a recognised email address , even if posts are made under pseudonyms .
Point six encourages bloggers to ignore " trolls " making nasty comments that fall short of abuse or libel .
" Never wrestle with a pig , " is the advice .
" You both get dirty , but the pig likes it . "
To back up the code , they propose a " civility enforced " badge marking sites which subscribe to the guidelines , and an " anything goes " badge to denote those that do not .
The proposed guidelines can be interactively amended by web users , until a final version is agreed .
Mr O'Reilly writes on his website radar.oreilly : " Setting standards for acceptable behaviour in a forum you control is conducive to free speech , not damaging to it .
There 's no reason why we should tolerate conversations online that we would n't tolerate in our living room . "
Many sites , including the Guardian 's Comment is free blog , already deploy several of the points .
But this is the first attempt to apply a common framework to the rapidly growing population of blogs which already stands at 71m .
The move formalises concern among many bloggers and web publishers about abusive language .
Last month a woman blogger went public with the attacks she had suffered on her site .
In her account of the harassment she endured , Kathy Sierra refers to photographs being posted of her head beside a noose , and comments such as : " fuck off you boring slut ... i hope someone slits your throat and cums down your gob " .
" The guy who wrote this is anonymous , " she said .
" I have no way of knowing just how disturbed he might be . "
The draft guidelines have prompted wide debate with varying responses .
Dan Gillmor of the Centre for Citizen Media , a group devoted to grassroots media attached to Berkeley 's graduate school of journalism , rejects the need for a code of conduct .
He says bloggers require only one simple rule : be civil .
To define unacceptable behaviour is to create a monster , he says , as " Who'd be the judge of it ?
The government ?
Libel lawyers ?
Uh , oh . "
901 am says the idea is the preserve of rabid feminists and professional victims .
" Civility is subjective , and controlling what people say and do on blogs can only be a recipe for the decline of the medium and the introduction of totalitarianism online . "
Reality just got a one - two punch .
A new experiment has tried to suss out which of two counterintuitive ingredients is more basic to quantum theory , only to find that they go hand in hand .
Einstein was famously bugged by what are now well - established facts of quantum theory : the randomness of a particle 's choices and the possibility of instantaneous linkages between far - flung light or matter .
Experimenters now conclude that Einstein cannot even pick his poison , because allowing for instant links kills any simple notion of reality , too .
The team updated a classic 1982 experiment in which researchers measured the polarizations , or spatial orientations , of twin pairs of photons .
In quantum theory , photons and other particles do not have definite values for properties such as location or polarization but rather acquire a specific property randomly when measured in an experiment .
" The big question always was whether one can go beyond this probabilistic description , " says physicist Markus Aspelmeyer of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Vienna .
Perhaps Einstein was right that " God does not play dice , " and a photon has a true state that is somehow hidden from experiments .
Researchers learned that they could test a related question using photons that are entangled , meaning they are instantaneously connected over any distance in such a way that the measured property of one depends on the other — like a pair of dice that always comes up doubles .
In the 1982 experiment , if the photons " rolled doubles " more than a certain fraction of the time , it meant that particles violated something called local realism : the idea that influences between particles ripple through spacetime like waves ( locality ) and that particles have hidden nonrandom properties ( realism ) .
But which assumption might be wrong ?
" It could still be possible , " Aspelmeyer says , " that you maintain realism and that you just relax this locality condition . "
So he , along with team leader Anton Zeilinger and colleagues , tested a proposed antiquantum model in which influences travel instantaneously but particles have real properties ( no locality but realism ) .
They split red laser photons into entangled pairs and sent the twinned light particles along separate paths .
They then measured the polarizations of the photon at different angles to see how often they scored " doubles , " called correlations .
Aspelmeyer says the group 's hunch was that " if you allow for nonlocal interactions , anything goes , [ so ] you can recover quantum physics completely " without losing a grip on reality .
But , as in the older experiment , they once again saw more correlations than nonlocal realism allowed .
In other words , Aspelmeyer says , nonlocality is not enough to save realism from quantum theory .
In effect , quantum naysayers like Einstein would have to swallow the spider of nonrealism to catch the fly of nonlocality .
" You have to pay a price , " Aspelmeyer says .
" I 'm still amazed [ at the experiment 's outcome ] , I have to say . "
There are still other models of nonlocal realism that the experiment does not address , including some that are indistinguishable in principle from quantum theory , writes Alain Aspect of the Institute of Optics in Palaiseau , France , the leader of the 1982 experiment , in a comment published along with the findings in this week 's Nature .
" The conclusion one draws is more a question of taste than logic , " Aspect says .
" But I rather share the view that such experiments allow us to look deeper into the great mysteries of quantum mechanics . "
The sanitation of football continues apace : now , it seems , even verbal provocation is unacceptable , after Fifa today banned Marco Materazzi for two matches for his part in Zinedine Zidane 's infamous sending - off during the World Cup final .
Zidane 's violent conduct inevitably produced a three - match suspension , which will come into effect should he come out of retirement , while he was also fined 7500 Swiss francs ( £ 3260 ) .
Materazzi is 5000 Swiss francs ( £ 2170 ) worse off .
While Materazzi admitted abusing Zidane , who retaliated with a vicious chestbutt , his suspension sets a dangerous precedent with regard to verbal provocation , which has hitherto been perceived as part and parcel of a man 's game .
" In both of the players statements , the two players expressed regret over the incidents and presented their excuses to Fifa and the football community over what had happened , " said the spokesman Andreas Herren .
" They both stressed in statements that the verbal provocation was of an insulting nature but not - and I stress - of any racist nature . "
In punishing Materazzi so strictly for the mundane sporting offence of " insulting " comments , Fifa has defenestrated norms and mores that have been part of football 's fabric since time immemorial .
And in doing so , they would appear to have opened a Pandora 's Box : is sledging now banned ?
If not , what did Materazzi say that was so insulting as to demand punishment ?
Where is the line drawn ?
How can a line be drawn in an area that intrinsically produces the greyest shades ?
Materazzi may be piqued at the decision , or he may see it as a blessing in disguise : depending on any unscheduled friendlies , it means he may miss the rematch between France and Italy in Paris on September 6 .
Zidane , for his part , will not be stripped of the Golden Ball he was awarded as the player of the tournament .
" It was not even discussed , " said Herren , with a forthrightness that could easily be construed as confirming Fifa 's subscription to the prevalent mood of Zidane 's victimhood .
In doing so , and in hitting Materazzi so hard , Fifa has tweaked the footballing landscape in a way that could have significant repercussions .

Decision Tree Learning in Ruby
You ’ve built a vibrant community of Family Guy enthusiasts .
The SVD recommendation algorithm took your site to the next level by allowing you to leverage the implicit knowledge of your community .
But now you ’re ready for the next iteration - you are about to roll out some new opt - in customizations , but you do n’t want to bug every user by asking them if they want to participate .
And so it occurred to you : “ would n’t it be nice if we could just ask a subset of our users , and then extrapolate this knowledge to predict the preferences for the rest ? ”
And once again , machine learning comes to the rescue !
Except this time , it will be a decision tree .
Whether you ’re trying to solve a marketing problem , building a medical diagnosis system , or trying to learn the preferences of a user , this technique can do wonders .
Decision trees : what , where , and why
Decision trees fall into the category of inductive machine learning algorithms .
Given a set of examples ( training data ) described by some set of attributes ( ex. age , marital status , education ) the goal of the algorithm is to learn the decision function stored in the data and then use it to classify new inputs .
Let ’s work through an example :
For the full training dataset take a look at Christopher Roach ’s article .
His data is for a slightly different application , but we can easily translate this problem into the context of our Family Guy community .
Feeding all of the examples into the algorithm , and graphing the resulting tree gives us :
Our dataset contains four different attributes , but our decision tree shows that only three make a difference !
In this case , ‘ education ’ appears to be irrelevant to the final opt - in decision .
Intuitively , we could build a tree which contains every attribute by simply providing a path for every training example , but is that the best we can do ?
Instead , we want to eliminate attributes which serve as weak predictors ( education ) - we want to compress the data , and that is exactly what a decision tree algorithm will do .
Given a set of examples , and a list of attributes , a decision tree algorithm tries to find the smallest tree that is consistent with the examples .
As a bonus , the output of the algorithm can be automatically graphed and interpreted visually - a rare occurrence in the machine learning field .
In other words , do n’t be surprised if all of the sudden the VP of marketing becomes your best buddy !
Understanding information gain
We swept some of the details of the underlying algorithm under the rug , but they ’re worth a closer look .
In order to build our decision tree , we need to be able to distinguish between ‘ important ’ attributes , and attributes which contribute little to the overall decision process .
Intuitively , the most important attribute should go at the top of the tree because it carries the most information .
Likewise for the second attribute , third , and so forth .
But how do we quantify ‘ important ’ ?
Thankfully , Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver have already done most of the work for us in their 1949 publication : Model of Communication .
Specifically , they provided a formula to measure the numbers of bits required to encode a stream of data .
Thus , first we can measure the number of bits that our entire training set requires , and then we can repeat this procedure to measure the number of bits each attribute can provide us .
Intuitively , the attribute which will yield the most information should become our first decision node .
Then , the attribute is removed and this process is repeated recursively until all examples are classified .
For the mathematically inclined , this procedure can be translated into the following steps :
As you may have guessed , I ( a , b ) measures the amount of information .
First , the formula calculates the information required to classify the original dataset ( p - # of positive examples , n - # of negative examples ) .
Then , we split the dataset on the selected attribute ( with v choices ) and calculate the information gain .
This process is repeated for every attribute , and the one with the highest information gain is chosen to be our decision node .
Of course , there is a reason why we swept this stuff under the rug in the first place .
Instead of worrying about the math , you can simply make use of my freshly minted gem : decisiontree .
Install it , and we are ready to go : sudo gem install decisiontree
Learning discrete datasets ( classification )
When working with discrete datasets ( separate and distinct attribute labels ) , we are trying to solve a classification problem .
Let ’s take a look at how we can do this in Ruby :
require ' rubygems ' require ' decisiontree ' attributes = [ ' Age ' , ' Education ' , ' Income ' , ' Marital Status ' ] training = [ [ ' 36 - 55 ' , ' Masters ' , ' High ' , ' Single ' , 1 ] , [ ' 18 - 35 ' , ' High School ' , ' Low ' , ' Single ' , 0 ] , [ '< 18 ' , ' High School ' , ' Low ' , ' Married ' , 1 ] # ... more training examples ]
# Instantiate the tree , and train it based on the data ( set default to ' 1 ' ) dec_tree = DecisionTree :: ID3 Tree .
new ( attributes , training , 1 , : discrete ) dec_tree .
train test = [ '< 18 ' , ' High School ' , ' Low ' , ' Single ' , 0 ] decision = dec_tree .
predict ( test ) puts " Predicted : #{ decision } ...
True decision : #{ test .
last } " ; # Graph the tree , save to ' discrete.png ' dec_tree .
graph ( " discrete " )
Note that the last field in the training set specifies the label for that example ( opt - in or not ) .
You can also find the full example of the sample tree we discussed above bundled with the source of the gem .
In order to graph the tree , you will need Graphviz and GraphR libraries installed on your system .
Learning continuous datasets ( regression )
Regression , or learning datasets with continuous attributes ( temperature , height , etc. ) is also supported by the decisiontree gem .
In fact , the interface is remarkably similar :
require ' rubygems ' require ' decisiontree ' # Medical diagnosis based on chemical tests attributes = [ ' K ' , ' Na ' , ' Cl ' , ' Endotoxin ' ] training = [ [ 4 .
6 , 138 , 102 , 27 . 5 , 1 ] , [ 4 .
5 , 141 , 103 , 26 . 5 , 1 ] , [ 3 . 2 , 139 , 98 , 30 . 7 , 0 ] # ... more training examples ]
# Instantiate the tree , and train it based on the data ( set default to ' 1 ' ) dec_tree = DecisionTree :: ID3 Tree .
new ( attributes , training , 1 , : continuous ) dec_tree .
train test = [ 3 . 2 , 144 , 105 , 24 . 4 , 0 ] decision = dec_tree .
predict ( test ) puts " Predicted : #{ decision } ...
True decision : #{ test .
last } " ;
You will also find a full dataset and implementation of a decision tree regression bundled with the source code - this one is for medical diagnosis !
And that ’s it , now we ’re ready to roll our next batch of updates with some ( artificial ) intelligence .
This almost makes me wonder : what machine learning wonder will our Family Guy enthusiasts see next ?

Officials take blame for killer 's escape Fugitive still at large after walking out of jail in street clothes Charles Victor Thompson changed into street clothes and showed guards state employee identification .
YOUR E- MAIL ALERTS Texas Houston ( Texas ) Capital Punishment Crime , Law and Justice or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) -- Officials at a Houston jail took responsibility Friday for the escape of a convicted murderer who had recently been sentenced to die , a sheriff 's department spokesman said Friday .
Charles Victor Thompson , 35 , escaped Thursday afternoon from the Harris County Jail after changing into civilian clothes and talking his way past guards .
" There were a number of points where this could have been prevented , " Lt. John Martin told reporters .
" In this incident , there were a series of lapses .
The one thing that is evident about this incident is that it is 100 percent human error and absolutely could have been avoided . "
Thompson , 35 , was convicted of capital murder in April 1999 in the shooting deaths of his former girlfriend , Dennise Hayslip , and her friend Darren Cain , 30 .
Police have received a number of significant leads into Thompson 's whereabouts , Martin said .
Several agencies were searching for him , including the U.S. Marshals Service and the Gulf Coast Violent Offenders Task Force .
The U.S. Marshals Service announced Friday night a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to Thompson 's capture .
Thompson , who was resentenced to death October 28 , escaped after meet with an attorney .
Such meetings take place in a locked booth that has a Plexiglas divider between inmate and attorney .
No deputy is present so that the client - attorney privilege is maintained .
Thompson slipped out of his handcuffs , changed from his orange jumpsuit into street clothes and walked away after showing guards identification indicating he worked in the state attorney general 's office .
Thompson apparently had concealed the clothes and changed after the lawyer -- who was not his attorney of record -- left , Martin said .
Authorities do n't know how Thompson got out of the room , which had been locked .
Thompson went to a control center where he told a guard he was conducting an investigation for the state and said he did n't have a security badge because he had entered the jail through an adjoining building , Martin said .
The jail has surveillance cameras but no video recorders , Martin said .
It is n't known whether Thompson escaped in a vehicle or on foot .
After the escape , authorities accounted for all vehicles belonging to Thompson 's family , Martin said , but it took some time to find a truck belonging to Thompson 's brother .
It was unclear if the truck was used in the escape .
When he was last seen , Thompson was wearing khaki pants , a dark blue shirt and white tennis shoes .
" We will be looking at our security procedures , we will be determining what procedures simply were not followed and we will also be attempting to determine whether we need to implement stronger procedures or additional security procedures , " Martin said .
Chief Deputy Danny Billingsley said he was on duty when the escape occurred .
" As a department we 're embarrassed about this , " he said . " ...
I feel personally responsible because I was the ranking person on duty when this happened . "
The families of the victims were notified immediately after the escape .
Hayslip 's mother , Wynona Donaghy of Tomball , Texas , told reporters she had been advised to go into hiding .
" [ I 'm ] frightened , and hopefully not for long is he out , because he is a threat not only to himself but to anybody around him , " she said .
" I believe he 'd come after anybody .
He 's capable . "
Donaghy said she wanted to appear before reporters because she is convinced someone helped Thompson escape .
" They do n't know how dangerous he is , " she said .
Thompson 's resentencing was ordered by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals , which had upheld his conviction .

なぜか変なところでエラーが出る。どうにもそのエラーの原因が掴めない。そもそも、実行するごとに結果が違うし。ウワーン。
ちょっと変えたら動いてしまった。さっぱりわからん。俺が ruby の状態管理を追えてないだけなんだけれど。
まぁ、動いたからいいかぁ？（いい加減）
さて、作業としては 、
あさってのデモを作 る
AOT コンパイラ（ruby -> C）を作る
があるんだけど、今日一日で終わるだろうか。コンパイラは正直すぐ出来そうな気はするんだよな。もちろん、厳密なものは無理だけど（例外とか）。
1 bug 去って、また 1 bug
考えてたんだけど、やっぱりVM状態カウンタ（VM状態バージョンっていう言葉はやっぱり変ですね、反省）の比較は、インラインキャッシュでは要らないですねぇ。でも、まぁ現状の実装のほうが楽だから、そのままで行くか。
理由は、キャッシュするための記憶域のセットを管理できるから。多分。でも、その管理、結構面倒くさいな。とくに、ファイナライザ、というか命令列が
GC されるとき。
でも、管理はできるので、やっぱりそのようにする必要はあるな。
つまり、先日のはこうなる。
// 排他制御必要なし if ( klass == mc->mc_klass ) { mn = mc-> mc_method ; } else{ mn = rb_method_node ( klass , id ) ; // メソッド実体を検索 mc->mc_klass = klass ; mc-> mc_method = mn ; } // 排他制御必要あり if ( mc ) { if ( klass == mc->mc_klass ) { mn = mc-> mc_method ; } else{ mn = rb_method_node ( klass , id ) ; if( mc->mc_rewrite_count++ > threshold ) {
// これ以上インラインメソッドキャッシュを利用しないようにする cancel_inline_method_cache(mc ) ; SET_METHOD_CACHE_ENTRY_TO_OPERAND(GET_PC ( ) , 0 ) ; } else { cancel_inline_method_cache(mc ) ; mc = NEW_METHOD_CACHE_ENTRY ( ) ; register_inline_method_cache(mc ) ; mc->mc_klass = klass ; mc->mc_method = mn ; SET_METHOD_CACHE_ENTRY_TO_OPERAND(GET_PC ( ) , mc ) ; } } } else { // もうメソッドキャッシュはしない mn = rb_method_node ( klass , id ) ; }
なんか、ほんとにこれでいいのかイマイチ疑問だが・・・（この処理の途中で再定義があったとき、正しく動くんだろうか？）
新しく登録するときに、ロックが必要な気がするな。
else { cancel_inline_method_cache(mc ) ; mc = register_inline_method_cache( klass , mn ) ; SET_METHOD_CACHE_ENTRY_TO_OPERAND(GET_PC ( ) , mc ) ; }
こうするのがいいだろうか。
よろしくないなぁ 。cancel したエントリを利用する可能性がある。
else { cancel_inline_method_cache(mc ) ; register_inline_method_cache(klass , mn , GET_PC ( ) ) ; }
ここまで必要ですねえ。
で、register_inline_method_cache で、適切なロックが必要。
って、これ も2重に cancel して、ゴミが残る可能性があるのか。
else { cancel_and_register_inline_method_cache(mc , klass , mn , GET_PC ( ) ) ; }
結局、この部分はアトミックに行なわないといけないってことで。
デスクトップでcygwin用に ruby / sdl をビルドして，ノートに持っていったら起動しない．dlopen のエラーと出る．問題はいろいろ思いつくけど，なんでだろう．cygwin が古いだけ，というのもありそう．
発表前なのに，プレゼンの準備をしないで AOT compiler を作り始める．ダメダメだ ．
で，リテラルを C に落とすのがとても面倒そうだ ．
i=0 while i<100000000 i+=1 end # = > ruby
81.203000 0.031000 81.234000 ( 81.446000 ) yarv 6.860000 0.047000 6.907000 ( 6.902000 ) aotc 0.796000 0.016000 0.812000 ( 0.843000 )
というわけで，AOT compiler を作ってみた ．2時間くらい．
100倍速くなる．まぁ，かなり限定したシチュエーションですが．もちろん，Ruby 全部が 100 倍 早くなるわけは無い．
でも，目算どおりで，良かった．
メソッド呼び出しを入れると，10倍くらい遅くなる予定．10倍で済むだろうか．
ちなみに，メソッド呼び出しはまだ実装していない．例外なども，なんにも考えてない．
せめて，tak くらいはできるようにしておかないと駄目だろうか．
うーん，きちんと作れば速いものができるような気がするな．とりあえず，aot compiled method を特別に扱う（rb_call0 みたいなところで扱う）ようにして，ごにょごにょと・・・．
NODE_CFUNC みたいなのは，かなり無駄が多かったり多くなかったりするから．
メソッドの起動がどれだけ速かったり遅かったりするかが勝負だなぁ．
ちなみにコンパイラは 100 行 くらいで ruby でガーーっと書いたので，ダメダメ．グローバル変数とか使ってるし．コミットしたくもないけど，どうしようかなあ．
ちなみに，上記 Ruby プログラムに対して，こんなコードを吐く ．

So in addition to dropping a couple of high - capacity disks this morning , Samsung also gave us some interesting ( albeit , depressing ) insight into their thoughts on Solid State Disk penetration at a session on SSD vs. hard drives at a product conference in JapanBig stuff when you consider Samsung 's pioneering role to supplant traditional 1.8 - inch hard disk drives with flash - lovin ' SSDs .
We 've already heard from Sandisk that SSD prices should fall by about 60 % annually .
Nice , but SSDs are currently 5 x the cost of their mechanical brethren : $ 7.5 / GB compared to $ 1.4 / GB for HDDs .
Even by 2010 , Samsung ( backed by DataQuest research ) still estimates at least a 3.x gap : $ 1.9 / GB for SSDs vs $ 0.9 / GB for HDDs according to Hwang 's law .
In other words , we 'll be paying a significant premium for flash memory 's lickity quick boots and greater reliability long into the future .
Still , a 128GB SSD for $ 243 ?
Give us two , please .
JAM - 1 is located in the walls of blood vessels in the brain
Scientists at Bristol University say the findings could lead to new ways of treating the condition , which affects about one in five Britons .
They isolated a protein , JAM - 1 , in the brain which appeared to trap white blood cells , obstructing blood flow .
This can cause inflammation and result in poor oxygen supply to the brain .
Brain blood pressure
Professor Julian Paton and colleagues believe these , in turn , trigger events that raise blood pressure , the journal Hypertension reports .
The future challenge will be to understand the type of inflammation within the vessels in the brain
Lead researcher Professor Julian Paton
Their studies in rats show JAM - 1 is linked to raised blood pressure , but the exact mechanisms behind this are still unclear .
They are now looking at the human brain to understand more .
Professor Paton explained : " The future challenge will be to understand the type of inflammation within the vessels in the brain , so that we know what drug to use , and how to target them .
" JAM - 1 could provide us with new clues as to how to deal with this disease .
" We are looking at the possibility of treating those patients that fail to respond to conventional therapy for hypertension with drugs that reduce blood vessel inflammation and increase blood flow within the brain . "
Drug target
Professor Jeremy Pearson of the British Heart Foundation , which funded the latest work , said : " This exciting study is important because it suggests there are unexpected causes of high blood pressure related to blood supply to the brain .
" It therefore opens up the possibility of new ways to treat this common , but often poorly managed , condition . "
It has been known for some time that the brain can affect blood pressure .
A team of researchers , led by Neurosurgery expert Mr Alex Green of Oxford 's John Radcliffe Hospital , found they could make patients ' blood pressure increase or decrease by stimulating very specific regions of the brain with electrodes .
Mr Green said the latest work was " very exciting " and that it suggested JAM - 1 could be a good target for new blood pressure therapies .
Professor Graham MacGregor , chairman of the Blood Pressure Association , cautioned that the work was at a very early stage and much more extensive research was needed .
He said blood pressure medicines currently prescribed by doctors could be very effective , provided they were taken correctly and in combination with leading a healthy lifestyle .
Although high blood pressure , also known as hypertension , can cause headaches , dizziness and problems with vision , the majority of people with the condition do not display any noticeable symptoms .
It can lead to heart attack , stroke and kidney damage , but medication can be used to control its effects if changes to lifestyle fail to lower blood pressure .
Don Marti has a thorough write - up of the cross-pollination happening between OLPC and a bunch of free software projects .
I enjoyed the last paragraph of the article the most :
Just as the CM1 ’s software is getting an overhaul , so is the keyboard .
“ Nicholas Negroponte ’s one absolute demand is to get rid of Caps Lock , ” Gettys says .
And , Bender says , “ There ’s one new key they get that ’s the important one and that ’s the View Source key . ”
Having “ the freedom to view the source ” can seem very abstract , and having a “ View Source ” key makes this feature of the machines clear to the users .
Imagine one of these kids visiting an Apple Store1 sometime in the future and innocently asking where the “ View Source ” key is .
“ Let you view the source ?
But that ’s our property , it belongs to us , you ca n’t have it . ”
For anyone wondering how the technical side to the key can work : almost all of the code the user runs is written in Python , and the system keeps precise track of what ’s running where .
One of the inspirations for OLPC is the powerful ability children have to learn with minimal guidance ; an ability which is consistently underestimated by adults .
By providing free software in this way , the very structure of the machine reflects the potential for self - guided learning that originally motivated the creation of the device .
We ’ve added many new features to the laptop since I started working with OLPC — a webcam , SD card reader and dedicated NAND flash controller are the latest — but it ’s going to take something very special to supplant the “ View Source ” key as my favourite addition .
( : I do n’t mean to pick on Apple ; insert any such vendor here .
I chose Apple ’ cause they ’re both a hardware and software manufacturer .
In fact , as the article points out , Apple have helped us out significantly by agreeing to let the Squeak Foundation release the Squeak Smalltalk environment under an Apache - style license .
Squeak will be one of the main programming languages used by the kids . )
Cardiff University scientists will shortly set sail ( March 5 ) to investigate a startling discovery in the depths of the Atlantic .
Scientists have discovered a large area thousands of square kilometres in extent in the middle of the Atlantic where the Earth ’s crust appears to be missing .
Instead , the mantle - the deep interior of the Earth , normally covered by crust many kilometres thick - is exposed on the seafloor , 3000 m below the surface .
Marine geologist Dr Chris MacLeod , School of Earth , Ocean and Planetary Sciences said : " This discovery is like an open wound on the surface of the Earth .
Was the crust never there ?
Was it once there but then torn away on huge geological faults ?
If so , then how and why ? "
To answer some of these questions Dr MacLeod with a team of scientists , led by marine geophysicist Professor Roger Searle , Durham University , will travel to the area which lies mid-way between the Cape Verde Islands and the Caribbean .
The expedition will be the inaugural research cruise of a new UK research ship RRS James Cook .
The team intends to use sonars to image the seafloor and then take rock cores using a robotic seabed drill .
The samples will provide a rare opportunity to gain insights into the workings of the mantle deep below the surface of the Earth .
Progress of the cruise can be monitored via a live web link to the ship : http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/gg/classroom@sea/JC007/
“ He ’s not the Prime Minister Tony Blair of Iraq , ” General Petraeus said of Mr. Maliki on Thursday .
“ He does not have a parliamentary majority .
He does not have his ministers in all of the different ministries , ” and they “ sometimes sound a bit discordant in their statements to the press and their statements to other countries .
It ’s a very , very challenging situation in which to lead . ”
Mr. Bush was careful when he announced his new strategy in January to avoid public estimates of how quickly Mr. Maliki might take steps toward political reconciliation .
Even now ,
White House officials are being careful not to describe with any precision the mix of benchmarks they expect Mr. Maliki to deliver .
By the time Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus complete a comprehensive assessment of progress in September , three months after the troop increase has been fully in place , American officials are hoping that some of the pieces of crucial legislation will have passed .
But Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates found himself pressing Mr. Maliki last week to keep Parliament from taking a two - month summer break .
If lawmakers remain in Baghdad , said one senior American official who did not want to be identified because he was discussing internal White House deliberations , “ we ’ll have some outputs then . ”
He added , “ That ’s different from having outcomes , ” drawing a distinction between a sign of activity and a sign of success , which could take considerably longer .
In public , Mr. Bush has remained enthusiastic about Mr. Maliki , with whom he talks over a secure video link every few weeks .
But Mr. Bush was also publicly supportive of several of Mr. Maliki ’s predecessors , even though White House officials now dismiss many of them as ill - suited for the job .
In January , Mr. Bush characterized Mr. Maliki as an architect of the troop increase plan , even while telling visiting Congressional leaders that “ I said to Maliki this has to work or you ’re out , ” according to two officials who were in the room .
Pressed on why he thought the new strategy would succeed where previous efforts had failed , Mr. Bush shot back , “ Because it has to . ”
The word “ finance ” is a scary one to many people .
It does n’t have to be this way though – not if you ’re willing to educate yourself and study the market in its current state in some depth .
You do n’t have to be a financial expert to know how to make the right decisions for your own personal finances , and you certainly do n’t need to live on the edge of poverty if you ’re smart about using your money and saving from the right things .
The reality is that we have more tools than ever available at our disposal to sort out our financial situations and to ensure that we ’re in a good position at any time .
But it takes some effort to make proper use of those tools , and it also takes a bit of experience which you can only obtain by educating yourself .
How to Develop a Budget
Start with the basics – if you do n’t have a budget yet , it ’s time to develop one .
This is not as scary as it sounds .
You just have to figure out where most of your money is going towards , draw up some tables , and see if you can cut any corners without impacting the rest of your finances in any noticeable way .
Sometimes you ’ll discover that you ’ve been spending far too money on things that can be avoided completely .
In other cases , you ’ll spot opportunities for consolidating some of your expenses into single payments .
The important point is to get a good overview of your situation instead of shooting in the dark .
You have to know how every move you make with your money affects you in the long run .
And this will require an adequate top - down view of your financial situation .
Helpful Tools
You have a large variety of tools at your disposal that can be quite helpful for this .
The internet is the most important one .
You should not forget that you have a powerful computer in your pocket either – your smartphone can be very useful for keeping track of your budget in multiple ways .
It can allow you to check your bank account balance , transfer money on the go , and compare deals for something while you ’re out and about .
Proper use of a smartphone can make it one of the most valuable investments you can make in your personal finances these days , so needless to say , you should make it a priority to familiarize yourself with your phone and what it can do for you .
Expanding into the Market
Once you ’re more comfortable handling your money , you might want to take a deeper look into the market , and explore some opportunities for taking advantage of it more actively .
Investing is a good example of that .
There is no shortage of options if you want to do something of this sort , but it should go without saying that you should maintain an educated approach to this .
If you do n’t know what you ’re doing , it can quickly backfire and cause you to actually lose money !
There are lots of examples out there of people who ’ve made one wrong move with their personal finances and have ended up in severe financial distress as a result .
Using Loans the Right Way
A loan can be a good tool for getting out of such situations .
On the other hand , it can also be a double - bladed knife that can make things more difficult for you if you ’re not sure what you ’re doing .
You have to compare the available deals on loans very carefully if you ’ve decided to get one , and never make a decision like this lightly .
You must also be confident in your ability to actually get that loan paid off on time .
When used right though , it ’s one of the best things you can do to help yourself out of a tough spot .
Many people underestimate the potential of loans in this regard , but the truth is that they ’re one of the most useful tools on the financial market in its current state .
The bad reputation some types of loans might have is mostly owed to the fact that people tend to use them irresponsibly , without planning ahead or considering the implications .
As a result , they end up owing more than they can realistically handle , and they see no way out of their situations .
This does n’t have to be the case with you though .
A little bit of planning can go a long way in avoiding issues of this type .
Why Cleaning Your Windows is Essential
Do n’t underestimate the value of maintaining your windows clean .
Most people think it ’s all about beauty , but in reality , there are some excellent reasons why cleaning your window is more severe than you might think .
Most people like it when their windows are neat but do n’t like the method of cleaning them or having them polished .
It could be that this despised task gets overlooked because people do n’t know how important it is , and why it should not be at the behind of their priority list .
This information was shared by the best service for window cleaning Carlsbad has to offer .
Why You Need to Keep Your Windows Clean
In today ’s world , everyone is concerned about is being efficient in energy , and your windows can make a difference .
You may think that by having energy - efficient windows , you ’ve done all the methods you can do , but you may be shocked to know that even dirt shreds on your windows can reduce their heating capability .
As dirt shreds build upon the covering and in the holes of your windows , they start to reflect some of the UV light continuously from your home , lowering the amount of sun that can enter and add warmth .
The integrity of the glass may become vulnerable and more easily shattered , and the clearness can become clouded due to the outcomes of Dirt resting on your windows .
Because the lens is permeable ( not everyone is aware of this ) , dust and microorganisms can grow up inside the pores , lessening the durability of your windows .
Besides dust , other things that can harm your windows and should be cleaned off are : acid rain the buildup of minerals left behind from hard water oxidation that happens from window screens and alloy window frames accidental overspray from building materials such as paint , mortar , chalk , drywall texture or other substances
The smoke film can develop on the inside of your windows from cigarettes , candles , cooking , or the fireplace , which can leave lingering smells and affect breathing .
Clean windows are good feng shui !
Our glasses are the “ eyes of the home , ” they then become our vision of the world and how we see life .
And at last , we all know that clean windows will affect the curb appeal and interior look of our home if we are trying to sell it .
Windows are one of the common things that people see in an establishment .
Sadly , many people usually ignore the importance of having spotless windows , whether it is high rise window cleaning or commercial window cleaning .
Windows regularly cleaned can make a significant impact on the appearance of an establishment .
There are many benefits linked with having clean windows , from the improved overall appearance of the building to enhanced comfort .
Window cleaning aids to allow more natural light to come in .
Time windows typically become dull due to contaminants such as oxidation , hard mineral , acid rain , paint , spray , among others that prevent natural sunlight from penetrating inside the establishment .
This will make your home or office to look dark .
Proper window cleaning is essential because it helps to remove pollutants and contaminants that have stuck on the glass and have limited natural sunlight from entering inside .
This part alone not only serves to make your home or office or look nice , but it also adds more comfort and turns the room space to appear more prominent and more appealing .
Grime , Dirt , and dust usually tend to settle on windows over time if they are not regularly cleaned .
They not only make the window look dull , but it also increases the growth of allergen that can cause allergic reactions , skin problems , and respiratory problems .
However , if you hire a professional window cleaning service to clean the window regularly , you will not only help to enhance their overall look , but you will also help to eliminate dirt , grime , and allergens that can produce serious health problems .
Bill Maher appeared on Scarborough last night for the second part of his interview .
This time Maher listed the reasons why Bush should be impeached .
Download - WMV Download - QT
Bill has been very outspoken on the seven minutes that Bush sat there after hearing the news " the country is under attack " .
Scarborough tried to spin what was actually told to Bush into something much better , but Bill quickly put old Joe back into his place .
The most interesting part though is when Scarborough says he is " more a Libertarian than a Conservative " .
For years Scarborough prided himself on being a conservative ( one of Newt 's conservatives ) , but now it appears he is ashamed of what a conservative really is ( or has become ) , so he has decided to give his political leanings a new title .
Could this be a sign of things to come in the political world ?

Filed under : Protest Babes
There is something we the women can't stand the most : religious fundamentalism , which denies our individual liberty .
There is , in my opinion , a religion that oppresses the women more than all the others in the recent history : Islam .
And its political wing , Islamism , is a totalitarian ideology that makes of oppression of the woman its raison d'etre .
That is why , the protest babes are always on the side of secularism , compared to the old , black - dressed Islamist women .
Turkey also has its protest babes , and they are there to defend secularism against the Islamist threat .
There has been intense lobbying on both sides
The measure passed by 63 votes to 37 , falling short of the two - thirds majority needed to override the veto .
Opinion polls suggest most Americans back the research , which scientists hope will lead to cures for illnesses like Parkinson 's and Alzheimer's .
But Mr Bush has consistently opposed embryonic research on moral grounds .
The simple answer is he thinks murder 's wrong
Tony Snow
White House spokesman
Q&A : US debate on stem cells
What are stem cells ?
The vote came at the end of two days of emotional debates on three separate stem cell bills .
The most controversial bill , the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act , scraps limits on federal funding imposed by Mr Bush in 2001 .
It has already been passed by the House of Representatives .
The bill was backed by 44 Democrats and 19 Republicans , while 36 Republicans and one Democrat opposed it .
White House spokesman Tony Snow said Mr Bush 's veto - his first in nearly six years in office - would be " pretty swift " .
" He is fulfilling a promise that he has long made and he is keeping it , " he said .
The other two - less controversial - bills received unanimous backing from the Senate , and are expected to be signed into law by President Bush .
One encourages stem cell research using cells from sources other than embryos , and the other bill bans the growing and aborting of foetuses for research .
Election issue
In the years since Mr Bush imposed limits on federal funding , pressure has been building for a loosening of restrictions .
Opinion polls suggest almost two - thirds of Americans support the research .
PRESIDENTIAL VETOES George W Bush : 0 Bill Clinton : 38 George Bush Snr : 44 Ronald Reagan : 78 FD Roosevelt : 635 Thomas Jefferson : 0
Bush set for Senate clash
Campaigners for stem cell research include prominent Republicans such as Nancy Reagan , whose husband , former President Ronald Reagan , died after a long battle with Alzheimer's .
But Mr Bush - along with many other conservative Republicans - has remained firmly against any change to the law .
" The simple answer is he thinks murder 's wrong , " Tony Snow said .
" The president is not going to get on the slippery slope of taking something living and making it dead for the purposes of scientific research . "
It seems set to become an issue in November 's mid-term congressional elections .
I 'm all about the cheese , baby
( Hi , Digg !
Thanks for visiting . )
I was n't sure whether to post this under amusing bits , or create a whole new category for " freakin ' disgusting . "
As a full - time student , and little - time earning a paycheque guy , I am now making purchases of computer equipment vicariously through friends and family members .
One friend , after suffering through endless reloading of his XP machine because of bad hard drives , and innumerable virii , finally decided he wanted a Mac , but was looking for nothing fancy .
I find a suitable -- and excellently usable -- PowerMac G4 , of the " Quicksilver " variety on eBay .
I bid , I win , I pay , it ships .
I pick it up from the UPS depot in International Falls , MN ... and when the UPS guy brings it out , I can hear it tumbling around in the box .
Ouch -- not well packed .
Sigh .
I sign for it , haul it out to the van , and slice it open , fearful of what I might find .
Here 's what I see :
Well , there 's foam padding in the top , but not enough .
Packing material pretty lacking .
But .... wait -- what is that , peeking through the foam ?
No , it 's not .....
Yup -- it 's a pizza box .
Well , dead air crush space , not a bad idea to use .
( Cue creeping sense of horror )
You do n't suppose it's ....um.......
Hey , excellent -- I heard hardened , leftover pizza cheese and grease acts as an antistatic barrier !
Lucky me .
Underneath yon bacteria - laden packing material lies the G4 in question -- somehow , amazingly , intact , apparently .
And , our illustrious eBayer appears to have included a keyboard with it , packed underneath the G4 .
That 's a nice unexpected ......( lifts the G4 up to see the keyboard )
Holy...mother ....of.... crap .
I thought the pizza box was bad -- apparently , eBay is now suggesting using 2 litre pop bottles and milk jugs to protect my purchase .
Could this get any worse or more disgusting ?
Apparently , it could .
Observe , if you will , the milk jug in question .
Good to know our favourite eBay seller is n't lactose intolerant -- and really , milk and pizza go well together .
Besides , why not have more bacteria protection on the * other * side of the G4 ?
I was completely overwhelmed by the situation .
How on God 's green earth could anyone think that I 'd do the Mypos Dance of Joy over the arrival of a computer , packed with someone 's garbage ?
Surprised -- nay shocked -- as you might be , gentle reader , the machine arrived , and the hard drive merrily engaged in the " click of death " on bootup .
And was short half the RAM that it was supposed to have .
And was a slower processor than first described .
Oh joy -- hours of leg work ahead of me for a computer that ISN'T EVEN MINE .
After jumping through requisite hoops , I was finally able to get a partial refund , more RAM , and another HD out of the seller -- which he shipped sans garbage , much to my disappointment .
I was thinking , " Smaller box , maybe this time I 'll get a used condom , or a ziploc bag of cat hairballs . "
No juice .
He did , however , ship the RAM and HD sans antistatic protection , as well .
Sigh .
Rumsfeld ’s transition raises questions
By Rowan Scarborough – THE WASHINGTON TIMES – January 25 , 2007
On Jan. 4 , Mr. Rumsfeld opened a government - provided transition office in Arlington and has seven Pentagon - paid staffers working for him , a Pentagon official said .
The Pentagon lists Mr. Rumsfeld as a “ nonpaid consultant , ” a status he needs in order to review secret and top - secret documents , the official said .

Rethinking the Draft
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
Once again the possibility of reinstating a military draft is being discussed in Washington , and while the idea seems remote it is not unthinkable .
Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel of New York , soon to be a powerful committee chair , has openly called for reinstating the Selective Service System .
Retired Army General Barry McCaffrey claims that our ground forces in both Afghanistan and Iraq are stretched far too thin , and desperately need reinforcements .
Meanwhile , other political and military leaders suggest that several hundred thousand additional troops might be needed simply to restore some semblance of order in Iraq .
We are nearing the point where a choice will have to be made : either decrease our troop commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan significantly , or produce thousands of new military recruits quickly .
So a discussion of military conscription is not purely academic .
Yet the Department of Defense remains steadfastly opposed to a draft .
A Pentagon report stated that draft registration could be eliminated " with no effect on military mobilization and no measurable effect on military recruitment . "
Most military experts believe a draft would actually impair military readiness , despite the increase in raw manpower , because of training and morale problems .
So why is the idea of a draft even considered ?
One answer is that our military forces are spread far too thin , engaged in conflicts around the globe that are none of our business .
With hundreds of thousands of troops stationed in literally hundreds of foreign nations , we simply do n’t have enough soldiers to invade and occupy every country labeled a threat or deemed ripe for regime change .
Given the choice , many in Congress would rather draft more young bodies than rethink our role as world policeman and bring some of our troops home .
Military needs aside , some politicians simply love the thought of mandatory service to the federal government .
The political right favors sending young people to fight in aggressive wars like Iraq .
The political left longs to send young people into harm ’s way to save the world in places like Darfur .
But both sides share the same belief that citizens should serve the needs of the state– a belief our founders clearly rejected in the Declaration of Independence .
To many politicians , the American government is America .
This is why , on a crude level , the draft appeals to patriotic fervor .
Compulsory national service , whether in the form of military conscription or make - work programs like AmeriCorps , still sells on Capitol Hill .
Conscription is wrongly associated with patriotism , when really it represents collectivism and involuntary servitude .
I believe wholeheartedly that an all - volunteer military is not only sufficient for national defense , but also preferable .
It is time to abolish the Selective Service System and resign military conscription to the dustbin of American history .
Five hundred million dollars have been wasted on Selective Service since 1979 , money that could have been returned to taxpayers or spent to improve the lives of our nation ’s veterans .
Ronald Reagan said it best : " The most fundamental objection to draft registration is moral . "
The notion of involuntary servitude , in whatever form , is simply incompatible with a free society .
Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas .

The best ...
1. Apocalypse Now -- Helicopter attack
Francis Ford Coppola , 1979
" I love the smell of napalm in the morning .
It smells like victory . "
Robert Duvall 's helicopters wreak bloody destruction upon a Vietnamese village to the strains of Wagner 's Ride of the Valkyries in order to secure a beachhead for a bit of post - combat surfing .
No cinematic moment better captures the folly , absurdity and tragic human cost of America 's war against the Vietcong .
2. Saving Private Ryan -- Omaha Beach landing
Steven Spielberg , 1998
The graphic depiction of the Omaha beach D - Day landing shocked audiences and even induced flashbacks in Normandy veterans .
The shaky , hand held cameras , the desaturated color and the unflinching portrayal of the near - suicidal assault all add up to a sickening sense of realism that remains unmatched in war films .
3= Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers -- Helm's Deep
Peter Jackson , 2002
The dull , impending stomp of Saruman 's army ; the ceaseless onslaught of the Uruk Hai ; the inevitable breaching of the unbreachable fort .
Jackson captures the desperation of the 300 men facing a host of Orcs 10,000 - strong , and the terror of their women and children , against the long , rain - drenched night in the most atmospheric of the Lord of the Rings battles .
Oh , the relief when Gandalf arrives on time .
( Still not convinced by Legolas skateboarding down the ramparts , though . )
3= Lord of the Rings : Return of the King -- Pelennor Fields
( until the Army of the Dead arrive )
Peter Jackson , 2003
The Orcs get even more hideous , the Oliphaunts are awe - inspiring , the Winged Nazgul had you cowering behind your popcorn .
Theoden is at last redeemed on the battlefield , and with one line and swish of her sword , Eowyn proves she 's equal with the men .
This spectacular whirlwind of CGI , distorted sound and awesome scale stunned audiences , and was rightly hailed as a movie milestone .
Then it all goes horribly wrong .
( See below . )
5. A Bridge Too Far -- Parachute drop
Richard Attenborough , 1977
Thousands of doomed Allied troops are dispatched behind enemy lines in an awe - inspiring parachute drop , followed by the climactic tank and infantry battle over the bridge at Arnhem .
Richard Attenborough 's cast is stellar ( including Anthony Hopkins , Laurence Olivier , Sean Connery , Dirk Bogarde , Ryan O'Neal and Robert Redford ) and his pre-CGI achievement staggering .
6. Tora ! Tora !
Tora ! --
Attack on Pearl Harbor
Richard Fleischer , Kinji Fukasaku , Toshio Masuda , 1970
There are two good films about Pearl Harbor .
Neither of them is called Pearl Harbor ( see below ) .
If " From Here to Eternity " dealt brilliantly with the human drama of the event , " Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! " captures the sheer audacity of the Japanese aerial raid on the naval base .
Massively expensive for its time ( it cost an estimated $ 25 million ) and featuring three directors , one American and two Japanese , this is truly filmmaking on an epic scale .
7. Zulu -- Battle of Rourke's Drift
Cy Endfield , 1964
" Zulus , thousands of ' em " -- as Michael Caine never said .
The portrayal of the 1879 Battle of Rourke 's Drift has proved deeply influential , inspiring Peter Jackson 's staging of the Battle of Helm 's Deep and echoed in Paul Verhoeven 's Starship Troopers .
You still feel the chill in the pit of your stomach when you see the tidal wave of Zulu impis running down the side of the valley at the meager 150 British soldiers .
8. Starship Troopers -- Battle of Klendathu , Battle on Planet P
Paul Verhoeven , 1997
" They sucked his brains out ! "
A bloody bugfest on Klendathu sees 100,000 troops hacked , ripped and squished to death in an hour ; then we follow Rico 's roughnecks to Planet P where his poorly - equipped infantry are sent back as bait for thousands of spiky Arachnids .
But is it really the bugs who 're the evil ones ?
Slick , smart B - movie action .
9. Braveheart -- Battle of Stirling
Mel Gibson , 1995
" They may take our lives , but they will never take our FREEDOM ! "
Woaded - up Mel Gibson plays Scottish rebel William Wallace and tries nobly to overthrow the beastly English .
His victory at the Battle of Stirling is scarcely a model of historical accuracy , but tremendous fun nonetheless and , if there were one , Gibson 's rousing taunts would have won him the Oscar for best battlefield banter .
10 . Gladiator -- Battle in Germania
Ridley Scott , 2000
Classical chaos in the thrilling Germania opening battle , as the Romans pitch a mudfight against hairy , scary forest - dwelling barbarians .
Russell Crowe single - handedly revived epic sword - and - sandal films ; thousands of movie extras cheered , then were digitally replaced .
And the worst ...
Star Wars : Return of the Jedi -- Battle of Endor
Richard Marquand , 1983
The Empire 's frighteningly efficient professional armored troops , backed by the power of the Dark Side , complete with towering Scout Walkers , speeder bikes and ray guns get defeated by ... a bunch of overgrown Tribbles armed with rocks and creepers .
Er , no .
Not even with Han Solo on your side .
Star Wars : The Phantom Menace -- Battle of Naboo
George Lucas , 1999
A chilling multitude of battle droids , reminiscent of Wall - era Pink Floyd ; an outnumbered coalition of oppressed good guys ; lashings of lightsaber action .
The trouble is , we just do n't care .
And in the world 's worst cinematic travesty ever , Qui -Gon Jinn dies ; Jar Jar Binks does n't .
Life just ai n't fair .
King Arthur -- Battle of Badon Hill
Antoine Fuqua , 2004
This muddy , bloody yawn - fest stretched even the most credulous Bruckheimer fans .
We 're supposed to root for irritatingly feisty Keira Knightley battling in a ridiculous leather / woad bikini combo ?
Hand - to - hand with a bunch of hefty Saxon invaders ?
In the dead of winter ?
Give us a break .
Lord of the Rings : Return of the King -- Pelennor Fields
Peter Jackson , 2003
... and then the staunch resistance of the Men of Gondor and the Rohirrim 's endeavors on the battlefield are all rendered utterly pointless when the Army of the Dead swoop in at the end .
Could n't they have turned up a bit earlier ?
An oversimplified cop out .
Dune -- Battle of Arrakis
David Lynch , 1984
What could be more awe - inspiring than Kyle Maclachlan riding a vacuum - cleaner hose disguised as a giant sandworm as he leads his Fremen warriors into battle against the legions of Sardaukar ?
Quite a lot of things , as it turned out .
A so - bad - it 's - almost - good $ 30 million turkey that tried and failed to be the next Star Wars .
Great death for Baron Harkkonen , though .
Pearl Harbor -- Attack on Pearl Harbor
Michael Bay , 2001
This bloated extravaganza manages to turn the tragedy of Pearl Harbor into a schmaltzy love triangle constructed from Hollywood 's finest overpaid wood .
Worse still , Ben Affleck survives .

Carl and Danielle Dockings met playing cards online
Carl Dockings , 36 , from Newport , south Wales , popped the question to Danielle at Chicago 's O'Hare Airport after the pair met playing cards on the internet .
The 26 - year - old said " yes " and the couple were married four months later .
The pair are now settled in his home city with their daughter Isabel , who was born on New Year 's Day .
Council worker Mr Dockings explained how the couple met while playing the card game gin online .
He was really funny and we seemed to click right away
Danielle Dockings
He said : " I 'd always liked cards and was filling in the evening .
I went on there and bumped into Danielle playing in a card game and we hit it off straight away .
" I was inundated with work and the computer was where I went to relax and wind down and that 's where I found Danielle .
" We got on so well .
We just seemed to know what the other was thinking .
" Danielle 's the most loving , caring person I 've ever met and that came through straight away . "
' Terrified '
Mr Dockings said the pair had fallen in love before even exchanging pictures , but that sending a photograph was still a " nerve - wracking " experience .
He said : " We finally agreed to swap photos and Danielle sent one over first - after seeing the photo of her I was terrified of sending the photo of myself . "
When Mr Docking flew to Chicago to meet his bride - to - be , who is from nearby Wisconsin , he did not waste time before popping the question .
Mr Docking , who also has children aged six and nine , said : " I gave her a cuddle and a kiss and told her how happy I was being there .
" We walked for a couple of minutes to the train station at Chicago airport and I thought ' I 've got to have this woman for life ' and that 's when I popped the question and I went down and proposed to her . "
' Good conversation '
Mrs Docking said the proposal was not a complete surprise after the pair had got to know each other through months of online messaging .
She said : " I had a feeling he would [ propose ] - we 'd talked about it .
" We were chatting and emailing and playing cards for about 10 months .
" It was good conversation - there was never any awkward silence .
He was really funny and we seemed to click right away .
" I was able to pick up on how loving and caring he was because we would talk about our day to day lives and he would talk about how he was with his kids .
" I fell in love with his personality and the kind of person he was . "
Python Proposal : Accumulation Displays
( Status : this proposal will not go forward , but helped spark a discussion on a better idea -- generator expressions . )
List displays ( aka list comprehensions ) have proven to be a useful and popular part of Python .
However , there are limitations on what they can do , and they sometimes lead to inefficiencies : it is tempting to create a list of intermediate results , even when the whole list is not really needed .
Consider finding the maximum termperature over the last day , where you have a function , temp , that takes an hour as argument and fetches the temperature .
With list comprehensions this is :
max ( [ temp ( hour ) for hour in range ( 24 ) ] )
[ Max : temp ( hour ) for hour in range ( 24 ) ]
[ Sum : x*x for x in numbers ] [ Product : Prob_spam ( word ) for word in email_msg ] [ Min : temp ( hour ) for hour in range ( 24 ) ]

Another way to look at it is that there are some common algorithms in programming , such as finding the best element ( s ) or value (s ) from a candidate set , that appear again and again , and this allows us to abstract out these algorithms , rather than re-implement them every time .
One drawback of my proposal is that the [ ... ] syntax suggests that a list is returned , when that need not be the case .
My defense is that it is iterating over a list ( or at least , an iterable ) .
But Guido pronounced , quite reasonably , that this was not a sufficient defense .
There have been past discussions of set displays and dict displays , using syntax something like :
words = { w.lower ( ) for w in text.split( ) } squares = { i :i* i for i in range ( N ) }
words = [ Set : w.lower ( ) for w in text.split( ) ] squares =
[ Dict : i , i*i for i in range ( N ) ]
words = set ( [ w.lower ( ) for w in text.split( ) ] ) squares = dict ( [ i , i*i for i in range ( N ) ] )
exp for x in it
def gen ( ) : for x in it : yield exp return gen ( )
Accumulation Display Generator Expression plus Function [ Sum : x*x for x in numbers ] [ Product : Prob_spam ( word ) for word in email_msg ] [ Min : temp ( hour ) for hour in range ( 24 ) ]
[ Median : f( x ) for x in data ] [ SortBy : abs ( x ) for x in ( - 2 , - 4 , 3 , 1 ) ] [ Top ( 10 ) : humor ( joke ) for joke in jokes ] [ Argmax : votes ( c ) for c in candidates ] sum ( x*x for x in numbers ) product ( Prob_spam ( word ) for word in email_msg ) min( temp ( hour ) for hour in range ( 24 ) ) median ( f( x ) for x in data ) sortdecorated ( ( abs ( x ) , x ) for x in ( - 2 , - 4 , 3 , 1 ) ) top ( 10 , ( humor ( joke ) for joke in jokes ) ) argmax ( ( c , votes ( c ) ) for c in candidates )
With the accumulation display approach , you need a change to the language , and a new set of accumulators .
With the generator expression approach you need a change to the language of similar complexity , and a combination of old funcxtions ( sum , min ) and new functions ( product , top , argmax ) .
The new functions are somewhat easier to write than the accumulators ; for example a 6 - line some function instead of an 8 - line Some accumulator :
def some ( items ) : " If some element in items is true , return it ; otherwise return False " for item in items : if item : return item return False
Philip J. Eby and Raymond Hettinger proposed the generator expression idea .
I 'm happy that my proposal came at the right time to help spur a discussion that appears to be on the way to a happy ending -- I think the generator expression idea is more generally useful than my proposal .
Other points were raised in the discussion on python - dev .
Ian Bicking made a suggestion that I interpreted to mean that accumulation should be implemented as something like :
def accumulation ( acc , f , it ) : a = acc.__accum__( ) for x in it : if a.add ( f( x ) , x ) : break return a.result ( )
min , max , sum
__accum__
Next Steps
A library of accumulators .
I 'm thinking there should be an accum module , which users can choose to import or import * from .
I have a candidate accum module .
A demonstration of the use of these accumulators .
I have one called testaccum which rewrites a limited class of accumulation displays into calls to accumulation and prints the results .
It produces this output : temp = [ 70 , 70 , 71 , 74 , 76 , 76 , 72 , 76 , 77 , 77 , 77 , 78 , 78 , 79 , 79 , 79 , 78 , 80 , 82 , 83 , 83 , 81 , 84 , 83 ] data = temp votes = {' Gray ' : 45 , ' Arnie ' : 48 , ' Peter ' : 3 , ' Cruz ' : 32 , ' Tom ' : 13} candidates = [ ' Gray ' , ' Arnie ' , ' Peter ' , ' Cruz ' , ' Tom ' ] [ Max : temp [ hour ] for hour in range ( 24 ) ] ==> 84 [ Min : temp [ hour ] for hour in range ( 24 ) ] ==> 70 [ Sum : x*x for x in data ] ==> 144999 [ Mean : f( x ) for x in data ] ==> 155.25 [ Median : f( x ) for x in data ] ==> 156.0 [ Mode : f( x ) for x in data ] ==> 166 [ Argmax : votes [ c ] for c in candidates ] ==> Arnie [ Argmin : votes [ c ] for c in candidates ] ==>
Peter [ Some : temp [ hour ] > 75 for hour in range ( 24 ) ] ==>
True [ Every : temp [ hour ] > 75 for hour in range ( 24 ) ] ==>
False [ Top ( 10 ) : temp [ hour ] for hour in range ( 24 ) ] == > [ 84 , 83 , 83 , 83 , 82 , 81 , 80 , 79 , 79 , 79 ] [ Join ( ' , ' ) : votes[ c ] for c in candidates ] == > 45 , 48 , 3 , 32 , 13 [ SortBy : abs ( x ) for x in ( - 2 , - 4 , 3 , 1 ) ] == > [ 1 , - 2 , 3 , - 4 ] [ SortBy( reverse= True ) : abs ( x ) for x in ( - 2 , - 4 , 3 , 1 ) ] == > [ - 4 , 3 , - 2 , 1 ]
Changing the grammar would have been rather easy .
Where the grammar now has : listmaker ::= expression ( list_for | ( " , " expression ) * [ " , " ] ) we could change it to : listmaker ::= expression [ " : " expression ] ( list_for | ( " , " expression ) * [ " , " ] )
Changing the code generator would have been simple for the simple examples shown here , but would require some thought for complex listmakers with multiple for and if clauses .
Basically , we want [ acc : exp for x in it1 if c1 for y in it2 if c 2 ...] to mean from itertools import ifilter accumulation ( acc , lambda ( x , y , ... ) : exp , icross_product ( ifilter ( c1 , it1 ) , ifilter ( c2 , it2 ) , ... ) ) where icross_product takes the cross product of all the argument iterables , in left - to - right order .
That is , it generates tuples in the order ( c1 [ 0 ] , c2 [ 0 ] , ... cn [ 0 ] ) ( c1 [ 0 ] , c2 [ 0 ] , ... cn [ 1 ] ) ( c1 [ 0 ] , c2 [ 0 ] , ... cn [ 2 ] ) ... ( c1 [ 0 ] , c2 [ 0 ] , ... cn [ -1 ] ) ( c1 [ 0 ] , c2 [ 0 ] , ... cn_ 1 [ 1 ] , cn [ 0 ] ) ( c1 [ 0 ] , c2 [ 0 ] , ... cn_ 1 [ 1 ] , cn [ 1 ] ) ... ( c1 [ - 1 ] , c2 [ - 1 ] , ... cn [ -1 ] ) Perhaps it should be a standard part of itertools .

Can a Human See a Single Photon ?
The human eye is very sensitive but can we see a single photon ?
The answer is that the sensors in the retina can respond to a single photon .
But neural filters only allow a signal to pass to the brain to trigger a conscious response when at least about five to nine arrive within less than 100 ms .
If we could consciously see single photons we would experience too much visual " noise " in very low light , so this filter is a necessary adaptation , not a weakness .
Some people have said that single photons can be seen and quote the fact that faint flashes from radioactive materials ( for example ) can be seen .
This is an incorrect argument .
Such flashes produce a large number of photons .
It is also not possible to determine sensitivity from the ability of amateur astronomers to see faint stars with the naked eye .
They are limited by background light before the true limits are reached .
To test visual sensitivity a more careful experiment must be performed .
The retina at the back of the human eye has two types of receptors , known as cones and rods .
The cones are responsible for colour vision , but are much less sensitive to low light than the rods .
In bright light the cones are active and the iris is stopped down .
This is called photopic vision .
When we enter a dark room , the eyes first adapt by opening up the iris to allow more light in .
Over a period of about 30 minutes , there are other chemical adaptations that make the rods become sensitive to light at about a 10,000th of the level needed for the cones to work .
After this time we see much better in the dark , but we have very little colour vision .
This is known as scotopic vision .
The active substance in the rods is rhodopsin .
A single photon can be absorbed by a single molecule that changes shape and chemically triggers a signal that is transmitted to the optic nerve .
Vitamin
A aldehyde also plays an essential role as a light - absorbing pigment .
A symptom of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness because of the failure of scotopic vision .
It is possible to test our visual sensitivity by using a very low level light source in a dark room .
The experiment was first done successfully by Hecht , Schlaer and Pirenne in 1942 .
They concluded that the rods can respond to a single photon during scotopic vision .
In their experiment they allowed human subjects to have 30 minutes to get used to the dark .
They positioned a controlled light source 20 degrees to the left of the point on which the subject 's eyes were fixed , so that the light would fall on the region of the retina with the highest concentration of rods .
The light source was a disk that subtended an angle of 10 minutes of arc and emitted a faint flash of 1 millisecond to avoid too much spatial or temporal spreading of the light .
The wavelength used was about 510 nm ( green light ) .
The subjects were asked to respond " yes " or " no " to say whether or not they thought they had seen a flash .
The light was gradually reduced in intensity until the subjects could only guess the answer .
They found that about 90 photons had to enter the eye for a 60 % success rate in responding .
Since only about 10 % of photons arriving at the eye actually reach the retina , this means that about 9 photons were actually required at the receptors .
Since the photons would have been spread over about 350 rods , the experimenters were able to conclude statistically that the rods must be responding to single photons , even if the subjects were not able to see such photons when they arrived too infrequently .
In 1979 Baylor , Lamb and Yau were able to use toads ' rods placed into electrodes to show directly that they respond to single photons .

Trusted Computing Best Practices
The Trusted Computing Group ( TCG ) is an industry consortium that is trying to build more secure computers .
They have a lot of members , although the board of directors consists of Microsoft , Sony , AMD , Intel , IBM , SUN , HP , and two smaller companies who are voted on in a rotating basis .
The basic idea is that you build a computer from the ground up securely , with a core hardware “ root of trust ” called a Trusted Platform Module ( TPM ) .
Applications can run securely on the computer , can communicate with other applications and their owners securely , and can be sure that no untrusted applications have access to their data or code .
This sounds great , but it ’s a double - edged sword .
The same system that prevents worms and viruses from running on your computer might also stop you from using any legitimate software that your hardware or operating system vendor simply does n’t like .
The same system that protects spyware from accessing your data files might also stop you from copying audio and video files .
The same system that ensures that all the patches you download are legitimate might also prevent you from , well , doing pretty much anything .
( Ross Anderson has an excellent FAQ on the topic .
I wrote about it back when Microsoft called it Palladium . )
In May , the Trusted Computing Group published a best practices document : “ Design , Implementation , and Usage Principles for TPM - Based Platforms . ”
Written for users and implementers of TCG technology , the document tries to draw a line between good uses and bad uses of this technology .
The principles that TCG believes underlie the effective , useful , and acceptable design , implementation , and use of TCG technologies are the following : Security : TCG - enabled components should achieve controlled access to designated critical secured data and should reliably measure and report the system ’s security properties .
The reporting mechanism should be fully under the owner ’s control .
Privacy : TCG - enabled components should be designed and implemented with privacy in mind and adhere to the letter and spirit of all relevant guidelines , laws , and regulations .
This includes , but is not limited to , the OECD Guidelines , the Fair Information Practices , and the European Union Data Protection Directive ( 95/46 / EC ) .
Interoperability : Implementations and deployments of TCG specifications should facilitate interoperability .
Furthermore , implementations and deployments of TCG specifications should not introduce any new interoperability obstacles that are not for the purpose of security .
Portability of data : Deployment should support established principles and practices of data ownership .
Controllability : Each owner should have effective choice and control over the use and operation of the TCG - enabled capabilities that belong to them ; their participation must be opt-in .
Subsequently , any user should be able to reliably disable the TCG functionality in a way that does not violate the owner ’s policy .
Ease - of -use :
The nontechnical user should find the TCG - enabled capabilities comprehensible and usable .
It ’s basically a good document , although there are some valid criticisms .
I like that the document clearly states that coercive use of the technology — forcing people to use digital rights management systems , for example , are inappropriate :
The use of coercion to effectively force the use of the TPM capabilities is not an appropriate use of the TCG technology .
I like that the document tries to protect user privacy :
All implementations of TCG - enabled components should ensure that the TCG technology is not inappropriately used for data aggregation of personal information /
I wish that interoperability were more strongly enforced .
The language has too much wiggle room for companies to break interoperability under the guise of security :
Furthermore , implementations and deployments of TCG specifications should not introduce any new interoperability obstacles that are not for the purpose of security .
That sounds good , but what does “ security ” mean in that context ?
Security of the user against malicious code ?
Security of big media against people copying music and videos ?
Security of software vendors against competition ?
The big problem with TCG technology is that it can be used to further all three of these “ security ” goals , and this document is where “ security ” should be better defined .
Complaints aside , it ’s a good document and we should all hope that companies follow it .
Compliance is totally voluntary , but it ’s the kind of document that governments and large corporations can point to and demand that vendors follow .
But there ’s something fishy going on .
Microsoft is doing its best to stall the document , and to ensure that it does n’t apply to Vista ( formerly known as Longhorn ) , Microsoft ’s next - generation operating system .
The document was first written in the fall of 2003 , and went through the standard review process in early 2004 .
Microsoft delayed the adoption and publication of the document , demanding more review .
Eventually the document was published in June of this year ( with a May date on the cover ) .
Meanwhile , the TCG built a purely software version of the specification : Trusted Network Connect ( TNC ) .
Basically , it ’s a TCG system without a TPM .
The best practices document does n’t apply to TNC , because Microsoft ( as a member of the TCG board of directors ) blocked it .
The excuse is that the document had n’t been written with software - only applications in mind , so it should n’t apply to software - only TCG systems .
This is absurd .
The document outlines best practices for how the system is used .
There ’s nothing in it about how the system works internally .
There ’s nothing unique to hardware - based systems , nothing that would be different for software - only systems .
You can go through the document yourself and replace all references to “ TPM ” or “ hardware ” with “ software ” ( or , better yet , “ hardware or software ” ) in five minutes .
There are about a dozen changes , and none of them make any meaningful difference .
The only reason I can think of for all this Machiavellian maneuvering is that the TCG board of directors is making sure that the document does n’t apply to Vista .
If the document is n’t published until after Vista is released , then obviously it does n’t apply .
Near as I can tell , no one is following this story .
No one is asking why TCG best practices apply to hardware - based systems if they ’re writing software - only specifications .
No one is asking why the document does n’t apply to all TCG systems , since it ’s obviously written without any particular technology in mind .
And no one is asking why the TCG is delaying the adoption of any software best practices .
I believe the reason is Microsoft and Vista , but clearly there ’s some investigative reporting to be done .

Introduction
" More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency ( without necessarily achieving it ) than for any other single reason - including blind stupidity . "
- W.A. Wulf " On the other hand , we cannot ignore efficiency . " - Jon Bentley
Many software engineers recommend what I call the " procrastination approach " to optimization .
Delay optimization as much as possible , and do n't do it if you can avoid it .
I agree with the basic premise .
Optimizing too early or too often is not a good approach to engineering .
Better to have a program that runs than a fast program that crashes .
On the other hand , you 're not likely to write a successful app these days without doing optimization at some point in the process .
Your compiler can help you , but you as a programmer understand more about your application than the compiler .
As Michael Abrash puts it , the best compiler is " between your ears . "
There are many levels of optimization , but I 'm going to focus on one in particular : C++ optimizations .
Some of these techniques apply to other languages as well - like Java - but most are specific to C ++.
I 'll also cover how to configure your compiler for maximum C++ efficiency .
Preliminaries
I originally wrote this document in 1998 .
A lot has changed since then , though many of the techniques listed are still relevant and valuable depending on your platform and compiler .
As always , never accept optimization techniques at face value .
Measure , measure , measure .
All of the examples are in C ++.
The code is designed to compile with any standard ANSI C++ - compliant compiler .
Some of the more complex techniques involve templates and the Standard Template Library .
I used
As the national push for alternative energy sources heats up , researchers at the University of Rochester have for the first time identified how genes responsible for biomass breakdown are turned on in a microorganism that produces valuable ethanol from materials like grass and cornstalks .
Waste products such as grass clippings and wood chipsâ€ ” once thought too difficult to turn into ethanolâ€ ” may soon be fodder for hungry , gene - tweaked bacteria .
The findings in today ’s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences may empower scientists to engineer ethanol - producing super - organisms that can make clean - burning fuel from the nation ’s one billion unused tons of yearly biomass production .
“ This is the first revelation of how a bacterium chooses from its more than 100 enzymes to break down a particular biomass , ” says David H. Wu , professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Rochester .
“ Once we know how a bacterium targets a particular type of biomass , we should be able to boost that process to draw ethanol from biomass far more efficiently that we can today . ”
Ethanol holds the promise of a clean , renewable alternative to fossil fuels , but deriving it from plants is difficult .
Producing it from corn is the easiest method , but doing so on a large scale would drive up the price of corn , corn starch , and even tangential foods like beef , since cows are fed on cornâ € ” not to mention all the energy spent fertilizing , maintaining , and harvesting a crop like corn .
Conversely , deriving ethanol from plant materials such as the corn stalks and wood chips is challenging because the plants ’ cellulose is a very tough substance to break down , making for an inefficient process .
Wu ’s technique may prove much more effective than traditional methods .
Instead of using separate steps to break down biomass into glucose and ferment the glucose into ethanol , as is currently done , Wu is working on a way to make a bacterium break down and ferment plant biomass efficiently in just one step .
Wu investigated C. thermocellum , which is a microorganism that has that ability to turn biomass into ethanol in one step , but is not used at the industrial scale yet because the first step , breaking down the plant ’s cellulose , is much too inefficient .
The key , Wu surmised , is to find out what enzymes the bacterium uses to accomplish its feat , and then boost its ability to produce those enzymes .
The problem , however , lies in the fact that C. thermocellum uses more than 100 enzymes , and any of the millions of combinations of them may be the magic mixture to break down a particular biomass .
So , Wu decided to make the bacterium do the work for him .
“ The bacteria know how to express just the right genes to break down any particular biomass substrate , and we wanted to know how they know to turn on and off just the right genes at the right time to do the trick , ” says Wu .
“ We found the bacterium essentially throws the whole bowl of spaghetti at the wall , sees what sticks , and then makes a lot of that particular noodle . ”
C. thermocelllum produces low levels of many of its enzymes at any one time .
When the bacterium comes in contact with wood , for instance , a few of its enzymes break down some of that wood .
A product of that tiny reaction is a sugar called laminaribiose that diffuses into the cell .
There it deactivates a repressor for two genes , which wake up and start pumping out the two triggers the full production of wood - degrading enzymes CelC and LicA .
Wu ’s paper shows the first time the triggering pathway for enzyme production in this bacterium has been revealed , and it was only possible because C. thermocellum genome was just recently sequenced , thanks to Wu ’s collaboration with the U. S. Department of Energy .
With its 100 busy enzymes , the entire genome had to be observed as a whole , since fiddling with combinations of two , three , or more enzymes at a time would have taken “ more than our lifetime , ” Wu says .
Wu is now working to re-engineer C. thermocellum to express an abundance of particular genes so it can readily and efficiently produce ethanol from a particular biomass .
He ’s also continuing the genome - wide search for enzyme combinations that will degrade and ferment grasses , corn stovers , and even food waste .
“ I do n’t think this is the revolution that makes ethanol a mainstay , ” says Wu , “ but I believe this is a part of what will lead to the revolution . ”
This research , also authored by Wu ’s graduate students Michael Newcomb and Chun - Yu Chen , is funded by the U. S. Department of Energy .
If consumers even know there 's a DRM , what it is , and how it works , we 've already failed .

" Help Wanted : an attractive blonde , 18 - 28 , must care about world peace … "
Okay , so that 's not exactly the ad that 's been running in Sweden 's national employment register , but it 's pretty close .
The actual ad is in Swedish , and it is gender - neutral , as all want ads are required to be in Sweden .
" Anyone can apply -- even men , " said the owner of the Miss Sweden franchise , Panos Papadopoulos .
But Papadopoulos conceded that men do not get very far , because the main purpose of the contest is to choose Sweden 's representative to the Miss Universe pageant .
Miss Sweden ( Fröken Sverige , in Swedish ) is the only beauty pageant in the world that advertises in the want ads .
And contestants are chosen through a decidedly different selection process than any other beauty pageant in the world .
" It 's not a beauty pageant at all , not in the traditional way , " said Papadopoulos , who bought the rights to Miss Sweden a few years ago .
Papadopoulos also owns one of the country 's most successful swimsuit companies -- ironic , given that he banned the swimsuit competition soon after he bought Miss Sweden .
The Miss Sweden contest more closely resembles a reality TV show than a beauty pageant .
Instead , the contestants undergo a series of leadership contests and seminars .
The reason for this change ?
In Sweden , as in much of the world , the idea of beauty pageants had come under fire .
Protesters claimed it was sexist , old - fashioned , and out of sync with a country that prides itself on a more modern , liberal approach .
Beauty pageants elsewhere might do well to follow Sweden 's example .
Miss Spain recently filed suit against her pageant after she was disqualified for having a child .
The male - equivalent pageant has no rules against being a parent , but Miss Spain ( like Miss America ) does n't allow it for the women .
Miss Nevada was recently stripped of her crown after a sex scandal .
Miss USA also came under fire for less - than - ladylike behavior .
But Donald Trump , the owner of the rights to Miss USA , famously allowed her to keep her crown .
Miss Sweden has no crown -- and no tiara or sash , except the one given to her when she competes in Miss Universe .
Miss Sweden 2006 is 24 - year - old Josephine Alhanko , the first to be chosen by Sweden 's new method .
Blonde , blue - eyed and beautiful , she is very much the beauty queen .
But she also has two master 's degrees and is currently pursuing her PhD .
Alhanko said ever since she was a little girl she fantasized about being a beauty queen .
Her first pageant ?
Miss Universe last year , where she came in among the top 20 .
" There were some very nice girls , and some of them very beautiful and very intelligent , " Alhanko said .
" But of course , there was the other side .
" I was a bit shocked that so many of them had plastic surgery at such a young age , " she said .
" I think that is very sad .
It send out the wrong message .
But maybe opinions about that are very different in other countries than they are in Sweden . "
Next month , her reign ends and she 'll hand over to the next Miss Sweden .
She said her friends in graduate school tease her about being Miss Sweden .
But she suspects they are proud of her , too .

Asian traders are concerned about the strength of the US economy
The UK's FTSE tumbled 103.4 points , or 1.7 % , to 6,057.8 .
Earlier , Japan 's Nikkei index closed 2.9 % lower and New York 's Dow Jones index ended down 2 % .
Indexes in Hong Kong , Malaysia , India and Australia fell more than 2 % .
The sell - off comes just as stocks were starting to recover from a sharp slump that rocked markets late last month .
Analysts said that market volatility was likely to continue , especially as many markets and stocks had climbed to their highest levels in more than six years .
Lee Cheng Hooi of EON Capital said that the worry for investors was that the problems in the US mortgage market could cause the world 's biggest economy to slow down .
" This will cause a domino effect on the world economy , " he explained .
" There could be more bloodbath to come . "
Shakedown
Although analysts said Asia 's leading economies remained fundamentally strong , markets across the region are particularly sensitive to signs of a possible economic slowdown in the US , a key export market .
This latest round of selling has been sparked by concerns over the US sub - prime mortgage market .
Sub - prime lenders , who target consumers with poor credit histories , have been hit by an increase in defaults and bad loans .
This month could be very bad
Kim Yung-min , SH Asset Management
What 's the problem with sub -prime ?
Figures have shown that late mortgage payments and home repossessions in the US are at their highest level since records began .
New Century , the second - biggest sub - prime mortgage lender in the US , is seen by many observers to be close to bankruptcy - and the fear among investors is that this will ripple out into more stable parts of the economy .
" If the US sub - prime mortgage problems get worse , it could begin to hurt US consumers , and that would be very hurtful for exporters , " said Kim Yung - min , a fund manager at SH Asset Management in Seoul .
" This month could be very bad , " he added .
Wall Street 's slide on Tuesday also gained momentum from a US Commerce Department report that showed retail sales rose at a lower - than - expected rate of 0.1 % in February , suggesting consumer spending could be slowing down .
Strong fundamentals
But while many investors are reassessing their holdings and shedding some of their riskier assets , many others are happy to ride out the storm and buy into markets with good long - term growth prospects .
" The sell - off is in sympathy with the sharp sell - off we saw overnight on Wall Street , and it highlights the continued nervousness out there , " said David Cohen of Action Economics .
But " the world economy seems to be remaining on an upward trajectory " , he explained , adding that this is probably " a correction after the strong rally that was experienced for the previous several months around the world " .
For investors , the big question is how far and for how long this correction will last , and whether or not the current bull market run will be broken .
Last year , markets lost as much as 10 % of their value in May , only to recover and surge even higher , setting many record share prices .
It 's a danger to become too defensive in this environment
Tim Rocks , Macquarie Securities
In the weeks before the first sell - off , sparked by fears of a new capital gains tax in China and Beijing 's attempts to slow the economy , the FTSE 100 was at its highest level in more than six years .
The index has lost 5.7 % since 26 February , wiping £ 92bn off its market value .
But that still leaves it with a total worth of £ 1.53 trillion - and many analysts are predicting steady earnings growth for its biggest firms .
The same is true for many of the main markets worldwide , said Tim Rocks of Macquarie Securities .
" We see the outlook as fundamentally very , very strong , " he explained .
" It 's a danger to become too defensive in this environment .
Obviously we 're not going to know the full extent of this slowdown in the US for some time now , so there 's some reason for caution . "
The terrifying reality regarding your resume is that for all the many hours you put into fine - tuning , you ’ve got 30 seconds to make an impression on me .
Maybe less .
It ’s unfair , it ’s imprecise , and there ’s a good chance that I make horrible mistakes , but there ’s a lot more of you than me , and while hiring phenomenal teams is the most important thing I do , I ’m balancing that task with the fact that I need to build product and manage the endless stream of people walking into my office .
But here ’s a glimpse .
I ’m going to walk through the exact mental process I use when I look at a resume .
I do n’t know if this is right or efficient , but after fifteen years and staring at thousands of resumes , this is the process .
The First Pass
Your Name .
It ’s simple .
Do I know you ?
Whether I do or not , I ’m going to immediately Google you to see if I should .
Oh , you a have a weblog .
Excellent .
Company Names .
Do I recognize any companies that you worked at ?
If I do , I do n’t look at what you actually do , I assume that if I recognize the company , I ’m in the ballpark .
If I do n’t know the company , I scan for keywords in the description to get a rough idea .
Hmmmmm … networking words .
Ok , you ’re a networking guy .
Job Description and History .
Here I ’m looking for history and trajectory .
How many jobs have you had and for how long ?
How long have you been in your current role ?
Where ’d you come from ?
QA ?
Or have you always been an engineer ?
This is when I start looking for inconsistencies and warning flags .
Other Interests and Extracurriculars .
Yeah , this is part of the first pass .
I ’m eagerly looking to find something that makes you different from the last fifty resumes I looked at .
More on this in a moment .
So , we ’re done .
It ’s been ten to twenty seconds and I ’ve already formed an opinion .
There ’s a good chance that I ’ve already made a call whether to move forward on you .
If there are other folks checking the resume out , I can certainly be convinced to take a second look , but a basic opinion has been formed .
Before we move to the second pass , let ’s talk about the parts of your resume I did n’t look at and never will .
Professional objective .
This is likely your lead paragraph and I skipped it .
Career center counselors across the planet are slamming their fists on their desks as they read this because they ’ve been telling students , “ You need to write a crisp career objective .
It defines your resume . ”
Yes , it does , but I still do n’t read it and it ’s not because there is n’t good content there , it ’s the time issue .
See , if your resume is sitting in my inbox it means someone has already mapped you to an open job in my group .
Reading your objective is going to tell me something I already know .
Besides , my job title and description scrub will tell me whether we ’re in the ballpark or not .
If I ’ve got a Jr. Engineering position open and you ’ve got 10 years experience , I ’ll figure out that mismatch when I look at your history .
This does n’t mean you should n’t include this objective in your resume .
As you ’ll see below , there ’s more to the process than just me reading your resume , and different folks are looking for different content .
Skills .
I skip the skills section not only because this is information I ’ll derive from job history , but also because this section is full of misinformation .
I ’m not going to say that people lie in the skills section , but I know that if a candidate has heard the word Linux in the workplace , there ’s a good chance they ’re going to put Familiarity with Linux as a skill on their resume .
Besides , again , I know you ’ve goofed around with Linux because you said so in the description of your last job , right ?
Summary of Qualifications .
Similar to Skills , this is another skip section for me .
Here ’s a good example from an imaginary resume : “ Proven success in leading technical problem solving situations ” .
This line tells me nothing .
Yes , I know you ’re trying to tell me that you ’re strategic , but there is no way you ’re going to convince me that you ’re strategic in a resume .
I ’m going to learn that from a phone screen and from an interview .
Unlike Skills , which I find to be a total waste of time , I will go back to Summary of Qualifications if we end up talking .
When you write “ Established track record for delivering measurable results under tight schedules ” , I am going to ask you what the hell you mean on the phone and if your answer is n’t instant and insightful , I ’ll know your qualifications are designed to be buzzword compliant and do n’t actually define your qualifications .
The Second Pass
If I ca n’t decide whether to schedule a phone screen after the first pass , I go for another .
The goal now is , “ Ok , I saw something I liked in the first pass , is it real ? ”
This is when I do the following :
In - depth Job History .
I ’m going to actually read the job history for the past couple of jobs .
Not all of them , just the last two or three .
What I ’m doing is fleshing out my mental picture of you .
I ’m looking for more warning flags .
Do your responsibilities match your title ?
How long were you at your most recent job ?
If it was a long time , can I get a sense of how you grew ?
If it was short , can I figure out why you left ?
Do your last two jobs build on each other ?
Can I get a sense of where you ’re headed or are you all over the place ?
Your job history , — your professional experience — is the heart of your resume .
This is where I spent my time vetting you and this is where you should spend your time making sure I ’m going to get the most complete picture of who you are and what you ’re going to bring to my team .
School .
Yeah , this is the first time I ’ll notice whether you went to college or not .
I purposely do this because I ’ve found over years of hiring that a name brand university biases my opinion too early .
There ’s a lot to be said for a candidate who gets accepted to and graduates from Stanford or MIT , but I ’ve made just as many bad hires from these colleges as great ones .
Seeing a non-Computer Science degree is not a warning flag .
In fact , I ’m a huge fan of hiring physics majors as engineers .
For whatever reason , the curriculum for physics has a good intersection with computer science .
Any technical major for me is perfectly acceptable , and even non-technical majors with a technical job history make for a resume worth thinking about .
Ok , so that second pass took another 15 to 30 seconds and we ’re done .
You ’ve just given me the opportunity to change your life by potentially bringing you in for an interview and that chance is over .
Next !
What ’s unfair about what just happened is this .
You spent hours working on your resume .
You sent it to close friends for review and you edited it .
You agonized over the different sections and you stressed about the tone , and here I am , the hiring manager , and I read 1/10th of your work in 30 seconds .
Do n’t despair .
There are some easy things you can do to improve your chances .
Differentiate , Do n’t Annoy
Design your resume to downgrade .
Your resume needs to withstand some formatting abuse .
Go get your resume right now and convert it to plain text .
Can you still see the different sections ?
Is your job history still cleanly formatted ?
Can you still see the different jobs as well as the start and stop dates ?
Screw around with the margins , too .
Where are your line breaks ?
They ’d better not be after every line because that means visual chaos if a well - intentioned recruiter starts messing with fonts .
Never include a cover letter .
I do n’t read them .
Recruiters do n’t pass them on .
Make sure the key points of your cover letter are living in your career objective and your job history .
Embrace honest buzzword compliance .
Remember , I ’m not the only who is going to read your resume .
I ’m likely the most qualified to make a call whether you ’re a fit for my job , but before your resume gets to me , its going to be passed through a couple of different recruiters and these folks are just as busy as I am .
The lifeblood of the recruiter is the keyword .
Java , C++ , Objective - C.
The more specific relevant keywords and buzzwords you can shove into your resume , there more likely you ’re going to make it past the initial cut .
As I said above , I skip the Skills section because most folks already know that recruiters are just searching for specific words when they ’re sourcing candidates , so they shove every possible buzzword into their resume .
Know this , if you claim to Strong Java Background in your resume , I ’m going to be compelled to figure out how strong your skills actually are .
Do n’t include any keyword or buzzword that you are n’t comfortable talking about at length .
Differentiate , do n’t annoy .
You ’re likely going to start developing your resume from a template .
Maybe you ’ll use a friend ’s resume that you like as a starting point .
Excellent .
How are you going to make it yours ?
Remember , I ’ve looked at thousands of resumes , which means I ’ve seen all the standard templates .
I know when you ’re using Microsoft Word and I know when you ’ve developed a format of your own .
Right this second , I ’m flipping through a dozen college resumes and the ones I ’m spending time on are the ones that grab me visually , where there is something different .
On this one , the fellow put a subtle gray box around each of his section headings .
On this other one , the candidate used a nice combination of serif and sans serif fonts to grab me .
A couple of subtle visual differences to your resume goes a long way toward keeping me engaged in reading it , but remember , we ’re engineers here and efficiency matters .
Differentiating your resume to the point that I can’t quickly parse it is going to frustrate me .
You ’re not applying to be a visual designer ; you ’re an engineer .
Keep to the standard sections and do n’t make me work to figure out who you are .
Sound like a human .
Here ’s a doozy , this intern says he “ planned , designed , and coordinated engineers efforts for the development of a mission critical system ” .
ZzzzzzzzzzZzz .
What did this guy actually do ?
I honestly do n’t know .
Let ’s call this type of writing style resume mumbo jumbo and let ’s agree that usage of this style is tantamount to saying nothing at all .
What was the mission critical system ?
Why was it critical ?
How in the world did an intern plan , design , and coordinate the engineering efforts ?
I ’m a fan of giving interns real world work , but it ’d take a world - class intern to plan , design , and manage engineers on whatever this mission critical system is .
Take time to write your resume for a human .
You need to hit all the right buzzwords and keywords to get yourself past the layers of recruiters , but I ’m the guy who is really going to take apart your resume , and if you ’re saying nothing with resume mumbo jumbo , I ’m learning nothing .
Give me specifics and give them to me in a familiar tone .
I ’m not an automaton ; I honestly want to know what you do .
Tell me a story .
Include seemingly irrelevant experience .
This applies mostly to college types who lack experience in high technology .
You ’re going to stress that your job history does n’t include any engineering and you ’re thinking your summer working at Borders bookstore is irrelevant .
It ’s not .
Any job teaches you something .
Even though you were n’t coding in C++ , I want to know what you learned by being a bookseller .
Was it your first job ?
What did you learn about managers ?
How did you grow from the beginning to the end of the summer ?
Explain to me how hard work is hard no matter what the job is .
A Glimpse and a Hook
A resume will never define who you are .
It ’s not the job of your resume to give me a complete picture , and if you ’re struggling to include every last detail about who you are , you ’re wasting your time .
Your resume should be designed to give me a glimpse and a hook .
The glimpse is a view into the most recent years of your professional career .
It should convey your three most important accomplishments and it should give me a good idea where your technical skills lie .
The hook is more important .
The hook will leave me with a question .
Maybe it ’s something from your other interests section ?
How about an objective so outlandish that I can’t help but set up a phone screen .
I ’m not suggesting that you make anything up , I ’m asking you to market yourself in a way that I ’m going to remember .
A resume is not a statement of facts .
It ’s a declaration of intent .
Economists generally oppose price controls because they distort markets , and cause either shortages ( e.g. rent control ) when there is a price ceiling , or surpluses ( e.g. minimum wage ) when there is a price floor .
Shortages ( excess demand ) and surpluses ( excess supply ) represent an inefficient use of scarce resources , and economists support market prices because they eliminate shortages and surpluses , and therefore lead to efficiency .
From the Soviet Union , there are many examples of distortions and inefficiencies from its long history of price controls , but here is a real classic .
Light bulbs , like most other basic goods and staples in the Soviet Union , were often in short supply because the official price was below the market price , resulting in excess demand and prolonged shortages .
As a result of the chronic light bulb shortage , an informal , black market developed in the USSR for used , burned - out light bulbs .
That is , Soviet citizens would actually pay a positive price for a light bulb that did n’t work .
How would it be possible for a burned - out light bulb to have a positive price , when it would normally just be thrown out ?
Of what use could anybody have for a used light bulb ?

Bush alums reaping their rewards
AS PAUL WOLFOWITZ twists in the wind after being found guilty in a World Bank investigation of public payola to his girlfriend , it does seem that his career might finally be coming to an end .
Pity that the Iraq debacle , which Wolfowitz promoted , was not sufficient reason for removing him from public office ; instead , President Bush rewarded " Wolfie " with a promotion to head the World Bank .
Add him to the rapidly growing list of Bush alums whose career trajectory suddenly plummets upon the disclosure of a pattern of lying obvious to most observers but not to the president himself .
To understand why scum consistently rises to the surface of the Bush administration , it is best to refer to the wisdom contained in the final memoir of the late , great Kurt Vonnegut .
In an excerpt published in 2006 , Vonnegut observed that " George W. Bush has gathered around him ... most frighteningly , psychotic personalities , or PPs , the medical term for smart , personable people who have no consciences . "
How better to explain the unwavering arrogance of people -- certainly Wolfowitz , but clearly he is not alone in this administration -- who consistently get it wrong yet plow on undeterred by the inconvenience of fact or logic ?
Most of us , once associated with the grievous distortions of evidence and outright lies justifying the invasion of Iraq , not to mention the horrid waste and death attendant upon the subsequent occupation that Wolfowitz oversaw , would feel the need to pause for a spell of critical self - reflection .
Not so Wolfowitz , who , unmoved by the death and destruction he wrought , sailed on to the World Bank and announced that he would fight what he claimed was that venerable institution 's penchant for , yes , he used the word , " corruption . "
Toward that end he would bring with him a score of Pentagon underlings whose hands were almost as bloody as his from the Iraq disaster .
One of them , Kevin Kellems , former spokesman for Vice President Dick Cheney , suddenly resigned his $ 250,000 - a- year job at the World Bank on Monday .
Another veteran from the Iraq buildup to be rewarded was Wolfowitz 's lover , Shaha Riza , his resident Muslim expert , who was promoted to a State Department position paying more than Secretary Condoleezza Rice earns .
Not quite the $ 400,000 that Wolfowitz would be raking in at the World Bank , but Riza 's salary had the advantage of being tax - free -- she is still technically a " foreign national , " despite her access to the inner sanctums of U.S. security debates .
Such rich rewards for folks ostensibly fighting world poverty would not seem troubling to the PPs Vonnegut referred to , as they are suffering from a malady that renders them morally tone - deaf .
Citing what he calls the classic medical text on PPs , " The Mask of Sanity , " Vonnegut noted in his " Custodians of Chaos " piece : " Some people are born deaf , some are born blind or whatever , and this book is about congenitally defective human beings of a sort that is making this whole country and many other parts of the planet go completely haywire nowadays .
These are people born without consciences , and suddenly they are taking charge of everything .
" PPs are presentable , " Vonnegut reminds us , lest we be fooled by their equanimity on talk shows , " they know full well the suffering their actions may cause others , but they do not care .
They cannot care because they are nuts .
They have a screw loose ! "
Vonnegut includes the executives who gave us the Enron and WorldCom scandals with the neoconservatives to indicate the malady 's extent .
This could be dismissed as the standard liberal claptrap -- turning the culprits into victims whose illness made them do it .
But I offer his observations as the most plausible explanation of the headlong pursuit of disaster , for themselves and the planet , on the part of these otherwise canny overachievers .
Yes , their mendacity does often catch up with them , and folks like Wolfowitz do not tend to be well regarded after they have lost the perks of power .
The problem is that the truth arrives too late to prevent considerable suffering .
Indeed , Wolfowitz 's embarrassment at the World Bank is a minor inconvenience compared with the opprobrium he should be receiving after each day 's dose of disaster news from Iraq disproves the cakewalk of a regime change that he had so assuredly promised .
Then , too , this lying lout will no doubt be rewarded with something similar to the $ 4 million contract that former CIA Director George Tenet recently received to share a few details of how he went about betraying us .

WASHINGTON , March 11  NASA can find and track most of the nearby asteroids that could hit and damage the Earth , but there is not enough money in its budget to finish the project within a 15 - year deadline mandated by Congress , according to an agency report released Friday .
The report said there were about 20,000 asteroids and comets orbiting relatively close to our planet that could deliver blows ranging from destroying cities to ending all life .
These objects , 150 yards to more than a mile in diameter , represent about 20 percent of the asteroids and comets whose paths routinely pass between the Sun and the Earth ’s orbit , it said .
Rather than trying to detect , track , catalog and characterize all of the more than 100,000 “ near Earth objects , ” as Congress asked in a 2005 NASA authorization bill , the study said it would be more realistic to focus on those representing a real potential hazard .
But accomplishing this by 2020 would require using ground - based telescopes sponsored by other agencies for other purposes , possibly building a dedicated observatory for finding and tracking hazardous bodies and launching a spacecraft to observe the space around Earth from Venus .
Such an undertaking , the report said , would cost more than $ 1 billion that the agency does not have .
Ben Smith shows what a crackerjack reporter he is with this post about John Edwards ' haircuts ... The Politico receives its Drudge link so all is right with the world for them ...

I was talking with Patrick Cauldwell the other day about what makes a " Good Developer . "
We talked about a number of different characteristics .
My intent was to write up a list of good personality characteristics that describe effective programmers , but Patrick said , " The real problem with most developers is that they do n't keep their wits about themselves . "
This was like a slap in the face to me .
I realized when I was going through the Programmer Phases of Grief that I had n't kept my wits about me .
You ever have the very frightening experience when you 're driving along , perhaps lost in thought , and next thing you know , you 've driven two miles and you do n't remember the driving process that got you there ?
Many of us who 've been programming for a long time , or folks who are very gifted and take get from A to C while skipping B , can have these fugue states while programming .
I do n't literally mean that one blacks out while coding , but rather one goes " running down a one - way dead - end street . "
A lot of time is wasted before we realize that some original assumption was wrong .
I think one can be a more effective programmer if they can avoid not - thinking .
Call it Mindful Coding if you will .
The act of actually thinking while writing code is challenging , especially when your mind is jumping to the next idea or if you 're writing code you 've written a dozen times before .
Sometimes I 'll catch myself asking a question of someone around here , and halfway though the question I 'll realize that I have n't really THOUGHT about the problem space .
For me , and my learning style , this might involve explaining it to someone ( often my wife , who nods in all the right places , but cares not about such things ) or drawing a picture .
For many , analytical thinking is n't a passive thing .
Often just making the decision to " sleep on it " can be all that 's needed to break through a hard problem .
" If you can keep your wits about you while all others are losing theirs , and blaming you .
. . .
The world will be yours and everything in it , what 's more , you 'll be a man , my son . "
- Rudyard Kipling
So , I say , programmers , keep your wits about you .
Code Mindfully .
I vow to try harder .
I have blogged about OpenMP and exceptions in the past .
I have shown you what the OpenMP - specification has to say about exceptions .
I have also shown you some ( tiny ) workarounds for the limitations regarding exceptions sketched in the spec .
Unfortunately , this is only one side of the medal .
When you actually try to use exceptions and OpenMP together , you may get a different picture today .
This article is about my recent experiences in this regard .
Let ’s consider this simple program ( with thanks to my colleague BjÃ¶rn , who originally wrote it ) :
#include
#include
int main ( int , char const *[ ] )
{
float ts = 42.0 f ;
std::cerr << " ZERO , before parallel : " << std::endl ; std::cout << " ts " << ts << " &ts " << &ts << std::endl << std::endl ; # pragma omp parallel num_threads ( 1 ) { # pragma omp critical ( std_cerr_critical ) { std::cerr << " ONE , before try - catch : " << std::endl ; std::cerr << " ts " << ts << " &ts " << &ts << std::endl << std::endl ; } try { # pragma omp critical ( std_cerr_critical ) { std::cerr << " TWO , inside try : " << std::endl ; std::cerr << " ts " << ts << " &ts " << &ts << std::endl << std::endl ; } } catch ( ... ) { # pragma omp critical ( std_cerr_critical ) { std::cerr << " THREE , inside catch : " << std::endl ; std::cerr << " ts " << ts << " &ts " << &ts << std::endl << std::endl ; } } #pragma omp critical ( std_cerr_critical ) { std:: cerr << " FOUR , after catch , inside parallel : " << std::endl ; std::cerr << " ts " << ts << " &ts " << &ts << std::endl << std::endl ; } } // end # pragma omp parallel std::cerr << " FIVE , after parallel : " << std::endl ; std::cerr << " ts " << ts << " &ts " << &ts << std::endl << std::endl ; return 0 ; } [ / cpp ]
It 's really quite simple , it just monitors the value and the address of a float before , during and after a parallel region .
Which is normally not a problem , except in this case there is a try - catch block in the region .
The code is compliant to the OpenMP - specification , as all exceptions are caught from the thread that throws them and no exception leaves a structured block associated with any OpenMP - construct .
The critical regions are not even necessary here , because I have cut the number of threads used down to one to make the output clearer .
So let 's see what happens when I compile and run this code with a couple compilers .
The Intel Compiler goes first : [ code ] $ icpc exceptions_test.cpp - o exceptions - openmp exceptions_test.cpp( 11 ) : ( col. 2 ) remark : OpenMP DEFINED REGION WAS PARALLELIZED .
$ ./ exceptions ZERO , before parallel : ts 42 &ts 0xbfb1d664 ONE , before try - catch : ts 42 &ts 0xbfb1d664 TWO , inside try : ts 42 &ts 0xbfb1d664 FOUR , after catch , inside parallel : ts - 2.85996e-05 &ts 0xbfb1d4e4 FIVE , after parallel : ts 42 &ts 0xbfb1d664 [ / code ]
Uh , oh .
The address of the variable changed after the exception was caught , which is something that should never , ever happen .
It is a serious bug .
It took my colleague BjÃ¶rn quite some time to track this down , because this is something you would never expect to happen .
At least I would not .
No wonder some of my recent code using OpenMP and exceptions was not able to pass its unit tests on the Intel Compiler .
But hey , this is just one compiler and I would not judge from this bug about the whole state of exceptions and OpenMP , right ?
Sure you are right , the story goes on .
So I tried this innocent piece of code on a couple more compilers , e.g. the one from IBM : [ code ] $ xlC_r exceptions_test.cpp - o exceptions_test - qsmp=omp " " 1586 -356 ( U ) Unconditional branch in or out of a critical section . [ / code ]
Huh ?
It 's complaining that I am jumping into or out of a critical section .
But call me stupid , I do n't see this in my code .
After a little trial and error , it turns out the critical region on line 22 is making problems here , commenting it out makes the compiler do what I want and also produces the correct results .
Still , I should not have to do this , as a critical region inside a try - catch block appears to be totally valid to me .
At least the compiler is complaining this time and does not leave me with a hard to catch bug .
Let 's try another compiler , while we are at it ( from Sun this time ) : [ code ] CC exceptions_test.cpp -o exceptions_test - xopenmp - O3 " exceptions_test.cpp " , line 22 : Error : OpenMP constructs not permitted in try block .
1 Error(s ) detected . [ / code ]
Well , at least the compiler tells me what he does not like this time .
Same problem as with the IBM one , same solution - comment out the critical on line 22 and it works .
Still , yet again , from my point of view this should work just fine and I should not have to get rid of my beloved critical region .
But hey , we are having so much fun , why not try another compiler ?
It 's not like there are n't enough :-) .
Let 's try the Portland Compiler this time around : [ code ] pgCC exceptions_test.cpp -o exceptions_test - mp " exceptions_test.cpp " , line 12 : error : expected an identifier # pragma omp parallel num_threads ( 1 ) ^ " exceptions_test.cpp " , line 21 : error : support for exception handling is disabled try { [ / code ]
Oh my , the old problem with the Portland Compiler .
For some reason , it never appears to like my num_threads - clause .
But this is easily fixed by using omp_set_num_threads ( ) instead .
The other error is another story : why is exception handling disabled ?
Going through the compiler documentation , it appears exception handling can be enabled by compiling with –exceptions .
So let ’s try that – and jay , it works !
And gives the correct results this time , even without changing anything more in the code .
And it only took me 4 compilers to find one that liked it .
Last but not least , I have one more compiler up my sleeve : the compiler supplied with Visual Studio .
Let me just reboot really quick , so I can get to it …
Ok , done .
And here the story comes to a happy ending , as the Microsoft Compiler throws a couple of warnings , but compiles the code just fine .
No changes required and output is correct .
Finally .
Let me summarize my post here :
From the five compilers I have tried , one works as expected , one works after forcing it into using exceptions , two could not compile my code and one does compile , but produces a serious and hard to track down bug .
Not exactly a good track record .
My resume : be careful when using exceptions and OpenMP together , as obviously this is something that not many people do today .
I sometimes felt like I was the first person on earth to try this out ;) .
And while it can be fun to go where no one has gone before ( after all , thats what we are being paid to do at the university ) , working on the bleeding edge is only fun as long as your do n’t have a tight deadline to meet .
Also keep in mind that everything I wrote in this post is only valid today .
The compilers are getting better at a fast pace , and so what is a problem now and for me may not be a problem at all when you read this .
One more thing I would like to add : this post is by no means meant to bash on the compilers or the fine people that work on them .
I have read the analogy somewhere that writing a compiler for C++ is like climbing the Mount Everest .
Except that it is harder .
When taking a look at the language and some of its dark corners , I can only agree .
Mix in a pragma - based approach to parallel programming ( OpenMP ) , and maintaining a compiler that does both must be even more challenging .
I have a high respect for the people that cope with these difficulties every day .
Still , the story of this article deserves to be told , in my humble opinion …
SAN DIEGO --
An auction of nearly 100 foreclosed homes here Saturday showed that mortgage lenders are having to accept huge discounts in some cases to unload such properties .
A surge of foreclosures over the past year or so has left lenders struggling to sell a growing backlog of homes .
Rather than relying on real - estate agents , the usual practice , some are turning to large - scale auctions to speed up the sale process .

First Atomic Clock Wristwatch
Do not be misled .
The many " atomic time " wristwatches you see on the market today are merely cheap quartz wristwatches with a built - in radio receiver .
The watch sets itself from 60 kHz VLF radio time signals transmitted by NIST from station WWVB near the US atomic clock in Boulder , Colorado .
At least once a day , reception permitting , usually at night , the watch resets itself to compensate for the normal drift of a quartz crystal .
The result is a self - setting , radio - controlled , atomic - time , wrist watch that is never off by more than a second or two a day .
Impressive and convenient .
But these are not atomic clocks .
Today we have the first true atomic wristwatch .
The definition of a wrist watch is a time piece that can be worn on the wrist , no ?
Below is my brother - in - law , Bill , a professional construction contractor , proving that a HP 5071A Cesium Beam Primary Frequency Reference can in fact be used as a wrist watch .
You have a choice in stainless steel or adjustable nylon band .
Bill 's model below has a fashionable double nylon band .
Other colors are available by special order .
The watch keeps time to a few nanoseconds per day .
The attractive display is based on 7 - segment red LED technology .
Batteries are included ( they last about 45 minutes but are rechargeable ) .
AC adapter included .
There are no adjustments for daylight saving time ; however the clock does handle leap seconds and keeps track of the [ Modified Julian ] date .
This HP wristwatch includes 5/10 MHz and 1 PPS outputs .
An internal keypad is used to set the date and time .
Not waterproof nor even water resistant .
High - performance models available .
Contact your Symmetricom [ 1 ] sales office for details .

As a white liberal running in a majority African American district , Tennessee Democrat Stephen I. Cohen made a novel pledge on the campaign trail last year :
If elected , he would seek to become the first white member of the Congressional Black Caucus .
Now that he 's a freshman in Congress , Cohen has changed his plans .
He said he has dropped his bid after several current and former caucus members made it clear to him that whites need not apply .

" I think they 're real happy I 'm not going to join , " said Cohen , who succeeded Rep. Harold Ford , D - Tenn. , in the Memphis district .
" It 's their caucus and they do things their way .
You do n't force your way in .
You need to be invited . "
Cohen said he became convinced that joining the caucus would be " a social faux pas " after seeing news reports that former Rep. William Lacy Clay Sr. , D - Mo. , a co-founder of the caucus , had circulated a memo telling members it was " critical " that the group remain " exclusively African - American . "
Other members , including the new chairwoman , Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick , D - Mich . , and Clay 's son , Rep. William Lacy Clay , D - Mo. , agreed .
" Mr. Cohen asked for admission , and he got his answer .
...
It 's time to move on , " the younger Clay said .
" It 's an unwritten rule .
It 's understood .
It 's clear . "
The bylaws of the caucus do not make race a prerequisite for membership , a House aide said , but no non-black member has ever joined .
Rep. Pete Stark , D - Calif. , who is white , tried in 1975 when he was a sophomore representative and the group was only six years old .
" Half my Democratic constituents were African American .
I felt we had interests in common as far as helping people in poverty , " Stark said .
" They had a vote , and I lost .
They said the issue was that I was white , and they felt it was important that the group be limited to African Americans . "
Cohen remains hopeful , though , that he can forge relationships with black members in other ways .
" When I saw the reticence , I did n't want anyone to misunderstand my motives .
Politically , it was the right thing to do , " he said .
" There are other ways to gain fellowship with people I respect . "
Cohen won his seat in the 60 percent black district as the only white candidate in a crowded primary field .
If he faces a primary challenge next year from a black candidate , as expected , some Black Caucus members may work to defeat him .
A similar situation arose in 2004 after redistricting added more black voters to the Houston district of former Rep. Chris Bell , D - Texas .
Although House tradition discourages members of the same party from working against each other , about a dozen black lawmakers contributed to Bell 's opponent , Rep. Al Green , D - Texas , the eventual victor .
Even Bell 's Houston neighbor , Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D - Texas , campaigned against him .
One black member who criticized his colleagues for sandbagging Bell was Cohen 's predecessor , Harold Ford .
" You have an incumbent , and you do n't support an incumbent ?
It was inappropriate , " Ford told Congressional Quarterly in 2004 .
Cohen has won high marks for hiring African Americans .
A majority of his staff is African American , he said , including his chief of staff .
JERUSALEM , Aug. 29 — United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan came to Israel late Tuesday after two intensive days in Lebanon that he said had convinced him the Lebanese were serious about preserving the cease - fire and moving to a permanent peace .
“ They believe that , handled properly , they can use this moment to strengthen their state , ” Mr. Annan said in an interview in his hotel room in Jerusalem .
The Lebanese were committed , he said , to “ the idea that you cannot have a state within a state but have to have one authority , one law and one gun . ”
His reference was to the dominance in southern Lebanon of the Hezbollah militia , which provoked a hugely destructive 34 - day war with Israel by capturing two Israeli soldiers on July 12 .
“ I believe the Lebanese because they have seen what has happened to their country , ” he said .
Mr. Annan had spent his second day in Lebanon seeing much of that destruction on a tour of the border area in the south and a visit to the headquarters of Unifil , the 2,000 - member United Nations force in Lebanon .
The strength is soon to grow to 15,000 , matched by a like number of Lebanese Army troops , to patrol the south .
How the Crack Dealer Became a Chef
Have you ever heard of Chef Jeff Henderson ?
Until a few weeks ago , I had n’t either .
That ’s when our publicist mentioned him and his new book .
( We have the same publisher . )
Jeff grew up in L.A. and San Diego , became a big - time crack dealer , and was sentenced to a long term in prison , where he learned to cook and became passionate about food .
Now , after several years in prison and many , many restaurant jobs , he is the executive chef at the Cafe Bellagio in Vegas .
That ’s the story he tells in his book , Cooked , which Will Smith ’s production company has purchased in the hopes of filming his story .
As luck would have it , I ran into Chef Jeff a few days later when we were both giving lectures at a conference .
He ’s a very warm and sharp guy .
Here we are , swapping books :
On the flight home , I planned to just flip through his book but I became thoroughly engrossed and ended up reading the whole thing .
It ’s fascinating .
Below are two passages .
The first one portrays Jeff as a budding crack dealer , figuring out both the financial and culinary ends of the trade :
I bought one bird of powder from [ the Twins ] for $ 17,500 , bought my cooking supplies at Kmart and rented a room at the Spring Valley Motel 6 .
I experimented by cooking in small batches at first , just in case I fucked it up .
First , I weighed out eight ounces powder and four ounces baking soda and premixed them in a salad bowl .
I brought my bottled water to a boil , just like I saw the Twins do .
I was n’t sure whether the water was supposed to be boiling or simmering before I added the dope and baking soda , so I lowered the water to a simmer and added the mix .
I waited nervously for the ingredients to gel .
As it began to gel , I felt a little relief .
I hurried the glass pot to a sink full of crushed ice .
It immediately turned into crack .
I was like , “ This is the shit ! ”
Once I removed the small crack plate from the pot , I blotted it with a dry towel and placed it on the triple beam scale .
My eight ounces of cocaine yielded a return of twelve ounces of crack .
Selling crack at $ 1,500 an ounce , those extra four ounces would give me a profit of $ 6,000 per half bird .
That meant I ’d make $ 12,000 on every key I bought , and I could easily move five and ten kilos on the first and fifteenth of each month ( which were the welfare paydays ) .
This passage is about the economics of a prison kitchen :
Big Roy [ who is black ] ran the meat crew , seasoning and preparing the beef , chicken , fish , and stews .
Once the food was cooked , Big Roy made sure to cut a share of the hot food for the white boys running the bakery in exchange for his share of the rolls and sweets .
The kosher dudes got kicked down next , because they had what no other kitchen had access to .
Their packaged kosher TV dinners were easy to smuggle back to the units , and those kosher Sabbath dinners were always a hot item .
The chicken meals could fetch $ 10 a pop , and the kosher cooks always made a killing on what the rabbis brought in for the holidays .
Whatever Big Roy did n’t eat himself or hand down to his crew or trade , he sold .
He was really in cool with the white boys and the Jews when it came to that business , but he did n’t like dealing with the brothers because they ’d always try to strong - arm him for cheaper prices .
The black guys did n’t mind paying two bucks for a chicken breast and a wing , or a thigh and a leg , but Big Roy could get double that from the whites .
The brothers knew they were getting cut short , though , and from time to time someone would want to stick Big Roy .
So , Roy had to kick down some of his own stuff to certain brothers on the yard — the shot callers — to keep himself protected .
If you want to learn more than you ever knew about cooking crack , cooking prison food , and starting your life over once you get out of prison , Cooked is a pretty good start .
Mr Ponosov had been accused of knowingly using pirated software
The court in Perm , some 1000 km ( 620 miles ) east of Moscow , dismissed the case of Alexander Ponosov as " trivial " .
The trial was seen as a response by the authorities to international pressure to crack down on piracy in Russia .
Industry experts say Russia ranks second only to China in use of illegal computer software and bootlegged music .
" We 're off to drink champagne now , " Mr Ponosov told the Associated Press news agency after the court ruling .
" Of course , it was trivial , " he said .
Mr Ponosov earlier told the BBC that Russian prosecutors had brought the case against him and he was unaware of any Microsoft claim against him .
He said the 12 new computers at his school had been delivered with the unlicensed software already installed .
The school in the Urals village of Sepych has 380 pupils .
Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had publicly voiced support for Mr Ponosov .
BUGGING OUT : Brookline ’s John Hodgman expounding on one of his many areas of expertise .
John Hodgman is a very intelligent man .
He is also a very strange man .
His book , The Areas of My Expertise ( which has just been released in paperback by Riverhead ) , is an omnibus compendium of probable falsehoods .
According to the dust jacket , the arenas of his know - how are centered primarily on “ matters historical ; matters literary ; matters cryptozoological ; hobo matters ; food , drink , and cheese ( a kind of food ) ; squirrels and lobsters and eels ; haircuts ; utopia ; what will happen in the future ; and most other subjects . ”
Tom Perotta gets it just about right when he calls Hodgman “ witty , urbane , and completely out to lunch . ”
In addition to being the author of this mock almanack , chock - a- block with “ strange facts and odd-ities of the bizarre , ” and curator of his own semi- regular academic sermons , the Little Gray Book Lectures , Hodgman is also a contributor to the New York Times Magazine , McSweeney ’s , This American Life , Paris Review , and The Daily Show .
He is also a “ former professional literary agent . ”
And , of course , he is a PC .
( Not really , but he plays one on TV , opposite a Mac. )
In advance of his reading at Brookline Booksmith on September 27 , we managed to wangle 20 minutes of his time to talk about hoboes , mole men , eels , chupacabras , his hometown of Brookline , and his sudden widespread fame .
You are a very intelligent man .
That ’s kind of you to say .
I have no way of judging .
So how did you get so damn smart ?
Hard work and clean living .
And a serum injected into my spinal fluid .
By scientists .
Only have it done by scientists .
Seriously .
Do n’t try it yourself , it ’s just bad news .
It is n't a testament to the rigors of the Brookline Public Schools ?
Oh , well , they played their part .
It was their science department that injected the intelligence serum .
They do n’t do it anymore .
It was part of the scoliosis screening when I was growing up in Brookline .
Now it ’s not done anymore .
In one of your Little Gray Book Lectures , you refer to Brookline as " the town that has everything , yet at the same time has nothing . ”
Explain what that means .
Well , to some degree I was speaking of all home towns .
In that , to the person who comes from a particular place — let us call it “ Town X ” — it is the most unique and interesting and important place in the world .
It ’s where you first experience most of the common stories that we all experience in life .
So it has something of a mythic , novelistic quality to it .
But then as you get older , you realize that you share experiences with a lot of older people .
You also appreciate that every town is not only the most interesting place on earth , but also the most banal place on earth .
Because everyone , more or less , has shared experiences that they go through that make a town seem important .
Home towns are like opinions : everyone has one .
And I guess in that sense , they ’re also like assholes .
So what is your opinion of your hometown ?
Oh , I ’m awfully fond of it . . .
Brookline really is the most interesting place on earth .
A lot of history flows out of Brookline .
While it was not his birthplace , it was the adopted home of Frederick Law Olmstead , who sought to destroy all cities and remake America as a very beautifully landscaped wilderness .
I think it has the world ’s highest concentration of paperback copies of One Hundred Years of Solitude , thanks to the School Within a School program at Brookline High School .
There ’s a lot that ’s very unique and special about it .
It contains multitudes .
Oh , indeed .
It is the Macondo of Eastern Massachusetts .
You are an expert in “ matters historical , matters literary , matters cryptozoological , hobo matters . . . ”
You do n’t have to go through it all .
Yes , well , you know what you 're an expert in .
Fortunately .
Which of these areas of inquiry are your favorites , and have you thought about branching out ?
Well , one of the first ideas that made sense for the book was famous monsters and their hunters , which describes the somewhat complex relationship with various , as - yet - to - be- scientifically verified creatures such as the Loch Ness Monster , Sasquatch , etcetera , with some of the men , typically , who have been obsessed with finding them .
The cryptozoological part , I still like it quite a bit .
I ’m working on a new book , More Information Than You Require , and I find myself coming back and finding that I did not do enough on cryptozoology .
So I ’ve been pondering a lot the Wikipedia , which is my favorite source on the Internet for dubious scholarship , particularly its list of cryptids .
Y’know , I was just reading that yesterday !
Were you really ?
That ’s a strange coincidence .
Did you check out the Mongolian Blood Worm ?
I did not .
I was actually reading about the Chupacabra - type beast that they found up in Maine , where I 'm from .
Oh yeah , I heard about that .
Yes , it ’s very unusual , is n’t it ?
Work by the Arctic Monkeys is among EMI Music Publishing 's catalogue
Under the deal , online music service Spiralfrog will offer work from EMI 's artists - which include the Arctic Monkeys and Eminem - online in the US .
New York - based Spiralfrog will launch its service in December and make its money by carrying adverts on the site .
It will rival Apple 's iTunes , which charges 99 cents per song in the US .
Last week Vivendi Universal agreed to make its music catalogue available through Spiralfrog .
Burgeoning
" We are very pleased to help launch Spiralfrog , " said Roger Faxon , co-chief executive of EMI Music Publishing - which has the largest music catalogue in the world with over one million copyrights .
" It is a very exciting concept which fuses advertising with music downloads and other services to recapture consumer demand which has been hijacked by online piracy .
" Anytime we can create a new revenue stream for our songwriters and combat online piracy , you will see EMI Music Publishing leading the charge . "
Spiralfrog chief executive Robin Kent said that obtaining the rights would help his firm " provide young consumers with access to recordings from a wide range of artists that they want to hear " .
Under the deal , Spiralfrog will also gain rights to song lyrics .
Spiralfrog is discussing possible deals with other big record firms , questions still remain over how the artists will be paid .
The music downloads industry is a burgeoning market .
According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry , 60 million MP3 players were sold in 2005 , while 420 million single tracks were downloaded during the year - up 20 times on two years earlier .
Scientists have discovered that increased levels of ocean acidity and carbon dioxide concentrations have resulted in unexpected changes in oceanic chemical processes .
Their research results are published in the March 7 , 2007 , issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
Oliver Wingenter of New Mexico
Tech and his colleagues conducted a month - long field experiment .
The researchers simulated present - day carbon dioxide concentrations and ocean acidity , and carbon dioxide levels expected at the end of this century and the middle of the next one .
The study , funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , New Mexico Tech and the Comer Foundation , sheds light on how chemical processes that occur throughout the world ’s oceans help regulate Earth ’s climate .
Other recent scientific studies have shown that ocean acidity is rising 100 times faster than ever before , Wingenter said , but this study links the effect of increasing ocean acidity to changes in phytoplankton , which themselves produce “ greenhouse gases . ”
“ Pronounced changes in some phytoplankton have been observed during previous experiments , ” said Wingenter .
“ The consequences for marine organisms , their ecosystems and climate - relevant gases are unknown . ”
During the study , concentrations of dimethyl sulfide ( DMS ) and chloroiodomethane , produced by phytoplankton in ocean water , were measured .
“ In the atmosphere , DMS is rapidly oxidized to sulfur dioxide , which can form sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere , ” said Wingenter .
These aerosols can act as nuclei for cloud formation .
Increased cloudiness could block sunlight , thereby cooling Earth .
“ Therefore , additional DMS production in a higher carbon dioxide environment may help contribute to self - regulation of Earth ’s climate . ”
“ The bottom line is that carbon dioxide - loading of the atmosphere could lead to environmental changes we have not even begun to think about , effects beyond acidification of surface seawater and greenhouse warming , ” said Donald Rice , director of NSF ’s Chemical Oceanography Program .
Combining future experimental and modeling efforts will lead to a better understanding of the feedback systems between the atmosphere and ocean , believes Wingenter .
“ To predict future climate more accurately , it ’s critical that we understand the outcome of increasing ocean acidification and increasing carbon dioxide levels . ”
Wingenter ’s co-authors include former New Mexico Tech undergraduates Karl Haase and Max Ziegler , and scientists from the University of Bergen , the University of New Hampshire , the University of Kiel in Germany , and University of California at Irvine .
The harsh winter in Niigata , Japan brings heavy snow , which can pose problems for residents -- particularly the elderly -- who are faced with the laborious task of clearing it from driveways and entrances .
To the rescue comes Yuki-taro , an autonomous snowplow robot developed by a team of researchers from five Niigata - area organizations .
The friendly - looking Yuki- taro measures 160 x 95 x 75 cm ( 63 x 37 x 30 in . ) and weighs 400 kg ( 880 lbs ) .
Armed with GPS and a pair of video cameras embedded in its eyes , the self - guided robot seeks out snow and gobbles it up into its large mouth .
Yuki - taro 's insides consist of a system that compresses the snow into hard blocks measuring 60 x 30 x 15 cm ( 24 x 12 x 6 in. ) , which Yuki - taro expels from its rear end .
The blocks can then be stacked and stored until summer , when they can be used as an alternative source of refrigeration or cooling .
Yuki-taro is the result of nearly seven years of work by researchers from the Niigata Industrial Creation Organization ( NICO ) , Research and Development , Inc. ( RDI ) , Niigata Institute of Technology , Yamagata University and the Industrial Research Institute of Niigata Prefecture ( IRI ) , who set out to design an environmentally - friendly robot that can operate by itself and support the elderly .
In 2006 , Yuki-taro received a Good Design Award in the small - to - medium sized enterprise category .
Researchers continue to work on reducing Yuki - taro 's size , weight and cost , and they hope to make it commercially available in five years at a price of less than 1 million yen ( $ 8,300 ) .
It is unclear whether or not the researchers intend to further enhance the robot's " cute " factor , but they might ought to consider attaching a pair of pointy ears .
O-negai !

Japanese Banquet of Cannibalism
Japan as a country never stops amazing us .
I am sure you have heard of , or seen the “ Nyotaimori ”  ( literally means female body plate ) , where the restaurant serves sushi and sashimi on a naked woman ’s body .
If that is not weird enough , Japan has just invented another way of eating , where a “ body ”  is made from food and placed on an operating table , much as though in a hospital .
You can operate anyway and anywhere you want by cutting open the body and eating what you find inside .
The body will actually bleed as you cut it and the intestines and organs inside are completely editable .
It ’s a banquet of Cannibalism .

Marxism ( though mostly mistaken ) has had ( and still has ) great appeal as a proposed scientific explanation of the development of human society .
It appeals at different levels of detail .
At the lowest level of detail , a person may only believe that capitalist society is divided into two classes , capitalists and workers , and the former exploit the latter .
Many , who believe this do not even take the next step to believing that workers will overthrow the capitalists and not be exploited any more .
Further study of Marxism leads to hearing about surplus value either in a simple form or a more complex form that takes other economic transactions than the payment of wages into account .
We then have Marxist history telling about classes , the state as the instrument of the ruling class , class struggles , and the end of the class system to be accomplished by the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement by socialism which will evolve into communism .
This is just a sample of aspects of Marxism that have had intellectual appeal .
Marxism has been nicely mixed with Freudianism in some intellectual circles , but I have n't paid enough attention to say anything about that .
[ Perhaps I should point out one place where the intellectual structure becomes inadequate .
Einstein said , " Make everything as simple as possible - but not simpler . "
There are and have been classes defined by the relation of people to the means of production .
However , these have not always or even usually been the most important divisions in society .
There have been class struggles , but the majority of conflicts in human society ( both in the past and at present ) have not been class conflicts but religious , nationalist and dynastic conflicts .
A proper theory of society and its history will be vastly more complex than Marxism , and I think such a theory is not close to being at hand .
I do not despair of its eventual development . ]
Another embarassment to Marxism was the increase in working class prosperity in the advanced countries when theory said workers would get poorer and poorer .
Lenin 's patch in the theory referred to an aristocracy of labor and postulated that the poverty was exported to the colonies .
In an ideal Marxian capitalist society the workers would be paid the minimum needed to keep them alive and reproducing .
Marx and Engels referred to the reserve army of labor , i.e. the unemployed , whose competition for jobs would keep wages at the minimum .
However , actual capitalist societies were not ideal for several reasons .
First there was sometimes a shortage of labor , and this often made the employers increase wages in competition with each other .
This was particularly common in the United States as long as the frontier competed for labor .
Second workers had three kinds of bargaining power .
( 1 ) Individual .
Good workers could often get higher pay .
( 2 ) Collective .
Workers could combine into unions and threaten to strike .
( 3 ) Political .
Workers could vote for politicians who would enact minimum wage laws and laws to prevent extreme forms of union busting .
The Marxist idea of communism as the goal of human society arouses the same kind of human hope that has been aroused by the Christian and Muslim religions .
Millions have killed , inspired by such hopes .
Voltaire wrote in his essay on fanaticism , " How can you answer a man who tells you that he would rather obey God than men , and who is therefore sure to deserve heaven in cutting your throat ? "
It is hard for us to imagine today , the immense despair about human society caused by WWI .
Europe was devastated and millions were pointlessly killed .
It made many people intellectually desperate and ready to seize upon the promises of communism and the Soviet Union .
Giving up on these promises was so hard that many people were ready to believe every possible excuse for Lenin 's and Stalin 's crimes and disasters .
Here 's a quote from Bertrand Russell in lectures delivered in March and April 1914 .
WWI started in August 1914 .
It was a tremendous shock .
To us , to whom safety has become monotony , to whom the primeval savageries of nature are so remote as to become a mere pleasing condiment to our ordered routine , the world of dreams is very different from what it was amid the wars of Guelf and Ghibelline .
Hence William James 's protest against what he calls the " block universe " of the classical tradition ; hence Nietsche 's worship of force ; hence the verbal bloodthirstiness of many quiet literary men .
The barbaric substratum of human nature , unsatisfied in action , finds an outlet in imagination .
In philosophy , as elsewhere , this tendency is visiblep ; and it is this , rather than formal argument , that has thrust aside the classical tradition for a philosophy which fancies itself more virile and more vital .
- Bertrand Russell in " Our knowledge of the external world " , p.10 , 1914 , delivered as Lowell lectures , March and April 1914
The over simple communist explanation of World War I and its enormous destruction as an imperialist war gained millions of adherents for the Leninist variant of Marxism .
When the Soviet Union was partly allied with Nazi Germany between the Soviet - German non-aggression pact of 1939 August and the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 June , World War II was called an imperialist war .
However , few took the model seriously , though maybe it contributed to the French not defending themselves successfully in 1940 .
The world - wide depression of the 1930s was explained as an inevitable consequence of the " law " of surplus value and the increasing immiseration of the proletariat .
It gave credence to the false claims that the Soviet Union was a prosperous and democratic society .
The pro-communist propaganda by journalists who saw what they were determined to see had a large effect .
An interesting example is Edgar Snow 's Red Star over China that glorified Mao and the Chinese communists .
It so suited the Chinese communists that they had it translated into Chinese .
One Chinese in Taiwan told me that he had been converted to communism by the Chinese version of the book .
He had since changed his mind .
Another example is Walter Duranty who denied the Ukrainian famine of 1934 in the New York Times while simultaneously telling the British Embassy in Moscow about the famine .
Since he wrote what the journalistic establishment wanted to read , he got a Pulitzer Prize .
There has been some muttering in the New York Times about giving up that prize , but the plaque is still on the wall .
The example of hard work and self - sacrifice by individual socialists and communists in the trade union movement won adherents for their doctrines .
Missionaries won adherents for their churches in the same way .
It was possible to explain the poverty of the backward countries as consequences of imperialism as defined by Lenin .
Politicians in backward countries often still run for office against the colonial rulers of 50 years ago .
Revenge against killings and oppression was a powerful motive .
Once killing has started , accounting of who killed how many of whom and when is irrelevant .
Besides the usual revenge motivations associated with all conflicts , Marxism offered specific justifications for revenge against the class enemy .
Marxist propaganda makes much of martyrs and calls for revenge - as does Islam .
Since classical Christian martyrology does not call for revenge , it is morally more advanced than Islam or Marxism .
[ Please distinguish between calls for struggle against current oppression and calls for revenge . ]
Ideologies that attach blame to an enemy are attractive to those who are inclined to feel guilty .
It feels much better when the guilt is transformed into hatred .
The demigod image of Stalin was a major attraction of communism for a large fraction of its adherents .
Here 's a part of a poem on the death of Stalin in March 1953 by the Chilean Communist poet Pablo Neruda .
( It is usually , but not always , omitted from editions of Neruda 's collected poems . ) ... We will sail there together , a poet is a fisher -
man and the sea to the distant Captain who
when entering into death left to all the peo -
ples as a legacy , his life .
To be men !
That is
the Stalinist law !
- We must learn from Stalin
his sincere intensity
his concrete clarity
... Stalin is the moon ,
the maturity of man and the peoples .
Stalinists ,
Let us bear this title with pride .
... Stalinist workers , clerks , women
take care of this day !
The light has not vanished .
the fire has not disappeared ,
there is only the growth of
light , bread , fire and hope
in Stalin 's invincible time !
... In recent years the dove ,
Peace , the wandering persecuted rose ,
found herself in his shoulders
and Stalin , the giant one ,
carried her at the heights of his forehead ,
...A wave beats against the stones of the shore .
But Malenkov will continue his work .
Neruda 's own loyalty to Stalin had motivated him , while a Chilean consul , to give false Chilean passports to a team sent to Mexico to assassinate Leon Trotsky in 1940 , who had been a rival of Stalin in the Soviet Union .
( That attempt was repelled by Trotsky 's guards . )
He also gave a Chilean passport to the Mexican painter David Siquieros so he could flee the country while on bail after taking part in an attack on Trotsky 's residence .
Notice that Neruda was hoping for a new maximal leader in Georgi Malenkov , Stalin 's immediate successor as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union .
Malenkov did n't last long as leader ; he was out - maneuvered and ousted by Khrushchev .
He survived into his 90s , however .
According to one of the Venona decryptions , the KGB in Mexico included Neruda as an agent .
See The Venona Story by Robert Benson http://www.nsa.gov/publications/publi00039.cfm.
Besides its appeal to utopian sentiments , the Communist version of Marxism also promoted class hatred of the working class towards the capitalist class .
Because the appeal of communism was greater to intellectuals than to workers in many countries , the class hatred was often vicarious .
Here 's a nice example of its expression , perhaps by a person not given to violence himself .
Blow the bloody bugle , beat the bloody drum .
Blow the bloody bourgeoisie to bloody kingdom come ;
We 'll build a big bonfire , high as the old church spire ,
And we 'll burn the bloody bastards one by one .
Eric Hoffer in his 1951
The true believer : thoughts on the nature of mass movements emphasized the certainty that communism offered to its followers .
He quotes the 1945 edition of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , the official glorification of Stalin ( available on the web at marx2 mao.org ) .
The power of Marxist - Leninist theory lies in the fact that it enables the Party to find the right orientation in any situation , to understand the inner connection of current events , to forsee their course , and to perceive not only how and in what direction they are developing in the present but how and in what direction they are bound to develop in the future .
Not all followers were motivated by that claim of certainty , but some were .
Suppression of private discussion was incomplete , and many apparently firm followers were relieved by the collapse of the repression both in Germany and in the Soviet Union .
Many had been previously relieved by Khrushchev 's 1956 exposé of Stalin 's crimes .
Marxism has proved adaptable to power - seekers .
Of course , Marxism is not the only ideology with that property .
Repeated crises within communism have led to people leaving communist parties .
Here 's a list : Lenin suppressing the Socialist Revolutionaries .
The exile of Trotsky ( Mostly his followers quit then . )
The show trials of the 1930s in which leading communists were forced to confess being Nazi spies .
The Soviet German non-aggression pact of 1939 .
The iron curtain cutting off communication between people in the Soviet Union and their friends and relatives abroad .
The suppression of the Hungarian revolt in 1956 .
The Berlin wall of 1961 .
The invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 .
The Maoist Cultural Revolution of 1966 .
Each of these events caused people to quit the communist movement , sometimes even a majority of a communist party , but always a core stayed on .
Finally , we need to ask why so many people stuck with communism even after seeing its failures and crimes .
Some were implicated in the crimes and profited from them .
Others hoped that the Soviet Union would get better in spite of seeing that it was n't .
Humans have great capacity for wishful thinking .
Many people stayed in the communist movement out of fear of the consequences of quitting .
( 1 ) If your job depended on Party members , leaving the Party was likely to lose your job .
( 2 ) If your family stayed in , they were pressured to divorce you or otherwise separate from you .
( 3 ) The Party launched rumor campaigns in which defectors were accused of being drunks , wife beaters and embezzlers . ( 4 ) A person might see the crimes of the Soviets but still accept the Party propaganda about the evil nature of the FBI and American police departments .

" The choice is the universe or nothing . " - H.G. Wells
“ It seems very controlled and deliberate and concentrated on expanding the area they control , ” he said .
The Sunni forces are being bolstered by support from insurgent strongholds in the West .
The Shiite militias are using neighborhoods in the north , specifically Shuala and Sadr City , as bases of operation .
There is also increasing evidence that militia members from southern cities like Basra are coming to Baghdad to join the fight .
“ I believe everyone , to some extent , is influenced by the militias , ” Colonel Miska said .
“ While some Iraqi security forces may be complicit with the militias , others fear for their families when confronting the militia , and that is the more pervasive threat . ”
Looking at a map he had his intelligence officers create , which highlights current battle zones and details the changing religious makeup of neighborhoods , Colonel Miska noted just how many different forces , each answering to different bosses , currently occupied the battlefield .
“ Who would design this mess ? ” he said .
“ It is like an orchestra where everyone is playing a different song . ”
His main focus , he said , is trying to establish some kind of unity of command .
As it stands , the police and military answer to different ministries , and within the police force the bureaucracy is divided even further between the regular police and the national police .
On top of that are about 145,000 armed men who work as protection detail for the Facilities Protection Services , with minimal oversight , according to United States military officials .
There are also thousands of Shiite militia members and Sunni insurgents posing as security forces .
Colonel Miska tried to define where American forces fit in the tangle of competing interests , which is only further complicated by the complicity and direct participation of top government officials .
LiveLeak.com is a sometimes - controversial video - based site which receives over a half - million visitors a day and was , until just now , completely unindexed in Google – because they accidentally told Google not to index their site !
The funniest part is that , as of 4 AM PST , their own front page still has a ‘ try it for yourself ’ link that encourages users to see that they are n’t indexed by Google .
In� a rather tragic personal video a depressed - sounding LiveLeak administrator describes how he has been trying to contact Google about this potential act of censorship .
Meanwhile , this video has received comments ranging from ranging from “ google has stepped out of bounds ” to “ google is with the government in censoring the internet and they must be stopped !!! ”
Meanwhile , of course , they were informed ( by a friend of mine ) of the problem and , as you can see below , have fixed it :
Even the� Wikipedia article on Google censorship� contains an ( albeit now contested ) sub-section pointing out this issue . � �
How can a site with a half a million visitors a day� and numerous web� professionals looking into the problem NOT figure this out sooner ?

" Help us and ask questions , " read the note , secretly passed to a visitor from an immigrant child incarcerated in a Texas prison .
Based on their visits and interviews , the Women 's Commission for Refugee Women and Children and the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service are calling for the immediate shutdown of the T. Don Hutto Residential Center in Taylor , Texas .
Local activists have brought national and international attention on this facility , owned by the Corrections Corporation of American ( CCA ) , which imprisons children and their families for profit under the same horrendous conditions as when it was a prison for adults .
Approximately 400 immigrants are incarcerated in Hutto , and at least half of the prisoners are children , according to Texans United for Families .
Many of the immigrants -- who are limited to countries other than Mexico - - have made requests for asylum in the U.S.
They await deportation hearings without any charges for months , and sometimes years .

On March 6 , the ACLU sued Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff on behalf of 10 children in the Taylor jail .
The ACLU based its lawsuit on a 1997 settlement protecting immigrant minors that resulted from a class - action suit accusing immigration officials of abusing minors .
In its current initiative , the ACLU accuses Hutto of violating every provision of the 1997 settlement , including not giving children the right to wear their own clothes or have privacy .
The artwork of children tells no lies , and the artwork of children imprisoned at Hutto -- posted on the ACLU Web site -- is heartbreaking .
A child sits atop a broken heart ; a boy behind crudely drawn bars .
The saddest of all - - an American flag , with the words " HELP " scrawled between the two red stripes at the top .

According to depositions filed with the ACLU lawsuit , the guards at Hutto threaten unruly children with separation from their mothers .
But this is often an echo of the threats that drove these families to the U.S. in the first place , to seek asylum .
Raouitee Pamela Puran came from Guyana after she and her four - year - old daughter Wesleyann Emptage were threatened by the people who kidnapped and murdered her husband .
" Wesleyann has heard the guards threaten that children who act up will be separated from their parents , " Raouitee said in her deposition .
" Almost everyone has heard this .
Wesleyann is terrified that something like that could happen to her .
She is afraid of the guards because she thinks they have the power to take me away from her . "
Sherona Verdieu , a 13 - year - old from Haiti whose father was kidnapped and eventually killed when her mother could not pay a ransom , said she worried about crying -- that this could be a cause for separating her from her mother .
Elsa Carbajal -- a 24 - year - old woman from Honduras who survived a brutal rape committed by the son of a police officer who continued to terrorize her afterward -- said that her 5 - year - old son and 3 - year - old daughter " think that they have done something wrong to be imprisoned in this jail . "
Angelina , Elsa 's daughter , suffered significant weight loss while in Hutto .
She told her mother that she was always cold , but according to Elsa , she was yelled at for trying to take a blanket , while the guards wear gloves and heavy clothing .
The cruelty of the guards and prison officials that emerges from reading the lawsuit is hard to fathom .
Families are awakened at 5:30 or 5:45 a.m. , and must be through bathing by 6 a.m .
They are given 20 minutes to eat .
" If we have n't finished , " Elsa says , " the officials say they are n't interested -- the time to eat has finished . "
If the children have n't finished , they have to throw away the food .
" In some cases , " she says , " they have grabbed the food and thrown it in the trash in front of the children , and they cry because they say they are hungry . "
After the 20 - minute meal , the prisoners return to their cells " to do nothing , " Elsa says .
" They do n't allow us to sleep , only to sit and wait for the hours , days , months to pass . "
The prisoners are n't allowed to have books sent to them , and a great deal of the day is spent in senseless head counts to make sure no one has escaped .
Nine - year - old Kevin Yourdkhani , the son of Iranian - born parents who have sought asylum in Canada for several years , ended up in Hutto after the plane he and his family were traveling on was forced to make an emergency landing in Puerto Rico , where U.S. officials questioned their passports .
In his deposition , Kevin complained about the ridiculous excuse for an education system at Hutto .
" Students " in the class of 25 ranged in age from six to 12 years old .
" All we do is color and draw pictures and watch Spanish movies , " Kevin said .
Kevin also said that his bed was small and cold , and stuck next to a smelly washroom .
His mother had to use the toilet in front of him .
Once , when Kevin 's dad came in to fix the bed , guards told him that if his father was in his room again , both parents would be put in separate jails , and Kevin would be sent to a foster home .
" I cried and cried , " he said .
" I felt if I will be separated , I can never see my parents again , and I will get stepparents , and they will hurt me or maybe they will kill me . "

Since the ACLU filed its suit March 6 , seven of the children named in the action -- Wesleyann , Kevin , Angelina and Richard Carbajal , and Aisha , Mohammed and Bahja Ibrahim - - have been released from Hutto , along with their families .
Rebecca Bernhardt of the ACLU says that those who won release were able to post bond or retain good lawyers or had enough activism and attention paid to their case that they could prove an embarrassment to CCA .
According to the Austin American Statesman , U.S. District Court Judge Sam Sparks has agreed that the detention of immigrants in Hutto fails to meet federal standards , and that the ACLU lawsuit will probably succeed .
He set an expedited trial date for August .
But he denied a request for a preliminary injunction ordering release of the families , " saying that federal standards do not provide rights for adult detainees , only minors , " the newspaper reported .
This hints of the possibility of more family separations and the continued suffering for immigrants in detention .
T. Don Hutto was supposed to be a model for an ever - growing number of immigrant detention centers .
Although officials of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs enforcement claim that Hutto was designed to stop the practice of separating detained parents from their chidren , it seems more likely that this private prison thought it would be more cost - effective to have parents caring for young children within the jail .
Besides , there is still plenty of separation .
Fathers are often sent to a separate facility , and children who are citizens are usually farmed out to relatives , rather than sent to Hutto .
According to Deepa Fernandes of CorpWatch , there are 26,500 undocumented people held by federal authorities in the U.S. , and the number will rise to 32,000 by the end of the year .
Immigrant rights activist Jay Johnson - Castro has continued his walks to expose atrocities along the border of Texas and Mexico and in immigrant detention facilities .
During a recent five - day march to protest immigrant prisons in the Rio Grande Valley , he learned that Hutto is n't the only place where children are being detained .
In Los Fresnos , Johnson - Castro visited International Educational Services , which he found to be nothing like a school .
Instead , it was a detention center for " young adults " who had been separated from their mothers incarcerated at the nearby Port Isabel Immigrant Detention Center .
When the children turn 18 , they are sent to a separate adult prison .
Johnson - Castro also visited Raymondville , the home of a $ 65 million tent city that holds 2,000 immigrants who speak more than 40 different languages in windowless hothouses .
They are locked down 23 hours a day .
" We still have the problem that Hutto was supposed to fix , " says Johnson - Castro .
" The criminals who run this show can say that 's the game , but we 're sick and tired of you making these rules ...
The criminals make the rules , and we 're going to put a stop to it . "

The ever - so - loyal Jessica Pickett asks :
A few of your posts – taken together with other econobloggers – would seem to suggest a correlation between being a libertarian economist and being a die - hard sci- fi / fantasy geek .
Does your experience support this anecdotal observation , and if so , can you elaborate on the possible causation ?
I see the connection , and I can think of a few possible answers :
1 . The rude : Because both groups live in a fantasy world .
But even if that is true , many other ideologues live in a fantasy world but fail to have the same attachment to science fiction .
2 . The trivial : Both loves are correlated with " young upper middle class nerdy white male , " but otherwise the connection has no significance .
3 . The proud : Libertarian economists like to imagine how things otherwise might be .
This spills over into a love for science fiction .
4 . The Freudian : Libertarians feel an infantile need to rearrange the pieces of the moral universe , due to thwarted childhood desires and ongoing sexual frustrations .
5 . The sociological : Character development is notoriously weak in science fiction and libertarians are prone to see societies in terms of abstract laws rather than very definite individual human beings .
5. Denial or minimization of the fact : I doubt if the connection holds outside the USA .
Plus bloggers are a very , um … " select " sample .

Liz Strauss sparked a heated debate recently with her post 10 Reasons Creative Folks Drive Us Crazy , with some people ( mistakenly ) interpreting her as meaning that “ creative folks ” are somehow different in kind to the rest of us .
I made a half - baked comment on one of her follow - ups , and she suggested I turn it into a blog post – so this is my attempt at the slightly - more - baked version , with thanks to Liz for the prompt .
It ’s a question that comes up for me quite often in relation to my work , when people ask me why I focus on coaching creative professionals – after all , is n’t everyone creative ?
So are n’t I being restrictive by working with the “ creatives ” ?
To which I answer :
Yes of course they are ; and No I ’m not .
To explain why , let ’s look at the concept of the “ creative person ” .
We can probably all recognise the classic image of the artist or creative person – a Romantic , wilful , sensitive , temperamental , tortured soul , a perpetual outsider with a mysterious and misunderstood talent .
A bit like a cross between Lord Byron and Vincent Van Gogh .
The trouble is , it ’s not true .
However appealing the image might be to some artists and the makers of biopics , there are many creative people who do n’t fit the stereotype .
Even among the poets , some of the most obvious candidates for the mantle of the incurable Romantic , we find quite a few actively resisting the image .
W.H. Auden called himself “ an incurable Classic ” , and his friend and fellow - poet Louis MacNeice wrote :
Why hold that poets are so sensitive ?
A thickskinned grasping lot who filch and eavesdrop ,
Who enjoy ourselves at other men ’s expense ,
Who , legislators or not , ourselves are lawless ,
We do not need your indulgence , much less your pity ,
With fewer qualms , we have rather more common sense
Than your Common Man ( ‘ To the Public ’ )
Philip Larkin produced perhaps the most memorable anti-Romantic poetic manifesto , by saying “ deprivation is to me what daffodils were to Wordsworth ” .
Yet if some artists resist the stereotype , there are still plenty of people , particularly in the Creative Industries , who are keen to perpetuate the idea that there is something special about the “ creative personality ” that sets it apart from other mortals , and makes creatives either social misfits or mysterious geniuses – or both .
This attitude gets short shrift from Robert Weisberg in his book Creativity : Beyond the Myth of Genius , where he debunks the idea of the creative genius by arguing that attempts to define the creative personality have met with failure .
Similarly , in Creativity – Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention , Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi admits that he started out as a creativity researcher by trying to identify the common personality traits of creative individuals – but later abandoned the attempt , concluding that there is no fixed ‘ creative type ’ .
The closest he could get was “ complexity ” , as described in Liz ’s post , meaning that creative people often combine very different and seemingly incompatible traits .
( E.g. a friend once told me she did n’t understand how I could both like football “ and write such sensitive poems ” – to which I answered , of course , that it ’s because I like football that I can write such sensitive poems . )
One area of psychological research on creativity that has produced some positive results is motivation .
Theresa Amabile ’s research has shown that there is a strong correlation between creative performance and “ intrinsic motivation ” – i.e. when someone is working on a creative task for its own intrinsic interest they are likely to demonstrate more creativity than if they are pursuing the task in order to achieve an extrinsic reward , like money , fame or promotion .
She quotes the American poet Anne Sexton :
Anne Sexton told her agent that , although she would love to make a great deal of money from her books , she knew that she had to forget all about that while actually writing her poems
Weisberg and Csikszentmihalyi similarly emphasise the importance of motivation or determination in creative performance .
A key element of Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of creative flow is that this kind of peak performance is “ autotelic ” , meaning it is enjoyable for its own sake .
So one way of defining the ‘ creative person ’ is simply someone who enjoys creativity and therefore does a lot of it .
So if the special “ creative person ” is a myth , why do I focus on working with creatives ?
Having worked with professional artists and creatives for over 10 years , as well as with many other types of client , I would say there are basically three differences between them and many other people .
1 . They think of themselves as “ creative ” .
I ’ve come across many people who are perfectly capable of coming up with original ideas – but who keep blocking themselves by saying “ I ’m not creative ” .
Even when it is pointed out to them that they have done creative things , they resist the label , and clearly feel uncomfortable with it .
The “ creatives ” on the other hand , are quite happy to think of themselves as creative , and do n’t create this kind of internal obstacle to their natural creativity .
2 . They love doing creative work .
Because they enjoy creative work more than most people , they spend more time doing it .
Which means they get better at it .
Which means they enjoy it more .
Which means they do more of it … and so on .
This is not to say they do n’t enjoy money , status , recognition or other rewards , but these are not as important to them as the pleasure of creativity itself .
3 . They put themselves in an environment where creativity is encouraged .
I once ran a seminar and set a group of managers the task of finding the “ second right answer ” to a question ( based on Roger von Oech ’s excellent creativity book A Whack on the Side of the Head ) .
A couple of minutes into the activity , I noticed they were looking very uncomfortable .
When I asked them what was wrong , they said it felt very unsafe , as they were constantly told by senior management that mistakes were unacceptable and they had to get things “ right ” .
No wonder their creativity was inhibited !
Creative types on the other hand , gravitate to situations where creativity is not only encouraged but expected of them – art schools , ad agencies , design studios , artists ’ quarters , writer ’s colonies , film sets and ‘ clusters ’ of creative businesses .
By surrounding themselves with others engaged in creative work , they immerse themselves in the latest ideas and developments in their field – and some of that creativity rubs off .
These three factors help them develop their raw creative talent into accomplished skills .
This is not to deny that some of us are naturally “ gifted ” with more talent than others , but this is a matter of degree rather than kind – and talent is nothing unless you put it to work .
How you can be a more creative person
So what are the implications for someone who wants to be more creative , either as a professional or keen amateur ?
It boils down to doing these three things :
1. Assume you are creative .
Do n’t worry about labelling yourself a creative or uncreative person .
Just assume that creativity is humanly possible , and you are a human , therefore it ’s possible for you .
2 . Follow your heart .
Your passion for creativity is your guide to developing your talent .
When your curiosity is aroused , when you feel yourself becoming absorbed , fascinated and excited by a creative task – that ’s your talent telling you you ’re getting warm – it ’s saying “ Do more of this ” .
Creativity can be hard work , and it requires dedication and commitment to keep going , but if you apply yourself and follow your heart , sooner or later you will taste creative flow , at the point where your motivation , talent and experience blend together .
3 . Hang around with creative people .
Get involved .
Go to work in somewhere creativity is encouraged ; go to readings , galleries and concerts ; attend classes and stay behind for a drink and a chat with the other students ; read books ; read magazines and offer to write for them ; hook into online communities via blogs , mailing lists and and discussion boards .
Whatever your chosen medium , soak it up by hanging out with the people who are doing it .
Get familiar with the whole of your chosen field , its history as well as its present – that way you have a chance of contributing to its future .
So back to the original questions – I hope I ’ve shown that I ’m not putting labels or restrictions on people .
Anyone can be creative , provided they do these three things .
And why do I work with creative professionals ?
Partly it ’s a matter of personal taste – I ’m a writer myself and love working with people with a similar passion for creativity .
If you ’re going to spend a lot of time coaching others to do something , I think you should have experience of it yourself .
The other reason is that the “ creatives ” do n’t put any limits on their creativity , which makes them very exciting to work with .
They are not essentially any different from other people , but they are doing the three things listed above , consistently – which means they are enjoying their work more and producing better and better creative results , working towards the possibility of creating something extraordinary .
And if you want to , so can you .

Was I a good American ?
How good an American was I ?
Did I do what I could to resist the takeover of my country and the brutalisation of my fellow human beings ?
How much further could I have gone ?
Were the crimes of the Bush administration those that demand you give up your life and everyday commitments to throw yourself into maximum resistance ?
If not , then what were we waiting for ?
The questions have troubled me regularly these last five years , because I was one of the millions of American citizens who did not shut down GuantÃ¡namo Bay and stop the other atrocities of the administration .
Â
I Â wrote .
I gave money , sometimes in large chunks .
I went to anti-war marches .
I demonstrated .
I also planted a garden , cooked dinners , played with children , wandered around aimlessly , and did lots of other things you do when the world is not crashing down around you .
And maybe when it is .
Was it ?
It was for the men in our gulag .
And the boys there .
And the rule of law in my native land .
Before the current administration , it had always been easy to condemn the “ good Germans ” who did nothing while Jews , Gypsies and others were rounded up for extermination .
One likes to believe that one will be different , will harbour Anne Frank in one ’s secret annex , smuggle people across the border , defy the authorities who do evil .
Those we scornfully call good Germans merely did little while the mouth of hell opened up .

Since I do n’t see these things catalogued and bullet - pointed as often as I feel like I should , I want to pause and take stock :

Then it was about Weapons of Mass Destruction , except that were n’t any and the conclusive evidence that there was turned out to be fiction ( and the only way to not know this was to ignore the counsel of your own intelligence people ) .
It ’s also about bringing democracy to the region .
Of course , the only thing that ’s been brought to the region so far is a strong and compelling case for all Arabs to unite against our occupation .

There are several files that appear not to have extensions in Windows XP .
Perhaps the best known example is the HOSTS file .
Files such as the HOSTS file that appear to be “ extensionless ” actually contain an invisible period “ . ” — or dot — at the end the file name .
It is this invisible dot that will enable us to select a specific program with which to open files with no extensions .
Jump through the hoops
As web developers , we are constantly checking and consulting server - generated error_log files .
Like the HOSTS file , the error_log files appear to have no associated extension .
In Windows XP , opening extensionless files requires opening the “ Open with … ” dialogue box and scrolling through a long list of file types .
And , although there is a checkbox option within the dialogue box enabling users to “ Always use the selected program to open this kind of file , ” the option is “ greyed out ” and useless .
Thus opening an extensionless file requires four or five extra “ clicks ” , as well as the extra time it takes to jump through the hoops .
This may not sound like a big deal , but try opening any number of files by this method and the extra clicks begin to add up .
After opening our millionth error_log file using the “ Open with ” method , we decided to confront the problem and devise a solution .
After a bit of research , we were presented with several options : editing the registry , installing software , or tweaking Windows “ Folder Options ” .
After fiddling with the registry and installing some software with no real progress , we decided to try the heretofore unsuccessful “ Folder Options ” method .
Sure enough , armed with an invisible dot and a slight tweak , we were finally able to convince Windows XP to associate extensionless file types with Notepad , our program of choice for such files .
The Solution ( Notepad )
Although this solution is relatively risk - free1 , requiring no registry editing or software installation , the process is fairly sensitive , requiring careful attention .
Below are two methods : the first associates extensionless files with Notepad , while the second does such with WordPad .
Both assume you are running on a Windows XP operating system .
Here is the method of associating extensionless file types with Notepad in WinXP :
Open Windows Explorer and go to Tools › Folder Options › File Types .
Click the “ New ” button and type “ . txt ” in the “ File Extension ” field .
Click on the “ Advanced ” button and the “ Associated File Type ” should read “ Text Document ” .
If it is blank , or says something else , close everything out and start over , making sure to follow the steps in order .
Finally , in the “ File Extension ” field , replace the “ .txt ” with a single dot , “ . ” Click “ OK ” and exit .
Find or create an extensionless file and check it out .
The Solution ( WordPad )
Here is a similar method of associating extensionless file types with WordPad in WinXP :
Open Windows Explorer and go to Tools › Folder Options › File Types .
Click the “ New ” button and type “ . txt ” in the “ File Extension ” field .
Click on the “ Advanced ” button and the “ Associated File Type ” should read “ Text Document ” .
If it is blank , or says something else , close everything out and start over , making sure to follow the steps in order .
Open the “ Associated File Type ” dropdown menu .
Scroll down and select “ Wordpad Document ” .
Finally , in the “ File Extension ” field , replace the “ .txt ” with a single dot , “ . ” Click “ OK ” and exit .

[ Ayla Holland ( L ) and Mark Ginsberg ( R ) ]
Yesterday at the Multnomah County Courthouse the law came down against fixed gear bicycles .
On June 1 , 2006 Portland bike messenger Ayla Holland was given a ticket for allegedly violating Oregon Revised Statute ( ORS ) 815.280 ( 2 ) ( a ) which states ,
A bicycle must be equipped with a brake that enables the operator to make the braked wheels skid on dry , level , clean pavement .
strong enough to skid tire .
At issue was whether Holland ’s fixed gear bicycle met this requirement .
She and her lawyer Mark Ginsberg thought it did , but Officer Barnum of the Portland Police Bureau thought otherwise so they brought the matter in front of a traffic court Judge .
[ Ginsberg explains how
a fixed gear works . ]
According to Officer Barnum , he stopped Holland at SW First and Jefferson and told her that she was in violation of the law and that she must put a front brake on her fixie to avoid a ticket .
Holland disagreed .
She and Ginsberg claim that Oregon statute does not clearly define what a brake is and that as long as a bicycle can perform a “ skid on dry , level clean pavement ” it does not need to have a separate , traditional braking device .
At the start of the trial it was clear that neither the Judge nor the Officer understood just what a fixed - gear bicycle was .
To help them visualize , Ginsberg likened a fixie to a child ’s Big Wheel .
Once everyone was clear and the cop was finished with his opening testimony , Ginsberg began his cross-examination :
Ginsberg ( to Officer Barnum ) :
“ When you approached the rider did she stop ? ”
Officer Barnum :
“ Yes . ”
Ginsberg :
“ How ’d she stop the bike ? ”
Officer Barnum :
“ I do n’t know . ”
Ginsberg :
“ The gear itself stopped the bike . ”
Officer Barnum :
“ But the gear is not a brake . ”
From the outset , the judge seemed to agree with the cop and it was up to Ginsberg to change his mind .
The trial began to hinge on the definition of brake .
Ginsberg continued to ask questions of the cop .
Ginsberg :
“ What is a brake ? ”
Officer Barnum :
“ A lever , a caliper or a coaster brake hub . ”
Ginsberg :
“ Can you show the court where in the vehicle code a brake is defined as such ? ”
Officer Barnum :
“ No . ”
Ginsberg :
“ Did you at any time during the traffic stop ask my client if she could skid ( thus meeting the performance requirement of the statute ) ? ”
Officer Barnum :
“ No . ”
At this point the judge seemed increasingly exasperated with Ginsberg ’s direction and pointed out that “ brake ” was a commonly accepted term .
To end this line of questioning , Ginsberg offered to demonstrate to the court that Holland could easily bring her fixed - gear bike to a skid on dry , level pavement .
The judge declined his offer .
Now it was time for Officer Barnum to ask questions .
He asked Holland ,
“ What would you do if your chain broke ? ”
Holland :
“ I would use my feet . ”
Officer Barnum :
“ What if your leg muscles had a spasm ? ”
Holland :
“ I ’m not sure … these are emergency situations . ”
Ginsberg interjected with a question for Holland :
“ Did any of these situations happen on the day you were stopped ? ”
Holland :
“ No . ”
Now it was time for Officer Barnum to submit his closing testimony .
He continued to argue that nowhere in the statute does it say gears can be utilized as brakes ( it does n’t say they ca n’t either ) .
He also said that “ motorists and the public deserve to have these bikes be properly equipped , ” and that a “ skid is not as good or safe as a stop . ”
“ The requirement , ” he said , “ has not been met . ”
Now it was Ginsberg ’s turn .
He said ,
“ The state is overreaching in seeking to define a brake as a lever and a caliper .
The question remains ; is the fixed gear the brake ?
The statutes are clear that the answer is yes . ”
To solidify his point , he took out a huge Webster ’s dictionary and opened it to the word “ brake . ”
The definition stated that a brake is a “ device to arrest the motion of a vehicle . ”
It did not stipulate anything about a distinct lever or caliper .
In his last few comments he proclaimed that the current statute is not well - written and that it is “ frightening to require only a front brake . ”
With both sides at rest , it was time for the Judge ’s final opinion .
His contention was that the main source of braking power on a fixed gear are the muscles of the rider , not the gear itself .
To this end , he questioned how messengers — whom he ’s seen riding “ much too fast ” — could stop safely .
In the Judge ’s opinion , gearing itself and / or leg muscles are not a sufficient source of braking power .
He said ,
“ The brake must be a device separate from the musclulature of the rider .
Take me for instance .
I do n’t have leg muscles as strong as a messenger … how would I stop safely ? ”
He then turned directly to Ginsberg and said ,
“ If your client had a stick she could rub against her tire , you ’d have a case .
I do n’t believe the defense has convinced me to broaden the definition of a brake .
I find the defendant guilty . ”
So now Holland has 30 days to either attach a hand brake to her bike and pay a $ 73 fine , or appeal the decision .
In talking with her outside the courtroom it seemed like she did not think the Judge ’s opinion was fair and I would n’t be surprised if she and Ginsberg decide to continue the fight .
This decision by the Judge raises some concerns and questions .
Will the cops now feel emboldened to go out and ticket everyone on a fixed - gear ?
Are fixed - gears now essentially illegal ?
Are fixed - gears truly a public safety hazard ?
Fixed gears have become a huge trend across the country and with hundreds if not thousands of them in Portland , I do n’t think we ’ve heard the end of this issue .

Wisconsin farmer rakes in cranberries By Robert Imrie , Associated Press WISCONSIN RAPIDS , Wis .  Cranberry farmer Dan Brockman drives his new harvesting machine — " the ruby slipper " — through the vines .
Finger - like steel rods submerged in six inches of chilly waters below him quietly nudge and shake the plants .
Dan Brockman pulls the ruby slipper through cranberries in Wisconsin .
Morry Gash , AP Berries float to the surface , a sea of red forming behind Brockman 's tractor as he drives .
His invention , five years in the making , promises a much faster way to harvest the popular fruit that is the basis of a $ 200 million annual industry and a staple of Thanksgiving Day tables .
" If it works as well as it appears it does , yes , it will revolutionize cranberry harvesting , " says Teryl Roper , a fruits crop specialist and professor of horticulture at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
" It is elegantly simple . "
According to Roper , there are about 1,200 cranberry growers in the United States and Canada .
Wisconsin produces more than half of the estimated 575 million pounds of cranberries Americans consume each year , according to the Wisconsin State Cranberry Growers Association .
The ruby slipper is an alternative to mechanized water wheel beaters that have been used for decades to harvest cranberries .
Brockman 's invention has no movable parts other than spring - loaded arms upon which metal finger - like rods are mounted .
As the device is pulled or pushed through flooded cranberry vines with a tractor , the arms follow the contour of the ground and the rods shake off the berries , much like someone shaking a small apple tree so the fruit rains down .
The berries float to the top of the water , where workers gather them together and pump them into trailers and trucks for processing into juices , sauces and other products .
By comparison , the self - propelled machine now used throughout the industry features a rotating beater similar to rotating cutters on old push lawn mowers that knocks the berries from the vines as the harvester slowly drives down flooded fields .
Brockman , 47 , started out by picking two fields with the ruby slipper and the next year the crop came back even better .
He hired a consultant who found evidence the return crop was 17 % to 24 % better than areas harvested with a conventional beater , suggesting his invention did less damage to the plants than conventional beaters .
Brockman invested $ 30,000 to develop his ruby slipper .
A patent is pending .
" I did n't build it with the concept that I am going to build something that everyone wants to buy .
I was building it so I could harvest my crop better and more efficiently and it just happened that a groundhog finds an acorn , " he says .
BDT , a Wisconsin Rapids manufacturing company that bought the rights to build the machine from Brockman , has sold eight ruby slippers so far — priced at $ 7,000 to $ 9,000 depending on the width — and all the customers are happy with the results , says engineer and co-owner Dave Dix .
It 's the biggest technological development for the cranberry industry in 20 years , Dix says .
Many larger growers now use three workers each operating a self - propelled water wheel beater , some costing up to $ 40,000 each , Dix says .
BDT 's testing shows Brockman 's invention can do the same amount of harvesting in the same amount of time with one operator , Dix says .
The machine can harvest four acres of vines in an hour , which is extremely fast .
Brockman spent six years working in a paper mill before returning to the cranberry farm his father started in 1946 .
The idea for the ruby slipper came during hours of idle thinking while riding tractors or sitting in the silence of a stand while deer hunting , he said .
" I always approach just about everything with the idea that there 's a better way to do it , " Brockman says .
" You just need to find it . "

So if you are looking for a trusty guide to online casinos in the UK , look no further than OnlineGaming4u – a reputable website established in 2006 .
More Gambling Sites
Online casinos first hit the internet more than 23 years ago .
According to this article the first online casino launched in 1994 , whereas online poker was only launched in 98 .
However , since then the avalanche effect kicked in – and tens to hundreds more gambling sites came on to the scene .
More and more companies were founded and other software developers developed the technology required to operate on the web such as NetEnt , IGT and Playtech .
This was great for consumers and gave players much more choice on where to play real - money games online .
The only downside to this is that for inexperienced customers , sometimes too much choice can be overwhelming .
But , in our useful guide to gambling , we showcase a vetted selection of top online casino sites for UK players along with the software they use and the games they provide .
We list some of the most trusted and reputable brands in the business including Jackpotjoy , LeoVegas and Paddy Power , along with some newer sites such as Starspins , bgo and Virgin .
Casino Games & Slots
Play the best casino games and slots online and on mobile with the leading casinos in the UK .
We rate and review hundreds of real money games that are available to play online , some of which are recommended to us by our visitors , and look in depth to each game .
We then publish our findings on our game pages with top sites to play at and fantastic bonuses to enhance gameplay .
View More Games »
Some of the games we publish are available in demo mode , so that players can practice before playing for real money .
This is also a great opportunity to learn how the game works , familiarise with the gameplay and work out a strategy that suits .
Free Casino Games
At OnlineGaming4u , we have everything from free bonus deals on specific casino games to free roulette games and more .
Some of the games even come with no deposit bonuses , so that you can get a real - cash experience – for free !
Popular no deposit games include ; Starburst , Gonzo ’s Quest and Secrets of the Phoenix .
When it comes to free casino games , in the gambling industry we generally separate this category in to two : no deposit and for fun .
For fun games are then broken down further in to 2 categories – demo , and casual .
Demo & No Deposit Casino Games
Demo games are closely linked to actual casino games without the financial commitment .
These are often played on a temporary basis .
The player generally gets the full experience of a real money game , using credits or a faux balance .
Casual games are those that are fee - free and played purely for fun permanently .
A popular ‘ for fun ’ example is casino games that are played on social media platforms , apps or sites like DoubleDown and Big Fish .
No deposit games come in all shapes and sizes and commonly depend on 2 factors – the game type , and the casino provider .
As each online casino sets its own offers , it is up to them whether they wish to offer an open no deposit bonus , or a limited one .
Often no -deposit promotions are linked directly to a specific game , especially if the offer is free spins with no deposit .
So these type of offers are available at selected games , such as bgo who offer 20 free spins on Starburst .
However , casinos like Paddy Power are more open and allow customers to play any game , including roulette with their no deposit bonus .
So if you are looking for the best casino games in 2020 , head over to our game guide and games archive where you can find categorised lists of top titles and where to play them .
All of the games we list include bonuses that vary in size and type from free spins to first deposit and cashback .

How I learned to stop worrying and love Trac
It ’s hard to believe only a week has passed since we ’ve integrated the project blog into Trac – with the Timeline view displaying both source code changes and blog entries , it now became really convenient to just keep Trac open and refresh it every time we want to get an update on the state of the project .
The first thing that bothered me was the looks – Trac comes with a lovely warm coloured skin – the Trac team has done an excellent job designing the interface , but next to the rest of our web - based tools ( which all conform to the same colour scheme as this very blog )
Trac just looked a bit out of place .
Also , with so many Trac installations on the web it started being a bit confusing .
I thought I ’d have a stab at customizing Trac ’s look .
It ai n’t no sin , to take off your skin …
First , I grabbed the logo and favourites icon from our website , placed them in the htdocs / directory of our Trac installation , and changed the entries pointing to the in the Trac configuration file .
In order to change the colour scheme I changed the template site_css.cs in the project ’s templates directory , and added a directive to pull a CSS file I had prepared based on our standard css ( the template is being pulled into each and every page that Trac renders , so it ’s better not to put the css directly in it – using a separate css file allows browser to cache the code ) .
Getting the CSS selectors right was mostly straightforward , though I do think the HTML templates could have been better designed for customization .
Getting rid of the ticketing system
While we already make use of Trac ’s source browser , timeline and wiki , we do n’t need the ticketing system ( we use Bugzilla for bug - tracking ) .
I wondered whether I could make Trac hide the navigation and search items for tickets .
Turns out it ’s easier than I hoped – since all Trac components inherit from the Component class , it ’s easy to tell Trac which components to load based on the package they ’re in – All I have to do is add the following to trac.ini :
[ components ] trac.ticket .* = disabled
With View Tickets , New Ticket and Roadmap gone from the Trac menu the system looks much less cluttered , and there ’s no risk that anyone would try to use these features , that are incompatible with our existing bug - tracking system .
Bugs , not Tickets
I still found myself switching between Trac and Bugzilla all the time , and that can be very frustrating – so frustrating it can ruin even days like this , when the weather is so fine .
Something had to be done – it was time to integrate our project ’s bug - list from Bugzilla into Trac .
Bugzilla is notorious for having very sparse documentation , but the clues are there if you want to read them .
For every bug - list you get from bugzilla you can pull an RSS feed , and for the detailed bug views you can request the data to be sent in Bugzilla ’s proprietary XML format .
Retrieving information from Bugzilla is possible using a combination of the two .
First you must authenticate – Bugzilla uses cookies to keep track of your login , so it ’s easy to fool it by posting the username and password to the login form , capturing the cookie and sending it back to Bugzilla in all future requests .
To search for bugs I build a query string ( based on what I learned from playing with the standard web interface ) and add the parameter ctype=rss .
I parse the result with feedparser and extract the id from all the bugs in the result by parsing the bug url .
With the list of bug ids I can initiate a call to show_bug.cgi , passing the ids and the parameter ctype=xml .
I parse the result using xmltramp and iterate over it , building a neat little list of dictionaries which can be easily used from Python code and from templates .
Integration with Trac
As we ’ve seen last week , integrating new functionality into Trac is easy peasy – all you have to do is write classes that inherit from Component and implement interfaces – the documentation is not great but the Trac source code is very easy to read and pretty self - documenting .
First , I added a new navigation item ( implementing INavigationContributor ) which reads Bugs and points to / bugs .
I added a new template ( which I placed inside my Python package ) and implemented IRequestHandler so that it reads all of the project ’s bugs out of bugzilla and uses the template to render them , linking each bug to its corresponding page on Bugzilla .
One of the advantages of having a centralized system for project management is that you can search over all of it ’s components – by implementing ISearchSource I could provide a hook into Bugzilla ’s search – by simply forwarding the search terms to the short desc and long desc parameters in Bugzilla you get pretty good coverage .
Finally , bugs are a moving target , they just keep changing all the time as participants in the project add comments and change the bug ’s status , so it would be useful to see these changes interleaved with the rest of the chronological list in the timeline view .
After last week ’s little adventure with the blog I am already an ITimelineEventProvider pro – it only took a couple of minutes before I had bug changes in the list .
The code
You can get the plugin from here .
It ’s buggy , and extremely inefficient .
It authenticates before each and every request , thus making the interface to Bugzilla even slower than it needs to be .
The entries in the timeline indicate that the bug changed , but not why it changed – you ’ll have to follow to Bugzilla if you ’re curious enough , the bug list does n’t sort the bugs by anything , does n’t allow any report except for the list of all bugs , and it does n’t look very nice either .
If you do decide to give it a try , do n’t forget to send us some patches 🙂
Impeachment : A Duty , Not an Option Editor ’s Note : Washington's " conventional wisdom " holds that the idea of impeaching George W. Bush is a non-starter , a pipe dream , so beyond the possible that it 's not worth even discussing .
But there is another way to look at it , that impeachment is the only hope for restoring the democratic Republic envisioned by the Founders .
In this guest essay , journalist Carla Binion argues why the impossible may be the necessary : George W. Bush and Dick Cheney deceived Congress and the American people into supporting their unlawful invasion of Iraq .
Their abuse of power continues .
They should be impeached , not for partisan reasons , but to maintain our constitutional system and to deter future leaders from abusing power .

Printer friendly Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. discussed Richard Nixon 's expansion and abuse of presidential power in " The Imperial Presidency . "
Schlesinger said the question of impeachment " was more than whether Congress and the people wanted to deal with the particular iniquities of the Nixon administration .
It was whether they wished to rein in the runaway Presidency . "
Today 's runaway Presidency is far from reined in .
Bush and Cheney are emboldened by the fact that they 've managed to get away with the high crime of lying to Congress in order to dupe the nation into war .
They keep escalating the conflict , peddling the same distortions and propaganda they 've used all along .
Bush and Cheney function as kings .
This is n't what America 's founders had in mind .
The United States of America was born during the Enlightenment , or the Age of Reason .
America was conceived by a learned generation angry with power - mad absolute rulers .
On the eve of the country 's birth , as popular outrage bubbled to the surface , Great Britain 's King George III and monarchs of other nations were above the law .
An adage at the time was " the king can do no wrong . "
Since the Middle Ages , in order to safeguard their rights , English barons asserted that kings should abide by the rule of law .
These barons pushed for a representative system -- government by consent of the people .
They worked up agreements such as the Magna Carta to protect themselves from potentially repressive monarchs .
The feudal idea that monarchs must obey the law and cooperate with their subjects helped set the stage for our own representative form of government with its limits on executive power .
Enlightenment - era philosophers stirred the fire .
British political philosopher John Locke , French writer Jean Jacques Rousseau and others denounced the " divine right of kings " and the all - powerful , unaccountable monarchy .
They wrote that government should gain power only with the consent of the governed and that any government should be replaced if it failed to guarantee basic liberties for the governed .
Both Locke and Rousseau thought the relationship between rulers and the ruled should be regulated by contract .
The U. S. Constitution is a document of that kind , a contract between government and the governed .
The Declaration of Independence , though more about our founding principles than legality , also reflects Enlightenment philosophers ' views .
The Declaration says : " Governments are instituted among men , deriving their just power from the consent of the governed . "
It echoes Locke 's idea that the people should depose leaders if they fail to protect basic liberties .
Regarding citizens ' right to " life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , " the Declaration states : " Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government . "
John Keane writes in Tom Paine : A Political Life : " The whole point of the Revolutionary struggle against the British had been to establish in constitutional form the principle that unchecked power corrupts both decision - makers and decision takers , whereas publicly checked power enables bad governors and bad policies to be revoked . "
Keane refers to Tom Paine 's statement that the American revolutionaries had battled for periodic elections " not only for the purpose of giving the people , in their elective character , the opportunity of showing their approbation of those who have acted right , by re-electing them , and rejecting those who have acted wrong ; but also for the purpose of correcting the wrong ( where any wrong has been done ) of a former legislature . "
In the 2006 elections , the American people showed their approval of officials who acted right by re-electing them and rejected those who acted wrongly .
Our votes were , as Paine 's commentary suggests , " for the purpose of correcting the wrong of a former [ Republican - dominated , rubber stamp ] legislature . "
Among other concerns , the recent elections were a public mandate opposing the Bush administration 's Iraq policy .
As public outrage against the Iraq fiasco increases , Bush and Cheney fend off our representative congressional critics , claiming they 're trying to override the judgment of current military commanders in Iraq .
However , the Bush / Cheney team rejected advice of countless military and intelligence professionals from the start of the Iraq invasion , seeking only information supporting their ideology and dismissing any contradictory facts .
Any member of Congress who still doubts the Bush administration deliberately fixed the intelligence and knowingly misled the nation to attack Iraq should read the ample evidence in this article : http://democracyrising.us/content/view/245/164/
The article was written in 2005 , before the mid-term elections , when Republicans dominated Congress and yielded to Bush 's every demand .
Now that we have a Democratic majority in Congress , there is no excuse for our Democratic representatives to shirk their responsibility to hold official investigations looking toward impeachment .
As this nation was being founded , at the North Carolina Constitutional convention , James Iredell , who later became a U. S. Supreme Court Justice , stated that a President " must certainly be punishable for giving false information to the Senate . "
Iredell said a President " is to regulate all intercourse with foreign powers , and it is his duty to impart to the Senate every material intelligence he receives . "
He added that a President is also culpable " if it should appear that he has not given full information , but has concealed important intelligence when he ought to have communicated , and by that means induced them to enter into measures injurious to their country , and which they would not have considered to had the true state of things been disclosed to them . "
[ J. Elliot , " Debates in the Several State Conventions on Adoption of the Federal Constitution , As Recommended by the General Convention at Philadelphia in 1787 ( Washington : 1836 ) , vol. 4 at 127 . ]
To recap -- A President should be punished if he gives false information to the Senate and conceals significant intelligence , causing Congress to enter into an injurious situation they would n't have entered if the full truth had been disclosed .
What punishment would be effective and essentially corrective ?
It would n't be enough for such a President to merely say the words " I 'm accountable . "
True accountability has concrete consequences , such as impeachment and removal from office .
In his above - referenced book , Arthur Schlesinger said he thought Nixon 's impeachment was a necessity .
" If the Nixon White House escaped the legal consequences of its illegal behavior , " said Schlesinger , " why would future Presidents and their associates not suppose themselves entitled to do what the Nixon White House had done ?
Only condign punishment would restore popular faith in the Presidency and deter future Presidents from illegal conduct - so long , at least , as Watergate remained a vivid memory . "
Today Watergate has become a faded memory , and this country has lost the lessons we should have absorbed from the Nixon impeachment .
One of the repercussions of our willing forgetfulness is that after Nixon , three other Presidents ( Ronald Reagan , George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush ) committed serious abuses of power involving U.S. foreign policy .
Reagan 's and GHW Bush 's abuses centered mainly on Iran - contra .
In January 2000 , I wrote a four - part series on Iran - contra ( links given below ) and I 've decided to review some of that information here , since there are relevant similarities between the way the Iran - contra participants circumvented the Constitution and the current unconstitutional behavior of the Bush / Cheney administration .
The primary sources for my Iran - contra series were the " Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran - contra Affair , " published by the New York Times , and two PBS Frontline broadcasts with journalist Bill Moyers , one that aired in 1987 and another in 1990 .
As mentioned in the series , Americans might have found the Iran - contra affair more interesting if it had been more aptly named .
It should have been called the " Republicans Undermine the Constitution " scandal .
As Bill Moyers said of Iran - contra , " The basic constitutional issues still have not been confronted .
Can a President , on his own , wage a war that Congress opposes ?
And how are we the people to hold our leaders accountable if we are kept in the dark about their deeds ?
What happened in Iran - contra was nothing less than the systematic disregard for democracy itself .
It was in effect a coup , a spirit at odds with liberty .
Officials who boasted of themselves as men of the Constitution showed utter contempt for the law .
They had the money and power to do what they wanted , the guile to hide their tracks , and the arrogance to simply declare what they did was legal . "
In 2007 , the same constitutional issues still have n't been confronted .
George W. Bush waged war with Iraq " on his own " in that he did n't accurately inform members of Congress about his reasons or intentions .
Bush has kept the public in the dark about his deeds , has shown systematic disregard for democracy itself and utter contempt for the law , in a spirit at odds with liberty .
He has had the guile to hide his tracks and the arrogance to simply declare what he did was legal .
Congress 's failure to impeach the Iran - contra participants sent a distinct message to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney , and the message was that they could also ignore the rule of law and the Constitution .
Just as the Bush team justifies its actions by exaggerating the threat of terrorism and misrepresenting the real nature of that threat , the Reagan administration over - hyped the threat of communism in Central America .
Reagan 's CIA Director William Casey ran disinformation programs aimed at convincing Congress and the public they faced perpetual danger from external threats .
For an American president to use scare tactics to manipulate public opinion is virtually anti-American .
In the PBS series mentioned above , Bill Moyers said , " The people who wrote the Constitution lived in a world more dangerous than ours .
They were surrounded by territory controlled by hostile powers on the edge of a vast wilderness .
Yet they understood that even in perilous times the strength of self - government was public debate and public consensus .
To put aside these basic values out of fear , to imitate the foe in order to defeat him is to shred the distinction that makes us different .
In the end , not only our values but also our methods separate us from the enemies of freedom in the world .
The decisions that we make are inherent in the methods that produce them .
An open society can not survive a secret government . "
We have a secret government operating today , one that sold us the Iraq invasion based on deception .
The Bush administration 's decision to conduct and continue the Iraq war has endangered our national security by draining our military 's strength , bleeding our national budget and ruining our reputation around the world .
Our national security is threatened when other world leaders no longer trust this nation 's leadership .
The reasons we have n't yet rectified Bush 's and Cheney 's ongoing power abuses in the Iraq affair are similar to reasons our system of government did n't self - correct during Iran- contra .
In both cases , our system of checks and balances failed us .
There were at least four reasons the Reagan administration managed to cloak their misdeeds and evade accountability : · Congress did not do its job .
· The media did not do its job .
· The White House , the Justice Department , and the CIA , stalled , stonewalled , destroyed evidence and served as their own judge and jury , and
· The American people could not play a meaningful role , because we were kept in the dark .
In my four - part series I explain those reasons and the particulars of Iran - contra in detail , and I include specifics regarding the cover - up , methods of propaganda and evidence that George H. W. Bush was n't " out of the loop " as he claimed .
The details are worth reviewing for a more complete picture of the parallels between Iran - contra and the current situation in Iraq .
The Iraq intervention has also been compared with the war in Vietnam .
On March 18 , 1968 , Robert F. Kennedy spoke against U.S. policy in Vietnam .
His critique could apply to the Iraq affair today .
He said , " We are entitled to ask - we are required to ask - how many more men , how many more lives , how much more destruction will be asked , to provide the military victory that is always just around the corner , to pour into this bottomless pit of our dreams ? "
Kennedy added , " But this question the administration does not and cannot answer .
It has no answer - none but the ever - expanding use of military force and the lives of our brave soldiers , in a conflict where military force has failed to solve anything in the past …
It is long past time to ask : what is this war doing to us ?
Of course it is costing us money - fully one - fourth of our federal budget - but that is the smallest price we pay .
The cost is in our young men , the tens of thousands of their lives cut off forever .
The cost is in our world position - in neutrals and allies alike , every day more baffled by and estranged from a policy they can not understand . "
Kennedy concluded , " Higher yet is the price we pay in our innermost lives , and in the spirit of our country …
The costs of the war 's present course far outweigh anything we can reasonably hope to gain by it , for ourselves or for the people of Vietnam . "
( " The American Reader : Words That Made A Nation , " edited by Diane Ravitch , HarperCollins Publishers , 1991 . )
In order to learn from history rather than repeat past mistakes , and to give our current national situation context , it helps to remember the lessons of Vietnam , Nixon 's imperial Presidency , the Iran - contra affair and a period when monarchs were above the law - the era that gave birth to our Constitution .
When evaluated in the context of all these events , Bush 's runaway Presidency , his administration 's crimes against the people of this country and the repercussions of those actions appear so egregious that impeachment is n't merely Congress 's option , but its constitutional duty .

R6RS Status Report
Kent Dybvig , Will Clinger , Matthew Flatt , Mike Sperber , and Anton van Straaten
February 24 , 2006
1. Overview
This status report describes the current state of the R6RS standardization effort .
It covers principles we have outlined to guide the effort , decisions we have made to date , our work in progress , and the process by which we intend to complete the R6RS .
2. Guiding Principles
To help guide the standardization effort , the editors have adopted a set of principles , presented below .
They are , like R6RS itself , a work in progress and still subject to change .
Like R5RS Scheme , R6RS Scheme should :
derive its power from simplicity , a small number of generally useful core syntactic forms and procedures , and no unnecessary restrictions on how they are composed ;
allow programs to define new procedures and new hygienic syntactic forms ;
support the traditional s-expression representation of program source code as data ;
make procedure calls powerful enough to express any form of sequential control , and allow programs to perform non-local control operations without the use of global program transformations ;
allow interesting , purely functional programs to run indefinitely without terminating or running out of memory on finite - memory machines ;
allow educators to use the language to teach programming effectively , at various levels and with a variety of pedagogical approaches ; and
allow researchers to use the language to explore the design , implementation , and semantics of programming languages .
In addition , R6RS Scheme should :
allow programmers to create and distribute substantial programs and libraries , e.g. , SRFI implementations , that run without modification in a variety of Scheme implementations ;
support procedural , syntactic , and data abstraction more fully by allowing programs to define hygiene - bending and hygiene - breaking syntactic abstractions and new unique datatypes along with procedures and hygienic macros in any scope ;
allow programmers to rely on a level of automatic run-time type and bounds checking sufficient to ensure type safety while also providing a standard way to declare whether such checks are desired ; and
allow implementations to generate efficient code , without requiring programmers to use implementation - specific operators or declarations .
In general , R6RS should include building blocks that allow a wide variety of libraries to be written , include commonly used user - level features to enhance portability and readability of library and application code , and exclude features that are less commonly used and easily implemented in separate libraries .
R6RS Scheme should also be backward compatible with programs written in R5RS Scheme to the extent possible without compromising the above principles and future viability of the language .
With respect to future viability , we operate under the assumption that many more Scheme programs will be written in the future than exist in the present , so the future programs are those with which we must be most concerned .
3. Decisions
This section outlines the decisions made to date .
3.1 . Structural changes
R6RS will consist of a core language and set of separate libraries .
The following features are definitely in the core language :
none yet identified
The following features are definitely in a separate library .
delay and force
and hash tables ( see Section 3.5 )
3.2 . Features eliminated
The following features have been eliminated .
transcript - on and transcript - off
3.3 . Changes
The following syntactic and semantic changes have been made to existing features .
syntax is case sensitive
internal defines now follow letrec* semantics
semantics there is now a single unique end - of - file object
3.4 . Features added
The following features have been added .
letrec* ( letrec with left - to - right evaluation order )
( with left - to - right evaluation order ) block comments bracketed by #| and |#
and expression comments prefixed by # ;
matched square brackets ( " [ " and " ] " ) ; equivalent to matched parentheses for list data and list - structured forms
" and " " ) ; equivalent to matched parentheses for list data and list - structured forms allow symbols to start with ->
eof - object constructor to obtain the end - of - file object
constructor to obtain the end - of - file object require continuations created by begin to accept any number of values
3.5 . Features to be added
The following features will be added once the details have been worked out .
top - level libraries
record types and record definitions
exception handling
safe ( default ) and unsafe modes
syntax - case macros
macros hash tables ( as a library )
Unicode support
new string escape characters , including
for newline ( part of Unicode support )
for newline ( part of Unicode support ) serialization ( read - write invariance ) for every datum ( part of Unicode support )
3.6 . Reaffirmations
The following features of R5RS are reaffirmed for R6RS .
support for multiple values
unspecified evaluation order for applications , let bindings , and letrec bindings
bindings , and bindings set -car ! and set-cdr !
3.7 . Beyond R6RS
The following features are definitely not under consideration for R6RS .
processes
network programming
object - oriented programming
box datatype
4. Work in Progress
Most of the standardization effort is currently focused on several subsystems : libraries , records , Unicode , arithmetic , exceptions , I/O , modules , and hash tables .
Sections 4.1 - 4.7 list for each subsystem a set of informal requirements the editors have identified , the current status , and open questions .
In several cases , a subsystem is up for discussion as a SRFI in order to give the editors a chance to inform the community of the ongoing work and obtain valuable feedback from the community .
The final mechanism adopted for R6RS may , however , differ in minor or significant ways from the published SRFI .
A list of other items up for consideration is given in Section 4.8 .
These have not received as much attention to date , usually because they involve less complex or far - reaching changes or are considered to be of lower priority .
4.1 . Libraries
Informal requirements : support distribution of portable libraries , support identification of library location , namespace management , export / import of macros , permit separate but dependent analysis and compilation , support generation of efficient compiled code , ability to define new libraries .
Support for libraries is under community discussion via SRFI 83 .
Two big issues have arisen : the need to clarify phases , e.g. , for compile - time modules that import at compile - time , and how library names are written ( coding as strings is controversial ) .
Still up in the air are the extent to which the syntax of import and export forms is tied down , what built - in libraries besides r6rs there might be , and whether there is to be support for user - defined libraries .
4.2 . Records
Informal requirements : disjoint types , syntactic interface , mutable fields .
Support for records is under community discussion via SRFI 76 .
Still to be settled is whether generativity should be specified , e.g. , as expand - time or run-time and also whether to elide or provide a rationale for the " sealed " feature .
4.3 . Unicode
Informal requirements : provision for Unicode characters and character syntax , Unicode strings and string syntax ; Unicode character I/O ; integer -> char and char -> integer are inverse operations and support Unicode - specific text encodings ; write / read invariance for every datum , including symbols .
Support for Unicode is under community discussion via SRFI 75 .
Open issues include what normalization and character representation to use .
We will probably use normalization form " C , " and Scheme characters will likely correspond to Unicode scalar values ( which can be represented by a 21 - bit fixed - length encoding , but other representations are also possible ) .
4.4 . Arithmetic
Informal requirements : support for IEEE zeros , infinities , and NaNs , clean up behavior of eqv? wrt numbers , fix certain arithmetic operations , transparency .
Changes for R6RS arithmetic are under community discussion via SRFI 77 .
There is general agreement to require the full tower and to require that real ?
implies an exact zero imaginary part .
Among the open questions are whether fixnum , flonum , exact - only , and inexact - only operations should be in separate libraries rather than in the core language .
4.5 . Exceptions
Informal requirements : clarify the meaning of " is an error , " view exception handling as a means of communication between parts of the program .
Proposals for this subsystem are currently under discussion .
No R6RS - specific SRFIs have been published , and no decisions have been made .
There is , however , general agreement to use SRFI 34 as a basis for the R6RS exception - handling system .
Informal requirements : read - byte and write - byte , ports that support binary I/O , byte vectors , block read / write operations .
This subsystem actually addresses two separable issues here : potential additions changes to I/O and the inclusion of a byte - vector datatype .
The byte - vector datatype is necessary to support block read / write operations .
Proposals for this subsystem are currently under discussion .
No R6RS - specific SRFIs have been published , and no decisions have been made .
4.7 . Macros
Informal requirements : specify expansion semantics , specify interaction with modules , allow procedural transformers , hygiene - breaking operations , maintain support for syntax - rules .
The editors have decided to adopt syntax - case as currently implemented in Chez Scheme and Dr. Scheme , with various differences to be worked out by Dybvig and Flatt .
Also , the underscore identifier ( " _ " ) will no longer be a pattern variable but instead a special identifier that matches any input , and underscore will be allowed in place of the keyword naming a macro in a syntax - rules pattern .
4.8 .
Other possible changes
The following possible features and changes have been discussed without resolution .
external representation for ( possibly cyclic ) graph structures
syntax for the eof - object , if any
whether #t , #f , and characters must be followed by a delimiter
, , and characters must be followed by a delimiter case - lambda
cond - expand
improving the semantics of eqv? and equal ?
and bitwise operations on exact integers
homogeneous numeric vectors
support for file operations
support for regular expressions
support system operations
formatted output
making quotation of empty list optional
adding support for weak pointers
adding a void object to replace the " unspecified value "
support for gensyms and uids
let - values or other multiple - value binding construct (s )
or other multiple - value binding construct (s ) R5RS compatibility library
5. Completion Process
We intend to deliver a draft R6RS to the Steering Committee by September 1 , 2006 .
In order to meet this target , we plan to wrap up work on the various subsystems , decide on the core language / library split , and create a rough internal ( editors only ) draft of the R6RS by mid-June .
For each of the subsystems , the core / library split , and the safe / unsafe mode mechanism and semantics , we have assigned a single editor to be responsible for ensuring progress .
We have also assigned one or more additional editors to help .
These assignments are shown below .
subsystem primary editor additional editors libraries Flatt Dybvig records Sperber Dybvig , van Straaten arithmetic Clinger Sperber Unicode Flatt Clinger macros Dybvig Flatt exceptions Sperber Clinger I/O Sperber van Straaten core / library split van Straaten Dybvig hash tables van Straaten Clinger safe / unsafe mode Clinger Sperber
As time permits , we will also discuss as a group the other possible features and changes described in Section 4.8 , as well as additional ones that may arise , and decide which are to be incorporated into R6RS .
Responsibility for making sure that the editors complete their work and communicate effectively lies with the chair ( Dybvig ) and responsibility for creating the R6RS drafts lies with the project editor ( Sperber ) .

Pat Toomey , President of the Club for Growth , has an op - ed piece in today ’s Wall Street Journal examining the record of Arizona Senator John McCain
As one might suspect , there is much in the Senator ’s record to concern those of us who believe in individual liberty .
Take , for example , his economic record :
Sen .
McCain was one of only two Republican senators to oppose the 2001 tax cuts and one of only three GOP senators to oppose the 2003 reductions .
Furthermore , his reason for opposing the cuts was taken straight from the playbook of the most radical left - wing Democrats .
In 2001 , Sen. McCain argued , “ I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle - class Americans who need tax relief . ”
That statement is virtually indistinguishable from the class - warfare demagoguery used by Democrats like Ted Kennedy and John Kerry .
More importantly , it was grossly inaccurate .
The Bush tax cuts lowered income taxes , and other taxes , for every American who paid them .
In percentage terms , lower - income workers enjoyed the greatest savings , and today , upper - income workers pay a larger share of total income taxes than they did before the Bush tax cuts .
Additionally , Toomey points out , McCain has been a supporter of government regulation of the economy on many occasions .
There is , however , one thing in his legacy that stands out above all others :
[ O ] f all his infringements on personal freedom , Sen. McCain ’s persistent attacks on political speech are the most worrisome .
The First Amendment is an important safeguard of pro-growth policies .
When government strays from sound economic policies , citizens must be free to exercise their constitutional rights to petition and criticize those policies and the politicians responsible for them .
The 2002 McCain - Feingold bill ( or the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ) , named in part for the Arizona senator who gave it life , seeks to squash political dissent by imposing grossly unconstitutional restrictions on citizen participation in political debate .
In defense of the bill ’s provision severely limiting the freedom of private groups to run political TV ads , Sen. McCain argued in a Supreme Court brief , “ These ads are direct , blatant attacks on the candidates .
We do n’t think that ’s right . ”
He thus anointed himself the arbiter of appropriate political speech , worthy of deciphering which speech is “ right ” and which should be permitted in American political debate .
His law constitutes the greatest modern infringement of the First Amendment right to political free speech .
While bestowing significant advantages upon incumbent office holders , it has created neither a less corrupt political domain nor a more democratic one .
I noted last year that McCain - Feingold is the one reason why I will never vote for John McCain .
Given his record as evidenced by the Club for Growth ’s white paper , anyone who consider themselves libertarian or classical liberal should think long and hard before supporting him in 2008 .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. youngsters aged 14 to 18 who work at retail and service jobs during the school year put in an average of 16 hours a week , often at jobs that are dangerous and unsupervised , a study said on Monday .
The report from the University of North Carolina said some of the working conditions found in interviews with a representative sample of 928 teenage workers violated federal law .
“ Teens are exposed to multiple hazards , use dangerous equipment despite federal prohibitions and work long hours during the school week , ” said the report published in the March issue of Pediatrics , the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics .
“ They also lack consistent training and adult supervision on the job , ” it added .
The research done during 2003 found the teens worked an average of 16.2 hours per week during the school year , including nearly three times a week after 7 p.m. on school nights .
Thirty - seven percent of those under 16 reported working after 7 p.m. on a school night , a probable violation of federal law , it said .
Despite federal regulations prohibiting teens under 18 from using certain types of dangerous equipment such as slicers , dough mixers , box crushers and paper balers , or serving or selling alcohol in places where it is consumed , more than half of the boys and 43 percent of the girls said they had done work that was prohibited , the study found .
Girls were more likely than boys to have jobs that involved handling cash -- exposing them to robbery risks , the authors said .
Boys reported less supervision than girls .
Working late “ suggests the potential for interference with school or sleep , as well as potential for exposure to workplace violence that is more prevalent in the retail and service sectors than in other settings , ” the study said .
“ Many teens are performing tasks that are prohibited by current federal child labor laws .
Our results also suggest gaps in both safety training and supervision of working teens because approximately one - third of the teens reported not receiving any safety training , ” it added .
Among those who were trained , it said , some critical areas such as what to do in case of robbery or how to deal with arguments or fights among co-workers were not addressed .
One of the problems given to solve in HTDP was to write a program that solved the 8 queens problem , that is , to place 8 queens on a standard chess board so that none of them are attacking each other .
I quite enjoyed working through this , and came up with something that used a straight size 64 scheme vector to represent the board which I thought would be reasonably efficient .
First of all , as encouraged by HTDP , there were the functions to manipulate and display the board :
( define - struct board ( squares size ) )
( define ( display - board b ) …)
( define ( coord - > index x y n ) …)
( define ( board - ref b x y ) …)
;; Constructors
( define ( build - board n f ) …)
( define ( empty - board n ) …)
and then the methods suggested within the book to solve the problem .
I ’ve attached the code at the end along with fairly naive translations into Ocaml and C ++.
The surprising thing to me though is that vast differences in speed .
The Ocaml runs around 15 times faster than the scheme , and the C++ runs around 20 times faster than the Ocaml .
Now , to some people , this might suggest that C++ is much faster than Ocaml which in turn is much faster than PLT Scheme .
However , the wealth of information around on the net leads me to believe that this is not true .
I therefore conclude that I am not very good at writing efficient scheme or efficient Ocaml .
I can see that there are minor algorithmic differences between the code .
In particular , the C++ uses out - of - bound data rather than a Some / None type as in the Ocaml .
Additionally , the C++ uses simple machine integers to represent the square types .
It is difficult to believe that this accounts for the difference though , in which case , what am I doing wrong ?

Happy birthday Leonhard Euler
Leonhard Euler , one of the greatest and most prolific mathematicians ever to walk the earth , was born 300 years ago today in Basel , Switzerland .
Euler named the constant e ( not for himself ; he used vowels for constants and had already used a for something else ) , and discovered the astonishing formula !!
e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x !! , which is known as Euler 's formula .
A special case of this formula is the Euler identity : !!e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 !!.

Visual Complex Analysis
from Powell 's Visual Complex Analysis , by Tristan Needham .
This was certainly the best math book I read in all of 2006 , and probably the best one I 've read in the past five years .
( Many thanks to Dan Schmidt for rcommending it . )
The brief explanantion is something like this : the exponential function ect is exactly the function that satisfies the differential equation df / dt = cf(t ) .
That is , it is the function that describes the motion of a particle whose velocity is proportional to its position at all times .
Imagine a particle moving on the real line .
If its velocity is proportional to its position , it will speed away from the origin at an exponentially increasing rate .
Or , if the proportionality constant is negative , it will rapidly approach the origin , getting closer ( but never quite reaching it ) at an exponentially increasing rate .
Now , suppose we consider a particle moving on the complex plane instead of on the real line , again with velocity proportional to position .
If the proportionality constant is real , the particle will speed away from the origin ( or towards it , if the constant is negative ) , as before .
But what if the proportionality constant is imaginary ?
A proportionality constant of i means that the velocity of the particle is at right angles to the position , because multiplication by i in the complex plane corresponds to a counterclockwise rotation by 90° , as always .
In this case , the path of the particle is a circle , and so its position as a function of t is described by something like cos t + i sin t .
But this function must satisfy the differential equation also , with c = i , and we have Euler 's formula .
Another famous and important formula named after Euler is also called Euler 's formula , and states that for any simply - connected polyhedron with F faces , E edges , and V vertices , F - E + V = 2 .
For example , the cube has 6 faces , 12 edges , and 8 vertices , and indeed 6 - 12 + 8 = 2 .
The formula also holds for all planar graphs and is the fundamental result of planar graph theory .
Spheres in this case behave like planes , and graphs that cover spheres also satisfy F - E + V = 2 .
One then wonders whether the theorem holds for more complex surfaces , such as tori ; this is equivalent to asking about polyhedra that have a single hole .
In this case , the theorem is a little different , and the identity becomes F - E + V = 0 .
It turns out that every surface S has a value χ ( S ) , called the Euler characteristic , such that graphs on the surface all satisfy F - E + V = χ ( S ) .
Euler also discovered that the sum of the first n terms of the harmonic series , 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n , is approximately log n .
We might like to say that it becomes arbitrarily close to log n , as so many things do , but it does not .
It is always a bit larger than log n , and you cannot make it as close as you want .
The more terms you take , the closer the sum gets to log n + γ , where γ is approximately 0.577216 .
This γ is Euler 's constant : $ $ \gamma = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left({\sum_{i=1}^n { 1 \over i} - \ln n}\right ) $ $
This is one of those numbers that shows up all over the place , and is easy to calculate , but is a big fat mystery .
Is it rational ?
Everyone would be shocked if it were , but nobody knows for sure .
The Euler totient function φ ( x ) counts the number of integers less than x that have no divisors in common with x .
It is of tremendous importance in combinmatorics and number theory .
One of the most fundamental and astonishing facts about the totient function is Euler 's theorem : a φ(n ) - 1 is a multiple of n whenever a and n have no divisors in common .
For example , since & phi(9 ) = 6 , a6 - 1 is a multiple of 9 , except when a is divisible by 3 : 16 - 1 = 0· 9 . 26 - 1 = 7· 9 . 46 - 1 = 455· 9 . 56 - 1 = 1736· 9 . 76 - 1 = 13072· 9 . Euler 's solution in 1736 of the " bridges of Königsberg " problem is often said to have begun the study of topology .
It is also the source of the term " Eulerian path " .
Wikipedia lists forty more items that are merely named for Euler .
The list of topics that he discovered , invented , or contributed to would be far too large to actually construct .
Happy birthday , Leonhard Euler .

Plans for the World Trade Center site are now complete
See the plans
The towers will descend in height in a semicircle around the memorial to the victims of the 11 September attacks .
The designs complete plans for Ground Zero , where the showpiece Freedom Tower is already under construction .
But five years on , frustration is growing over the lack of actual rebuilding work , correspondents say .
British architects Norman Foster and Richard Rogers have each designed one of the new towers , as has Fumihiko Maki of Japan .
Each building will be covered in glass and the tallest will stand as high as the city 's iconic Empire State Building .
Former glory
Mayor Michael Bloomberg told a news conference in New York that the new skyline would " restore the splendour of our city 's historic birthplace " .
Plans for the World Trade Center site are now complete
" These are some of the most stunning buildings you will see anywhere in the world , " said New York Governor George Pataki .
" It does respect the sanctity of this entire site , " he added .
Lord Rogers said that he hoped people would come to the site to think of the past , but , more importantly , to " dream of the future " .
Construction work on the new towers is expected to begin in 2007 or 2008 .
Design features
The tallest of the skyscrapers , and the last to be built , will be topped by four diamonds that will point towards the memorial park from any vantage point in the city , architects say .
Designed by Lord Foster , the diamonds will light up lower Manhattan at night .
Lord Rogers 's building will be more slender and designs show it featuring four 100 ft ( 30 m ) spires - one at each corner .
Fumihiko Maki 's minimalist fourth tower will be covered in perforated aluminium , making it the lightest of the skyscrapers , according to its designer .
The landmark buildings are intended to complement Freedom Tower - which at 1,776ft ( 541 m ) is set to become the tallest building in the United States .
All building work on the site is due to be completed by 2012 .

Not so long ago , the world was buzzing with the idea that 3D printing would soon become mainstream and everyone would have a 3D printer in their home .
We now know that ’s not true , but that does n’t mean 3D printing is n’t valuable .
Beyond its high - end use in prototyping , 3D printing remains really useful for creating things that do n’t have a big enough market to warrant manufacturing them .
It ’s a perfect match for Eurorack , where even the most popular products are used by a small number of people .
It brings highly specific and customizable ideas to fruition and bridges a gap between hardcore module builders and end users .
I dug through Thingiverse* , the Internet ’s home for 3D printable designs , and put together a collection of 98 Eurorack designs and can be printed or remixed for free .
The collection contains faceplates , cases , breakouts , blank panels , knobs , cable organizers , and adapters for all sorts of unexpected things .
Some of the designs are highly customizable , even if you know nothing about design .
Weeks have passed since Apple 's announcement of the Mac Pro , and while we wanted to conclude our look at the Mac Pro much earlier , like many Mac Pro users we ran into some serious performance issues under Windows XP .
With the Mac Pro performance issues resolved and some more time with the system under our belts , we 're able to bring you the final part in our Mac Pro coverage .
This time we 're focusing on upgrading the memory and CPUs in the Mac Pro , as well as looking at its performance as a PC running Windows XP .
As a high end Xeon based machine that can run both Mac OS X and Windows XP , the Mac Pro has the potential to be the power user 's dream .
Today our task is to find out just how upgradable this machine is and how well it runs XP , if it can truly be your only system if you 're a Mac and PC user .
FBD Revisited
Thus far the only real downside we 've seen to the Mac Pro is its use of Fully Buffered DIMM ( FBD ) .
As we mentioned in our initial article discussing the Mac Pro 's specifications , the FBD spec calls for a serial interface between memory controller and memory modules , while allowing the chips on the memory modules themselves to be regular mainstream DDR2 devices .
A FBD memory controller talks to an AMB ( Advanced Memory Buffer ) on each memory module , which acts as a translation hub and buffer for all communication between the DDR2 devices on the module and the requests from the memory controller .
The major benefit of FBD is the ability to feature more memory modules per channel ( up to 8 per channel ) , offering greater capacity for high end servers and workstations than even registered DDR2 .
The downside to FBD is that there is significant overhead and latency introduced by using a packetized interface and using the AMBs to translate from one interface technology to another ( FBD to DDR2 ) .
As we mentioned and proved in our previous articles , the number and configuration of FB - DIMMs in your Mac Pro can affect performance .
The Intel 5000X chipset in the Mac Pro features two 144 - bit FBD branches , each being the width of two FB - DIMMs ( effectively giving the chipset four " channels " ) .
Therefore you need at least two FB - DIMMs in the system ( the width of a single FBD branch ) , but ideally you 'd need at least four to have a hope of attaining peak bandwidth .
As some of our readers ( and Intel ) pointed out , the story does n't just end at needing four FB - DIMMs .
The rank of the FB - DIMMs can impact performance as well , and ideally each of your FB - DIMM modules would be dual rank modules .
The rank of a DIMM is determined by dividing the width of all of the devices on the module by the width of the module itself .
For example , a single rank FB - DIMM would have 9 DDR2 devices each being 8 - bits wide .
A dual rank FB - DIMM would be composed of 18 DDR2 devices , each still being 8 - bits wide .
All of our 512MB FB - DIMMs are single rank modules , while our 1GB and 2GB modules are dual rank .
The story does n't end with rank though .
Because of the dedicated read and write lanes between the memory controller and the AMBs on FB - DIMMs , you can be reading from one FB - DIMM while writing to another .
So in theory , if you 're running an application ( or combination of applications ) that have a lot of concurrent reads and writes going on you could stand to benefit from having more than one FB - DIMM per channel .
Based on all of the above information , it would seem like your best bet is to stick as many dual rank FB - DIMMs as you can afford in your system , and if that were the case then we'd be able to move on from here .
Unfortunately it 's not , because as we mentioned in previous articles , the more FB - DIMMs you have in your system , the higher access latencies will be to those additional FB - DIMMs .
What we then end up with is a tradeoff between more bandwidth and higher latency , so which route do you take ?
We 've done a lot of testing and most of our tests seem to favor the four dual - rank FB - DIMM module configuration , but the number / configuration of modules really depends on your particular needs .
We 're still testing to figure out what the tangible real world performance differences are between the multitude of memory configurations , but for now just know that if you need maximum bandwidth you 'll want 8 dual rank FB - DIMMs , but if you want lower latency you 'll want fewer modules .
Whether or not you 'll see a performance difference will depend mostly on the application ( s ) you 're running .

Presenter , Trust me I 'm an economist , BBC Two
Have you ever been made an offer you felt you could n't afford to refuse ?
Most of us have had the experience of buying a mobile phone or hiring a car on holiday , to find that suddenly the friendly assistant is talking about frightening risks and offering to protect us from them .
Before we drive our hire cars onto the dangerous foreign streets , we are warned about the excess of 900 euros if something goes wrong .
For just 10 euros a day , we can make that worry vanish .
But before you sign up for your peace of mind , stop and think : economists think you might be making a classic error .
Unfair price
When should you pay over the odds for insurance ?
If you can bring yourself to keep cool about little risks , you should insure only the big risks
Tim Harford
If you pay 10 euros a day to protect yourself from a 900 euro excess , then that 's fair if you crash into something every 90 days .
Of course , if your driving is that bad or the roads are that dangerous , you should probably walk instead .
Even if you crash your car once a year or so , you would be paying four times more than was fair for your car hire insurance .
Whether you should do that or not depends on how frightened you are of risk .
Small risk
Most of us worry too much about little risks like losing a cheap mobile phone .
One of the major phone companies will insure a cheap mobile phone for 92 pence a week , about £ 50 a year .
The phone itself will cost £ 50 to replace .
That is a typical price , but despite all the headlines about mobile phone theft , most phones live peaceful lives and die of old age .
The fair price for the insurance is probably closer to £ 5 a year .
Fair price
What is more , most of the people who buy the phone insurance could afford to replace a £ 50 phone without having to starve .
We are buying protection from a risk that we can afford to take , and we are buying it at an incredibly high price .
You could take the money you would have spent on extra insurance for your washing machine , mobile phone and rental car and put it into a savings account .
For such small risks and such overpriced insurance , it is very likely that the savings account will contain enough money to pay for the occasional phone that falls down the lavatory .
In effect , you are insuring yourself , and at a fair price too .
Taoism in economics
It can make sense to pay for insurance , even overpriced insurance , to protect yourself from a big risk : your house burning down , or you becoming ill and unable to work for years .
For that kind of risk , there is no way your savings account will ever be big enough .
But that is what insurance is designed for : risks that you cannot afford to take , not risks that you can .
If you can bring yourself to keep cool about little risks , you should insure only the big risks , such as your house burning down .
( What counts as a big risk , of course , depends on how rich you are . )
As for the mobile phone in the lavatory , you will simply have to tell yourself that in the big scheme of things , it is not that important .
That is the closest that economics will ever come to Taoism .
The big picture
The strange thing is , I only know two other people who actually behave like this - not taking insurance on little risks ..
Both of them are wealthy economists .
Why will the practice never catch on ?
Economic psychologists have researched how we respond to risk , and discovered that we find it impossible to put our losses into context .
I should recognise that the value of my home fluctuates every hour by more than the value of the mobile phone I am so worried about losing .
It will not be the house price , but the theft of the phone that upsets me .
And it is the risk of being upset that mobile phone companies will remind me about next time I am in one of their shops .

The Zune hype is making me dizzy .
If you ’ve been following our Zune coverage here at Medialoper you probably know that we had pretty low expectations for the Zune .
As unlikely as it may seem , I think the Zune launch may have actually turned out worse than we expected .
Here ’s a round - up of some of the Zune “ highlights ” from the past few days :
All in all that ’s not bad for a couple of days on the market .
How much worse could things possibly get for the Zune ?
The very first 1040 Federal Income Tax form from 1913 appears above ( click to enlarge ) .
Notice that :
1 . Taxes were only paid on income above $ 20,000 , equivalent to $ 407,000 in today 's dollars , at the initial rate of only 1 % .
( Correction : Income taxes in 1913 were actually assessed on income above the personal exemption of $ 3,000 , equivalent to $ 61,000 today ) .
2 . The highest marginal tax rate in 1913 was 6 % , which applied to income above $ 500,000 , equivalent in today 's dollars to about $ 10 million .
The entire 1040 tax form in 1913 , including all forms and instructions , was only 4 pages ,

All instructions in 1913 were contained on a single page , compared to the

Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac .
~ Henry A. Kissinger
Things are starting to get interesting .
Global markets , puffed up by the Feds ’ loose fiscal policy , took a nosedive the other day , sending ripples of fear through investors .
The mortgage industry , after years of irresponsible lending practices , is being wheeled to intensive care .
Our troop " surge " in Iraq is producing an all - too predictable wave of violence , and our soldiers in Afghanistan are bracing for a brutal summer offensive by the Taliban .
The casual observer could be excused for wondering if anyone is steering this ship .
And if so , do they have a plan ?
Is there a method to this madness ?
The answers to these questions can be found , in my opinion , by examining the needs and wants of our ruling class .
Any honest analysis of history reveals one sober axiom :
All statist political systems exist primarily to perpetuate the power and privilege of the elites who control the system .
This axiom is true even for those systems that claim to oppose class - based privilege .
It has long been noted , for instance , that socialism is a failure because it " does n’t work . "
While that may be true , it fails to account for the cold reality hiding behind the façade of socialist ideology .
In truth , socialism " works " perfectly well for those who control the levers of political power .
As was the case in the Soviet Union ( and in our own statist , mixed economy ) the governing elites who possess inside access to decision - making authority do quite well .
They enjoy a guaranteed income stream , superior health care services , and a cornucopia of luxuries unavailable to the average citizen .
The key ( for the elites ) is to find a way to keep the scam rolling despite the negative effects of their own depredations , lest they " kill the goose that lays the golden egg . "
The ultimate end - game of such systems is portrayed beautifully in Mel Gibson ’s recent movie , Apocalypto .
The Mayan Empire depicted in that movie faces a series of social , political , and economic crises that its governing class is at a loss to address , because the disasters stalking it are the creation of the very corrupt forces on which the rulers depend to perpetuate their rule .
In their desperation to maintain control in the face of mounting crises , the king and his feathered priests resort to the crudest method imaginable : human sacrifice .
They gather the masses around a grand step pyramid and treat them to endless , demagogic harangues about the glory of the Mayan people , the invincibility of the empire , and the utopia that lies just around the next corner .
The priests proceed to brutally kill innocent people in order to demonstrate their special relationship with the gods ( and to send a thinly - veiled message to any dissenters in the audience ) .
Their argument is crude but effective :
Only through such sacrifices — which conveniently must be mediated by the rulers — can the crisis be solved and the glories of yester - year return .
In a disturbing historical parallel , the depredations of our own ruling class are eroding the foundations of our society .
Our massive , unsustainable deficit spending , our geometrically expanding regimen of stifling regulations , and our never - ending series of military misadventures are slowly but inexorably grinding toward a destructive climax .
Our rulers are unable to address these problems because doing so would undermine the very privileges they seek to perpetuate .
Thus , they have resorted to a variety of morally bankrupt strategies not unlike those of the Mayans .
This is , in my opinion , the ultimate truth behind our " war on terror . "
Unfortunately for our ruling class , the current emperor is singularly inept .
The military adventure in Iraq has the potential to backfire badly .
Rather than perpetuating the rule of our elites , this war may well fatally undermine it .
President Bush and his dark retinue of feathered priests have , through a series of misjudgments and tactical errors , run the empire into a ditch in Mesopotamia .
The president cannot go forward , and he can not go back .
He cannot win ( and , from the elite ’s perspective , he must not lose ) .
The Iraq war can not be won because the objective was impossible from the start .
America cannot " bring democracy " to Iraq through force of arms .
To make matters worse , the war has badly sullied America ’s reputation .
Most of the world is disgusted by the war ’s destructiveness , and much of our own population has become dimly aware of the underhanded methods used to promote it .
The only way America could win the Iraq War would be the Roman way , which would mean killing most of the Iraqi population and destroying most of the nation ’s infrastructure .
Having done that , we could then crawl atop the smoking ruins and proclaim our " victory " to the world .
Unfortunately , such a strategy would utterly discredit the empire and thus undermine the central purpose of the war ( i.e. it would imperil the power and privilege of our elites ) .
But while victory is not an option , the empire ca n’t leave either .
Empires rule through force and threats .
For the threats to be credible , the force must be effective .
What would our enemies think if we " turned tail " and left Iraq ?
Would they not sense weakness ?
Would they not assume that America is a paper tiger ?
Would they not pursue policies at our expense that would , in turn , threaten the power and prosperity of our elites ?
This must not be allowed to happen at any cost .
To further complicate matters , a withdrawal would not only send a dangerous message to our enemies , it would send an equally dangerous message to our friends .
All across the world , America has cultivated a network of kings , dictators , and thugs who depend on the empire ’s gold and lead for their continued rule .
These satraps are now standing with their own feathered priests atop their own step pyramids and carefully watching what we do .
If we " bug out " and leave our Iraqi puppets swinging from the lamp posts , what will these allies think ?
Might they not doubt our value as patrons ?
Might they not begin to make alternate arrangements ?
This would , in turn , threaten the power and privilege of our elites .
This " Catch - 22 " is , I believe , behind the curious paralysis demonstrated by the Democrats in responding to this war .
The Democratic Party is , at its highest levels , very much a part of our elite class .
They stand to lose as much from this debacle as the cronies surrounding President Bush .
Senator Clinton ’s tortured approach to the Iraq War is a perfect example of this phenomenon .
She voted for the war and , in its early stages , enthusiastically supported it .
Since then , she has changed her position numerous times and has criticized the war without ever actually doing anything to stop it .
This erratic behavior is , I believe , a consequence of her ambition .
She does not despise the corruptive power of the imperial presidency , she covets it .
She realizes , at some deep , dark level of her psyche , that our defeat in Iraq and the humiliation of President Bush would have devastating consequences both for the American imperial project and for the office of the emperor itself .
That is very bad news for someone who wants to be the emperor .
But the plebeians are becoming restless .
They are starting to ask uncomfortable questions .
Why are we in Iraq ?
What happened to the WMDs ?
Why are the military contractors all driving Bentleys ?
The perilous situation in which President Bush finds himself is thus striking fear into the entire bipartisan ruling class .
However much they may dislike Bush , his fate is inexorably entwined with theirs .
As I see it , only two things could rescue the imperial project from Bush ’s ineptitude :
The first is another war .
The theory is quite simple .
In times of war , the American people " rally ’round the president . "
Old sins are forgiven .
The government is given a green light to further restrict civil liberties , to go further into debt , and to enact more controls over the economy .
Dissent is suppressed and the governing elites once again become the object of popular adulation .
Thus , giving the wheel of war yet another spin is a tempting strategy , and Iran is an inviting target .
Unfortunately , there are some risks involved .
America is on the verge of bankruptcy , a process that will be hastened by an additional war .
The people are already frustrated by our stalemates in Afghanistan and Iraq ( actually , calling them " stalemates " is a bit generous ) , and even our allies are expressing dissatisfaction with our aggressive foreign policy .
While a glorious victory in Persia could help transform our rulers from goats to golden boys , another failure would be catastrophic .
A Shiite offensive in Iraq and a calamitous spike in the price of oil are but a few of the potential pitfalls .
While the masses may love a winner , they despise a loser ( just ask Czar Nicholas II or Benito Mussolini ) .
If our ruling elites have their wits about them , they wo n’t allow the president to exercise this option .
There are simply too many things that could go wrong .
Nevertheless , depending on how powerful Bush ’s neocon Svengalis really are , the possibility should n’t be written off entirely
The second thing that could save the imperial project is another mass - casualty terrorist attack .
Let me first note that I doubt our rulers would actually stage a terror attack ( if for no other reason than the risks and consequences of discovery would be enormous ) .
However , if one should happen to occur , it would benefit our rulers immensely .
Before 9/11 , the neocons were openly daydreaming about the positive effects of " another Pearl Harbor . "
They claimed such an attack would , at long last , focus the American people on foreign policy and prompt aggressive action against " our enemies . "
A replay of 9/11 might well infuriate the American people enough to allow the government to " take the gloves off " in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Our rulers might also regain their status as the objects of anxious hope and comfort for the frightened masses .
This could lead to more emergency diktats , more deficit spending , more no - bid contracts , and a more aggressive prosecution of the war on terror .
In the ensuing violence , our ruling elite would probably emerge in a more secure position .
On the other hand , there are risks involved .
If an attack succeeded , government officials might be blamed for incompetence ( something they somehow avoided after the first 9/11 ) .
Also , rather than fury , the American people might react in the opposite way .
Like the Spaniards after the Madrid bombings , they might begin to ask hard questions about the value of our interventionist foreign policy .
While these are very real possibilities , I believe they are unlikely .
The American people are very different from the Europeans .
My guess is that Americans would be baying for blood .
There is , of course , a third option available to our ruling elites .
They could reconstitute our republic .
They could withdraw our troops from foreign lands and announce a new policy of noninterventionism .
They could drastically downsize our government , repeal laws that suppress civil liberties , and reinstitute states ’ rights .
This strategy would get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan , rebalance our budget , and remove the policies that have stirred much of the Muslim world against us .
Despite the obvious advantages , this idea is a non-starter .
The reason it is a non-starter can be found in my original assertion :
All statist political systems exist primarily to perpetuate the power and privilege of the elites who control the system .
A policy that drastically downsized the federal government and ended our imperial foreign policy would have a dramatic , negative effect on our ruling elites .
As members of a class that controls the world ’s dominant nation , they live as Olympians .
They wield power on a scale undreamed of by Moguls or pharaohs .
The fame , the wealth , and the sex are just too seductive for them to ever contemplate " throwing it all away . "
Why would they willingly abandon the one thing that our entire political system exists to perpetuate ?
Who , having worn the laurels of Caesar , would ever consent to being a mere Cincinnatus ?
Even the remote possibility of reconstituting our republic strikes dread into our rulers ’ hearts .
It is the one thing to which they will never voluntarily consent .
Anything — even starting another war or enduring a nuclear terror attack — would be preferable .
Thus , like Cassandra , we libertarians are fated to watch as the tragedy unfolds .
Those who have the power to stop it , lack the will ( or even the desire ) … and those who have the will , lack the power .
The Best of Steven LaTulippe
May 1 , 2007  -- Samuel Stupp has a bunch of mice that used to drag their hind legs behind them when they crawled around his Illinois lab , but they have miraculously regained at least partial use of their rear legs .
Astonishingly , their severed spinal cords have been repaired , at least partly , without surgery or drugs .
All it took was a simple injection of a liquid containing tiny molecular structures developed by Stupp and his colleagues at Northwestern University .
Six weeks later , the mice were able to walk again .
They do n't have their former agility , but their injuries should have left them paralyzed for life .
Stupp is on the cutting edge of one of the most exciting fields in medical research : regenerative medicine .
If he and others in the field are on the right track , one of these days tragic diseases like Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's will be a thing of the past .
And the crippled will walk again as the human body repairs itself in ways that it cannot do today .
Preliminary results with lab animals have been encouraging , but what works for mice and rats frequently does not work for humans .
But if it does , medicine will enter a new era .
Solution : Think Small
Stupp 's team concentrates on combining the incredibly small world of nanotechnology with biology , creating molecules that self - assemble into large molecular structures that can literally " hug " around cells in the human body .
That allows them to take charge of key cells present in the body and dictate how they will perform , or , in the case of stem cells , what they will become .
That 's a slightly different approach than others in the field are following .
Researchers at the University of Michigan , for example , are making " nano particles " that are thousands of times smaller than a single cell .
They are small enough to slip through tiny openings in a cell , potentially delivering cancer - killing drugs directly to a damaged cell .
James R. Baker , who runs the university 's nanotechnology institute , calls it the " nanotechnology equivalent of a Trojan horse . "
Compared to Baker 's horse , Stupp 's molecular structures are huge , although still too small to be seen with the unaided eye .
' Glial ' Cells Key to the Nervous System
The mice in Stupp 's lab can move about better these days because the designer molecules attacked the precise reason why a spinal cord is unable to heal itself .
When the cord is severed , glial cells in the body create a scar called a " glial scar . "
" The scar appears within weeks after the injury and this basically paralyzes the patient forever , " Stupp said .
" The scar is like a physical blockade that prevents axons from regenerating and growing . "
Axons are fibers that extend out from nerve cells and attach to other cells , thus allowing the brain to command the body to carry out its functions , like moving its legs .
Stem cells present in the body that have not yet developed into a specialized cell should be able to differentiate into new neurons , thus making regeneration possible , but often the stem cells become glial cells instead , making recovery that much more difficult by reinforcing the " blockade . "
A couple of years ago , Stupp said , his team discovered that it could pack its nanostructure with a biological signal that commands the stem cells to turn into neurons , not glial cells .
The same signal , he said , orders the axons to grow .
And that 's just what Stupp and his colleagues found when they dissected the damaged spinal column in some of the mice .
" We see regenerated axons across the lesion , " he said .
" That 's the exciting part .
Regeneration of axons across the lesion is very significant . "
No Drugs , No Surgery
What it means is that the spinal column is , indeed , healing itself , and without the aid of drugs .
But what happens to those nanostructures after they 've done their work ?
One of the concerns in the field of nanotechnology is that scientists might create tiny machines that could be used for great mischief .
They might make manufacturing so cheap , for example , that any country could afford to become a military superpower .
There is no chance of anything evil coming out of this , Stupp said .
" These nanostructures are completely biodegradable , " Stupp said .
" They disappear within weeks . "
So they do their work and go away .
Stupp is now expanding his research into Parkinson 's disease .
" It 's just the very beginning , so this is extremely early , " he said .
" We are introducing these nanostructures in the brain of mice that have Parkinson 's disease .
We have seen very interesting functional recovery . "
In the end , it might turn out that Stupp 's work is only part of the solution .
Like his associates at the University of Michigan , he might find that his nanostructures make great drug delivery systems .
Certain solutions may require the introduction of stem cells , he said , so that controversy is n't likely to go away .
But maybe a marriage between nanotechnology and traditional medical procedures might be just the ticket .
" What might really work is the integration of the two , " he said .
Stupp 's results are encouraging , although very preliminary .
But he is so convinced that he's on the right track that he recently unveiled his mice , and their partial recovery , during a meeting in Washington of the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies .
The project is a public interest program sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Pew Charitable Trusts .
The mice are not pretty to watch .
They still struggle to walk , sometimes dragging one foot .
So it 's a partial victory at this point .
But it 's a significant milestone in a field that is in its infancy .
The firm predicts that before April , there will be 30,000 personal insolvencies in the UK .
It blames the increasing trend on greater borrowing and spending , higher interest rates and big utility bills .
The firm says 2006 will have seen more than 100,000 personal insolvencies .
It says there will be even more in 2007 .
" Last year , during the period straight after Christmas , when most bills started to hit the doormat , we witnessed the highest ever amount of people going into personal insolvency , " said Mike Gerrard of Grant Thornton .
" We regularly see people , especially over Christmas and with the start of the sales , add to their problems in quite a substantial way .
" This year , things could be even worse . "
IVAs
Last year , there was a 55 % rise in the number of people being forced by the burden of their debts to declare themselves insolvent .
HOW TO GO BUST Bankruptcy : the traditional way of escaping overwhelming debt .
Ends after one year , but you are likely to lose all your assets including your house to pay something to the creditors IVA : A deal between you and your creditors , overseen by an insolvency practitioner .
Less stigma , less chance of losing your home , but involves paying some of your debts in one go or over a number of years
Q&A Personal insolvencies
In the first nine months of the year alone , this happened to 75,000 people in England and Wales .
The rise was largely due to a big increase in the number of people entering a process called an Individual Voluntary Arrangement ( IVA ) , which is a formal alternative to bankruptcy .
The use of this procedure has apparently been encouraged by widespread advertising from specialist insolvency and debt advisory firms .
In turn , this has been blamed by the High Street banks for forcing them to write off several billion pounds in loans and credit card debts during the past year .
Some experts have predicted that 2007 will see IVAs become even more commonplace than bankruptcy .
Sarah Miller , a spokeswoman at Citizens Advice , said : " We do see evidence of a Christmas debt hangover , and this month we expect to exceed the 140,000 debt problems that Citizens Advice bureaux dealt with in January 2006 . "
Vista 's EULA Product Activation Worries
Mark Rasch looks at the license agreement for Windows Vista and how its product activation component , which can disable operation of the computer , may be like walking on thin ice .
 Does the Microsoft EULA adequately tell you what will happen if you dont activate the product or if you cant establish that it is genuine ?
Well , not exactly .
It does tell you that some parts of the product wont work - but it also ambiguously says that the product itself wont work .
Moreover , it allows Microsoft , through fine print in a generally unread and non negotiable agreement , to create an opportunity for economic extortion . 
The terms of Microsofts End User License Agreement ( EULA ) for its upcoming Vista operating system raises the conflict between two fundamental principles of contract law .
The first , and more familiar , is that parties to a contract can generally agree to just about anything , as long as what they agree to doesnt violate the law and isnt unconscionable .
The second principle is that the law generally disfavors the remedy of  self - help . 
That is to say that , if there is a violation of the terms of a contract , you usually have to go to court , prove the violation , and then you are entitled to damages or other relief .
The terms of the Vista EULA , like the current EULA related to the  Windows Genuine Advantage ,  allows Microsoft to unilaterally decide that you have breached the terms of the agreement , and they can essentially disable the software , and possibly deny you access to critical files on your computer without benefit of proof , hearing , testimony or judicial intervention .
In fact , if Microsoft is wrong , and your software is , in fact , properly licensed , you probably will be forced to buy a license to another copy of the operating system from Microsoft just to be able to get access to your files , and then you can sue Microsoft for the original license fee .
Even then , you wont be able to get any damages from Microsoft , and may not even be able to get the cost of the first license back .
Product activiation in the Vista license
Suppose you buy a new computer after January 2007 , or purchase an early upgrade for one of the various flavors of Vista .
The first problem is , you may think you bought a copy of the operating system .
Actually , the OS is still owned by Microsoft .
You may own a physical DVD , but what you have bought is the right to use the software subject to any of the terms and conditions of the End User License Agreement ( EULA ) , which you may or may not have access to at the time you buy the computer or disk .
Typically , the EULA will be contained in micro-print on the outside of a DVD , or may be on a splash screen that prompts you to unequivocally declare ,  I agree .. as a condition precedent to installing or booting the software .
Courts have pretty much established that this manner of acquiescence is okay , provided that there is some way for you to get your money back if you dont agree to the EULA .
The Vista EULA informs the licensee that Vista will automatically send information about the version , language and product key of the software , the user 's Internet protocol address of the device , and information derived from the hardware configuration of the device .
Although I have an amused tolerance for books like The Total Woman , I am not entirely incapable of good , old - fashioned feminist rage .
The notion that even educated middle - class American women had to put out in order to get a damn refrigerator — even that they might " yearn " for one — just steams me .
However , I would not advise against using sex for more subtle marital adjustments , of a type described in The Sex - Starved Marriage .
Davis reminds women that one of the more effective ways to get a husband to be more considerate and helpful is to seduce him .
She counsels a group of female clients who complain of angry , critical husbands to " pay more attention to their physical relationships with their husbands , " to " be sexier , more affectionate , attentive , responsive , and passionate . "
Darned if the old bag of tricks does n't work like a charm — the ladies arrive at the next therapy session giggling and thrilled with their new powers .
To many contemporary women , however , the notion that sex might have any function other than personal fulfillment ( and the occasional bit of carefully scheduled baby making ) is a violation of the very tenets of the sexual revolution that so deeply shaped their attitudes on such matters .
Under these conditions , pity the poor married man hoping to get a bit of comfort from the wife at day 's end .
He must somehow seduce a woman who is economically independent of him , bone tired , philosophically disinclined to have sex unless she is jolly well in the mood , numbingly familiar with his every sexual maneuver , and still doing a slow burn over his failure to wipe down the countertops and fold the dish towel after cooking the kids ' dinner .
He can hardly be blamed for opting instead to check his e-mail , catch a few minutes of SportsCenter , and call it a night .
A final , less quantifiable development has served to snuff out marital sexuality , and it has to do with the way middle - and upper - middle - class adults think about family life and their role in it .
There are many indications of this , but let us simply glance at the Disney catalogue .
Not surprisingly , in addition to toys and figurines the catalogue features Disney - themed clothing : bathrobes with Winnie the Pooh appliqués , stretch knit pants with a small Mickey Mouse at the hem , quilted " Magic Winter Jackets " featuring a choice of Eeyore , Mickey , or Pooh .
Here 's the problem : all these items are for adults .
In fact , I was horrified to discover that it would have been possible for my husband and me to spend last Halloween trick - or - treating in matching Tweedledum and Tweedledee costumes — a pretty far cry from Marabel Morgan 's idea of a good costume .
For many couples child - rearing has become not merely one aspect of marriage but its entire purpose and function .
Spouses regard each other not as principally lovers and companions but as sharers of the great , unending burden of taking care of the children .
And make no mistake about it : American middle - class families have made child - rearing a dauntingly complex enterprise .
My children are still very small , but it has been made abundantly clear to me by friends and acquaintances that I had better get in the market for an SUV or a minivan , because I am soon enough going to be shuttling the children and their friends to a bewildering series of soccer games , soccer parties , soccer tournaments .
Already I throw birthday parties with guest lists and budgets that approximate those of a wedding - rehearsal dinner .
The curious thing about this labor - intensive variety of parenting is that it has arisen now , when parents — and specifically mothers — have less time to devote to their children than ever before .
One can't help finding in these developments a frantic attempt at compensation for the hours some professional - class mothers spend away from their children .
Mothering , which used to be a rather private affair ( requiring , principally , a playpen , a back yard , a television set , and a coffeepot ) , has now adopted a very public dimension .
Why , of course Sarah So-and - So is a good mother : little Andrew is at Gymboree , Music Rhapsody , Bright Child , and Fit for Kids every week !
All of domestic life now turns on the entertainment and happiness not of the adults but of the children .
At vacation time my husband and I do n't drag our little boys through the Louvre , as I was dragged at a tender age ( because my parents wanted to see it , and it would never have occurred to them to consult their children about where to go on holiday ) .
Rather , we check into hotels with elaborate children 's pools and nightly fireworks and huge duck ponds .
It 's all very jolly , but it is entirely possible , I suppose , that some parents will overidentify with the whole thing , will forget that they are in fact the adults and not the children .
And if your conception of yourself is as a great big eight - year - old , you 're not very likely to have sex on your mind come the end of the day .
His nickname is Darwin's Rottweiler and he earned it - and a reputation that spans the globe - with his pugnacious defence of the theory of evolution .
But Professor Richard Dawkins ' strident views , and the way with which they are delivered , came under surprise attack yesterday from an equally eminent scientist , though one better known for his more avuncular style .
Lord Winston condemned Prof Dawkins for what he called his " patronising " and " insulting " attitude to religious faith , and argued that he and others like him were in danger of damaging the public 's trust in science .
He particularly objected to Prof Dawkins ' latest book , The God Delusion , which is an outright attack on religion .
" I find the title of ' The God Delusion ' rather insulting , " said Lord Winston , " I have a huge respect for Richard Dawkins but I think it is very patronising to call a serious book about other peoples ' views of the universe and everything a delusion .
I do n't think that is helpful and I think it portrays science in a bad light . "
Lord Winston , an IVF pioneer well known as the presenter of science documentaries such as The Human Body , Superhuman and Human Instinct , will argue for a more conciliatory approach to religion in a public lecture at the University of Dundee tonight .
Entitled The Science Delusion , it is part of the university 's Greatest Minds lecture series .
" The reason I 've called it the Science Delusion is because I think there is a body of scientific opinion from my scientific colleagues who seem to believe that science is the absolute truth and that religious and spiritual values are to be discounted , " said Lord Winston .
" Some people , both scientists and religious people , deal with uncertainty by being certain .
That is dangerous in the fundamentalists and it is dangerous in the fundamentalist scientists . "
Lord Winston , who is a practising Jew , said the tone adopted by Prof Dawkins and others was counterproductive .
" Unfortunately the neo-Darwinists , and I do n't just mean Dawkins , I mean [ the philosopher ] Daniel Dennett in particular and [ neuroscientist ]
Steven Pinker are extremely arrogant .
I think scientific arrogance really does give a great degree of distrust .
I think people begin to think that scientists like to believe that they can run the universe .
He added : " I have a huge admiration for Richard Dawkins .
But I 'm not sure that his way of approaching his view of the universe is wise .
Dawkins is not an arrogant man , but I think he does portray certainty in a way that sometimes sounds arrogant " .
Prof Dawkins declined to comment on Lord Winston 's criticisms until he had seen the full text of the lecture .
However , Prof Dennett at Tufts University in the US , said , the dangers of religion had been " swept under the rug " for centuries and needed to be exposed .
" [ I ] think it is time to risk offence and not mince words .
Let 's find out just how good , or bad , religion actually is , " he said .
The philosopher AC Grayling at Birkbeck College , London , dismissed Lord Winston 's arguments as " tiresome guff " .
" Belief in supernatural entities in the universe ... is false , and in the light of increasing scientific knowledge about nature has definitely come to be delusional , " he said .
Religious divide :
Richard Dawkins
The Oxford evolutionary biologist asserts that belief in God is irrational and profoundly harmful to society .
In The God Delusion , the bestseller published last year , he concluded that religion is a useless , and sometimes dangerous , evolutionary accident .
" I am hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches scientific enterprise .
It teaches us not to change our minds , and not to want to know exciting things that are available to be known . "
Sam Harris
Author of the anti-theistic bestsellers The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation .
He wrote last year : " Most scientists are keeping silent when they should be blasting the hideous fantasies of a prior age with all the facts at their disposal . "
Steven Weinberg
The physicist , Nobel laureate and prominent public spokesman for science has warned that " the world needs to wake up from its long nightmare of religious belief " .
Last year he argued : " Anything scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done and may in the end be our greatest contribution to civilisation . "
Daniel Dennett
The philosopher last year published Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon , which has helped to push the discussion into the public arena .
Dennett believes that within 25 years religion will command little of the awe it seems to command presently but insists that he wants to engage religious readers in a rational discussion , not turn them away .
Edward O Wilson
An evolutionary biologist who last year made US headlines following the publication of his book , The Creation : An Appeal to Save Life on Earth .
In it he implores America 's religious right to join with science to save the planet .

A leading Indian technology college is switching off internet access to try and get its students involved in a bit of real - world socialising .
The Indian Institute of Technology ( IIT ) in Mumbai ( Bombay ) will turn off hostel students ' free internet access from 11 pm until 12.30 pm .
Authorities hope the decision will get students talking to each other again .
Mumbai has 13 undergraduate hostels .
Dean of student affairs Prakash Gopalan told Reuters :
" The old hostel culture of camaraderie and socialising among students is gone .
This is not healthy in our opinion . "
Gopalan said there had been a decline in academic performance as well as other activities like sport , cultural events , and general socialising .
The dean said students in hostels did not even know the person two doors away from them .
University authorities hope the ban will lead to earlier nights for some students as well as more chit-chat .
All night internet access is being blamed for poor attendance at morning lectures as well as creating a generation of friendless students .
There are seven IITs across India and their alumni include many of the country 's most famous entrepreneurs and engineers .
Comments on student blogs make the obvious point that there are other reasons for students to stay up late and sleep through lectures than the internet .
Others complained that regulation was the wrong way to tackle the problem , and one noted that a similar policy at IIT Madras led to students downloading films and watching them until internet access was restored .

This girl right here is one of the best kind of girl you can find , she ’s a good friend , she ’s caring , she ’s sometimes to selfless , and so much more .
She ’s mad crazy and goofy though so if your not into people like that stay away lol , but if you are maybe Alanys will test your limits for weirdness is , but around certain people she might be too shy to bring out her weirdness .
If you fall in love keep her , trust me it ’s worth it , but if some shit happens do n’t go back to her , because Alanys will put you in a fucking world of hurt .
Might as well just stay as friends and she ’ll be there forever
The following remarks were delivered by Bernie Sanders to the National Conference for Media Reform .
Sanders is the junior United States Senator from Vermont .
He is an independent , but caucuses with the Democrats .
Amy Goodman describes Sanders ’ speech as an “ alternative State of the Union . ”
The full text to Sanders ’ speech can be found here .
Video of his presentation can be found here .
Here are excerpts of Sanders ’ speech to the NCMR in Memphis :
[ W]e will not succeed unless you are there , unless there is a strong grassroots media , which demands fundamental changes in media today and the end of corporate control over our media .
We ’ve got to work together on that .
Now , you are going to hear from a lot of folks who know more about the details of the media than I do , but what I do know a lot about is how media impacts the political process , what media means for those of us who day after day struggle with the major issues facing our country and a goal of trying to improve the quality of life for all of our people .
And I want to spend just a minute in telling you what I suspect most of you already know .
If you are concerned , as been said , about healthcare , if you are concerned about foreign policy and Iraq , if you are concerned about the economy , if you are concerned about global warming , you are kidding yourselves if you are not concerned about corporate control over the media , because every one of these issues is directly controlled and directly relevant to the media .
In terms of the war in Iraq , the American media failed , and failed grotesquely , in exposing the dishonest and misleading assertions of the Bush administration in the lead - up to that war , and they are as responsible as is President Bush for the disaster that now befalls us . . .
. . .
If you were to ask me what the most significant untold story of our time is , in terms of domestic politics , I would tell you very simply that that story happens to be the collapse of the American middle class .
. . .
[ D] espite an explosion of technology , huge increase in worker productivity , tens of millions of our fellow Americans have seen a decline in their real wages and are working longer hours for lower wages .
In fact , what you probably do n’t know is that the working people in our country work longer hours than do the working people in any other industrialized nation on earth .
How did that happen ?
How did it happen today that a two - income family has less disposal income than a one - income family did thirty years ago ? . . .
Now , one might think that this is an interesting story .
One might think that globalization and disastrous trade policies , which have lowered the standard of living of millions of American workers , might be a story that should be covered .
. . .
Now , what is all of this about ?
What happens ?
If the reality of working people ’s lives are not reflected in the TV , in the newspapers , what happens ? . . .
People working long hours , people working for lower wages , they turn on the television set , they do not see that reality .
What they see is the issue is personal responsibility .
You ca n’t afford healthcare ?
You ’re losing your pension ?
Then the problem is with you .
Work a little bit harder .
It is not a systemic problem .
It is not a problem that can be solved by government .
It is not a problem which asked you to be involved in the political process .
You are the only person who can find a job that pays you a living wage .
That ’s your fault ! . . .
When we wake up in the morning and we brush our teeth , for better or worse , we see our own reflections in the mirror .
When we turn on the television , somebody is providing us a mirror to the world , and what we want is that mirror to reflect the reality of ordinary people and not the illusions of a few .
Talk about healthcare .
[ G ] o out on the street and ask people how many major countries in the world do not have a national healthcare program , which guarantees healthcare to all people .
And you know what ?
Most people do not know , because they have not seen it reflected in the media , that the United States of America is the only nation on earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all of its people .
They do not know about the healthcare systems in Scandinavia .
They do not know about European healthcare systems .
And the only thing they will hear about the Canadian healthcare system are the problems that that system has .
That ’s what they will hear . . .
In terms of the environment , if we are told over and over again that there is a serious scientific debate about the causation of global warming or whether global warming actually exists …
Well , you know what ?
There is no debate among the scientific community .
Now , here ’s an issue that I ’m sure you see on the TV almost every night — it probably bores you , you see it so much — and that is that the United States today has the most unfair distribution of wealth and income of any major country on earth .
I was joking .
You do n’t see that on television very often .
Now , here is at issue , you know , which is of enormous significance from an economic point of view , as well as a political point of view , as well as a moral point of view .
Richest 1 % of the population in America owns more wealth than the bottom 90 % .
Richest 13,000 families earn more income than do the bottom 20 million families .
In many ways , in my view , we are moving toward an oligarchic form of society .
Do you think that maybe this is an issue that should be thrown out there on the table ?
Do we think it ’s a good idea that so few have so much and so many have so little ?
But that is an issue that is beyond the scope of what establishment media is literally allowed to discuss .

( Try it with a sheet of paper ) The secret may be to use the sense of touch , rather than concentration .
" Most normal people cannot simultaneously draw a circle with one hand and a square with the other , " says David Rosenbaum , distinguished professor of psychology and director of Penn State 's Laboratory For Cognition and Action .
" It is a fundamental limitation that the nervous system seems to impose on the hands for reasons that are not fully understood .
" Rosenbaum thinks the key to the problem lies in the higher neural centers responsible for concentration on multiple tasks .
" When you perform one task , you conceptualize it as one , " he explains , “ but when you have two tasks to do at the same time that you ca n’t think of as one , it gets complicated because the mind has to shift attention back and forth from one task to the other .
" To test this idea , Rosenbaum and his Penn State colleagues , Amanda Dawson , a recent Ph.D. recipient , and John Challis , associate professor of kinesiology , set up an experiment in which participants could track moving objects with light touch and without having to concentrate on the tracking .
Volunteer participants who kept their eyes closed during the experiment tried to keep their hands in contact with two moving disks .
The participants could independently trace the paths of the disks , even when the disks moved in ways that are normally very hard for people to produce on their own .
For example , they could trace a square and a circle at the same time , which is normally impossible .
The disks were driven by moving magnets on the other size of an opaque pane of glass .
" If the person exerted little more than a feather touch on the disks , the magnets decoupled and the experiment came to a stop .
So the participants ’ hands were not simply being dragged along by the magnetic force on the disks , " explains Rosenbaum , whose findings appear in the November / December issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology .
Researchers say the test provides the strongest evidence yet that the reason most persons are unable to voluntarily multi-task with their two hands is that their mind gets in the way .
"
We created a situation where each hand simply reacts to the motion of the object being felt , so in effect we bypassed the high - level cognitive system .
The excellent performance displayed by our participants took no training whatsoever , " added Rosenbaum .
" Using haptics , we managed to get into the motor system through the backdoor .
" Researchers say the findings could benefit people with coordination problems , and that haptic tracking might help such persons learn to better control their irregular hand movements .

Mandy Sellars , 32 , from Lancashire , suffers from Proteus syndrome , a condition also thought to have affected the " Elephant Man " , Joseph Merrick .
Although she was born with abnormally large legs and feet - which continue to grow - her body is of average size .
Doctors may have to amputate in the future , but Ms Sellars says she wants to raise awareness before it happens .
Proteus Syndrome is only thought to affect about 120 people worldwide , which ensures Ms Sellars receives some stares in public .
I quite fancy having a go at snowboarding actually , maybe paragliding or white water rafting would be wonderful
Mandy Sellars
" I expect people to look - I think that 's quite inevitable because I would if I was in their position - but a smile can bring so much to one person , " she said .
She told the BBC of her relief at finally being diagnosed with the condition in May 2006 , which allowed her to meet other sufferers .
" I wanted to belong , " said Ms Sellars .
" I wanted to find other people that had the condition , and to be able to relate to them and them to relate to me and know what it 's like to live with this condition and how different it is . "
Mandy was born with oversized limbs
Proteus Syndrome is an extremely rare condition which involves atypical growth of the bones , skin , head and a variety of other symptoms .
The name comes from the Greek god Proteus who could change his form .
There is no known cure and if Ms Sellars limbs continue to grow - her feet are 16ins long while her legs are 35ins in diameter at the bottom and 28ins at the top - doctors say they will have to amputate .
" I have goals for when that does happen , " she added .
" Why not ?
It can be a different life .
It could be a more adventurous life .
Things I can't do now I might be able to do then .
" I quite fancy having a go at snowboarding actually , maybe paragliding or white water rafting would be wonderful , it really would .
So you never know - watch this space . "
There 's a new development from yesterday 's story on wholesale download pricing .
While the record labels are still unwilling to divulge their wholesale pricing structure for online music sales in UMG v. Lindor without strict confidentiality provisions , an attorney for UMG has told opposing counsel Ray Beckerman that the 70 ¢ per track figure is in the ballpark .
The revelation comes from an e-mail exchange between Richard Gabriel , counsel for UMG , and Marie Lindor 's attorney Ray Beckerman that occurred in December , but was just made public today .
In a December 19 , 2006 e-mail to Beckerman , Gabriel said that the wholesale prices paid to the labels by the likes of Apple , Real , Napster , and others are not uniform , but " cover a range , with 70 ¢ being in the correct range . "
The pricing information could be crucial for defendant Marie Lindor as she makes the argument that the $ 750 - per-song damages sought by the RIAA are excessive and unconstitutionally severe .
Lindor argues that the actual damages suffered by the RIAA are in line with the wholesale price per song , and if that is indeed the case , damages should be capped accordingly between $ 2.80 and $ 7.00 per song if infringement is proven .
A proposed order filed yesterday would force the recording industry to divulge closely - held details of their wholesale pricing arrangements .
The record labels are fighting Lindor 's attempts to gain access to the pricing information .
They have argued that it should n't be divulged , and if it is , it should only be done so under a protective order that would keep the data highly confidential .
The RIAA regards the wholesale price per song as a trade secret .
The pricing data really may not be all that secret .
Late in 2005 , former New York Attorney General ( and current Governor ) Eliot Spitzer launched an investigation into price fixing by the record labels , alleging collusion between the major labels in their dealings with the online music industry .
Gabriel believes that making the pricing information public would " implicate [ sic ] very real antitrust concerns " as the labels are not supposed to
Gabriel also calls the pricing information " highly proprietary , " saying that each plaintiff in the UMG v. Lindor case has engaged in independent negotiations with the download services .
As a result , " each of the record companies is aware only of its own pricing and does not know what the others charge , " wrote Gabriel .
Beckerman argues in a letter to the judge that the only reason the labels want to keep this information confidential is to " serve their strategic objectives for other cases , " which he says does not rise to the legal threshold necessary for a protective order .
The proposed order would force the labels to turn over contracts with their 12 largest customers .
Most details such as the identities of the parties would be kept confidential , but pricing information and volume would not .
I have read several posts over the last few weeks about one of the new features in Feisty which is “ command not found ” .
According to various sources if you type a command at the command prompt that is n’t found it will offer suggestions on it .
For example , at a terminal I type : tilda ( quake style terminal emulator ) .
If I did n’t have it installed , normally you ’d get a message saying “ command not found ” and that would be the end of it .
However , in Feisty if I type the same thing the result is :
The program ' tilda ' is currently not installed .
You can install it by typing :
sudo apt - get install tilda
Make sure you have the ' universe ' component enabled
bash : tilda : command not found
Very cool , however I thought it was n’t working as advertised .
You see , I typed in my first name at the command prompt : paul .
I got this as a result :
The program ' paul ' is currently not installed .
You can install it by typing :
sudo apt - get install paul
Make sure you have the ' universe ' component enabled
bash : paul : command not found
So I figured that it was just going to give me that same answer no matter what I typed and that it was n’t really considering what packages could be installed .
However , a quick look at Synaptic and sure enough there is a package named paul .
Here is the package description for paul :
Yet another image viewer ( displays PNG , TIFF , GIF , JPG , etc . )
paul = _ P_rogram zur _A_uswertung und _ U_mwandlung von _L_aserbildern
( for non German speakers : Program to evaluate and convert laser images ) .
Especially designed to work with gray scaled image sequences but may be
useful for any images .
Using of imlib gives great flexibility of
file formats and is fast .
Features : move images until they match ; cut images precisely ;
create clickable HTML maps ; 2D - FFT ; operations onto single image or
set of images
So , shame on me for thinking this new feature was bogus .
Turns out it really does know what packages are in the repository and what can be installed .
If you type in something that is completely unavailable you get a plain “ bash : command : command not found ” with no offer to install .
Refactoring Probability Distributions : part 1 , part 2 , part 3 , part 4 , part 5
Welcome to the 5th ( and final ) installment of Refactoring Probability Distributions !
Today , let 's begin with an example from Bayesian Filters for Location Estimation ( PDF ) , an excellent paper by Fox and colleagues .
In their example , we have a robot in a hallway with 3 doors .
Unfortunately , we do n't know where in the hallway the robot is located :
The vertical black lines are " particles . "
Each particle represents a possible location of our robot , chosen at random along the hallway .
At first , our particles are spread along the entire hallway ( the top row of black lines ) .
Each particle begins life with a weight of 100 % , represented by the height of the black line .
Now imagine that our robot has a " door sensor , " which currently tells us that we 're in front of a door .
This allows us to rule out any particle which is located between doors .
So we multiply the weight of each particle by 100 % ( if it 's in front of a door ) or 0 % ( if it 's between doors ) , which gives us the lower row of particles .
If our sensor was less accurate , we might use 90 % and 10 % , respectively .
What would this example look like in Haskell ?
We could build a giant list of particles ( with weights ) , but that would require us to do a lot of bookkeeping by hand .
Instead , we use a monad to hide all the details , allowing us to work with a single particle at a time .
localizeRobot :: WPS Int localizeRobot = do --
Pick a random starting location .
--
This will be our first particle .
pos1 <- uniform [ 0 .. 299 ] --
We know we 're at a door .
Particles -- in front of a door get a weight of -- 100 % , others get 0 % . if doorAtPosition pos1 then weight 1 else weight 0 -- ...
What happens if our robot drives forward ?
Driving down the hall
When our robot drives forward , we need to move our particles the same amount :
This time , we do n't detect a door , so we need to invert our blue line .
Once again , this allows us to filter our some particles .
In Haskell , we would write :
localizeRobot = do -- ... --
Drive forward a bit .
let pos2 = pos1 + 28 --
We know we 're not at a door .
if not ( doorAtPosition pos2 ) then weight 1 else weight 0 -- ...
The next time we move , things start to get really interesting :
We can rule out all but one clump of particles !
In Haskell :
localizeRobot = do -- ... --
Drive forward some more .
let pos3 = pos2 + 28 if doorAtPosition pos3 then weight 1 else weight 0 -- Our final hypothesis .
return pos3
And that 's it !
We can run our particle system as follows :
> runWPS ' localizeRobot 10 [ 97 , 109 , 93 ]
In this example , we run our particle system with 10 particles , 3 of which survive the whole way to the end .
These are clustered about 1 /3rd of the way down the hallway , giving us a pretty good idea of where we are .
Unweighted Particle System Monad
OK , so how does our monad work ?
This gets pretty technical , so you may want to review part 1 and part 2 before continuing .
Alternatively , you could just scroll down to the last section .
To begin with , let 's ignore the weights .
We can represent a particle system as function that maps an integer to a random list of particles :
newtype PS a = PS { runPS :: Int ->
Rand [ a ] }
The integer tells us how many particles to return :
> runRand ( runPS ( uniform [ 1 .. 10 ] ) 5 ) [ 3 , 2 , 9 , 5 , 10 ]
If we have a random value of type Rand a , we can build a particle system of type PS a by sampling that random value repeatedly .
Building on the code from part 2 , we get :
liftRand :: Rand a ->
PS a liftRand r = PS ( sample r )
Given a particle system of type PS a , and a function of type a -> b , we can construct a particle system of type PS b by running the particle system and applying our function to each particle :
instance Functor PS where fmap f ps = PS mapped where mapped n = liftM ( map f ) ( runPS ps n )
We also need to define the monadic return and >>= operators .
The former can be built from return operator for Rand :
instance Monad PS where return = liftRand .
return ps >>= f = joinPS ( fmap f ps )
As for the latter , it 's usually easiest to define >>= in terms of a join operation .
And join is where the magic happens --- we need to collapse a value of type PS ( PS a ) into a value of type PS a :
joinPS :: PS ( PS a ) -> PS a joinPS psps = PS ( joinPS ' psps ) joinPS ' :: PS ( PS a ) ->
Int ->
Rand [ a ] joinPS ' psps n = do pss <- ( runPS psps n ) xs <- sequence ( map sample1 pss ) return ( concat xs ) where sample1 ps = runPS ps 1
The code is a little tricky , but the basic idea is simple :
We run our outer particle system , producing n particles .
But each of these particles is itself a particle system , which we run to produce a single particle .
We then combine the n single - particle results into one result with n particles .
We also need to make our particle system a probability monad .
Again , we can do this by reusing code from Rand :
instance Dist PS where weighted = liftRand .
weighted
Note that this monad is n't ready for production use --- it 's still pretty slow , and it does n't give us any way to access our sensors .
Weighted Particle System Monad
The weighted version of the particle system is a bit easier .
We can just reuse PerhapsT , which transforms an existing monad into one with a per-element weight :
type WPS = PerhapsT PS
We also need to make WPS into a probability distribution :
instance Dist ( PerhapsT PS ) where weighted = PerhapsT . weighted .
map liftWeighted where liftWeighted ( x , w ) = ( Perhaps x 1 , w )
Next , we need a way to update the weight of a given particle .
Note that this is closely related to apply Prob from part 4 .
weight :: Prob -> WPS ( ) weight p = PerhapsT ( return ( Perhaps ( ) p ) )
Finally , we need a way run a weighted particle system :
runWPS wps n = runPS ( runPerhapsT wps ) n
In our example , we also use a wrapper function to clean up the output a bit :
runWPS ' wps n = ( runRand .
liftM catPossible ) ( runWPS wps n ) catPossible ( ph : phs ) | impossible ph = catPossible phs catPossible ( Perhaps x p : phs ) = x : ( catPossible phs ) catPossible [ ] = [ ]
You can download the latest version of this code using Darcs :
darcs get http://www.randomhacks.net/darcs/probability
In a more sophisticated implementation , we'd want to periodically resample our particles , discarding the ones with weights near zero , and increasing the number of particles near likely locations .
More cool stuff
Bayesian Filters for Location Estimation ( PDF ) is an excellent ( and very accessible ) overview of belief functions .
If you 're into robotics or probability , it 's definitely worth checking out .
As sigfpe points out , PerhapsT is closely related m-sets , which turn up a lot whenever you 're working with matrices .
In fact , you can build a monad from any measure space , including possibility and other models of beliefs .
Do n't miss sigfpe 's excellent articles on quantum mechanics .
He shows how to generalize the probability monad to support quantum amplitudes and mixed states .
Given all this cool stuff , I strongly suspect that monads are the Right Way to represent probability and beliefs in programming languages .

This year marks the 100th anniversary of George Orwell 's birth , and the writer who best explained the power of language on politics would be amazed what can be done with the Internet .
On February 17 a front page news analysis in the New York Times bylined by Patrick Tyler described the global anti-war protests as the emergence of " the second superpower " .
Tyler wrote : " ... the huge anti-war demonstrations around the world this weekend are reminders that there may still be two superpowers on the planet : the United States and world public opinion . "
This potent phrase spread rapidly .
Anti-war campaigners , peace groups and NGOs took to describing the global popular protest as " the second superpower " [ Greenpeace release ] .
And in less than a month , the phrase was being used by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .
[ Financial Times - reg req'd ] .
And a week ago , a Google search for the phrase would have shown the vigorous propagation of this ' meme ' .
Rub out the word
Then came this .
Entitled The Second Superpower Rears its Beautiful Head , by James F Moore , it was accompanied by a brand new blog .
The details need not detain us for very long , because the consequences of this piece are much more important than its anodyne contents .
It 's a plea for net users to organize themselves as a " superpower " , and represents a class of techno - utopian literature that John Perry Barlow has been promoting - the same sappy stuff , but not as well written - for the past ten years .
Only note how this example is sprinkled with trigger words for progressives , liberals and NPR listeners .
It concludes - if you can find your way through this mound of feel - good styrofoam peanuts - " we do not have to create a world where differences are resolved by war .
It is not our destiny to live in a world of destruction , tedium , and tragedy .
We will create a world of peace " .
In common with the genre , there 's no social or political context , although the author offers a single specific instruction that is very jarring in the surrounding blandness : we must co-operate with The World Bank .
Huh ?
It 's politics with the politics taken out : in short , it 's " revolution lite " .
Now here 's the important bit .
Look what the phrase " Second Superpower " produces on Google now .
Try it !.
Moore 's essay is right there at the top .
And not just first , but it already occupies all but three of the first thirty spots .
The bashful Moore writes : " It was nice of Dave Winer [ weblog tools vendor ] and Doc Searls [ advertising consultant ] to pick up on it , even if it 's not really ready for much exposure . "
No matter , Moore is an overnight A - list blogging superstar , at his very first attempt .
Although it took millions of people around the world to compel the Gray Lady to describe the anti-war movement as a " Second Superpower " , it took only a handful of webloggers to spin the alternative meaning to manufacture sufficient PageRank™ to flood Google with Moore 's alternative , neutered definition .
Indeed , if you were wearing your Google - goggles , and the search engine was your primary view of the world , you would have a hard time believing that the phrase " Second Superpower " ever meant anything else .
To all intents and purposes , the original meaning has been erased .
Obliterated , in just seven weeks .
You 're especially susceptible to this if you subscribe to the view that Google 's PageRank™ is " inherently democratic , " which is how Google , Inc. describes it .
And this Googlewash took just 42 days .
You are in a twisty maze of weblogs , all alike
All a strange coincidence , no doubt , but the picture darkens when you look at a parallel conversation taking place elsewhere , whose hyperlinks contributed to the redefinition , and help explain how this semantic ethnic - cleansing took place so quickly .
Moore 's subversion of the meaning of " Secondary Superpower " - his high PageRank™ from derives from followers of ' A - list ' tech bloggers linking from an eerily similar " Emergent Democracy " discussion list , which in turn takes its name from a similarly essay posted by Joi Ito [ Lunch - Lunch - Lunch - Segway - Lunch - Lunch - Fawning Parody ] who is a colossus of authority in these circles , hence lots of PageRank™ - boosting hyperlinks , and who like Moore , appeared from nowhere as a figure of authority .
Lunchin '
Ito's essay is uncannily similar to Moore 's - both are vague and elusive and fail to describe how the " emergent " democracy might form a legal framework , a currency , a definition of property or - most important this , when you 're being hit with a stick by a bastard - an armed resistance ( which in polite circles today , we call a " military " ) .
As with Moore , academic and historical research in this field is vapored away , as if by magic .
However , we have an idea of how this utopian " democracy " might look , if we follow the participants of Lunchbox 's mailing list .
These participants are quite clear about how they define democracy :
" Democracy can function perfectly well without people painting their faces and blocking streets , " writes one contributor .
42 Days
Orwell would be amused , indeed .
" Words define action , " sums up Alan Black .
Black helps organise San Francisco 's annual LitQuake event and is holding a festival to commemorate Orwell 's centenary in the city in June .
" Newspeak was one of the planks of the totalitarian regime .
Big Brother was constantly redefining history and redefining words - he knew people respond to key words , " he says .
" It 's interesting that they 've identified that the only way to oppose the one superpower comes from the people , and sought to redefine that . "
But the real marvel is that they did it with so few people .
Pew Research Center 's latest research says the number of Internet users who look at blogs is " so small that it is not possible to draw statistically meaningful conclusions about who uses blogs . "
They peg it at about four per cent .
But we 're looking at a small sub - genre of blogdom , the tech blogs , and specifically , we 're looking at an ' A list ' of that sub- sub - genre .
Which means that Google is being " gamed " - and the language perverted - by what in statistical terms in an extremely small fraction indeed .
That was enough to make a " meaning " disappear .
Googlewash
Writing about Google 's collusion with the People 's Republic of China to block access to mainland users , censorship researcher Seth Finkelsetein observed :
" Contrary to earlier utopian theories of the Internet , it takes very little effort for governments to cause certain information simply to vanish for a huge number of people . "
Rub out the word ' government ' , and replace it with ' weblog A - list ' .
In this case a commons resource , this very potent and quite viral phrase , was created by millions of people .
But it was poisoned by a very select number of ' bloggers ' .
Possibly a dozen , but no more than 30 , we 'd guess .
Who is poisoning the well ?
The phrase " greenwash " will be familiar to many of you : it 's where a spot of judicious marketing paint is applied to something decidedly rotten , transforming it into something that looks as if it 's wholesome and radical new , but which is essentially unchanged .
This is the first Googlewash we 've encountered .
42 days , too .
What else is coming down the pipe ? ®

Hello , world
For those few of you who read the first part of this tutorial series , " Part Isa - Introduction , Manners & ' Hello , world ' " , you would know that we are roughly 8 % of our way to completing the classic program ' Hello , world ' in INTERCAL .
In short , we had managed to write the character 'h ' to our standard output but we were not entirely sure how we had achieved this .
In this tutorial we will boldly attempt to finish writing our first INTERCAL program and possibly try to understand how the program actually works .
INTERCAL has very good support for the input and output of numbers .
In accepting numeric input the following would be allowed : EIGHT OH NINEEIGHT ZERO NINERWALO WALA SIYAM : where all of these inputs mean ' 809 ' , ( the last being written in the Tagalog language ) .
The ' WRITE IN ' statement accepts numbers written in English , Sanskrit , Basque , Tagalog , Classical Nahuatl , Georgian , Kwakiutl , and Volapuk .
INTERCAL will output numbers in Roman numerals , so in the example above we could use ' READ OUT ' to output the value 809 as DCCCIX .
To write our ' Hello , world ' program , we are much more interested in character output rather than Roman numeric output .
To understand character output in INTERCAL , you must first understand character input .
When speaking of character input , the INTERCAL manual says : Indeed character input in INTERCAL is handled in a fashion that is significantly different from all other programming languages and as we will see soon character output is even more unique .
To understand text input and output in INTERCAL we need to understand the Turing Text Model .
It is possibly best described using the following diagram which I drew on the back of an envelope :
We can imagine that INTERCAL has a circular input tape with all of the 256 available characters printed on it .
INTERCAL also has an ' input head ' which is positioned at the location of the last character entered by the user .
The input head starts at position 0 ( ASCII 0 ) when your INTERCAL program starts .
If the user types ' g ' , as in the diagram , the input head will be moved to the ' g ' on the input tape and the decimal value 103 ( g is ASCII 103 ) will be stored in the first position of your array .
So far , so good .
It is when the user keeps on typing that things get tricky .
If the user finishes typing the word ' goat ' , by typing ' oat ' , the following will result :
The input head will move to the right by 8 positions to reach the 'o ' from its initial position of ' g ' , so the decimal value 8 will be stored in the second position of your array .
The input head can only travel to the right .
So to reach the letter ' a ' , it must travel past the end of the 256 available characters and keep traveling until it reaches ' a ' .
To do this , it must travel 242 positions .
So the decimal value 242 will be stored in the third position of the array .
As with the simple case of 'o ' , the input head travels from ' a ' to 't ' , storing the decimal value 19 in the fourth position of the array .
Simple .
When it comes to character output , there is some good news and some bad news .
The good news is that the input tape and output tape ( and their corresponding heads ) are independent , which is much simpler than if they were connected .
The bad news is that the previous sentence is the only good news .
As with input in INTERCAL , described in the previous section , there is an output tape with all 256 ASCII characters printed on it and an output head .
The tape travels in the same direction as the input tape , but the output tape is on theof the tape .
This results in two subtle differences : 1 .
The numbers required to move the head from one position to another are different because the output head is effectively moving in the opposite direction to the corresponding input head .
2 . Because the output head is on the inside of the tape , it sees the binary representation of the ASCII characters printed on it .
For example , to print the ASCII character ' b ' , binary 0110 0010 , you would need to move the output head to the ASCII ' F ' , binary 0100 0110 .
As with the input head , the output head starts at position zero .
We can calculate the required head moves for the string ' Hello , world ' in the following table : : and so on .
Continuing on these calculations you end up with the program :
DO ,1 PLEASE , 1SUB #1 DO , 1SUB # 2 DO , 1SUB #3 DO , 1SUB # 4 DO , 1SUB #5 PLEASE , 1SUB#6 PLEASE , 1SUB #7 DO , 1SUB #8 DO , 1SUB#9 DO , 1SUB #10 DO , 1SUB #11 DO , 1SUB #12 DO , 1SUB #13 DO READ OUT , 1PLEASE GIVE UP : which when compiled and run gives the enormously satisfying output : I have written ' Hello , world ' in many different programming languages over the past many years but I have never felt the sense of achievement that writing ' Hello , world ' in INTERCAL has given me .
Imagine the pride I would I feel if I built a small operating system using INTERCAL ?' Hello , world ' has only scratched the surface of the power and flexibility of INTERCAL .
The astute reader will note that our program is quite linear , running from start to finish without branching or looping .
In the next tutorial in my INTERCAL series we will explore some of the options that INTERCAL provides us with to create more complex programs .

Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Political video smackdown / ' Hillary 1984 ' : Unauthorized Internet ad for Obama converts Apple Computer's ' 84 Super Bowl spot into a generational howl against Clinton 's presidential bid 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
It may be the most stunning and creative attack ad yet for a 2008 presidential candidate -- one experts say could represent a watershed moment in 21st century media and political advertising .
Yet the groundbreaking 74 - second pitch for Democratic Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , which remixes the classic " 1984 " ad that introduced Apple computers to the world , is not on cable or network TV , but on the Internet .
( To see the video , go to : www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h3G-lMZxjo)
And Obama 's campaign says it had absolutely nothing to do with the video that attacks one of his principal Democratic rivals , New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Indeed , the ad's creator is a mystery , at least for now .
The compelling " Hillary 1984 " video recently introduced on YouTube represents " a new era , a new wave of politics ... because it's not about Obama , " said Peter Leyden , director of the New Politics Institute , a San Francisco - based think tank on politics and new media .
" It 's about the end of the broadcast era . "
But some say the ad is just the latest attempt by outside activists to influence political campaigns -- or the newest way for campaigns to anonymously attack their opponents .
The video is a sophisticated new take on director Ridley Scott 's controversial Apple ad that caused shock waves with its premiere during the 1984 Super Bowl , and shows the same blond young female athlete running with a sledgehammer toward a widescreen -- where an ominous Big Brother figure drones to a mass of zombielike followers .
But this time , the woman is wearing an iPod -- and has her candidate 's slogan on her chest .
And the Big Brother -- whose image she defiantly smashes with a wave of her sledgehammer -- is Clinton , the Democratic presidential front - runner .
The tagline for the attack : " On Jan. 14 , the Democratic primary will begin .
And you 'll see why 2008 wo n't be like 1984 . "
An updated Apple symbol -- transformed into an O -- is followed by the dramatically emerging logo : BarackObama.com .
Veteran San Francisco ad man Bob Gardner , whose work has included political campaigns for former President Gerald Ford , said the video is " very powerful " in its efforts to call for a generational change in politics .
" It puts Hillary spouting cliche nonsense to the drones -- while a fresh face breaks through , " he says .
" It 's old versus new . "
That theme -- reflecting a generational change in the relationship between media , politics , candidates and voters -- suggests that " Hillary 1984 " could have the iconic power with the 21st century political generation that another classic political ad called " Daisy " represented to Baby Boomers , says Leyden .
That 1964 spot for President Lyndon Johnson -- featuring images of a child plucking a daisy , which morphed ominously into a nuclear mushroom cloud -- battered GOP presidential candidate Sen.
Barry Goldwater because it , too , portrayed " a shattering of the whole world " in both political leadership , and media .
Bill Burton , a spokesman for Obama , said he is aware of the " Hillary 1984 " video and has gotten calls from reporters on it -- but he insisted that the campaign is not connected to it .
" It 's somebody else 's creation , " he said , declining to comment on the ad's biting content .
Burton said he does n't know who created the spot , but it shows " there is a lot of energy for Sen .
Obama on the Web , in communities all over the country ... and frankly , that energy will manifest itself in a lot of ways . "
But in the weeks since its early March debut , the expertly created video remix -- called a mashup in blogosphere circles -- has " changed the zone " between political campaigns , their followers and the Internet , said Simon Rosenberg , president of the Washington - based New Democrat Network , an influential party advocacy group based in Washington , D.C .
With presidential campaigns now poised to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising that will blanket television before November 2008 , this seemingly home - produced video -- created with software and a laptop , and likely without the benefit of a team of expensive political consultants -- opens a new window , Rosenberg said .
It has dramatized a brave new world in which passionate activists outside the structure of traditional campaigns have the power to shape the message -- even for a presidential candidate .
The ad is proof that " anybody can do powerful emotional ads ... and the campaigns are no longer in control , " Rosenberg said .
" It will no longer be a top - down candidate message ; that 's a 20th century broadcast model . "
It also dramatizes that today , political activists with the Internet as their ammunition have gone from being " just donors to the cause , " he said , " to being partners in the fight .
And they do n't have to wait for permission . "
But while the medium is clearly more grassroots , political campaigns have not been averse to having an outside or independent voice -- witness the efforts of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in the 2004 presidential race against Democratic Sen .
John Kerry -- delivering ads that are tougher and meaner than the candidates might launch on their own .
Eric Jaye , a San Francisco political consultant and key adviser to Mayor Gavin Newsom , said the sophisticated " Hillary 1984 " effort is the " best example yet " of a crop of viral videos that have blossomed on the Internet over the past 18 months .
But Jaye predicted such efforts are bound to become attractive tools for political campaigns , which will " orchestrate these videos on the down low to communicate negative messages -- without having to own them in public . "
Jaye noted that Obama 's campaign -- even as it insists it has no connection to the production -- reaps a clear benefit from the mashup video : " They get to call Hillary Clinton a pabulum - spewing pseudo - fascist , without having to own it . "
And he says the individual viral video efforts popping up on the Internet , however creative , come with risk for political campaigns -- especially presidential runs , where nuance and caution usually win out over edginess when it comes to shaping messages that appeal to wide swaths of voters
" They tend to be more entertaining -- but they tend to be nastier .
You used to have a series of apologies for what campaign bloggers said .
Now you have to have a series of apologies for what people with a video camera and software editing and a laptop do . "
Still , Jaye said , there 's a clear benefit in the energy such efforts create .
" If people take the time to make a campaign ad , it helps generate more excitement , more laughs .
It 's fresher , " he said .
" But it also generates more issues .
You have people making ads you do n't authorize . "
Gardner said the success of " Hillary 1984 " means that now " every candidate will have to worry about some guy with a video camera and a Mac being able to do whatever he or she wants . "
At the Obama campaign , he added wryly , " they are probably calling their consultant and saying , ' Why could n't you guys come up with something as brilliant ? ' "

Unless someone or something stops it soon , the mysterious killer that is wiping out many of the nation 's honeybees could have a devastating effect on America 's dinner plate , perhaps even reducing us to a glorified bread - and - water diet .
Honeybees do n't just make honey ; they pollinate more than 90 of the tastiest flowering crops we have .
Among them : apples , nuts , avocados , soybeans , asparagus , broccoli , celery , squash and cucumbers .
And lots of the really sweet and tart stuff , too , including citrus fruit , peaches , kiwi , cherries , blueberries , cranberries , strawberries , cantaloupe and other melons .
In fact , about one - third of the human diet comes from insect - pollinated plants , and the honeybee is responsible for 80 % of that pollination , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Even cattle , which feed on alfalfa , depend on bees .
So if the collapse worsens , we could end up being " stuck with grains and water , " said Kevin Hackett , the national program leader for USDA 's bee and pollination program .
" This is the biggest general threat to our food supply , " Hackett said .
While not all scientists foresee a food crisis , noting that large - scale bee die - offs have happened before , this one seems particularly baffling and alarming .
U.S. beekeepers in the past few months have lost one - quarter of their colonies — or about five times the normal winter losses — because of what scientists have dubbed Colony Collapse Disorder .
The problem started in November and seems to have spread to 27 states , with similar collapses reported in Brazil , Canada and parts of Europe .
Scientists are struggling to figure out what is killing the honeybees , and early results of a key study this week point to some kind of disease or parasite .
Even before this disorder struck , America 's honeybees were in trouble .
Their numbers were steadily shrinking , because their genes do not equip them to fight poisons and disease very well , and because their gregarious nature exposes them to ailments that afflict thousands of their close cousins .
" Quite frankly , the question is whether the bees can weather this perfect storm , " Hackett said .
" Do they have the resilience to bounce back ?
We 'll know probably by the end of the summer . "
Experts from Brazil and Europe have joined in the detective work at USDA 's bee lab in suburban Washington .
In recent weeks , Hackett briefed Vice President Cheney 's office on the problem .
Congress has held hearings on the matter .
" This crisis threatens to wipe out production of crops dependent on bees for pollination , " Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said in a statement .
A congressional study said honeybees add about $ 15 billion a year in value to our food supply .
Of the 17,000 species of bees that scientists know about , " honeybees are , for many reasons , the pollinator of choice for most North American crops , " a National Academy of Sciences study said last year .
They pollinate many types of plants , repeatedly visit the same plant , and recruit other honeybees to visit , too .
Pulitzer Prize - winning insect biologist E.O. Wilson of Harvard said the honeybee is nature 's " workhorse — and we took it for granted . "
" We 've hung our own future on a thread , " Wilson , author of the book " The Creation : An Appeal to Save Life on Earth , " told The Associated Press on Monday .
Beginning this past fall , beekeepers would open up their hives and find no workers , just newborn bees and the queen .
Unlike past bee die - offs , where dead bees would be found near the hive , this time they just disappeared .
The die - off takes just one to three weeks .
USDA 's top bee scientist , Jeff Pettis , who is coordinating the detective work on this die - off , has more suspected causes than time , people and money to look into them .
The top suspects are a parasite , an unknown virus , some kind of bacteria , pesticides , or a one - two combination of the top four , with one weakening the honeybee and the second killing it .
A quick experiment with some of the devastated hives makes pesticides seem less likely .
In the recent experiment , Pettis and colleagues irradiated some hard - hit hives and reintroduced new bee colonies .
More bees thrived in the irradiated hives than in the non-irradiated ones , pointing toward some kind of disease or parasite that was killed by radiation .
The parasite hypothesis has history and some new findings to give it a boost :
A mite practically wiped out the wild honeybee in the U.S. in the 1990s .
And another new one - celled parasitic fungus was found last week in a tiny sample of dead bees by University of California San Francisco molecular biologist Joe DeRisi , who isolated the human SARS virus .
However , Pettis and others said while the parasite nosema ceranae may be a factor , it can not be the sole cause .
The fungus has been seen before , sometimes in colonies that were healthy .
Recently , scientists have begun to wonder if mankind is too dependent on honeybees .
The scientific warning signs came in two reports last October .
First , the National Academy of Sciences said pollinators , especially America 's honeybee , were under threat of collapse because of a variety of factors .
Captive colonies in the United States shrank from 5.9 million in 1947 to 2.4 million in 2005 .
Then , scientists finished mapping the honeybee genome and found that the insect did not have the normal complement of genes that take poisons out of their systems or many immune - disease - fighting genes .
A fruitfly or a mosquito has twice the number of genes to fight toxins , University of Illinois entomologist May Berenbaum .
What the genome mapping revealed was " that honeybees may be peculiarly vulnerable to disease and toxins , " Berenbaum said .
University of Montana bee expert Jerry Bromenshenk has surveyed more than 500 beekeepers and found that 38 % of them had losses of 75 % or more .
A few weeks back , Bromenshenk was visiting California beekeepers and saw a hive that was thriving .
Two days later , it had completely collapsed .
Yet Bromenshenk said , " I 'm not ready to panic yet . "
He said he does n't think a food crisis is looming .
Even though experts this year gave what 's happening a new name and think this is a new type of die - off , it may have happened before .
Bromenshenk said cited die - offs in the 1960s and 1970s that sound somewhat the same .
There were reports of something like this in the United States in spots in 2004 , Pettis said .
And Germany had something similar in 2004 , said Peter Neumann , co-chairman of a 17 - country European research group studying the problem .
" The problem is that everyone wants a simple answer , " Pettis said .
" And it may not be a simple answer . "

Identity cards are due to be introduced in 2009
Instead of a single multi-billion pound system , information will be held on three existing , separate databases .
Home Secretary John Reid said it would save cash , but the Tories said ID cards were still a £ 20bn " white elephant " .
All non-Europeans already in the UK will also have to register fingerprints or iris scans from 2008 not just new arrivals , Mr Reid announced .
The controversial National Identity Register ( NIR ) , which Mr Reid says will cost £ 5.4 bn over 10 years , was originally proposed as a single " clean " computer system .
It was going to be built from scratch to avoid repeating mistakes and duplications in the government 's computer systems .
' Lower risk '
Now the information will be spread across three existing IT systems , including the Department of Work and Pensions ' ( DWP ) Customer Information Service , which holds national insurance records .
Mr Reid denied IT companies had wasted millions on preparation work for an entirely new system , saying the industry had been consulted on the move .
The government has reportedly spent about £ 35 m on IT consultants since the ID cards project began in 2004 .
" Doing something sensible is not necessarily a U - turn , " Mr Reid told reporters .
" We have decided it is lower risk , more efficient and faster to take the infrastructure that already exists , although the data will be drawn from other sources . "
Iris scans
Biometric information will be stored , initially , on systems currently used for asylum seekers , while biographical information will be stored on the DWP 's system .
Other information , on the issue and use of ID cards , will be stored on the existing Identity and Passport Service computer system .
Mr Reid also announced proposals to force foreign nationals from outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ) , who are already in the UK , to register their biometrics , such as fingerprints and iris scans .
This is already due to happen for those applying for visas to come to the UK from 2008 , but Mr Reid said : " We are going to look at how we could do it for people who are already here . "
Fake identity
He said the ultimate aim was to make all foreign nationals from outside the EU to register their biometric details but the scheme would begin with people re-applying to stay in the UK .
He said he also wanted to tighten up exit controls at ports and airports , as well as entry requirements .
" We want to count everybody in and count everybody out , " said Mr Reid .
Foreigners from outside the EEA would not be able to get a National Insurance number unless they have a biometric identity .
Immigration Minister Liam Byrne said new legislation would be published in the New Year .
Mr Reid said ID cards would help tackle illegal immigration , identity fraud , fight organised crime and terrorism , help protect vulnerable children by allowing better background checks and improve public services .
They would not stop people having a fake identity , he conceded , but would prevent people having multiple identities , which he said were most often used by " crooks , terrorists and fraudsters " .
Civil liberties
The plans were laid out in an action plan which Mr Reid said was a " countdown " to the introduction of ID cards .
ID cards are due from 2009 , becoming compulsory for anyone applying for a passport from 2010 .
Critics question their cost and the impact on civil liberties .
The card will contain basic identification information including the name , address , gender , date of birth and photo of the cardholder .
A microchip would also hold biometric information .
' Financial disaster '
Shadow Home Secretary , David Davis , for the Conservatives , said it was " beyond belief " that Mr Reid still planned to " waste up to £ 20bn of taxpayers ' money on this expensive white elephant " .
And the decision to use existing databases was " an admission of what will turn out to be a financial disaster for the taxpayer " .
He said Mr Reid " has tried to sneak this announcement out in a written statement that is not subject to scrutiny betrays just how fragile the government 's confidence in their own scheme actually is " .
' Sticking plaster '
The government should instead use the money to set up a dedicated UK border police , said Mr Davis .
Nick Clegg , for the Liberal Democrats , said : " These are sticking plaster measures in which the government is cutting corners to make the increasingly unpopular ID card scheme more palatable .
" The fact remains that however much John Reid rearranges the deckchairs , ID cards are doomed to be unacceptably expensive , intrusive and unmanageable . "
The SNP called the move an " embarrassing u-turn " which proved the Home Office was " not fit for purpose " .
Campaign group No2ID said " mixing up " new data with existing data meant the system would be " even less secure than originally suggested " .
The idea that this could then be integrated with banks ' chip and pin system , as the Home Office has proposed , was " farcical " in practical terms , a spokesman added .
The battery should produce enough electricity to power a home
The technology - using bacteria which consume sugar to generate power from brewery waste water - was unveiled at the University of Queensland .
The university was awarded a state grant of 140,000 Australian dollars ( $ 115,000 ; £ 58,000 ) to help fund the microbial fuel cell project .
The battery will be installed at Foster 's brewery near Brisbane .
As bacteria consume water - soluble waste from the plant such as starch , alcohol and sugar , the battery will produce clean water and electricity .
" Brewery waste water is a particularly good source because it is very biodegradable ... and is highly concentrated , which does help in improving the performance of the cell , " said the university 's waste water expert , Professor Jorg Keller .
According to estimates , the brewery battery should produce two kilowatts of power - enough to power a household .
" It 's not going to make an enormous amount of power - it 's primarily a waste water treatment that has the added benefit of creating electricity , " Prof Keller added .
A patent is pending for the technology , which could be used across a number of food , beverage and manufacturing industries .
On the cable side , the VH1 network , owned by Viacom , tested last month a method of keeping viewers tuned in during commercial breaks that it calls Showstoppers .
The experiment , during a show named “ Hogan Knows Best , ” commingled program snippets and spots in a way that was intended to lead the viewers through the commercial pods to the moment the show came back .
The trade publication Mediaweek reported this week the results of the test , including a finding that 47 percent of the viewers surveyed by VH1 said they paid more attention to the commercials in the Showstoppers format than they normally would .
The growing interest among all networks in retaining viewers throughout commercial pods is primarily because of the advertisers and agencies are focusing on what are known as commercial ratings .
For decades , the ratings gathered by Nielsen Media Research , which help marketers select the series they support or ignore , have measured viewership of the programs .
It was up to Madison Avenue to figure out how many viewers stayed to watch the spots .
Now , Nielsen is moving toward reporting average commercial minute ratings , based on the average of all the spots in a program .
Madison Avenue is asking for more , in the form of ratings that would be brand specific — that is , for each individual commercial .
•
The subject was a central theme of the conference at which Mr. Shaw spoke , sponsored by the Association of National Advertisers .
The conference , called the TV Forum , drew about 400 people to the Marriott Marquis hotel in Midtown Manhattan .
“ Without this change , I do n’t know how long television can be sustainable as an advertising medium , ” said O. Andrew Jung , senior director for advertising and media services at the Kellogg Company .
He has been leading the push for brand - specific commercial ratings .
“ We need to make our advertising more effective , ” Mr. Jung said , but “ 25 percent of an average hour is not measured properly . ”
His reference was to the typical amount of commercials during 60 minutes of TV .
In 1859 , John Tyndall ’s laboratory experiments showed that water vapour and carbon dioxide absorb infra-red radiation and that they could therefore affect the climate of the Earth .
As soon as his paper was published ( 1861 ) in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , he put out a press release for the London newspapers explaining that this result implied that all past climate changes were now understood and all future climate changes could be predicted simply from a knowledge of the concentrations of these ‘ greenhouse ’ gases …
Fast forward to 2006 : Svensmark and colleagues ’ laboratory experiments show that highly ionizing radiation can create ultra-small aerosol particles .
As soon as the paper is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , they put out a press release for the world ’s newspapers explaining that this result implied that all past climate changes were now understood and all future climate changes could be predicted simply from a knowledge of the intensity of these ‘ cosmic rays ’… .
History repeating itself ?
Well , not exactly .
Tyndall actually restricted himself to describing his experiments and simply linking it to the work of Fourier a few decades earlier .
It took more than another century before the credible quantitative estimates of these effects and their influence on past and possibly future climate were made , along with good enough observations of the gases to know that they have ( and continue ) to change significantly .
However , Svensmark and colleagues , not wanting to wait for the credible quantitative results to come in , instead short circuited all of that tedious follow - up work , scaling up to realistic conditions , theoretical and modelling studies demonstrating that their effect was indeed viable , and simply declared in their press materials that the team had ‘ discovered that cosmic rays play a big part in the everyday weather ’ and ‘ brings to a climax a scientific quest that has lasted two centuries ’ .
Nobel prizes all round then .
Alas !
if only it were that simple ….
( In explaining why it is n’t , I should first apologise for the third solar related posting in as many weeks .
I realise that most people are not that interested and so after this one , I promise a moratorium for a month or so ! )
Svensmark ’s paper itself is indeed of some interest .
Aerosol processes are among the most uncertain , and most studied , aspects of climate and these experiments ( they bombarded a clean mixture of water , SO 2 , O 3 and air with high energy UV and saw small H 2 SO 4 droplets form ) might be useful in adding to that field .
One could quibble with the use of the high - energy UV ( which never penetrates to the lower troposphere ) , and the high concentrations of SO 2 and O 3 , but by far the biggest problems lie in the study ’s relevance to the real world atmospheric conditions .
The working hypothesis of the cosmic ray crowd is that the ( weak ) correlations between low clouds and cosmic rays are causal ( i.e. a cosmic ray increase – due to a solar magnetic field weakening – causes low clouds to increase , cooling the planet ) .
The ‘ spin ’ on this new paper is that this has been demonstrated , and is significant , and furthermore , is responsible for the 20th Century rise in global temperatures .
But let ’s look carefully at what is required in this logic :
First , the particles observed in these experiments are orders of magnitude too small to be Cloud Condensation Nuclei ( CCN ) .
In the press release , this is why they talk about the ‘ building blocks ’ of CCN , however , aggrandisation of these small particles is in no sense guaranteed ( Missing step # 1 ) .
Secondly , the focus is on low clouds over the ocean .
However , over the ocean , there are huge numbers of condensation nuclei related to sea salt particles .
Thus to show that the cosmic ray mechanism is important , you need to show that it increases CCN even in the presence of lots of other CCN ( Missing step # 2 ) .
Next , even if more CCN were made , you would need to show that this actually changed cloud cover ( or optical thickness etc. ) ( Missing step # 3 ) .
And given that change in cloud properties , you would need to show that it had a significant effect on radiative forcing – which despite their hand waving , is not at all well quantified ( even the sign ! )
( Missing step # 4 ) .
Finally , to show that cosmic rays were actually responsible for some part of the recent warming you would need to show that there was actually a decreasing trend in cosmic rays over recent decades – which is tricky , because there has n’t been ( see the figure ) ( Missing step # 5 ) .
All of this will require significant work and there are certainly no guarantees that all the steps can be verified ( which they have been for the greenhouse gas hypothesis ) – especially the last !
However , they would seem essential to justifying the claims in the press releases .
Will these results be a spur to future research ?
Possibly .
But the ridiculous spin put on this paper is liable to continue to put off mainstream scientists from pursuing it .
It ’s as though Svensmark and co. want to enhance the field of solar - terrestrial research ’s bad reputation for agenda - driven science .
Unsurprisingly , this paper was trumpeted throughout contrarian circles last week and was received uncritically ( with one honorable exception in the ‘ climatesceptics ’ discussion group ) , even by people who normally spend their time decrying science - by - press - release .
( A word to the wise , consistency goes a long way to establishing credibility … ) .
At RealClimate , we ’ve often criticised press releases that we felt gave misleading impressions of the underlying work and lead to confused , and sometimes erroneous , headlines , but this example is by far the most blatant extrapolation - beyond - reasonableness that we ’ve seen .
If this group wants to be taken seriously and interact constructively with the rest of the community ( which is the only way the ‘ missing steps ’ will get sufficient attention ) , they have to act in a serious manner , be honest about the problems and caveats , and resist the temptation to speculate beyond what is justified .
The kind of antics seen in this case may play well for the peanut gallery , but they wo n’t impress the critics .
Let us negotiate
Or : why I ’m unsatisfied with mostly everything available for web authoring and what the acronym “ HTTP ” has to do with it all .
By Leonardo Boiko
The m17n problem
I am a Brazilian .
I have friends who can understand Portuguese but not English .
I like to play with the Internet , so I know a lot of people who can understand English and not Portuguese .
Being a Japanese culture enthusiast , I also have some friends who can understand Japanese better than anything else .
I can write in Portuguese and ( passably ) in English .
I also hope to be able to produce Japanese content in some years .
Since many of my friends are not technical persons , I ’d like to provide alternative language versions of my writings in the easiest possible manner .
If only I could send alternative language versions of content based on user preferences , I ’d be set .
There ’s a catchy techword for that , m17n ( for “ multilingualization ” ) .
But I could find no web software to make this easy — not even cherished software such as the Wordpress weblog , the Ruby on Rails framework or the Gallery image management scripts .
The XHTML problem
I ’m a computer guy .
I can read and appreciate the technical standards that make the Internet possible .
I also consider myself a poet , and as such , I crave beauty in everything I create — including webpages .
The common standard for webpages , HTML , is very messy .
There ’s a much nicer alternative , called XHTML , available since January 2000 .
Unfortunately , the most popular web browser ( which also happens to be the ugliest , slowest and most unsafe of web browsers ) does not care about XHTML .
Indeed , it does n’t even know what XHTML is .
To deal with problems like that , the folks at W3C made XHTML 1.0 to be backwards compatible .
Backward compatibility almost always means ugliness , and XHTML 1.0 is ugly .
It has useless redundancy and arbitrary restrictions to make it feels like HTML when seen by that crappy browser .
There ’s a 2001 standard , XHTML 1.1 , which is basically 1.0 minus ugliness .
It ’s XHTML which I can have pleasure in writing .
Nowadays all browsers that properly support XHTML 1.0 also supports 1.1 , since the newer standard is mostly a subset of the older ( the only thing new is support for ruby characters , which is very useful for Japanese ) .
Further , there ’s no reason at all to send “ compatible ” XHTML 1.0 to that bad browser .
You gain nothing by doing this and might as well send plain old HTML .
In a nutshell : HTML sucks , and XHTML 1.0 sucks too .
I sat down and hacked a XSLT script to automatically convert XHTML 1.1 documents to HTML documents .
Now I can write beautiful hand - crafted XHTML code and , when needed , generate HTML from it .
If only there was some way of asking the browser what kind of document he prefers .
However , again I could not find any projects to help me do this , not even the popular ones .
HTTP rulez
As it turns out , the two problems described above are already solved , and they were solved ten years ago .
By HTTP , no less .
Yep , HTTP , those four letters before every Web URL .
HTTP 1.1 has a mechanism for sending content in different languages and media types , called “ content negotiation ” , which is very nice .
It ’s also completely ignored by developers .
For example , it ’s painful to change your language preferences in major browsers ( My Mom could never do it ) .
Further , I could find no web project taking full advantage of the possibilities offered by content negotiation .
By now I was not surprised anymore .
I ’m starting to think that people simply do not care about standards .
They ignore that the Unicode standard solved everything about character set encodings and insist in using legacy national standards .
They ignore that XHTML and XML solved everything needed for m17n and refuse to acknowledge mechanisms like xml:lang and hreflang and < link rel= " alternate " hreflang= " xx " > .
And they seem to think of HTTP as some boring old network thingy .
It ’s not .
It ’s a very powerful and elegant mechanism for transmitting information .
The more I read into it , the more I am amazed about how much HTTP is underused in Wordpress or Ruby on Rails or Gallery .
HTTP rulez .
Update : the page referenced above seems to be offline frequently now , here 's the google cache .
Recommended reading .
In case it ’s lost forever , I ’ll copy Tomayko's list of things web frameworks should do , which is a nice summary of the problem :
Help implement content negotiation properly ( hell yes ! ) .
Proper , smart using of HTTP caching facilities ( If - modified - since , Expires , Cache - Control , etc. )
, , , etc. )
Make dealing with media types easy .
Make dealing with character encodings easy .
Encourage the use of standard HTTP authentication schemes ( this is another underused but powerful HTTP area ) .
Provide a sane mechanism for attaching different behavior to different verbs for a single resource .
Help ensure that URIs stay cool .
Make dealing with transfer encodings ( gzip , compress , etc. ) easy .
Help you use the entire range of response status codes properly ( e.g. nearly all dynamic content returns either a 200 or 500 ) .
Help ensuring GET requests are safe and idempotent .
How many of those points your favourite PHP / Python / Ruby framework provide ?
The three - layered system for content negotiation
I tried to use content negotiation through available tools such as Apache Multiviews .
The first problem I had was that , as mentioned before , web browsers do not make it easy for you to set , say , your preferred language .
I tried pointing to alternative language versions with the < link /> element , but the browsers ignore that too .
I tried to add explicit < a /> links to the alternative versions , but this solution , contrarywise to elementary user interface guidelines , was transitory ; as soon as the user opened another page , his choice of language was lost .
I ca n’t change the browser ’s list of preferred languages remotely .
The only solution , unfortunately , seems to be to duplicate the HTTP content negotiation mechanism .
We can do that using cookies .
If the user clicks “ Portuguese ” , you not only send him to the Portuguese version of a page , you also set a cookie saying that he likes Portuguese more than English .
When you retrieve a resource , you first try to see if you have a version satisfying the cookie preferences , and if not , you scan the standard HTTP language preferences .
You have two content negotiation layers .
What happens if you do not have any of the languages the user requested ?
HTTP has a status code for that , “ 406 Not Acceptable ” .
But it seems to me a terrible idea to do what Apache does by default and throw a big ugly “ 406 Not Acceptable ” error message at the user ’s face .
If I had written some text only in English and My Mom tried to see it , that error message would surely scare her out of the computer .
The authors of the HTTP RFC probably felt like that too , since they made the standard error message a SHOULD , not a MUST .
They even state that sending unacceptable content may be preferable to sending a 406 error response in some cases .
What if we take a middle road ?
We send the response with a 406 status code , but instead of attaching an error message , we attach some available version of the content .
My Mom needs not to know that an error ocurred .
If we feel like , we could include a little informative box saying “ I could not find this page in Portuguese , so I ’m sending it in English instead ” .
The decision of which language is the fallback should clearly be made by the webmaster .
But should the webmaster be required to write a version of every single page in this language ?
What if I want to write some content only in English and some only in Portuguese ?
The most general solution is not a fallback language but a fallback list of languages .
Yet another layer of content negotiation .
And thus we arrive at my three - layered content negotiation scheme .
Until now I ’ve discussed the problem in terms of m17n , but the same reasoning applies to media types ( the XHTML / HTML issue ) .
It also applies to selecting the best character set encoding and transfer encoding , which I do not worry about right now but is nice to keep in mind .
So , in general , we add two extra layers of content negotiation preferences mimicking the four HTTP Accept headers and follow this algorithm :
First , scan the user preferences set in cookies , if any , and see if there ’s an available representation satisfying them ;
If not , try the same with the standard HTTP headers ;
If not , find the best representation according to the site defaults and send it flagged as 406 .
So , Boiko , have you actually done anything about it ?
I do not wish to duplicate efforts .
It seems to me that the most logical place to implement such a content negotiation system would be at the web server , either as an Apache module or using something like Webrick .
But I cannot install Apache modules or run custom servers at my hosting service , so I ’m stuck with ( Fast ) CGI .
I ’ve been hacking together some Ruby for the algorithm described above , with emphasis on standards compliance .
It already works for serving static ( non - ERB ) content , but I want to improve it a little more before releasing .
( Update : sorry people , I 'm a procrastinator and an overengineer .
Since writing this I fell in love with Scheme — specifically , with a very m17n - aware and unixish Scheme implementation — and am in the process of rewriting everything . )
And that ’s my excuse about why I ’m not confortable in creating Wordpress texts or Gallery photo albums or Rails applications .
I welcome your suggestions .
Discuss this at reddit , or in my blog ( Portuguese , but English comments welcome ) .
