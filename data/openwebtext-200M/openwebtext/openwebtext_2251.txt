Dyeing to Boost Solar Efficiency by 50 %
July 14th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
MIT has perfected a dye technology that could change the solar world as we know it .
The most efficient form of solar technology today is ( arguably ) extreme concentrated photovoltaics , essentially solar panels placed under a magnifying glass .
But the problem with these systems is heat .
Concentrated sunlight can melt silicon solar panels unless you include specialized cooling systems .
Cooling technology costs money , and the panels require expensive tracking mechanisms to follow the sun through the day .
MIT ’s new solar system bypasses the heat and tracking problems all together .
Thin coatings of organic dyes absorb sunlight and redirect favored wavelengths into a pane of glass .
The light is aimed and concentrated towards the edge of the pane where small solar panels are located .
The concentrated light allows the panels to produce the maximum possible amount of energy all day , every day without cooling systems or complex tracking mechanisms .
The idea is not new , but its founders in the 70s could not overcome technical challenges .
The technology was abandoned when research funding dried up .
Their dyes were unstable , and their optical experise was imperfect .
Much of the light captured and concentrated into their glass or plastic was lost before it could reach the solar cells .
MIT took tips from laser technology and organic light emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) to perfect the technology .
Their expertise increased the distance light can travel through glass or plastic to reach the solar panels , boosting energy production .
“ In addition , the focused light increases the electrical power obtained from each solar cell “ by a factor of over 40 . ” ” According to Marc A Baldo , an associate professor at MIT who helped lead the project .
For more technical details , you may need an AAAS membership to read the Science article .
Three Reasons Why This Could Rock the Solar World :
1 ) It ’s Easy :
The technology is neither complex or difficult to manufacture .
All you need is a window frame laced with solar panels and an ordinary pane of glass or plastic .
Apply the proper ratios of organic dyes and you ’re ready to go .
The finished product looks like smoked glass and could be used on rooftops or solar farms .
Future improvements could bring them to ordinary windows .
Hopefully it will be competitive in price with other solar technologies .
2 ) Upgrade Existing Solar :
This technology can be applied to existing photovoltaic panels to boost their efficiency by as much as 50 % with minimal additional cost .
Upgrading existing solar panels will not only boost their energy output , but shift their cost / energy ratios .
That means that even older , more expensive solar installations could become more competitive with non-renewable energy sources .
3 ) It ’s Coming Soon : MIT claims this technology could be ready for commercial production within three years .
A company has already been founded to capitalize on the technology , and it won two prizes at MIT ’s Enterpreneurship Competition , totaling $ 30,000 .
They will also seek more investment over the next few months .
Keep your eyes peeled for Covalent Solar .
But nothing is certain .
Like any new technology , this one has its challenges ahead .
The dyes , for example , have a demonstrated lifespan of ten years , but most solar panels come with twenty or twenty - five year warranties .
Covalent Solar must also run the gamut of any fledgling business to bring their product to market .
With so many improving and emerging solar technologies , they will face a lot of competition .
What makes this technology different is its implications for existing solar installations and expansion into new spaces .
A window that helps power a building could become a powerful tool towards super - efficient or power - producing structures .
The potential for low cost , high efficiency solar technologies has never been greater .

Die Auseinandersetzungen vor dem Bundesverfassungsgericht um die Speicherung der Telefon - und Internet - Verbindungsdaten auf Vorrat gehen weiter : Der Berliner Rechtsanwalt Meinhard Starostik hat im Namen der über 34.000 Bundesbürger , die sich an der Massenverfassungsklage gegen die Vorratsdatenspeicherung beteiligen , vor dem Bundesverfassungsgericht Antrag auf Aussetzung der gesetzlichen Regelungen gestellt .
In Deutschland ist nach den zum 1 . Januar dieses Jahres eingeführten Regelungen zur Vorratsspeicherung von Telekommunikations - und Internet - Verbindungsdaten eine sechsmonatige Speicherung der Daten bei den Providern und Carriern vorgesehen , auf die Strafverfolger bei der Verfolgung von Straftaten und zur Gefahrenabwehr zugreifen dürfen .
Für die Internet - Verbindungsdaten gilt eine Übergangsfrist für die Umsetzung der Speicherpflicht bis Anfang 2009 .
Ende Februar war daraufhin die größte Verfassungsbeschwerde in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik , die der Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung initiiert hatte , auf den Weg gebracht worden : Insgesamt 34.443 Klageschriften gegen die verdachtslose Protokollierung von Telefon - und Internetdaten waren dem Bundesverfassungsgericht übergeben worden .
Das Bundesverfassungsgericht hat daraufhin die Regelungen in einer Eilentscheidung bis zu einem Urteil im Hauptsacheverfahren zwar nicht wie beantragt ausgesetzt , aber eingeschränkt .
Nach dieser Eilentscheidung der Verfassungsrichter müssen Telekommunikationsfirmen zwar Verbindungs - und Standortdaten der Nutzer verdachtsunabhängig sechs Monate vorhalten .
Sicherheitsbehörden dürfen darauf aber nur zur Verfolgung schwerer Straftaten zugreifen .
Zudem muss der Verdacht durch bestimmte Tatsachen begründet und die Erforschung des Sachverhalts auf andere Weise wesentlich erschwert oder aussichtslos sein .
In dem von Parlament und Bundesrat beschlossenen Gesetz zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung ist dagegen beispielsweise auch vorgesehen , dass Ermittler sowie prinzipiell Geheimdienste etwa auch bei " mittels Telekommunikation begangener Straftaten " auf die gespeicherten Verbindungsdaten zugreifen dürfen .
Derzeit sind noch weitere Beschwerden – unter anderem von FDP - und Grünen - Politikern – anhängig .
Auch die Gewerkschaft ver.di hat gegen die Vorratsdatenspeicherung Verfassungsbeschwerde eingelegt .
Mit dem neuen Antrag auf Aussetzung der Vorratsdatenspeicherung , bis das Gericht in der Hauptsache über die Verfassungsmäßigkeit der Vorratsdatenspeicherung entschieden hat , erhoffen sich die Bürgerrechtler nun bessere Chancen als beim ersten Mal .
Sie führen zur Begründung unter anderem eine Forsa - Umfrage an , laut der " die Vorratsdatenspeicherung jeden zweiten Bürger davon abhalte , in sensiblen Angelegenheiten telefonische Beratung in Anspruch zu nehmen " .
Damit habe sich die Annahme aus der Eilentscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts als unzutreffend herausgestellt , die anlasslose Erfassung des Kommunikations - , Bewegungs - und Informationsverhaltens ziehe noch keine irreparablen Beeinträchtigungen nach sich , heißt es zur Begründung des Antrags .
Außerdem habe " der Missbrauch von Verbindungsdaten durch die Deutsche Telekom gezeigt , dass die schädlichen Auswirkungen der Vorratsdatenspeicherung durch bloße Nutzungsbeschränkungen nicht in den Griff zu bekommen seien " .
Im Antrag wird zudem darauf hingewiesen , dass die " Vielzahl der Anbieter von Internetdiensten besondere Risiken für die Sicherheit der Daten schaffe " , daher sei die Aussetzung der ab 2009 zur Pflicht werdenden Vorratsdatenspeicherung für Internet - Zugänge besonders dringlich .
Auch sei es " widersprüchlich , dass Internetnutzer nach der einstweiligen Anordnung vom März 2008 schon bei dem Verdacht von Bagatellvergehen wie Tauschbörsennutzung oder eBay - Betrug mit Hilfe von Vorratsdaten identifiziert werden dürften , eine Herausgabe der Vorratsdaten etwa im Telefonbereich aber nur zur Verfolgung schwerer Straftaten zugelassen sei " .
Der Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung ruft auch für den 11 .
Oktober 2008 zu einer Großkundgebung unter dem Motto " Freiheit statt Angst " auf .
Um möglichst vielen Bürgern eine einfache Teilnahme zu ermöglichen , haben die Bürgerrechtler auch Sonderbusse organisiert .

The case has sparked a debate in Sweden about civil liberties
An eight - year - old boy has sparked an unlikely outcry in Sweden after failing to invite two of his classmates to his birthday party .
The boy 's school says he has violated the children 's rights and has complained to the Swedish Parliament .
The school , in Lund , southern Sweden , argues that if invitations are handed out on school premises then it must ensure there is no discrimination .
The boy 's father has lodged a complaint with the parliamentary ombudsman .
He says the two children were left out because one did not invite his son to his own party and he had fallen out with the other one .
The boy handed out his birthday invitations during class - time and when the teacher spotted that two children had not received one the invitations were confiscated .
" My son has taken it pretty hard , " the boy 's father told the newspaper Sydsvenskan .
" No one has the right to confiscate someone 's property in this way , it 's like taking someone 's post , " he added .
A verdict on the matter is likely to be reached in September , in time for the next school year .
A new kind of malicious software could pose a danger to Windows users who download music files on peer - to - peer networks .
The new malware inserts links to dangerous Web pages within ASF ( Advanced Systems Format ) media files .
" The possibility of this has been known for a little while but this is the first time we 've seen it done , " said David Emm , senior technology consultant for security vendor Kaspersky Lab .
Advanced Systems Format is a Microsoft - defined container format for audio and video streams that can also hold arbitrary content such as images or links to Web resources .
If a user plays an infected music file , it will launch Internet Explorer and load a malicious Web page which asks the user to download a codec , a well - known trick to get someone to download malware .
The actual download is not a codec but a Trojan horse , which installs a proxy program on the PC , Emm said .
The proxy program allows hackers to route other traffic through the compromised PC , helping the hacker essentially cover their tracks for other malicious activity , Emm said .
The malware has worm - like qualities .
Once on a PC , it looks for MP3 or MP2 audio files , transcodes them to Microsoft 's Windows Media Audio format , wraps them in an ASF container and adds links to further copies of the malware , in the guise of a codec , according to another security analyst , Secure Computing .
The " .mp3 " extension of the files is not modified , however , so victims may not immediately notice the change , according to Kaspersky Lab .
Most savvy PC users are aware of the codec ruse , but the style of attack is still effective since many media players do need to receive updated codecs occasionally in order to play files .
" Users downloading from P2P networks need to exercise caution anyway , but should also be sensitive to pop-ups appearing upon playing a downloaded video or audio stream , " Secure Computing said .
Users on a digital audio enthusiast site differed over the danger level of the malware .
" I never allow programs to choose which codecs I use to play back media , " wrote JXL on the Hydrogen Audio forum " I research it and get the codec bundles off of sites I know to be trustworthy and even then I still scan them and check to make sure they are what they are .
I honestly do n't feel that this malware has a very good chance of spreading fast . "
But most users will probably think the prompt to download a codec is just routine business , wrote a user by the nickname of Citay on the same forum .
" I think that outside a minority of users who really know about all the dangers implied with Internet use , the vast majority of people have no idea that such a codec download could lead to a Trojan infection , " Citay wrote .
Trend Micro calls the malware " Troj_Medpinch.a , " Secure Computing named it " " Trojan.ASF.Hijacker.gen " and Kaspersky calls it " Worm. Win32.GetCodec.a . "

FCC chief says Comcast violated Internet rules
The city council said the system helped managers monitor staff web access A city council has blocked its staff from looking at websites about atheism .
Lawyers at the National Secular Society said the move by Birmingham City Council was " discriminatory " and they would consider legal action .
The rules also ban sites that promote witchcraft , the paranormal , sexual deviancy and criminal activity .
The city council declined to comment on the possible legal action , but said the new system helped make it easier for managers to monitor staff web access .
' Very strong case '
The authority 's Bluecoat WebFilter computer system allows staff to look at websites relating to Christianity , Islam , Hinduism and other religions but blocks sites to do with " witchcraft or Satanism " and " occult practices , atheistic views , voodoo rituals or any other form of mysticism " .
Under the Employment Equality ( Religion or Belief ) Regulations 2003 , it is unlawful to discriminate against workers because of their religion or belief , which includes atheism .
National Secular Society president Terry Sanderson said the city council 's rules also discriminated against people who practise witchcraft , which is also classed as a legitimate belief .
We feel very strongly that people who do n't believe should not be denied the access that people who do believe have got
Terry Sanderson , National Secular Society
He said the society would initially contact the council and ask for the policy to be changed , and otherwise pursue legal action .
He said he believed he would have a " very strong case " .
Mr Sanderson said : " It is discriminatory not only against atheists but they also are banning access to sites to do with witchcraft .
" Witchcraft these days is called Wicca , which is an actual legitimate and recognised religion .
" We feel very strongly that people who do n't believe should not be denied the access that people who do believe have got . "
He added that some opinion polls said that up to 25 % of the UK population now considered themselves atheist .
A city council statement said the authority had a " long - standing internet usage policy for staff " .
It added : " We are currently implementing new internet monitoring software to make the control of internet access easier to manage .
" The aim of this is to provide greater control for individual line managers to monitor internet usage , and for departments , such as trading standards and child protection , to gain access , if needed , to certain sites for business reasons . "

What are these ?
Meditation involves silencing our mind .
It is not an intellectual activity , but an attempt to expand our consciousness and be aware of our ‘ real sense of being . ’
Meditation can be a practical tool for relaxation , concentration and better health ; it can also be an invaluable tool to self discovery .
Through meditation we develop the capacity to be content with ourselves as we are .
It is a happiness not dependent on external wealth and success .
If practiced correctly , meditation can be a powerful antidote to depressive thoughts .
How To Meditate
It is hard to pick up meditation from just reading an article , but I would like to share a few basic pointers about what meditation involves .
No matter what form of meditation you follow , the basic shared principle is to quieten your thoughts and mind .
We can sit in a chair for many hours , but , if thoughts continually pass through our mind then our meditation will be ineffective .
Ultimately the aim is to have a mind free of thoughts .
It is in this inner silence that we can experience a consciousness of real peace .
At first glance , people may find the concept of stopping thoughts very difficult .
If you try sitting silent for a while , you will probably be inundated with thoughts .
When giving meditation classes , the difficulty of controlling the thoughts is a common experience .
However , if you sincerely try , you can learn to reduce the power of thoughts over yourself .
These are some tips I suggest for controlling your thoughts :
You control your thoughts not the other way around .
Always remember it is you who can decide which thoughts to pursue and which to reject .
Never feel a slave to your own thoughts , even if at times they seem powerful .
Patience .
Do n’t expect a silent mind after the first few attempts .
We have been thinking all our life ; to change a habit of a lifetime requires persistence and perseverance .
Meditation , like any worthwhile activities requires dedicated and focused intensity .
Detachment .
If you keep rejecting thoughts , what happens is that you may be aware of thoughts , but , they have much less intensity .
A thought bubbles up , but , it becomes easier to detach from it .
You start to see thoughts as independent and outside of yourself .
This is a good sign , it shows you are developing the capacity to separate the sense of self from your mental thoughts .
From this point it becomes easier to stop your thoughts completely .
Concentrate on something .
It is hard to control our thoughts through the power of the mind .
To achieve inner silence it is advisable to choose something to focus our attention on .
This may be the use of a simple mantra ; it may be concentrating on a candle or flower .
Personally , I concentrate on the ‘ heart center ’ .
Try listening to your heart beat and feel your awareness leaving the mind and entering the heart .
If you can consciously leave the mind , it becomes much easier to reduce the power of thoughts .
Intensity .
If we are satisfied with outer life , we will feel no aspiration to meditate .
Effective meditation requires an aspiration to discover inner peace and inner happiness .
Meditation is not something to be done mechanically ; it should be done with intensity and focus .
Meditate with the feeling that this is our last day on earth .
Meditation and Depression
When we are depressed , we will notice a powerful stream of negative thoughts .
Often when we become depressed , we do n’t feel like meditating , everything seems lacking in hope .
However , if we can meditate effectively ; if we can go beyond these negative thoughts and quieten the mind , we really can have a dramatic change in our frame of mind .
This ability to silence the mind is invaluable as an aid to overcome unhappiness .
However , I would caution one thing .
We have to be careful , if we feel miserable or angry , we need to be even more careful that we meditate properly .
If you sit down to meditate but ca n’t stop the thoughts endlessly going round , it is better to give up and try something else like going for a walk .
The reason is that when we meditate there is tremendous intensity .
If we just ‘ concentrate ’ on our negative thoughts we make them more powerful .
Therefore , when meditating to overcome depression , it is even more important to detach from these negative thoughts .
It is the ability to silence the mind and thoughts which will help the depression to clear .
I became interested in meditation when studying in my final year at University .
I had enjoyed the usual student life , but , there I had an increasing sense that something was missing ; nothing could really give the sense of satisfaction I was searching for .
I read a few spiritual books and wanted to try meditation .
I went to some meditation classes organized by the Sri Chinmoy Centre in Oxford and have been meditating as a student of Sri Chinmoy for the past 9 years .

NIST has solved the mystery of WTC 7 , explaining that a brand “ new phenomenon ” was discovered , namely , that “ thermal expansion ” of the thick structural steel of WTC 7 led to its weakening .
In the process of discovering this new phenomenon , NIST also discovered another new phenomenon it calls “ fire ” .
( NIST explained that fire is hot ) .
It was this new thing – fire – which led to the “ thermal expansion ” .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
In addition , NIST has discovered a third new phenomenon called “ gravity ” .
Gravity , NIST explains for the rapt press , makes things “ fall down and go boom ” really fast .
In related news , NIST – the government agency responsible for advancing measurement science , standards , and technology – has announced that nuclear reactors can be powered with play - doh and that our nation ’s fighter jets can be powered by gummy bears .

The Beijing National Stadium , nicknamed " The Bird 's Nest , " has already become an icon in the country of 1.3 billion .
But for some farmers close to Hangzhou ( located in the southeast of China ) , the Herzog & de Meuron structure was just too darn far away ... so in a fit of DIY ingenuity , they built their own replica out of bamboo .
Steel 's apparently kind of hard to get when you 're living on a couple of dollars a day .

Altogether , it took ten bamboo sculptors roughly two weeks to put together the Bird 's Nest ( at a 1:20 scale of the Beijing original ) out of 800 pieces of bamboo .
The villagers say they plan to use the structure for local sports events .
Hmmm ...
As cool as this DIY structure is , I 'm not sure what kind of sport you 'd be able to fit in it .
Ping pong ?

573,639 : The disturbing number of Britons with no criminal record but now registered on Labour ’s DNA database
Nearly 600,000 people never convicted of any crime now have their details stored on Labour ’s DNA database , shock figures reveal .
More than 400,000 of those were added in the past two years , further fuelling the belief that the Government is building a genetic record of the entire population by stealth .
The figure of 573,639 people on the database who have not been convicted , cautioned , formally warned or reprimanded has pushed the overall total to 4.2 million .
Civil rights campaigners and MPs want the police to destroy the DNA records of anyone without a criminal record
In the past two years alone , a total of about one million new people have had their DNA added .
Nearly half of them – 434,176 – have not been convicted of any crime .
Police can take DNA fingerprints from anybody arrested on suspicion of a recordable offence .
But DNA taken from victims and witnesses to separate it from suspects ’ samples at crime scenes can also be added to the database .
The information can be stored indefinitely and potentially matched with samples at crime scenes , even if the suspect is innocent .
Home Office Minister Meg Hillier : Innocent children are included in the database
Civil rights campaigners and MPs have been calling on the Government to change the law to force the police to destroy the DNA records of anyone without a criminal record .
Last month , a Government - funded inquiry called for new laws to limit who can access the database , including restricting police use to ‘ seeking matches from a crime scene ’ .
It also called on Ministers to curtail police powers that allow them to take DNA by force from people picked up for minor offences such as a breach of the peace .
The revelations of the number of ‘ non- criminals ’ being added to the system are contained in internal research statistics obtained by The Mail on Sunday from the National Policing Improvement Agency , which oversees the DNA database .
The research , carried out at the end of March , compared individuals on the DNA database and records on the Police National Computer .
It is the first official figure on the number of ‘ innocents ’ on the database since November 2005 , when there were just 139,463 people on the system who had not been charged or cautioned .
Last week , the Government also revealed its database contained the profiles of almost 40,000 innocent children .
Home Office Minister Meg Hillier said the profiles of an estimated 39,095 ten to 17 - year - olds who ‘ had not been convicted , cautioned , received a final warning / reprimand and had no charge pending against them ’ were on the database .
The UK ’s database is the largest in the world , holding the genetic fingerprints of more than 5 per cent of the population , compared with the equivalent database in the United States , which holds 0.5 per cent of the population .
Before 2001 , the police could take DNA samples during investigations but had to destroy these and the records derived from them if the people concerned were acquitted or charges were not proceeded with .
The law was changed in 2001 to remove this requirement and changed again in 2004 so that DNA samples could be taken from anyone arrested for a recordable offence and detained in a police station .
Neither the Home Office nor the National Policing Improvement Agency would explain the reason for the apparent huge increase in the number of people not convicted of any offence being added to the system .
Last night a spokesman for the National Policing Improvement Agency said the new figures were incomplete and had been produced only for research purposes .
He said : ‘ It is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of people on the National DNA Database who have committed no offence as some relevant conviction and caution records have been weeded from the Police National Computer . ’
He added that he was unable to discuss the apparent increase because it was not ‘ a like - for - like comparison ’ .
And a Home Office spokeswoman said : ‘ The National DNA Database is a key intelligence tool which has revolutionised the way the police can protect the public through identifying offenders and securing more convictions .
‘ It provides critical investigative leads for police investigations , providing on average about 45,000 matches per year . ’
The spokeswoman pointed to the case of Abdul Azad , who was arrested for violent disorder in his Birmingham home in February 2005 .
He had a DNA sample taken and was released without charge .
Later that year a rape happened in Stafford , 25 miles away .
There were no clues until skin from beneath the victim ’s fingernails was profiled and found to match the DNA taken from Azad .
He was jailed for six years .
BAGHDAD – Last night in the mess hall two Georgian officers sat down at the table opposite me .
The one facing me was a bit disheveled ; his uniform top was misbuttoned .
It was the kind of mistake you could make if you were in a hurry .
Both ate quickly and silently .
I wanted to say something , but what do you say at a time like this ?
And I thought , what did I say to my friends in New York on 9 - 11 ?
I rose from my chair , walked over , and asked if they had spoken with their families .
They had .
And they were alright .
The tiny Republic of Georgia , which straddles the land bridge between the world ’s largest lake and the largest inland sea , is home to five million people .
Both in population and in size , it is smaller than the other Georgia most Americans know .
And yet , that miniscule country has provided 2,000 soldiers to assist our mission in Iraq .
Why ?
The answer to that question is obvious when you look at a list of countries who have forces here .
Among the thirty nations are all three Baltic Republics , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Kazakhistan , and the Ukraine–each one a former Soviet Republic–along with several former Soviet Bloc countries including Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , and Romania .
These are all countries who knew oppression .
They knew fear .
And they knew death at the hands of dictators .
They knew one other thing too .
They knew the power of America to transform a hopeless situation .
They knew that America did n’t abandon them .
Sure it took a while , but they knew that America would persevere .
And that they would persevere .
And that they would win .
And they did win .
That ’s why , when in the sixth year of this war , when much of the rest of the world has abandoned America , when even many Americans have abandoned America , they who know best the horror of oppression , and the strength of the American spirit , have not abandoned us here in Iraq .
Albania , Bosnia - Herzegovina , Macedonia , Slovenia , and all the rest who have been allowed out out from behind the Iron Curtain are now looking at America to watch what we do for Georgia .
The phrase just does n’t make sense to people when I first say it : Porno 8 - track tapes .
No , not videos — 8 - track tapes , like from the 70’s .
Audio only .
No , not recordings of porno movie soundtracks .
It ’s like porno for the blind , or X - rated radio theater : improbable scenarios , occasional sound effects , awkward play - by - play of all the action .
Arousing ?
Stilted ?
Downright hilarious ?
You decide .
Like many of the real gems in my audio holdings , I acquired this from Goldmine Records , Columbus Ohio .
I need to take a few moments here to briefly canonize Goldmine and especially Goldmine ’s owner , Joe ( both RIP ) .
Goldmine for me was … well … a goldmine : it was nearby , it was cheap , and good stuff came through regularly .
Joe was just right for it .
Half rock casualty , half Simpsons comic book guy , Joe was a Zappa - worshipping music lover who ran this store for MEN .
And not just all men : the list of people who had been kicked out of the store and banned for life was not short .
The infraction could be anything from questioning Zappa ’s genius ( the signed show poster behind the counter should ’ve warned you ) or “ using the lord ’s name in vain ” as a hand - written notice near the Zappa poster warned .
Joe ’s appreciation for Zappa was n’t just in life — he died the same way as Zappa , too ( prostate cancer ) .
Although I was never big Zappa fan or even for most of Joe ’s likes , he took a shining to me .
I think he simply understood that even though I appreciated confusing things like inappropriate religious records and other shitty sounds , I liked what I liked , and I liked it hard and by the dozen .
And he gave me quantity discounts on those dozens , for which I am so grateful that I ’ll spend paragraphs canonizing him on a blog .
( Record stores , take note … )
These six 8 - tracks , which will be posted in six parts over the next few weeks , were no exception .
Joe held these for me at the store and left one of his characteristically gruff messages on my answering machine to get over there .
Mouth agape , I inspected these 8 - track treasures while he went on about how amazing they were , how rare they were , how he ’d never seen anything like them before .
I was bracing myself for the worst …
“ Alright Joe… how much ? ”
“ Eh — dollar each . ”
I miss Joe .
Wild sex crammed story –
The greatest stag album ever !
You actually hear crystal clear everything that goes on….
THE LUSTFUL SEXLIFE OF A PERVERTED NYMPHO HOUSEWIFE
The first and last tapes of this series are my favorites for many reasons , mainly the voice actresses / actors , the 8 - track artwork , and also the production quality .
The artwork is the first thing to hit you — it ’s dense , way too busy for a small 8 - track .
This is because of that bad habit labels had of just shrinking the 12 ″ album artwork down for 8 - track releases , but get out your magnifying glass because it ’s worth the look for liner notes like : ( enjoy the inappropriate caps )
The first to stick you in the ear with what you want to hear !
YOU’LL BE AMAZED listening to this sexciting audio stage recording , it is many times more stimulating than reading a book , each participant in this sensuously exciting story is alive , you hear real MEN and WOMEN actually SPEAKING with EACH OTHER saying the real words real people say , DRAMATIZING the REAL ACTS that real people do .
There is no doubt about it , you will enjoy being SEDUCED by these tantilizing - tittillating characters .
Get ready for many thrilling nights of listening pleasure , you will be delighted by the drama and stimulating power of this new wave of audio stag recordings .
“ Actually speaking to each other ” …!
Ain’t that a toe - curler ?
But “ dramatizing ” is a key word here : this audio porn , meaning that all the action must be verbally described .
If you thought fumbling with a difficult bra hook is an awkward moment in bed , try play - by - play narrative about every relevant action , excretion , and orifice .
But … writing about audio porn is like dancing about architecture .
Just go listen .
The full MP3 transfer is below .
Apologies for the lousy sound quality — blame the lousy 8 - track tape player I used , after failing to find a better one at five thrift stores .
But bad recordings are better than no recordings , right ?
Send me a better 8 - track deck and I ’ll send you the resulting improved transfers .
Free gift inside ! ( worth $ 2.00 ) A genuine French tickler novelty
This release is catalog number A8T - 1002 from Audio Stag Records , “ A product of Unique Ideas , Inc. / 1674 Broadway , N.Y.C. , N.Y. 10019 ” .
Dedicated to Joe ( RIP ) and Goldmine Records ( Columbus , Ohio ) for providing this gold , and so many more treasures .
It seems like no matter what I do , I can not sleep through the night .
Will it ever let up ?
According to the data , the answer is no and it will only get worse .

Summary :
• DNS servers had a core bug , that allows arbitrary cache poisoning
– The bug works even when the host is behind a firewall
– There are enough variants of the bug that we needed a stopgap before working on something more complete
• Industry rallied pretty ridiculously to do something about this , with hundreds of milllions protected
• DNS clients are at risk , in certain circumstances
• We are entering ( or , perhaps , holding back a little longer ) a third age of security research , where all networked apps are “ fair game ”
– Autoupdate in particular is a mess , broken by design ( except for Microsoft )
• SSL is not the panacea it would seem to be
– In fact , SSL certs are themselves dependent on DNS
• DNS bugs ended up creating something of a “ skeleton key ” across almost all major websites , despite independent implementations
• Internal networks are not at all safe , both from the effects of Java , and from the fact that internal routing could be influenced by external activity
– The whole concept of the fully internal network may be broken – there are just so many business relationships – and , between IPsec not triggering and SSL not being cert- validated , these relationships may not be secure
– We ’re not even populating CDN ’s securely !

WASHINGTON , D.C. -- Despite assurances to the contrary from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Democratic insiders are certain Sen.
Joseph Lieberman next year will be kicked out of the party 's caucus and lose his Senate chairmanship if he addresses the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn. , as planned .
Lieberman 's Democratic colleagues willing to accept his support of Sen. John McCain for president consider speaking to the GOP convention as the last straw .
Lieberman was re-elected from Connecticut as an independent in 2006 after losing the Democratic nomination because of his support for the Iraq war .
After his 2006 election , the Senate Democratic leadership agreed to give Lieberman the Homeland Security Committee chairmanship if he provided the decisive vote to make the Democrats a 51 to 49 Senate majority .
However , with additional Democratic senators likely to be elected this year , that agreement is expected to be null and void in the new Congress .
Obama Outside
Old Democratic hands believe Sen. Barack Obama 's decision to deliver his presidential nomination acceptance speech at the 75,000 - seat Denver Broncos football stadium Aug. 28 ignores a lesson from 48 years ago .
The last presidential nominee to deliver an outdoor acceptance speech was John F. Kennedy in 1960 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum .
That diminished the impact of one of his best campaign speeches , in which he unveiled the " New Frontier . "
The then - 100,000 - seat Coliseum was only half filled , and the sound was imperfect .
Technical advances in sound projection have been made in the last half - century , and Obama has been particularly effective in large outdoor venues .
Nevertheless , Democratic pros feel the safer course for Obama would have been to give the speech in the 19,000 - seat Pepsi Center , where the convention is being held .
Saving McCain
The nine Republican senators who switched positions Wednesday to pass the Medicare bill were taking their presidential candidate , Sen . John McCain , off the hook to avoid the wrath of senior citizens and doctors .
McCain , who was on the campaign trail , was absent June 26 when the Senate fell one vote short of the 60 needed to pass a bill stopping a cut in Medicare payments to physicians .
With his Democratic opponent , Sen. Barack Obama , present when the bill came up again Wednesday , Republicans feared that McCain would be blamed for blocking the measure .
The absent McCain was still opposed , but the nine Republicans switchers made his position moot .
Three of the GOP converts are up for re-election this year and were under heavy pressure from the American Medical Association .
McCain Without Murphy
The possible return of political consultant Mike Murphy to help Sen. John McCain 's campaign is definitely off , with the Republican presidential candidate 's aides putting out word that Murphy will not be back .
He has signed with NBC as a campaign commentator .
McCain was interested in returning Murphy , a key strategist in his 2000 presidential campaign .
But it was determined that Murphy would cause too much friction within McCain 's staff .
Murphy was not involved in the battle for this year 's Republican presidential campaign .
He had been close to both McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , and did not want to choose between them .
Barney 's Retreat
The House Republican minority scored a rare victory over the usually masterful Rep. Barney Frank , when he pulled from the House floor Wednesday a bill to protect as a " scenic wilderness " site the Taunton River at urban Fall River , Mass . , in his district .
Such measures are routinely approved when sponsored by a powerful committee chairman such as Frank .
However , Republicans launched a campaign contending that the bill was intended to block a liquefied natural gas terminal opposed by Frank .
A surprised Frank indicated he was not prepared for a floor fight .
" It 'll come back , " Frank was quoted by Congress Daily .
Congressional sources later said Frank might try again this coming week , with a possibility that the LNP terminal would be carved out and not included in the protected scenic area .
Football and Politics
Robert Wood Johnson IV , chairman and CEO of the New York Jets football team , this week will be named national finance chairman of the host committee for the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn .
Head of a personal investment company based in New York City , Johnson has been a fundraiser for Sen. John McCain .
He ran one McCain event in Manhattan that yielded $ 7 million .
He has family ties in Minnesota , where his mother resides .
US Financial System in Crisis as Government Hides the Truth to Prevent Bond Market Panic
Martin Weiss writes : With America 's economy sinking rapidly into recession , with much of America 's financial system teetering on the brink , and with a presidential election just three months from today , our leaders in Washington are under siege .
What are they saying behind closed doors ?
What worst - case scenarios are they contemplating ?
What contingency measures are they debating ?
I have no pretense of being privy to the answers .
Nor can anyone forecast what they will do in the press of events .
But we do have abundant research and data to serve as a basis for guessing .
Add a healthy dose of imagination , and I can begin to draft a script , below .
Just bear in mind that what follows is fiction — a scenario that I trust will give you greater insight into the dire reality of our times , along with a better understanding of what 's likely to come .
The Last Government Rescue
( Draft Script for a Fictional Scene )
A regularly scheduled meeting between Treasury Secretary Paulson and Fed Chairman Bernanke is hastily expanded to include the CEOs of Fannie Mae and General Motors , plus former Fed Chairmen Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker .
The Treasury Secretary seeks unanimous vows of confidentiality and opens the discussion with an air of confidence .
His immediate agenda :
To get everyone on the same page to make consistent public pronouncements in support of the government 's rescue efforts for the economy .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson : Gentlemen , I know we have problems , and that 's why we 're here today .
But let 's begin by counting our blessings :
The stimulus plan has supported the economy during this difficult period , and it could n't have been timelier .
American families spent , American companies invested , and the country as a whole benefited from strong export growth .
Yes , I know the 1.9 % growth in GDP in the second quarter disappointed some people .
But a lot of that was due to a decline in inventories , which is healthy .
The economy is not contracting ; it 's growing .
Employment is still historically very high .
Inflation is still historically low .
Moreover , this is the message I would hope to see everyone put out .
In normal times , I would n't presume to tell you what to say or how to say it .
But in this unsettling climate — in this atmosphere of frazzled nerves on Wall Street — the last thing we need is dissenting voices from the administration , from former government officials or even from industry .
To restore confidence — to prevent panic — we must present a united front , a single voice that resonates with the public , that 's credible , that can inspire , that can motivate investors to invest and banks to lend .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke : I agree .
We have to tell the truth .
But there should be no rush to tell the whole truth .
Always count your blessings , and do so publicly .
Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan : Blessings ?
This is a disaster and it 's getting worse .
The United States is living through a once - in - a - century crisis tied to the plunge in home prices , and those prices are nowhere near a bottom .
Paulson : I know housing continues to be at the heart of our economic challenges and remains our most significant downside risk .
I know home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis .
I know foreclosures are going to be increasing .
And I did n't say we should deny these realities in public .
I myself have recently admitted to all of them — in speeches , in front of dozens of TV cameras .
Bernanke :
My sense is that if we do n't acknowledge at least some of the most obvious issues , we look foolish .
Paulson : Agreed .
But you and I also agree that we do n't have to be so blunt as to cause panic in the markets .
Look .
I 'm not asking anyone here today to ignore the issues .
What I 'm asking is that we do everything we can to stress the positive .
Focus on the big steps we 've taken — like the stimulus package and the housing legislation .
Talk about the brevity of the current correction and the longevity of the coming recovery .
Give people hope , damn it !
Do n't run around talking about the housing market as a bottomless pit ... or about the huge risks the Fed is taking by inserting itself into broker balance sheets ... or about Fannie Mae being insolvent .
Greenspan :
The last of those three statements was not mine .
But it 's true .
Fannie Mae is insolvent .
And what you 're advocating — that we sugarcoat the realities even more than we normally do — is a huge mistake in its own right .
The sooner people face the music , the sooner they 'll deal with it and the quicker we 'll get this thing behind us .
The longer we cover it up and pussyfoot around , the worse it 's going to be in the long run .
I said it once , and I 'll say it again : Gentlemen , face it .
This is a disaster and it 's getting worse .
Home prices , which we said would stabilize , are doing nothing of the kind .
Detroit , which we said would be turning the corner , is falling off a cliff .
The credit crunch , which we said was ending , looks like it 's just beginning a new , broader phase .
Inflation , which we said was moderate , is doubling .
The federal deficit monkey , which we said was tamed , is going wild again .
That 's what folks out there are talking about .
That 's what 's in their face every day on the nightly news .
Heck , the only " good " thing I hear anyone talking about nowadays is the fact that a barrel of oil costs " only " $ 125 , which , I need not remind you , is double what it was last year .
Paulson :
So that 's what you want to tell the American people ?
That " this is a disaster and it 's getting worse " ?
Greenspan :
No , but how can we address the dangers we face if our primary agenda is to disguise the true gravity of those dangers ?
First , we risk losing all credibility — looking like horse 's asses .
Second , we risk a situation in which we ourselves start believing our own B.S.
But most fundamentally , we risk losing the opportunity to cure the cancer before it spreads to critical organs of our economic body .
Fannie Mae CEO : I can no longer dispute the comment that we 're insolvent .
Paulson : Please give us a heads up on that .
Fannie Mae :
This week , we are going to announce still another round of downgrades in our forecasts for credit losses .
We 've already warned investors that credit - related losses , such as payouts on loans we guarantee , were going to rise for the rest of the year .
But this market is crumbling far faster than anyone dreamed possible .
Even the Jeremiahs and Cassandras at Fannie Mae — and believe me , there are more of them coming out of the closet every day — even they underestimated how fast the home market could come unglued .
Even they underestimated the degree to which that pattern would persist through the present and into the future .
Look at the numbers that just came out .
You 've got home prices falling far faster than expected .
You 've got more people defaulting on their mortgages at a faster pace than expected .
And you 've got foreclosures spreading faster than anything we 've ever seen in the history of this country .
It 's a revolution .
It 's sweeping the country like wildfire .
And it 's being led by people willing to abandon their homes without the least remorse .
Paulson : Bottom line ?
Fannie Mae : Bottom line , the forecast we made back in May — and Freddie Mac 's forecasts as well — are way off target .
Paulson :
Is that why Standard & Poor 's just raised its loss estimates on your risky loans ?
Is that why Wall Street is saying you may not have enough capital to offset those losses ?
Fannie Mae : Yes .
We did ratchet up our expectation for 2008 credit loss ratio to at least double our historical range .
But now we know it 's going to be a lot worse .
Paulson : OK .
I understand .
But whatever you do , do n't admit to the idea that you 're insolvent .
Stick to our story !
Your primary regulator , OFHEO , says you have adequate capital .
I 've testified before Congress that you have adequate capital .
You 've said you have adequate capital .
We can't let the market bust our bubble .
Fannie Mae : Bust our bubble ?
The bubble has already burst , and look who 's getting stuck with most of the foreclosed properties : Fannie Mae .
Let me give you a concrete example :
We have 5,000 real estate brokers all over the country handling our foreclosure sales .
And in Flint , Michigan , we have one broker trying to sell one particular home for a price that will shock you .
Paulson : About thirty or forty thousand dollars ?
Fannie Mae : No .
He first tried to sell it for $ 6,900 .
But he had no takers .
So then he cut the price to $ 5,000 .
Still no buyers !
And this is a three - bedroom home in a residential neighborhood we 're talking about .
Not a two - door Chevy on a used car lot !
Bernanke : How widespread is this ?
Fannie Mae : Just in the first quarter , we got saddled with twice the number of homes through foreclosure than we could sell .
We 're trying to get rid of them quickly .
But we keep falling further and further behind .
Bernanke :
How much do you and Freddie Mac have in foreclosed homes on your books ?
Fannie Mae : As of March 31 , $ 6.9 billion worth .
Right now , much more .
Bernanke :
That 's a lot , but in proportion to the $ 5 trillion - plus in mortgages that you and Freddie own or guarantee , it does n't sound like that much to me .
Fannie Mae : Maybe not .
But try this arithmetic exercise :
Throw together all the foreclosed homes owned by every single one of the nation 's 8,500 commercial banks and thrifts .
How much do you think that adds up to ?
I 'll tell you .
It adds up to a figure of $ 8.56 billion .
See that ?
8,500 banks and thrifts have $ 8.56 billion in foreclosed homes .
But between Fannie and Freddie — just two companies — we 're stuck with almost as much — $ 6.9 billion .
In fact , if you look at all the money tied up in foreclosed homes in the U.S. , about $ 4 of every $ 10 is our burden .
Bernanke :
What are you doing about it ?
Fannie Mae : Until now , our stated goal has been to always try to get the highest possible price , even if that meant hanging on to the properties longer .
But that 's about to change .
Now , we 're going to have to start pricing our properties a lot more aggressively .
And consider this :
Once we send the directive to our 5,000 brokers across the country — to start dumping — there 's no way we can keep that directive under wraps .
The Street will know .
Everyone will see what 's really going on .
Paulson : Could it be that you are overstating the price declines and the losses that they could cause ?
Take that house in Michigan , for example .
It must have been a dump to begin with .
Do you know how much it sold for originally ?
Fannie Mae :
It 's a dump all right .
It needs a new roof .
It needs new carpeting .
The plumbing has been ripped out .
But just three years ago , in 2005 , it was not a dump .
Three years ago , it sold for $ 110,000 .
So even assuming we can find a buyer for the $ 5,000 , its price has fallen by over 95 % .
Naturally , most of our foreclosed homes for sale have n't fallen that far , that fast .
But this gives you an anecdotal illustration of what we 're up against .
And it gives you a sneak preview of the much deeper home price declines that are possible in the future .
Paulson :
But how widespread is this , really ?
Fannie Mae :
What definition are we using for " widespread " ?
If I told you that among the supposedly " AAA " rated subprime mortgage securities issued in 2006 , the default rate is now about 85 % , would that qualify as " widespread " ?
Paulson : Eighty - five percent ?
Fannie Mae : Yes , 85 % !
And I 'm not referring to a small , little subset of our portfolio .
We 've got about $ 70 billion in subprime and Alt - A securities in our portfolio .
Freddie Mac is even more at risk , with nearly $ 150 billion .
And that 's not even our primary concern .
Our primary concern is the surging foreclosure rate in " prime , " supposedly " high - quality , " " safe " mortgages , which represent the bulk of the paper we hold or guarantee .
Paulson :
What is your official posture on that aspect ?
Fannie Mae :
We used to say all this was " contained . "
Now we 're trying to put out the message that it's " temporary . "
But we can't keep up that fiction much longer .
Paulson :
Why not ?
Fannie Mae :
One reason is that , until recently , at least the rating agencies were playing along with us on this , postponing downgrades , keeping the fantasy alive .
But now they 're downgrading this paper step by step .
They 're forcing Fannie Mae — and all of us here around this table — to face reality .
They 're telling us that , until we face reality , this is going to be an endless soap opera .
Paulson : I know all about that .
But what makes you say you 're insolvent ?
Fannie Mae : I was afraid you 'd come back to that .
Because , I must say , that 's the big , immediate downside of facing reality .
When we face reality , we 're going to have to increase our reserves by such a huge amount , it will finally be abundantly obvious , even to our dearest friends at OFHEO , that we are not adequately capitalized after all — that we are , indeed , insolvent , bankrupt .
Now I ask you :
How much longer can we hide this from the public ?
From ourselves ?
A few weeks ?
Days ?
Paulson : I do n't get it .
I just do n't get it .
I 'm not talking just about Fannie Mae .
I mean the entire economy .
The Fed cut interest rates all the way down to 2 % .
But that did n't do the trick .
We rushed through the stimulus package , and that helped a bit , but barely enough to keep things going for another quarter .
Now what do we do ?
Now what do we say to the American people ?
General Motors CEO : I 'll tell you what you do .
You do whatever it takes to keep Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac capitalized , even if that means making them wards of the United States government .
You do whatever it takes to keep banks like Washington Mutual , Wachovia — and certainly mega-giants like Citigroup and HSBC — capitalized .
And while you 're before Congress , or the president , or the McCain or Obama people — and while you 're making the case that the GSEs and the big banks are vital to America 's financial security — you must also make the case that our nation 's great auto manufacturers are equally vital to America 's security .
You talk about home prices plunging .
But have you seen the collapse in used SUV prices ?
At the end of a two - year lease , one of our most popular SUVs was supposed to be worth $ 22,000 .
But as it turns out , the best price we can get for it in the used car market is less than $ 11,000 .
You talk of a housing collapse .
But please do n't ignore the auto industry collapse .
You talk about a mortgage collapse .
But God help us all if you ignore the collapse in auto credit !
And do n't forget the collapse in auto leasing that 's coming with the collapse in used car prices .
Most people are clueless about what 's really going on , even analysts on Wall Street .
For example , we 've just reported a $ 15.5 billion loss for the second quarter ... and that does n't even begin to reflect the big write - offs from the auto leasing debacle .
The $ 15.5 billion loss equates to a loss of $ 27.33 per share .
But you want to know the loss most people on Wall Street were expecting ?
Less than $ 3 per share !
So , yeah , sure , we did a good job of " putting out a positive message . "
And , yeah , we fooled them all right .
But what good did it do us ?
All it did was give us an excuse to delay much - needed action .
Paulson :
What kind of additional action were you contemplating ?
General Motors :
For starters , telling it like it is — telling you , telling Congress and telling the American people that unless you give us the same access to capital and funding as you 're giving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ...
Paulson : ...
But the reports I saw last month said you had plenty of cash — enough to last at least a year , maybe two .
General Motors :
That was our messaging , yes .
And we tried to convince folks that " we knew what was coming in the latest horrendous sales results , " that " we knew what we needed to do to respond and react . "
But now it looks like we really did not know .
Now it looks like we 'll run out of cash a lot sooner .
So like I was starting to say , unless we get federal help , General Motors is history .
Ford is history .
Chrysler is history .
Paulson :
And you still believe that where GM goes , so goes the United States ?
General Motors : Yes , I do .
Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker : I 've been listening to all this with increasing unease .
Gentlemen , do you not see where this discussion is headed ?
It 's headed toward nationalization of the GSEs , nationalization of Detroit 's Big Three , nationalization of major banks .
Earlier , it was said that this thing is spreading like a cancer .
What was really meant by that phrase ?
Well , I can't answer for the person who first spoke it , but I can give you my own interpretation of its meaning :
The truly dangerous cancer that 's spreading is the cancer of mistrust .
First , mistrust in subprime mortgages .
Then , mistrust in higher quality mortgages .
Now , mistrust in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
If it were mistrust based on unfounded rumor , we could ignore it .
But if it 's mistrust based on hard data that 's been distorted , quarantined or simply lied about ... then that 's another matter entirely .
Let me fast - forward to the final , fatal stage of this cancer , the stage we must avoid at all costs .
Let me take you to the day , however unlikely that day is , when it could spread to the U.S. government itself , when investors all over the world can no longer trust the debt of the United States Treasury Department .
Gentlemen , I know what I 'm talking about .
I looked the precursor of that mistrust in the eyes nearly three decades ago , in my first year as Fed chairman .
And in those days , we did not have collapsing mortgage markets or collapsing auto markets or insolvent GSEs .
All we had was plain - vanilla , double - digit inflation , without all these extra alarm bells and whistles .
In that sense , the mistrust back then was less complex — and more manageable — than it is today .
But it was powerful nonetheless — so powerful , in fact , that it nearly shut down the entire market for U.S. government bonds .
Greenspan : I meet a lot of people who do n't remember that time , or do n't quite grasp its significance .
Please help make sure everyone in this meeting does .
Volcker : It was 1980 .
We were meeting at Camp David .
Present were President Carter , myself , the Treasury Secretary , plus CEOs from Merrill Lynch , Salomon Brothers and other primary government security dealers .
In some ways , this meeting today reminds me of that meeting then — the same sense of siege , the same philosophical disagreements .
But there was one aspect we all agreed upon :
The spreading investor mistrust in U.S. government bonds .
That mistrust was so intense and so widespread , we could not sell U.S. government bonds .
Treasury bills were still fine .
But not bonds .
No one wanted long - term bonds and the entire market for them was as close to a total shutdown as it's ever been in the history of our country .
Greenspan :
Go into the crux of the crisis .
Volcker :
The crux of the crisis was that the fear of inflation was so intense , and government bond prices were going down so swiftly , there were virtually no more buyers of government bonds .
Worse , primary government security dealers had lost so much money from falling bond prices that they were afraid to buy them at auction , hold them in inventory and resell them .
Yet that 's precisely what we needed from them .
It 's through those dealers that the U.S. government sells nearly all of its bonds .
It 's through them that we raise nearly all of the money we need to refund maturing bonds and fund the government 's day - to - day operations .
Our network of government security dealers is much like GM 's network of auto dealers .
The dealers buy the merchandise at auction , mark it up , put it on their lots and then hope to resell it .
Now , imagine what would happen if GM 's dealer network were to shut down !
How would GM be able to sell its cars ?
That 's the same kind of situation the U.S. government was facing for its bonds in those dark days of early 1980 .
Except for a couple of the biggest dealers , like Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch , nearly all the government security dealers were shutting down their government bond operations .
Salomon would call Merrill to sell what 's considered a small lot of , say , $ 100 million in 20 - year Treasury bonds .
At the same time , someone else at Merrill would call Salomon to place a similar trade .
It was like two kids trying to trade the same marbles .
There were no buyers .
Virtually all the other dealers had packed up and gone home .
The point is , in that environment , we could not sell U.S. bonds .
Three - month Treasury bills ?
No problem .
People trusted us for three months .
But 20 - or 30 - year Treasury bonds ?
No !
The market for Treasury bonds had dried up .
And without it , the U.S. government simply could not continue to fund its own operations , could n't meet payroll .
Hard to believe , but true :
We faced a shutdown of the U.S. government .
Our only answer was to kill the monster that had fomented all the mistrust — inflation .
But to do that , we had to jack up interest rates .
We had to cut off credit to millions of Americans .
And in the process , we knew we were going to squash the economy .
Carter was up for re-election .
So you can imagine his initial resistance to the Draconian steps we were proposing .
But he had no choice .
To bring the point home , he was asked : " Which do you prefer :
The chance of losing the election in November ?
Or the certainty of the presidential paycheck bouncing right now in February ? "
Paulson :
Can we bring this back to the present ?
Volcker : Absolutely .
Let 's bring this back to the present by asking this question :
Is this the direction you want to take the country ?
If anyone in this room is willing to take that risk , say so now or forever hold your peace .
Because that 's the inevitable fork in the road ahead — the end of the fast lane you 're now on .
I 'm referring to the fast lane of open - ended government bailouts .
The fast lane of " consistent messaging " to cover up the true cause — and the true consequences — of these bailouts .
Henry , never forget : Millions of investors , mostly overseas , have put their faith in U.S. government securities .
They 've loaned you their money because they trusted you , the U.S. Treasury Department .
If you turn around now and pour their money down the bottomless pits we talked about today — Fannie and Freddie , GM and Ford , major banks — what do you think their reaction will be ?
What makes you believe that they 'll respond any differently than they did in 1980 , when they disappeared from the U.S. government security market or , worse , dumped their bonds in fear ?
What makes you believe you can stop the cancer of mistrust from spreading to 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue — to the U.S. Treasury Department itself ?
When and if that day arrives , I know we will make the right choices .
I am absolutely sure we will never let U.S. Treasury bonds become the next victims of the subprime crisis .
But if we know this now — if we CAN look ahead now and see that 's the ultimate choice we will confront someday ... why not make the right choice now , while our economy is still standing , while our country still has the resources to make the needed sacrifices ?
Face it , gentlemen :
The last government rescue must not be to save the government itself .
It must be one of the first government rescues .
We must first save ourselves .
Good luck and God bless !

08 Aug 08 , 03:27 Bond Auctions ( US Treashury Debt ) ;
Excellent " hypothetical scenario " , I really do think the US will at some point default on it's debt obligations of greater than 8 trillion , leaving foriegn investors holding the bag on worthless treashury notes which the US will then pay back with inflated dollars reminiscent of Wiemar Germany 's " worthless deutchmarks " .

19 Nov 08 , 15:42 Crisis and Geopolitical implications
I think another possible issue is the geopolitical implications of the crisis - is it not beyond reason that the US administration might hold the nuclear gun to those countries who currently purchase USTBs to continue to do so - of course if this is done a crisis will be manufactured and the countries in question will be portrayed as totalitarian aggressive governments and threatening the " free world "

With the debut of the new version of meOwns we have introduced several features that are concerned with how objects are related to each other .
In the user profile page , you get a list of other user that are similar to him / her .
And you are faced with the chemistry meter which tells you how much you are related to this user ( if you are logged in of course ) .
If you happen to be viewing your own profile page you will get a list of recommended items that you might be interested in .
Last but not least , when you view an item , you get a list of similar items .
In this article I will be talking about the features from an implementation point of view .
Naturally the first hurdle was to define the problem .
What we needed was to find a way to match items and users .
So first we needed to represent them in a way that can be matched .
We started from the items first and looked at how to match two items together .
What is an item ?
In meOwns an item is simply a name , a description , a type and some tags .
We decided to ignore photos and comments from the item .
Each of those fields gets a weight which affects the value of terms found in it .
Here is a sample product ( encoded in Yaml ) :
The above fields are then processed to extract relevant terms from them , this is done in the following manner
The above can be represented as follows :
After doing so , we create a list of terms with their frequencies , each field has a frequency multiplier according to its significance .
Assumming a multiplier value of 1 for all the fields
This Term - Frequency vector is the basis of doing item matching in meowns .
Several different approaches can be implemented to reach an item representation .
Even the details of a given approach can vary significantly .
I have chosen to stick to the easiest approach in the initial implementation .
Those willing to dig further are free to lookup more into document representation and indexing strategies .
User representation is just an aggregation of their item ( and wished item ) representations .
This way user and items share the same term vector structure and hence we can match users to items as much as we can match items to items and users to users .
The matching process involves further encoding of the term frequency vector .
Those in the academia refer to this as TF - IDF ( Term Frequency , Inverse Document Frequency ) representation .
In lay man 's terms this is a representation of how significant a term is to the certain document .
It is composed of the product of two parts .
This first which is TF ( Term Frequency ) is simply the frequency of the term in the document divided by the total sum of frequency of terms in the same document .
The second ( IDF ) is the total number of documents in the corpse ( the document store ) divided by the number of documents which contain this term .
If the term is found in all documents then the IDF will be equal to 1 and hence wo n't have an effect on the final product of the two parts .
On the other hand , if we have a corpus of 1,000,000 documents and only one with the given term then it will multiply the TF value by 1,000,000 which is significant .
A slight variation ( widely used ) is to multiply the TF with the Logarithmic value of the IDF .
After we are done calculating TF - IDF values for all the terms in term vectors matching can be done as follows
The returned value is called the cosine similarity between the two items .
It ranges between 0 and 1 where zero means no correlation and one means exact match .
We are still experimenting with threshold values but these are essentially the figures you get when you see another user 's chemistry meter for example .
In another installment we will discuss how are we implementing behind the scenes matching of users and items in an efficient way .
Just to justify calling the post document matching in Ruby , here 's a Ruby code to implement the above
The above methods enable us to extract the terms from different items .
The first method refers to a global ( bad me ) stop word list which should be present .
Now that we have the items represented as term frequencies we can generate their tf - idf vectors ( we will keep them as hashes though ) and we can use them to do the matching Pretty easy , now you get a value between 0 and 1 that represents how similar those two items are .
One of the presentations I was most disappointed to miss at OSCON was Evan Henshaw - Plath and Kellan Elliott - McCrea ‘s talk entitled “ Beyond REST ?
Building Data Services with XMPP PubSub . ”
Not because I ’ve somehow given up on the REST architectural approach that we ’ve been arguing on behalf since , oh , forever .
No , I ’m fascinated by XMPP because of the difficulties some startups – Twitter being the canonical example – have had scaling in certain dimensions .
Dimensions that might be in XMPP ’s sweet spot .
But also because we ’re generally different - tools - for - different - jobs kind of folks .
And XMPP is most certainly a different tool , as Kellan and Rabble ’s presentation reminds us .
Consider the proposition , for instance , of AMQP internally to AtomPub / XMPP externally .
No , my interest in XMPP is not a binary , mutually exlusive REST and / or , but rather a recognition that the technology that is more than instant messaging might be poised for a role in more than just instant messaging .
Nor is this some unique obsession of mine ; smarter folks like Dion ( Google / Ajaxian ) and Matt ( WordPress ) were similarly intrigued by Rabble and Kellan ’s deck .
As was , most interestingly , Joshua Schachter of del.icio.us and Yahoo fame .
It was his post , in fact , that triggered the interview that follows .
In it , Joshua pushes back on XMPP as the solution publish / subscribe architectural dilemma , proposing as an alternative a simple HTTP based callback system that would retrieve fragments of a syndicated format ( RSS being the example ) .
Creatively monikered PIMP ( PIMP Is Mostly Push ) .
It ’s sort of a HTTP based alternative to this , in fact .
The discussion that ensued in the comments to the post was really fascinating .
At least to me .
Enough so that I decided to ping a friend of mine who knows a bit about XMPP with a few questions .
This friend , for the sake of full disclosure , also happens to work for a RedMonk client ( Jabber ) , so feel free to read into that whatever you like .
Thus we have a Q&A , finally , that is not with myself .
That ’s right , we ’ve actually got a second party for you this time .
The interviewee , in this case , is none other than the CTO of Jabber , Joe Hildebrand ( second from the right here ) .
I hope the below contributes to the discussion that we ’re seeing now ; if it does , thank Joe .
It it does n’t , blame me .
One last quick note : the questions may seem oddly redundant in light of the above intro : that was because they were written first .
I chose not to edit my questions so as to not affect Joe ’s answers .
SOG : For the folks out there that might not be intimately familiar with XMPP , could you explain it and its value in a few sentences ?
JH : The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ( XMPP ) is a standardized protocol for :
Streaming chunks of XML at Internet scale
Exchanging information about the availability of endpoints ( presence )
Addressing messages to those endpoints
Originally known as the “ Jabber Protocol ” , XMPP was originally designed by Jeremie Miller ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremie_Miller) in 1998 in reaction to his perceived need for bringing together all of the proprietary IM services .
Instead of writing a multi- protocol client , he decided to put all of the interoperability on a server where the protocol definitions could be updated centrally .
He needed a protocol to get to that server , and since XML was hot at the time , I now have to deal with XML namespace madness . 🙂
XMPP has been standardized by the IETF in two main RFCs .
RFC 3920 ( http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html) specifies the lower - level streaming mechanism , addressing , framing , authentication , encryption , and internationalization .
RFC 3921
( http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3921.html) specifies how you build a presence and messaging system on top of the streaming layer .
Both of these RFCs are in the final stages of incorporating implementation experience at the moment ; the “ bis ” drafts with all of the clarifications and improvements can be found at xmpp.org ( http://www.xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3920bis-06.html, http://www.xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3921bis-06.html).
The RFCs give you enough protocol for a basic IM service , but one of the key goals of XMPP is extensibility .
With a very small number of delivery semantics , you can solve * many * different kinds of problems , many of which are not IM - related at all .
A good number of these extensions have been standardized at the XMPP Standards Foundation as XMPP Extension Protocols ( XEPs ) ( http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/).
The process for adding and modifying these standardized extensions is completely open ; we encourage anyone with comments or contributions to join the appropriate mailing list ( http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards).
However , keep in mind that many folks create their own protocol extensions .
There is no requirement for your extension to be public , documented , or open in any way , unless you want to be able to interoperate easily with software you did n’t write .
That ’s a business decision you can make ; XMPP software tends to be really good at ignoring extensions it does n’t understand , so you wo n’t break the network by innovating .
[ed : that was a few sentences ? ;) ]
SOG : Interest in XMPP seems to be peaking at the moment , from IBM ’s Sam Ruby making it one of his long bets to Evan Henshaw - Plath and Kellan Elliott - Mcrea ’s presentation at OSCON last week .
What is it about XMPP that ’s making it , like Hansel , so hot right now ?
JH : Many people are coming to the conclusion that HTTP polling does n’t work .
It does n’t scale , and it ca n’t deal with high - flow feeds without missing data that scrolls off the end of your feed during the interval between polls .
I would say that Twitter is a pretty extreme example of this problem , but there are lots of other sites have starting to want to allow third - parties to get access to their information with short latency .
As an example , imagine you wanted to have a site that did cool visualization of all of the changes to Wikipedia , as the changes were made .
Since there are more sites interested in sharing information than ever before , we ’re seeing many people come to this same conclusion at the same time , looking for an open , standards - based , widely - implemented solution to the problem .
Ergo : XMPP buzz .
SOG : Are there any current obvious problems or issues with web services or applications that you see on a daily basis that you think could be ameliorated via the usage of XMPP ?
JH : Let ’s dig into the scale issue .
If you want to make HTTP work for these sorts of solutions , there are a couple of paths :
Poll very frequently .
This adds a * horrific * amount of load to your web server .
Keep a connection open to the HTTP server with a request that only gets answered when there is new data ( sometimes known as the “ Comet ” approach ) .
Many web servers are not optimized for keeping large numbers of sockets open for days .
Unless you are using something like BOSH ( XEP - 0206 : http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0206.html), writing the server - side of this can be difficult , particularly when it comes to addressing the correct endpoint .
Use some sort of HTTP callback mechanism , where you give the sender the URL of a service to call when there is new information .
This requires the receiver to be hosted on an externally - reachable web server , for your server to have some large amount of uptime , and for the sender to be able to send large numbers of updates frequently .
To send these updates , you need to figure out which connection you ’re going to send on if you ’re already connected , do the TCP three - way handshake and SSL negotiation if you ’re not connected .
At the end of all of that , you still have to layer on some sort of authentication and / or authorization system for the sender and receiver to have any idea who the other end is .
If you want to use XMPP , it ’s more straightforward :
Have an XMPP server on both the sender and receiver side ( this might be collapsed down to one server if you like )
Receiver registers interest in notifications .
This might be a presence subscription , a XEP - 0060 ( http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html) subscription , a web page , or whatever .
Sender sends , potentially only when the other side is available .
Receiver receives , whenever they are available .
Encryption , authentication , authorization and the like are all handled by the XMPP layer .
Both endpoints know the address / identity of the other side , and can rely on the XMPP layer to do whatever system policy says to enforce those .
Yes , getting your XMPP server to scale requires a good deal of effort , but we sell one of those , so I know it ’s possible . 🙂
SOG : Speaking of , did you get a chance to check out that presentation , entitled “ Beyond REST ?
Building data services with XMPP ? ”
If so , what did you think ?
JH : I saw the deck , but did n’t see the presentation in person , unfortunately .
I got to spend some time with Kellan and Rabble at the XMPP Summit at OSCON .
It ’s really cool to see folks from the HTTP community get involved in the XMPP community .
Great ideas come out of the clash of cultures .
I think the folks that say “ It ’s just a socket , get over it ! ” do n’t quite understand all of what XMPP has to offer .
It ’s a socket with framing and Layer - 7 , identity - based routing , where the other side can go up and down without interrupting the flow of information .
SOG : As a counterpoint to that presentation , have you had a chance to check out Joshua Schachter ’s pushback , “ beyond rest , ” in which he proposes an HTTP callback system that would fall between full polling and persistent pub / sub ?
JH : Yeah .
It ’s totally possible to make an HTTP callback system work – after all , there are a couple of WS -* standards that talk about how to do this .
I assert that it will be a lot more difficult than people expect to make it scale and to get the security right .
SOG : One of the reasons that Joshua ’s post resonated with many of the developers we work with is the perceived complexity of XMPP .
The spec is big and heavy – bloated , even , some argue – with many namespaces that are irrelevant to many use cases [ see Russell Beattie for a counterpoint ] .
How do you think developers should address this ?
Libraries ?
Subsetting ?
JH : If you look at RFC 3920 there is n’t really anything superfluous .
Authentication is more … comprehensive than some would like because the IETF pushed us into a dependency on SASL ( like IMAP , POP3 , and SMTP now use ) .
3921 has a couple of superfluous things that been removed in 3921 bis , like session establishment and privacy lists .
I think when you say “ the spec ” , mostly people are complaining about the list of XEPs .
Today there are 247 of them , some of which have been deprecated .
Are there too many XEPs ?
Possibly .
But that ’s one of the consequences of an open process .
Could we do a better job of helping people get started ?
Absolutely .
One of the things we talked about at the Summit was how to give developers a gentle introduction .
Probably such a “ Dive into XMPP ” intro should cover the building - block XEPs , like 4 ( Data Forms ) , 30 ( Service Discovery ) , 45 ( Multi - User Chat ) , 50 ( Ad- Hoc Commands ) , 60 ( Publish / Subscribe ) , 115 ( Entity Capabilities ) , and 163 ( Personal Eventing ) .
We do try hard to layer correctly , reuse where
possible , and make clients as easy as we can to write .
Are a couple of the XEPs are too large to get your hands around easily as a newbie .
45 and 60 are my prime targets here .
One of the reasons they are so large , however , is that every possible error condition that has been found is in the spec , along with an example of each success case and error case .
As a developer , I love lots of examples .
I copy them from the spec and insert them into my code as comments .
That being said , we ’re talking about trying to pull some of the more advanced features out of some of these specs , so that there can be a kernel that is easier to learn and implement on its own .
If people want to complain about particular specs , the place to do it is in on the standards list .
No fair just writing a troll on your blog and hoping someone will wander by to fix your problem .
On the topic of libraries , there is probably an existing library for XMPP for almost any programming language , operating system , or environment ( http://www.jabber.org/libraries has some of those ) .
Please think carefully before embarking on writing your own — writing a * good * library can take a while , mostly because writing multi- threaded asynchronous network code is difficult no matter what the protocol .
If you use a good library , you can be up and running quite quickly .
SOG : What do you think would help to accelerate the adoption of XMPP , whether that ’s in the commercial marketplace or with individual developers ?
JH : The first step is realizing that you have a problem that XMPP can solve : it ’s not just for IM .
We ’re making inroads on that with the current hype cycle .
The next is helping people to get up and running more quickly so that their first experiences are positive .
Libraries , docs , chat rooms , consulting services , and books might all make that process easier .
Things you might not know about that will help :
Jabber Inc. will be announcing two commercially - supported client libraries ( for .
Net and AJAX ) in the next couple of weeks .
Docs and gentle introductions were an action item out of the Summit .
If you ’d like to help , contact stpeter .
Join the jdev chatroom ( xmpp : [ email protected ] ?
join ) from any XMPP server that has federation enabled .
Ask questions about protocol , implementations , libraries , or whatever there .
Consulting services : your Jabber Inc. salesperson can get you access to services from installation / configuration through solution design all the way to implementation of custom solutions , depending upon what you need .
I ’m sure that there are others in the community that would be willing to offer you expertise as well .
There are several books already on the market , most of which are out of date in a variety of ways .
There are rumors that a new one is on the way , though .
In all , XMPP has been around for almost 10 years .
It is open , standardized , robust , widely - implemented , and straightforward to understand compared to most other protocols in this space .
Yes , it ’s different than HTTP , or anything else a web developer might have run in to .
That ’s because it solves a problem that is n’t easy to solve in the traditional HTTP world : bi-directional , asynchronous , short - latency structured communications .
In his book , Collapse of an Empire : Lessons for Modern Russia , economist and former Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar , suggests that between 1966 and 1990 , 80 million Soviet farmers urbanized stalling grain production and putting pressure on the government to use revenue from oil and natural gas production to buy grain from abroad .
When fossil fuel production did not expand in such a way that provided increased profits for purchasing food the Soviets had to borrow foreign money to buy bread .
Loans from the West came with strings attached .
Those offering the credit demanded that the Soviets no longer use force to keep their states in line and political collapse , not famine , visited The USSR .
Interestingly Mr. Gaidar does n’t seem to suggest that the collapse of his country happened because a large portion of the population moved from the countryside into the cities and stopped growing their own grain .
Instead he seems to place the bulk of the blame for collapse on economics - on the inability of the Soviets to feed themselves not because there were n't enough people growing grain in that country but because of their inability to buy enough grain from other people to feed themselves because of decreasing oil and natural gas revenues .
The idea that the Soviet collapse was due in part to the fact that the Soviet Union gave up on its capacity for food self sufficiency ( food sovereignty ) in an effort to pursue industrialization seems absent from his theory .
All of this has interesting implications for the United States regarding our own food sovereignty as the rising cost of food means more people are priced out of a healthy diet .
Here in the United States about 40 % of our population farmed for a living around the turn of the 20th century .
By 1950 that number had dropped to 12 % .
Today fewer than 2 % do the work of growing food in America as we too have industrialized and urbanized our population .
The other 98 % of us work at a job which provides us money that allows us to buy food from a small number of domestic producers and from others who grow it abroad .
We have given up our own food sovereignty as a people and instead rely almost entirely on an economic system to provide us with meals .
Should we be pleased that the USSR shifted from a rural population towards a more urban population and were then unable to feed themselves leaving their leaders no choice but to consent to revolution in the face of a starving population and no way to pay for food ?
Maybe .
But that is an oversimplification of the history of the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Countries do n’t collapse for any single reason but because of a host of pressures .
However the agricultural situation surrounding the Soviet collapse suggests that America should be asking herself some questions .
If the economic system in the United States , an economic system based on growth , runs up against a depletion of resources that physically slows or stops our ability to grow economically , will we face a similar collapse ?
Could our nation , like the Soviet Union , come to regret our willingness to hand over our food sovereignty ?
Will fewer jobs mean less food ?
If the American economy of growth falters , how will the 98 % of non-farmers be able to buy bread ?
Are we in for a revolution when a certain percentage of the American people are unable to buy food ?
I ’m not talking about a revolution based on some sort of ideological difference like that between capitalism and communism .
I ’m talking about a revolution due to an increasing resource scarcity that chokes the life out of industrial agriculture .
In an era of unprecedented growth and materialist prosperity , many people have come to believe that the grocery store aisles will always stay stocked , but there is only so much of the natural world we can convert into human resources .
Mother Nature has her limits and infinite growth in our finite system is impossible even if short term growth seems to suggest that it is inevitable .
Will our failure to recognize this fact visit our dinner tables ?
Many Americans think that , unlike the Soviets , we have real choice in this country about what they eat .
But our choices are made by grocery store managers , transported to us by truckers and grown a thousand and a half miles away .
Our choices are harvested by migrant workers who are paid poverty level wages or worse and grown under contract by corporations whose practices destroy local communities and the biodiversity of healthy ecosystems .
Just because we buy our food at the grocery store does n’t mean we have any real control over how we fed our families .
What we have is the illusion of control and in this regard we might be worse off than the Soviets in terms of susceptibility .
In a country where most of our heavily lobbied congressional representatives support a farm bill that rewards the makers of cheap junk food to the detriment of our children and those who grow our fruits and our vegetables , can we really say that we have a choice in what we eat ?
How it ’s grown ?
What chemicals are sprayed on it ?
Would an agricultural revolution not also give us back real choice ?
Of course we have an alternative .
The population of the United States of America could make an anticipatory change away from industrial agriculture and decrease our dangerous reliance on it ?
We can , as a nation , turn away voluntarily from industrial agriculture by rejecting a culture of hyper consumption and promote a culture of creation - not factory farming but local farmers meeting local food needs .
We can embrace the freedom and stability of agricultural self sufficiency and local interdependency - the battle cry can be Food Sovereignty !
And we can do it in advance of any possible economic troubles because of speculation , liquidation , inflation , or any other manipulative practices that might further distort food price and access .
We can begin again to base our society on providing our own needs and the needs of our communities .
This sort of democratization of support systems could lead in turn to a stronger democratic system of governance with the population ruling over themselves not being provided for by the few .
A population that can feed itself can express power over a ruling minority by withdrawing their dependency from the system of reliance by which corporatization and globalization have indentured all of us depend on far away others for food .
We can grow it in our own front yards and buy it from the besieged family farmer down the road .
The ability of a nation to feed itself locally is important in establishing any attempt at addressing the crises currently facing humankind .
Rapid resource depletion , population migration , global climate change , peak energy , a pandemic illness or any combination of these converging calamities could lead to more conflict and the possible collapse of our current system of living .
Facing these issues can best be handled through a collaborative effort involving real education and a democratic approach towards problem solving .
A swift move towards self sufficiency , along with a return to local interdependency , could go a long way towards mitigating our problems and stabilizing our democratic goals and aims .
We could learn something from the Soviets .
Not the notion that large - scale communism is untenable - we already know that - but the idea that giving up our ability to grow food locally makes us more susceptible to an economic downturn .
Can we use this insight to regain control over our food and our governing institutions before the real want of limits sets in ?
We shall see .
BitTorrent Inc. , founded by Bram Cohen , the inventor of the BitTorrent protocol , is firing 12 of its 55 employees .
The company , which also develops the popular BitTorrent client uTorrent , had been struggling to make money from their download store , which is one of the causes of the layoffs .
One of the main plans of BitTorrent Inc. was to be the next iTunes , by selling movies and music via their “ BitTorrent powered ” online store .
For several reasons , DRM being one of them , the store never became the success they hoped it to be .
Valleywag reports that the company has now decided to lay off its sales and marketing department , due to failing attempts to sell the entertainment store to Best Buy .
This means that the development of uTorrent , specifically the long awaited Mac version , is not in danger .
The BitTorrent entertainment network was launched February 2007 and offers movie rentals starting at starting at $ 2.99 .
Before the store launched , BitTorrent Inc ’s co-founder Ashwin Navin said that the store was going to compete with BitTorrent sites like The Pirate Bay and mininova , as he said , “ If we ’re not competing effectively with piracy , we ’re not going to win . ”
There never was any real competition however , mainly because the movies are infected with Windows DRM .
The company never wanted to use DRM .
In fact , Bram Cohen told TorrentFreak in an interview that the DRM issue is causing an awful lot of headaches , but that most of their content partners are insisting on it .
BitTorrent ’s Ashwin Navin was a bit more outspoken about it .
He said that DRM is “ a time bomb waiting to happen , ” and that it will inspire people to pirate content .
One thing we can be sure of , it did n’t help to convert illegal downloaders to go legal .
If online video stores want to compete with their pirate counterparts , the pricing should be reasonable , the catalogue extensive , and all without DRM .
The BitTorrent store failed to meet these standards , and unfortunately , 12 people lost their job because of it .
Update :
In a comment received after publication of the article , Ashwin Navin told Torrent Freak that the layoffs are not related to the failing entertainment store .
Demand For Coal Climbing Rapidly Around The World
July 30th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Despite the myriad recent examples of positive news in the alternative energy world , it ’s important to remember that harmful non-renewables are n’t losing any ground .
According to the US Department of Energy , 258 gigawatts of new generating capacity are needed to meet an expected 40 % increase in consumption by 2030 , and coal companies are stepping up to meet this need .
In the US , 17.5 gigawatts of coal - fueled generating capacity are under construction , and 7.3 more gigawatts are on the way .
Coal companies are recording huge profits as a result of the growing desire for their services .
Arch Coal , one of the largest coal producers in the United States , has recorded a net income of $ 194.1 million in the first half of 2008 — triple their income from the first half of 2007 .
Curbing this trend will be difficult , if not impossible , as emerging markets such as China show no signs of slowing down .
Arch Coal suggests that 1.1 billion tons of coal will be needed by 2012 , essentially replicating the US coal industry in 5 years .
So what can be done to stop coal ’s harmful effects on the atmosphere ?
One possibility is carbon capture , but mandatory heat - trapping emission caps are not yet in place in the United States — not to mention other large coal - consuming countries .
Unless major policy changes are made immediately , we ’ll be dealing with massive coal emissions for a long time .

University research showed that widely used disk encryption technologies may be putting critical laptop data at risk .
This demonstration has made many organizations understand that their disk encryption solutions may no longer be the panacea for protecting critical data on laptops – deeper protection is required .
The good news is that there are software - driven techniques that can defend against Cold Boot attacks on machines that have been shut off , machines that are hibernating or sleeping , and machines in screen lock mode .
BitArmor has developed patent - pending software techniques to prevent such attacks on encryption keys in memory in order to ensure that critical systems remain secure .
McCain Defends ' Enron Loophole '
COMMENTARY : McCain Defends ' Enron Loophole ' by Jason Leopold Sen. John McCain says he opposes the $ 307 billion farm bill because it would dole out wasteful subsidies , but his chief economic adviser Phil Gramm also wants to stop its proposed regulation of energy futures trading , a market that was famously abused when Enron Corp. manipulated California ’s electricity prices in 2001 .
Clearing the way for that California price gouging , Gramm , as a powerful Texas senator in 2000 , slipped an Enron - backed provision into the Commodities Futures Modernization
Act that exempted from regulation energy trading on electronic platforms .
Then , over the next year , Enron – with Gramm ’s wife Wendy serving on its board of directors – worked to create false electricity shortages in California , bilking consumers out of an estimated $ 40 billion .
Gramm left the Senate in 2002 but now has emerged as what Fortune magazine calls “ McCain ’s econ brain , ” not only filling the Arizona senator ’s acknowledged void on economic expertise ( “ I do n’t know as much about the economy as I should ” ) but recognized as one of McCain ’s closest friends in politics .
The two men talk daily .
A McCain aide told me that the Arizona senator opposes the farm bill because it “ rewards lobbyists ” by granting rich farmers lucrative subsidies , although he would support “ a reasonable level of assistance and risk management to farmers when they need America 's help . ”
But the aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity , acknowledged that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee also opposes the farm bill because Gramm advised McCain that he should resist its regulatory language on the energy futures market .
Democrats have dubbed that gap in energy futures regulation the “ Enron loophole , ” but it played a part , too , in the more recent attempt by the Amaranth Advisers hedge fund to corner the national gas market by shifting trades to the unregulated “ dark markets ” of the Intercontinental Exchange .
The “ Enron loophole ” also has become part of the debate over the soaring price of oil .
Last week , a study sponsored by Sen.
Carl Levin , D - Michigan , concluded that speculative futures markets were partly to blame for the surge in oil prices that have pushed gas at the pump toward $ 4 a gallon .
At a May 15 news conference , Levin said the skyrocketing price of oil is “ not the result of supply and demand .
Speculators have taken over most of the futures market . "
However , the 673 - page farm bill , containing the regulatory provisions on electronic energy trading , still faces obstacles amid overall concerns about the bill ’s largesse to farmers at a time of rising food prices .
President George W. Bush has vowed to veto the bill , although it cleared the House and Senate by margins wide enough for an override , assuming Republicans do n’t rally behind Bush and McCain , their current and future standard bearers .
Gramm and Enron
The battle over the “ Enron loophole ” also could draw attention to McCain ’s dependence on Gramm as his chief economic adviser and Gramm ’s key role in passing legislation that let Enron trade commodities on electronic platforms without federal oversight .
In 2000 , with the Republicans in charge of Congress and Gramm chairing the Senate Banking Committee , the exemption on electronic trading was approved without a Senate hearing .
Internal Enron documents , which were released in 2002 , revealed that the Houston - based company helped write the legislation , which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in December 2000 .
Freed from regulatory interference , Enron then used manipulative trading practices to game the California electricity market and drive up electricity prices across the state .
While California consumers were getting fleeced , the new Bush administration shielded Enron from early accusations of market manipulation .
President Bush personally joined the fight against imposing caps on the soaring price of electricity , buying additional time for Enron although the company ’s house of cards collapsed anyway in fall 2001 .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Bush ’s Enron Lies . ” ]
In 2006 , the “ Enron loophole ” allowed Amaranth Advisers hedge fund to shift its trades from the regulated New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) to the unregulated Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ) in Atlanta .
That let Amaranth corner the natural gas market , betting that futures prices would rise .
The hedge fund lost about $ 6 billion and imploded as natural gas prices fell to a two - year low in September 2006 .
Last July , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged that Amaranth manipulated prices paid in the physical natural gas markets .
FERC has proposed $ 291 million in penalties and the forfeiture of “ unjust profits . ”
“ Unregulated markets are known as ‘ dark markets ’ because there is very little oversight of the trades , ” said Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Michigan , chairman of the subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations , during a hearing on energy speculation last December .
By trading on the “ dark ” ICE market , traders can avoid the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ’s rules which are in place to prevent price distortions or supply squeezes .
Stupak said trading volumes on ICE “ have skyrocketed in the past three years and are now as large or even larger in some months , than the volumes traded on the regulated futures market . ”
The lack of oversight “ makes it difficult for regulators to detect excessively large positions which could lead to price manipulation , ” Stupak said .
Advising McCain Gramm , who is now a vice chairman of financial services company UBS , began advising McCain in 2005 when the Arizona senator indicated he planned to run for President .
Since then , McCain has adopted much of Gramm ’s anti-tax , anti-regulatory agenda .
Most strikingly , McCain shifted to support Bush ’s tax cuts , which McCain had voted against in 2001 and 2003 .
He now vows that , if elected President , he would make them permanent .
Yet Gramm ’s influence over McCain ’s economic agenda – and the checkered political - business history of Gramm and his wife Wendy – have largely escaped media scrutiny .
Gramm received more than $ 34,000 in campaign contributions from Enron and served as one of the company ’s key legislative allies in Washington , including his help in 2000 removing federal oversight from energy trades on electronic platforms .
At the height of the Enron scandal in January 2002 , Gramm ’s press secretary Larry Neal told The New York Times that Gramm did not “ recall a conversation ” he apparently had with Enron ’s chairman Ken Lay in 2000 to discuss that Enron legislative priority .
An internal Enron e-mail dated Aug. 10 , 2000 , under the subject “ CFTC Reauthorization ” – sent by Enron ’s top lobbyist Richard Shapiro to Steve Kean , Enron ’s executive vice president – said the company needed to get Lay on the phone with Gramm so the bill could be passed .
“ The bill is not moving quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm 's desire to see significant changes made to the legislation ( not directly related to our energy language ) , ” Shapiro said .
“ Last week at the [ 2000 ] Republican Convention , I asked the Senator about the bill and he said they were working on it , but much needs to be changed for his support .
More telling perhaps , were Wendy Gramm 's comments that she would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year .
“ What this means is that we must , at the least , remove Senator Gramm 's opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain his support of the legislation . ”
Shapiro added : “ However , with less than 20 or so legislative days left , we need Senator Gramm to engage .
“ A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences .
Gramm needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron .
“ Let me know your thoughts on this approach .
I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay / Sen. Gramm call . ”
Several other internal Enron e-mails briefed company staffers on the status of Gramm ’s position and Enron ’s lobbying of the senator .
Gramm finally removed a “ hold ” on the bill in December 2000 , reintroduced the bill under a different number , and forced a vote on it without floor debate .
It was then attached to an appropriations bill that was signed by President Clinton on Dec. 21 , 2000 .
California Crisis
Less than a month later , California began to experience rolling blackouts due to artificial electricity shortages which , according to documents later released by federal energy regulators , were the result of manipulative trading practices employed by Enron .
The California crisis centered on Enron ’s energy trades through a new platform called EnronOnline , which had been freed from regulatory oversight by the legislation pushed by Gramm .
In April 2002 , Gramm blocked an amendment by Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - California , that would have closed the loophole that Gramm had helped open .
Gramm ’s wife , Wendy , also had played a role in the anti-regulatory policies that contributed to the Enron scandal .
On Jan. 14 , 1993 , in the final days of the first Bush administration , Wendy Gramm – as chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – pushed through a key regulatory exemption removing energy derivatives contracts and interest - rate swaps from federal oversight .
That was a major financial boon to Enron , where Wendy Gramm landed five weeks later as a member of the board of directors .
She also became a member of the audit committee that signed off on another one of Enron ’s fraudulent schemes , partnerships that hid the company ’s growing debt .
Even after Enron had collapsed in fall 2001 , Sen .
Gramm continued to resist congressional efforts at tightening up the rules .
In 2002 , despite the accounting scandals at Enron , WorldCom and other major companies , Sen . Gramm objected to the Sarbanes - Oxley corporate reform bill designed to hold executives accountable for inaccuracies in financial reports .
Now , the Gramm family ’s anti-regulatory agenda is returning via McCain ’s presidential campaign .
As Fortune ’s editor - at - large Shawn Tully wrote , “ economic conservatives should take heart .
McCain ’s chief economic adviser – and perhaps his closest political friend – is the ultimate pure play in free market faith , former Texas Sen. Phil Gramm .
... Most of [ McCain ’s ] current positions are vintage Gramm indeed . ”
[ Fortune , Feb. 19 . 2008 ]
The first test of McCain ’s commitment to Gramm ’s anti-regulatory purity may come in the looming battle over the “ Enron loophole ” that the farm bill seeks to close .

The teaser trailer for W. which based on the life and presidency of George W. Bush .
It is directed by Oliver Stone and stars Josh Brolin as George W. Bush .
Director Oliver Stone was in the same Yale graduating class as George W. Bush , the class of 1968 .
However , Stone did not end up graduating because he dropped out and went to Vietnam instead .
Bush did stay and graduate .
Josh Brolin wanted to perfect his speech and mannerisms to play George W. Bush .
He called hotels in the area of where Bush grew up to talk to people to get the accent right .
He also watched many videos in order to get Bush ’s walk down just right .
Christian Bale was originally going to play George W. Bush .
He went underwent weeks of prosthetics tests but eventually dropped out .
Oliver Stone offered the role of George Bush Sr. to Warrant Beatty and Harrison Ford before James Cromwell took on the role .
While Josh Brolin plays George W. Bush , his father , James Brolin played Ronal Reagan in The Reagans .
The Reagans was heavily criticized by the Republican party as they believed in was more of a leftist point of view of events .
No matter what your political stance is and no matter what opinion you may have about George W. Bush , it is hard to ignore how intriguing and entertaining the trailer for W is .
The trailer starts off in a way that emphasizes Bush as a young man when he was just a rabble - rouser with no motivation to finish anything and his father ’s distaste for the choices he makes .
The question of how he went from a slacker with a drinking problem to the President of the United States make for a juicy plot .
Those who are huge supporters of Bush may find the trailer to be slanted and a bit too focused on the troubles he went through in his younger years but director Oliver Stone appears to be more interested in the progress that was made and the evolution of the man rather than a glamour piece .
Everyone is just a person with their own history and their own faults , even the president , and the trailer appears to show that with a fair amount of objectivity .
George W. does not come off as a bad person , but rather a relatable person .
Josh Brolin is a great choice for the 43rd president as is most of the casting of real life people .
Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush is completely genius .
The teaser trailer for W. has just the right amount of drama , humor ( “ Who do you think you are ?
A Kennedy ” ) , and expertly chosen actors .

Concerned citizens who write to representatives may be reported for their views

An otherwise uninteresting article in the Salt Lake Tribune , about Utah representatives receiving different kinds of mail , has thrown up some disturbing information regarding letters about 9/11 truth .
Amongst the stories about Congressmen receiving letters from people who use “ Star Trek ” stationery , and from kids wanting homework outlawed , we find the following little tidbit :
“ Others have written in about 9/11 conspiracies , global takeovers or secret CIA mind - control techniques that “ got so crazy we actually had to hand them over to Capitol Police , ” he ( Legislative assistant Omar Raschid ) said . ”
Apparently not accepting the government ’s version of events surrounding 9/11 may land you in trouble with the cops if you ’re writing from Utah .

Bernanke , Paulson outline strategy to make working class pay for Wall Street crisis
By Andre Damon and Barry Grey
10 July 2008
In speeches delivered Tuesday , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson outlined the ruthless class policy being carried out to place the burden for the financial and housing crisis on the backs of working people .
Bernanke indicated that the Fed would extend its policy of offering unlimited loans to major Wall Street investment banks .
The provision of Fed funds to non-commercial banks and brokerage firms , a departure from the Fed ’s legal mandate without precedent since the Great Depression , is part of a policy of bailing out the banking system to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars .
The Fed announced its loan program for investment banks last March when it dispensed $ 29 billion to JPMorgan Chase as part of a rescue operation to prevent the collapse of Bear Stearns .
In his speech , Treasury Secretary Paulson acknowledged that home foreclosures in 2007 reached 1.5 million and predicted another 2.5 million homes would be foreclosed in 2008 .
But he made clear that nothing would be done to save the vast majority of distressed homeowners from being thrown onto the street .
Paulson , the former CEO of Goldman Sachs , said that “ many of today ’s unusually high number of foreclosures are not preventable . ”
With a callous indifference reminiscent of Marie Antoinette ’s “ Let them eat cake , ” he went on to say that “ some people took out mortgages they can’t possibly afford and they will lose their homes .
There is little public policymakers can , or should , do to compensate for untenable financial decisions . ”
In other words , low - income home owners who were lured into high - interest mortgages by predatory mortgage companies and banks are getting their just deserts !
Of course , the Wall Street CEOs and big investors who made billions of dollars by speculating on these loans , creating a vast edifice of fictitious capital that was bound to collapse , are not to be held accountable for any “ untenable financial decisions . ”
On the contrary , they are to be subsidized with hundreds of billions of dollars of credit , ultimately to be paid for by public funds .
The two speeches , presented at a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation forum on the housing crisis held in Virginia , underscore the real social interests — those of the financial aristocracy — that are being protected by the policies of the Fed , the Bush administration , and the Democratic Congress .
Bernanke made clear that his call for an extension of loans to big investment banks is part of a more comprehensive proposal to systemize and regularize federal subsidies and bailouts for troubled banking giants .
Particularly significant was the following remark : “ Because the resolution of a failing securities firm might have fiscal implications , it would be appropriate for the Treasury to take a leading role in any such process , in consultation with the firm ’s regulator and other authorities . ”
The implication is that the US Treasury should be ready to fund bank bail - outs with whatever taxpayer funds are necessary .
In neither speech was there even a hint that the government has any responsibility to protect home owners , or that the people responsible for the “ lax credit and underwriting standards ” that led to the current crisis might be called to account by regulators , Congress , or the courts .
Essentially the same principles underlie the Democratic - sponsored housing bill currently under debate in Congress .
The bill , which President Bush has threatened to veto , includes provisions to provide government insurance on mortgages in exchange for lenders writing down the principal by 15 percent .
The main purpose of the bill is not to assist homeowners , but to prevent foreclosures from harming the balance sheets of financial firms by transferring risky mortgages to the government .
The bill is tailored to marginally reduce the flood of home loan defaults and foreclosures , at a minimal cost to the government , so as to stabilize the housing market and stem the losses suffered by banks and financial institutions from the collapse of subprime mortgage - backed securities .
Home owners with subprime and adjustable - rate mortgages , who demonstrated their ability to pay off a refinanced loan , would have the debt converted to a thirty - year , fixed - rate mortgage , resulting in lower monthly payments .
The plan is entirely voluntary .
No bank or mortgage lender would be required to participate , and the financial firms would decide which , if any , loans they refinanced in return for a government guarantee against losses .
As a result , mortgage companies and banks that decide to participate will “ cherry pick ” the loans they refinance , choosing from among the loans which qualify under the terms of the bill only those they believe most likely to default .
The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimates that the measure would help a maximum of 500,000 home owners — that is , only 20 percent of the 2.5 million who , according to Paulson , will face foreclosure this year .
It does nothing to help those who have already had their homes foreclosed , or block banks and mortgage lenders from carrying out new foreclosures .
Lenders are currently filing foreclosure proceedings against more than 7,000 home owners a day .
The CBO estimates that the actual cost of the program — resulting from defaults of Federal Housing Administration - backed refinanced loans — would amount only to $ 2.7 billion over the next five years .
This is less than the amount spent on the Iraq war every 15 days , and a billion dollars less than the 2007 earnings of the top hedge fund manager in the US .
It is a tiny fraction of the nearly $ 1 trillion that the Fed has pumped into the financial markets since the credit crisis erupted last August .
The moves to further subsidize the banks coincide with the Fed ’s announced policy of halting interest rate cuts and preparing to raise rates later this year .
As Bernanke has made clear , the major consideration behind this policy shift is a desire to stem “ inflationary expectations ” — a euphemism for wage increases .
The aim is to utilize the economic contraction to drive up unemployment and undercut any struggle by workers for wage hikes to compensate for soaring prices and ruinous levels of household and personal debt .
The eruption of the credit crunch last August was not anticipated by the Fed or government policy - makers , whose easy credit policies had fueled the housing bubble .
They initially badly underestimated the seriousness and depth of the crisis , but soon responded with a series of interest rate cuts and massive injections of liquidity to bolster the banking system .
This was bound to ignite inflationary pressures and further weaken the dollar .
By the time of the Bear Stearns rescue last March — carried out with the support of both parties and all of their presidential candidates — it had become clear to the Fed that the credit and housing crisis would have a protracted impact on economic growth and that the financial system would remain highly fragile for an extended period .
A consensus emerged within the ruling elite in support of a brutal class policy to continue the bailout of Wall Street , while seeking to manage an orderly unwinding of the trillions of dollars in fictitious capital built up during the speculative boom — at the expense of the working class .
Now the strategy is to exploit the economic contraction to further depress wages .
There is no support in either political party to allocate any significant resources to relieve the economic and social distress of working class families being hammered by job cuts , sharply rising gas and food prices , and the collapse of their home values .
Editor ’s Note :
This is a guest post from Cory Edwards .
Cory is a professional musician and songwriter .
He lives with his wife and two children in St. Louis , MO .
Viktor Frankl ( 1905 - 1997 ) was a psychotherapist and brain surgeon who specialized in treating depression , especially for those prone to suicide .
Being a Jew in Nazi Germany , he was sent to Auschwitz where he was reduced to nothing but his “ naked existence . ”
As he entered the camp , they took the last of his belongings , including his clothes , his wedding ring , and the manuscript of a book he was writing .
Then , every inch of his body was shaved as he was escorted into a shower room .
His only consolation was that real water dripped from the shower heads instead of gas .
Frankl was a studious man who did n’t get a lot of physical exercise in life .
One of his fellow prisoners said Frankl was the least likely to survive the torturous regimen in store for him .
But by leaning on his rich inner life and helping other prisoners , along with some strokes of good luck , he lived to tell the tale .
His story is a lesson in manliness for times of suffering , whether that suffering is small or great .
Have a sense of purpose .
Frankl kept himself alive by developing a purpose : to keep other prisoners from committing suicide .
He did so by helping them to achieve their own sense of purpose .
He would encourage one man that he had to survive in order to return to a daughter that was safe in a foreign country .
He would encourage another , who had no living relatives left , that he must return to his profession to complete the work he had begun .
In addition , part of his sense of purpose was to suffer well .
He wrote , “ It did not really matter what we expected from life , but rather what life expected from us .
We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life , and instead to think of ourselves as those being questioned by life – daily and hourly .
Our answer must consist , not in talk and meditation , but in right action and in right conduct .
Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual . ”
Develop a rich inner life .
The man in the concentration camp who had a strong mind would often prove to be the stronger prisoner .
These were men who could appreciate , on a cold march in the snow , the beauty of the mountains , the forest , or the sunrise .
They kept their minds active by composing speeches , reconstructing lost manuscripts , and imagining life after imprisonment .
They had prayer meetings to keep a strong connection to their religious beliefs .
Frankl said , “ Sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain ( they were often of a delicate constitution ) , but the damage to their inner selves was less .
They were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom . ”
Develop a fervent love for your wife .
For those who were married and truly in love with their wives , an extra source of strength was available to them .
This was not a place where mere sexual fantasy could relieve a man from suffering ( the sexual drive was mostly dead for the underfed and overworked prisoners ) .
However , thinking of his wife – her features , her voice , and little incidents from their life together – a man found considerable strength for endurance .
Frankl found this to be the case whether the wife was alive or dead .
He often thought of the words of Solomon : “ For love is strong as death . ”
Frankl wrote , “ I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss , be it only for a brief moment , in the contemplation of his beloved .
In a position of utter desolation , when man cannot express himself in positive action , when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way – an honorable way – in such a position man can , through loving contemplation of his beloved , achieve fulfillment . ”
Choose your attitude .
Frankl wrote , “ The one thing you ca n’t take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me .
The last of one ’s freedoms is to choose one ’s attitude in any given circumstance . ”
This does not mean to think rainbows on a cloudy day , though it can .
It can mean choosing indignation over coldness , joy over sorrow , strength over weakness , hope over despair .
No man ’s behavior is dictated solely by circumstance .
His behavior can be directed by choice – the choice every living man has .
Viktor Frankl ’s story can be found in Man ’s Search for Meaning , a book about the psychotherapeutic ideas that he honed while in concentration camps .
It is recommended reading for any man , showing the depths to which one can sink and the heights to which one can rise in the middle of the most horrific suffering imaginable .

Longtime Minneapolis peace activist and sometime - gadfly Ed Felien asked a Hennepin County District judge on Thursday to compel the county attorney to arrest President Bush when his plane lands for the GOP convention in September .
Felien , a former Minneapolis City Council member , said Bush should be investigated and prosecuted for murder because of troop deaths in Iraq , conspiracy to fix oil prices and conspiracy to distribute drugs by controlling the opium trade in Afghanistan .
A LONG SHOT : He acknowledged that his request was unusual , but also said , " The purpose of the prosecuting attorney is not to achieve convictions , but to seek justice . "
At the end of a 30 - minute hearing , Judge Gary Larson said he would rule in the normal course of business , but he did not provide a time frame .
Felien 's request certainly had the feel of a very long shot .
Deputy Hennepin County Attorney Patrick Diamond said the notion that the president could be taken into custody and prosecuted is " highly doubtful . "
SOLE DISCRETION : Diamond emphasized that the county attorney bears the sole discretion of when to prosecute crimes .
" Not everything a county attorney can do is something a county attorney should do , " he said .
He argued , too , that Felien 's request raises serious separation of powers issues .
A totalitarian state exists when a " judge is deciding not just the outcome but who should be investigated and prosecuted , " Diamond said .
PRESENTING HIS CASE : During Felien 's nearly 20 minutes of wide - ranging argument , Larson advised him several times to slow down so the court reporter could capture his words .
Felien touched on Bush family history , claiming that the family has influential ties to " Saudi princes " as well as Afghanistan drug lords and the Mafia .
He introduced numerous news articles to the judge regarding the Bush family and oil prices .
Is it possible for a company to have its best earnings ever for the first three months of the year and the second - best of all time for any corporation and still not please anyone ?
The answer is yes if the company is Exxon Mobil Corp. , the world ’s largest publicly traded oil company .
Irving , Texas - based Exxon on Thursday posted first - quarter sales of $ 116.9 billion , a better performance in three months than all but 52 nations do in a year , according to the International Monetary Fund ’s world rankings for gross domestic product .
And Exxon got to keep $ 10.9 billion , or $ 2.03 a share , in net profit after all the bills were paid .
That was up 17 % from year - earlier earnings but less than Wall Street had expected because of weak production and anemic refining profit .
Henry Hubble , the company ’s vice president of investor relations and corporate secretary , emphasized the positive during a conference call with analysts and investors :
“ In an environment of high commodity prices , Exxon Mobil ’s outstanding portfolio of integrated businesses performed well , allowing us to deliver record first - quarter results . ”

But consumer advocates blasted the company , saying it and other oil companies were posting exorbitant profits at a time when many Americans are hurting from high fuel costs and the weak economy .
They also said Exxon spent too much buying back stock and not enough on capital investments in production that could help bring energy costs down .
Members of Congress threatened legislation to rein in oil company behavior .
And one of the few families that can trace its investment history with the company all the way back to the old days of Standard Oil -- the Rockefeller clan -- said this week that Exxon Mobil was on the wrong path and not focusing on renewable energy .
Amid record oil prices , analysts polled by Thomson Financial had forecast $ 2.13 a share in earnings .
Investors were n’t thrilled either , sending shares down from $ 3.37 , or 3.6 % , to $ 89.70 .
“ It was a terrible day for Exxon Mobil , ” said Fadel Gheit , senior oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Co . “ Their production problems are more pronounced than their rivals ’ .
They are not improving as much either , and with the price of oil so high , they can no longer dictate terms to oil producing countries .
They are now at the mercy of geopolitics . ”

Gheit said that Exxon was still a powerhouse in many ways , maintaining “ the strongest balance sheet in the business , having $ 40 billion in cash and the most aggressive stock buyback policy in the industry .
But he added that not even new deep - water oil developments off the coast of Angola were enough to solve production problems .
Analyst Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank said the market wanted to see production growth because it was “ deeply concerned about future energy supply .
. . .
Exxon Mobil does not offer that right now . ”
Exxon ’s results fell shy of its fourth - quarter performance , the company ’s best , when it recorded net income of $ 11.7 billion , or $ 2.13 a share .
Its 17 % profit increase trailed more impressive 25 % and 63 % gains , respectively , by Royal Dutch Shell and BP .
Exxon ’s oil and gas production fell 5.6 % , leaving the company less leverage on rapidly rising crude prices .
Refining profit fell by more than half .

Analyst Phil Weiss of Argus Research said Exxon ’s profit got “ hurt by higher oil prices , as crazy as that sounds . ”
That ’s due in part from the fact that Exxon Mobil , as the world ’s largest refiner of oil , ca n’t raise those prices fast enough to keep pace , he said .
Exxon ’s Hubble said the company was increasing its quarterly cash dividend to 40 cents a share , up 14 % , marking its 26th straight year of increased dividends .
In 2007 , Exxon spent $ 31.8 billion buying back stock and $ 20.9 billion on capital expenditures .
That ’s part of the problem , said Tyler Slocum , director of Public Citizen ’s Energy Program , who said that if Exxon Mobil wo n’t spend money where it is most needed , such as on capital investment to reduce the price burdens on consumers and on renewable energy development , then it was time for government to step in and take action .

“ It ’s not just about beating up on Exxon , ” Slocum said .
“ It ’s about making them pay their fair share . ”
This year , Exxon has said , it expects to increase its capital spending to about $ 25 billion .
The stock buyback program , Hubble said , “ demonstrates our commitment to return cash to our shareholders . ”

Yahoo rejected a $ 47.5 bn offer from Microsoft Yahoo has agreed a deal with Google which will see Yahoo use the search engine giant 's advertising technology .
Under the agreement , Google ads will appear alongside some Yahoo search results in the US and Canada .
The announcement came after Yahoo said it had failed to persuade Microsoft to renew its bid to buy all of the internet company .
Recent talks concluded after Yahoo rejected a Microsoft proposal to buy just its online search business .
Potentially lucrative Yahoo said the agreement with Google could be worth up to $ 800 m ( £ 410 m ) in additional revenue every year .
Alarm bells were already ringing on Capitol Hill over Yahoo's ' limited ' trial in April of Google 's technology
Rory Cellan- Jones , BBC Technology Correspondent
The Yahoo - Google drama BBC dot. life technology blog " This commercial agreement provides Yahoo with the opportunity to deliver more relevant ads to users and provide advertisers and publishers with better advertising technology , " said Eric Schmidt , Google chairman and chief executive .
" We believe that the convergence of search and display is the next major development " in online advertising industry , said Yahoo chief executive Jerry Yang .
The partnership will initially last for three years , but could last up to 10 if Yahoo decides to renew .
Google said the deal did not need regulatory approval but that it would delay its implementation by up to three and a half months to give the US Department of Justice a chance to review it .
However , the deal is likely to attract attention from competition regulators in Washington , according to the BBC 's technology correspondent Rory Cellan - Jones .
" Alarm bells were already ringing on Capitol Hill over Yahoo's ' limited ' trial in April of Google 's technology , " he said .
Alternative deal
The markets closed before the Google deal was announced .
Shares in Yahoo had closed down 10 % after it said its attempts to revive Microsoft's $ 47.5 bn ( £ 24 bn ) offer for the whole of Yahoo had been unsuccessful .

The shares fell as low as $ 22.50 earlier in the trading session , their lowest level since the software giant first offered $ 31 a share for Yahoo in January .
Yahoo rejected a new proposal from Microsoft to buy just its online search operations .
 In the weeks since Microsoft withdrew its offer to acquire Yahoo , the two companies have continued to discuss an alternative transaction that Microsoft believes would have delivered in excess of $ 33 per share to the Yahoo shareholders , " Microsoft said in a statement .
" This partnership would ensure healthy competition in the marketplace , providing greater choice and innovation for advertisers , publishers and consumers , " the company said .
Yahoo , however , did not want to sell off only one part of the business .
It said such a deal " would not be consistent with the company 's view of the converging search and display marketplaces " .
Microsoft sources told the BBC's Rory Cellan - Jones that the company was no longer interested in a full takeover because Yahoo had been " underperforming " and was losing some of its key staff .
Yahoo's shares closed 10 % lower at $ 23.52 , while Microsoft finished 4.1 % higher at $ 28.24 .

An alleged gang member accused of triple murder in the slayings of a San Francisco father and two sons pleaded not guilty Wednesday at a hearing in which the judge refused to issue a blanket gag order in the high - profile case .
Edwin Ramos , 21 , is accused of the June 22 shooting deaths of Tony Bologna , 48 , and his sons Michael , 20 , and Matthew , 16 , in the city 's Excelsior district .
In an appearance before Judge Lucy Kelly McCabe , Ramos spoke softly and slowly in denying each of the allegations .
The defense sought the gag order after The Chronicle revealed that Ramos was an illegal immigrant who was found to have committed two felonies at age 17 - a gang - related assault of a Muni passenger and the attempted robbery of a pregnant woman - but was not surrendered by San Francisco juvenile justice authorities to federal officials for possible deportation .
The report has triggered outrage on local and national talk shows , and Danielle Bologna said city officials " need to take responsibility " for actions that she says led to the killings of her husband and sons .
Ramos ' attorney , Robert Amparan , told the court Wednesday the case was fast " becoming national media fodder " and said he was concerned about an atmosphere of " vigilantism . "
He said his office has received threatening calls and that he was concerned about comments posted by readers on The Chronicle 's Web site , SFGate .
Federal authorities say Ramos , a Salvadoran native whom police believe was involved in the MS - 13 street gang , was awaiting deportation proceedings at the time of the slayings after being turned down for temporary residency .
But Amparan insisted outside court that Ramos was in the United States legally and that federal officials were wrong about his immigration status .
He has also said the reports about Ramos ' criminal history are false , but has declined to be specific .
McCabe said she saw no grounds to issue a gag order that would prevent attorneys , law enforcement officials and Ramos from talking publicly about the case outside court .
She left open the possibility that she would issue an order barring further disclosures related to Ramos ' juvenile criminal records , which by law are not open to public examination .
" At this point , there has been insufficient showing that Mr. Ramos ' fair - trial rights have been jeopardized , " the judge said in denying the gag - order request .
McCabe told Ramos to return to court next Wednesday on the juvenile - records issue .
Also Wednesday , federal officials provided more details from their records about the chain of events that led to Ramos ' release from San Francisco city jail in April , despite that he had already been flagged by federal authorities as an illegal immigrant .
Ramos was let go after San Francisco prosecutors declined to charge him in connection with a March 30 arrest on suspicion of weapons and gang violations .
Sheriff Michael Hennessey has said deputies faxed a notice to the local Immigration and Customs Enforcement office four hours after Ramos and a companion were arrested , inquiring about their immigration status .
The sheriff says the federal office never replied and that Ramos was released early April 2 .
Later , Hennessey said , deputies electronically queried a federal database about Ramos ' status to determine whether the Sheriff 's Department could bill the federal government for his jail stay .
According to Tim Counts , spokesman for ICE , the only communication his agency received about Ramos came by way of the electronic request at 3:44 a.m.
April 2 , nearly two hours after Ramos was released .
He said there is no record that ICE received any fax from the Sheriff 's Department .
Sheriff 's deputies queried the agency by phone April 1 about the man arrested with Ramos , Erick Lopez , and an immigration hold was placed on him , Counts said .
In response , Hennessey said , " I believe their information is incorrect .
I 'm sorry that the dialogue around this case has stooped to this level .
I look forward to cooperating with them in the future . "
Many people are asking about Treasury Secretary Paulson 's Covered Bond Plan .
Bank of America Corp. , Citigroup Inc. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. threw their support behind Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's effort to spur covered bonds as a new source of mortgage financing .
" We look forward to being leading issuers as the U.S. covered bond market develops , " the banks said in a joint statement in Washington .
They applauded Paulson 's release today of guidelines for issuers of covered bonds , which detail the types of loans that should go into the securities and how their payments ought to be made .
Even in Europe , where covered bonds are a market in excess of $ 3 trillion , investors are shunning the debt amid a collapse in appetite for investments in housing .
" Mortgage - backed securities investors are not in the mood right now to buy bonds with anything less than government backing , " Kenneth Hackel , managing director of fixed - income strategy at RBS Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich , Connecticut , said in an interview , referring to debt guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Paulson said the four U.S. banks are " ready to go " and that sales by the largest banks can help encourage smaller mortgage lenders to proceed .
" Covered bonds have the potential to increase mortgage financing , improve underwriting standards and strengthen U.S. financial institutions , " he said .
Covered bonds offer greater protection to investors because banks keep the home loans on their books , and must make up shortfalls if homeowners fail to pay .
Covered bonds achieve higher ratings than regular notes by augmenting the issuer 's pledge to pay with a group of assets such as mortgages that can be sold in a default .
The extra security allows lenders to pay less interest .
While the securities are backed by loans and bank assets to get AAA ratings , most are valued , on average , as if they were three levels lower .
The Treasury 's guidelines spell out a formal definition for covered bonds .
The bonds should have maturities of at least one year and no more than 30 years .
Home loans in covered - bond pools would have a maximum loan - to - value ratio of 80 percent .

The Role Of Israel In The Georgian War By Brian Harring 8 - 17 - 8
Georgia became a huge source of income , and military advantage , for the Israeli government and Israeli arms dealers ..
Israel began selling arms to Georgia about seven years ago , following an initiative by Georgian citizens who immigrated to Israel and became weapons hustlers .
They contacted Israeli defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that Georgia had relatively large budgets , mostly American grants , and could be interested in purchasing Israeli weapons .
The military cooperation between the countries developed swiftly .
The fact that Georgia 's defense minister , Davit Kezerashvili , is a former Israeli who is fluent in Hebrew contributed to this cooperation .
" We are now in a fight against the great Russia , " he said , " and our hope is to receive assistance from the White House , because Georgia cannot survive on its own .
" Kezerashvili 's door was always open to the Israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in Israel .
Compared to countries in Eastern Europe , the deals in this country were conducted fast , mainly due to the pro-Israeli defense minister 's personal involvement .
The Jerusalem Post on August 12 , 2008 reported : " Georgian Prime Minister Vladimer ( Lado ) Gurgenidze ( Jewish ) made a special call to Israel Tuesday morning to receive a blessing from one of the Haredi community 's most important rabbis and spiritual leaders , Rabbi Aharon Leib Steinman . "
The Prime Minister of Georgia , principally a nation of Orthodox Christians called Rabbi Steinman saying ' I 've heard he is a holy man .
I want him to pray for us and our state . '
Among the Israelis who took advantage of the opportunity and began doing business in Georgia were former Minister Roni Milo and his brother Shlomo , former director - general of the Military Industries , Brigadier - General ( Res. ) Gal Hirsch and Major - General ( Res. )
Yisrael Ziv. Roni Milo conducted business in Georgia for Elbit Systems and the Military Industries , and with his help Israel 's defense industries managed to sell to Georgia remote - piloted vehicles ( RPVs ) , automatic turrets for armored vehicles , antiaircraft systems , communication systems , shells and rockets .
The Ministry of Defense of Israel had supplied the Georgian government their Hermes 450 UAV spy drones , made by Elbit Maarahot Systems Ltd , for use , under the strict control of Israeli intelligence units , to conduct intelligence - gathering flights over southern Russia and , most especially into a Iran , targeted for Israeli Air Force attacks in the near future .
Two airfields in southern Georgia had been earmarked for the use of Israeli military aircraft , intended to launch an attack on identified targets relating to Iranian atomic energy projects .
This attack was approved by President Bush in an undertaking with the government of Israel signed in Washington , D.C. , on July 4 , 2006 .
The thrust of this top secret agreement was that the Israeli government would have " free and unfettered use " of unspecified Georgian airfields , under American control , onto which they could ferry fighter - bombers which then could fly south , over Turkish territory ( and with clandestine Turkish permission ) to strike at Tehran .
The distance from Georgia to Tehran is obviously far less than from Tel Aviv .
No one expected that these attacks would completely destroy Iranian military or scientific targets , but there would be the element of complete surprise coupled with serious property damage which might well interdict future Iranian atomic development and certainly serve as a serious warning to Iran not to threaten Israel again .
Using Georgian bases , with the consent and full assistance of , the United States , would make such an attack much more feasible that attempting to fly from Israeli bases with overflights that might have serious regional diplomatic consequences .
Now , thanks to the irrational actions of the thoroughly unstable Georgian president , all of these schemes have collapsed and it is now believed that the Russian special forces have captured , intact , a number of the Israeli drones and , far more important , their radio controlling equipment .
In the main , Israeli military and intelligence units stationed in Georgia were mostly composed of Israel Defense Force reservists working for Global CST , owned by Maj.
Gen. Israel Ziv , and Defense Shield , owned by Brig .
Gen. Gal Hirsch .
" The Israelis should be proud of themselves for the Israeli training and education received by the Georgian soldiers , " Georgian Minister Temur Yakobashvili .
By this manner , Israel could claim that it had a very small number of IDF people in Georgia " mainly connected with our Embassy in Tiblisi . "
The Russians , however , were not fooled by this and their own intelligence had pinpointed Israeli surveillance bases and when they went after the Georgians who invaded South Ossetia , units of the Russian air force bombed the Israeli bases in central Georgia and in the area of the capital , Tbilisi .
They also severely damaged the runways and service areas of the two Georgian airbases designed to launch Israeli sir force units in a sudden attack on Iran .
Israel is currently a part of the Anglo - American military axis , which cooperates with the interests of the Western oil giants in the Middle East and Central Asia .
Israel is a partner in the Baku - Tblisi - Ceyhan pipeline which brings oil and gas to the Eastern Mediterranean .
More than 20 percent of Israeli oil is imported from Azerbaijan , of which a large share transits through the BTC pipeline .
Controlled by British Petroleum , the BTC pipeline has dramatically changed the geopolitics of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Caucusus : " [ The BTC pipeline ] considerably changes the status of the region 's countries and cements a new pro-West alliance .
Having taken the pipeline to the Mediterranean , Washington has practically set up a new bloc with Azerbaijan , Georgia , Turkey and Israel , " ( Komerzant , Moscow , 14 July 2006 )
While the official reports state that the BTC pipeline will " channel oil to Western markets " , what is rarely acknowledged is that part of the oil from the Caspian sea would be directly channeled towards Israel , via Georgia .
In this regard , an Israeli - Turkish pipeline project has also been envisaged which would link Ceyhan to the Israeli port of Ashkelon and from there through Israel 's main pipeline system , to the Red Sea .
The objective of Israel is not only to acquire Caspian sea oil for its own consumption needs but also to play a key role in re-exporting Caspian sea oil back to the Asian markets through the Red Sea port of Eilat .
The strategic implications of this re-routing of Caspian sea oil are far - reaching
What has been planned , is to link the BTC pipeline to the Trans - Israel Eilat - Ashkelon pipeline , also known as Israel 's Tipline , from Ceyhan to the Israeli port of Ashkelon .
The Isreali unmanned surveillance drones
The unmanned Israeli clandestine surveillance drones are a favorite of intelligence agencies world - wide .
Their most popular drone is the Hermes 450 drone aircraft .
The Hermes 450 is a large , capable 450 kg spy drone manufactured by Elbit Systems of Israel .
Able to stay airborne for a maximum of 20 hours , it has a 10.5 metre wingspan and is 6.1 metres long .
It can carry a variety of different surveillance packages , including the CoMPASS ( Compact Multi- Purpose Advanced Stabilised System ) , which is a combined laser marker and infrared scanner .
Elbit also offers Hermes with the AN / ZPQ - 1 TESAR ( Tactical Endurance Synthetic Aperture Radar ) from Northrop Grumman of the US , a ground - sweeping radar which can detect objects as small as one foot in size and pick out those which are moving from those which are n't .
Radars of this type are essential for full bad weather capability , and help a lot with scanning large areas of terrain .
Electro - optical scanners such as CoMPASS tend to offer a " drink - straw " view of only small areas in detail .
The TESAR is the same radar used in the hugely successful " Predator " drone , in service for several years now with the US forces .
The U.S. Army has a drone trainng school located at Ft. Huachuca , Arizona , an intelligence center located 10 miles from the Mexican border and the home of massive telephonic intelligence intercept units , aimed at Central and South America .
At present there are 225 soldiers , reservists , and National Guardsmen training at this school .
And on the faculty are three Israeli specialists .
This unit is not destined for the middle east or even Pakistan ; it has been set up to conduct surveillance of northern Mexico .
There are two reasons for wanting to watch our southern neighbor .
The first is to watch for great treks of illegal aliens but the second , and most important , is to conduct reconnaissance of territory over which American military units might be traversing in any punitive actions that could very , very well be triggered by the growing political instability in Mexico , caused by a growing struggle between the central government and the very powerful Mexican - based drug lords , who are wreaking havoc in that very corrupt country .
If a highly irate CIA employee , complaining of " excessive Israeli influence " in his agency , had not passed on files of information to the Russians late last year in Miami , in all probability , we would be reading about a stunning Israeli attack on Tehran .
Now , the Iranian anti-aircraft missile batteries , supplied and manned by Russian " technicians , " have the probable coordinates of such an Israeli surprise attack , from the north , which would give the defenses of Tehran a vital heads - up .
This is a tale of US expansion not Russian aggression War in the Caucasus is as much the product of an American imperial drive as local conflicts .
It 's likely to be a taste of things to come By Seumas Milne The Guardian 8 - 14 - 8
The outcome of six grim days of bloodshed in the Caucasus has triggered an outpouring of the most nauseating hypocrisy from western politicians and their captive media .
As talking heads thundered against Russian imperialism and brutal disproportionality , US vice - president Dick Cheney , faithfully echoed by Gordon Brown and David Miliband , declared that " Russian aggression must not go unanswered " .
George Bush denounced Russia for having " invaded a sovereign neighbouring state " and threatening " a democratic government " .
Such an action , he insisted , " is unacceptable in the 21st century " .
Could these by any chance be the leaders of the same governments that in 2003 invaded and occupied - along with Georgia , as luck would have it - the sovereign state of Iraq on a false pretext at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives ?
Or even the two governments that blocked a ceasefire in the summer of 2006 as Israel pulverised Lebanon 's infrastructure and killed more than a thousand civilians in retaliation for the capture or killing of five soldiers ?
You'd be hard put to recall after all the fury over Russian aggression that it was actually Georgia that began the war last Thursday with an all - out attack on South Ossetia to " restore constitutional order " - in other words , rule over an area it has never controlled since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Nor , amid the outrage at Russian bombardments , have there been much more than the briefest references to the atrocities committed by Georgian forces against citizens it claims as its own in South Ossetia 's capital Tskhinvali .
Several hundred civilians were killed there by Georgian troops last week , along with Russian soldiers operating under a 1990s peace agreement : " I saw a Georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children , " one Tskhinvali resident , Saramat Tskhovredov , told reporters on Tuesday .
Might it be because Georgia is what Jim Murphy , Britain 's minister for Europe , called a " small beautiful democracy " .
Well it 's certainly small and beautiful , but both the current president , Mikheil Saakashvili , and his predecessor came to power in western - backed coups , the most recent prettified as a " Rose revolution " .
Saakashvili was then initially rubber - stamped into office with 96 % of the vote before establishing what the International Crisis Group recently described as an " increasingly authoritarian " government , violently cracking down on opposition dissent and independent media last November .
" Democratic " simply seems to mean " pro-western " in these cases .
The long - running dispute over South Ossetia - as well as Abkhazia , the other contested region of Georgia - is the inevitable consequence of the breakup of the Soviet Union .
As in the case of Yugoslavia , minorities who were happy enough to live on either side of an internal boundary that made little difference to their lives feel quite differently when they find themselves on the wrong side of an international state border .
Such problems would be hard enough to settle through negotiation in any circumstances .
But add in the tireless US promotion of Georgia as a pro-western , anti-Russian forward base in the region , its efforts to bring Georgia into NATO , the routing of a key Caspian oil pipeline through its territory aimed at weakening Russia 's control of energy supplies , and the US - sponsored recognition of the independence of Kosovo - whose status Russia had explicitly linked to that of South Ossetia and Abkhazia - and conflict was only a matter of time .
The CIA has in fact been closely involved in Georgia since the Soviet collapse .
But under the Bush administration , Georgia has become a fully fledged US satellite .
Georgia 's forces are armed and trained by the US and Israel .
It has the third - largest military contingent in Iraq - hence the US need to airlift 800 of them back to fight the Russians at the weekend .
Saakashvili's links with the neoconservatives in Washington are particularly close : the lobbying firm headed by US Republican candidate John McCain 's top foreign policy adviser , Randy Scheunemann , has been paid nearly $ 900,000 by the Georgian government since 2004 .
But underlying the conflict of the past week has also been the Bush administration 's wider , explicit determination to enforce US global hegemony and prevent any regional challenge , particularly from a resurgent Russia .
That aim was first spelled out when Cheney was defence secretary under Bush 's father , but its full impact has only been felt as Russia has begun to recover from the disintegration of the 1990s .
Over the past decade , NATO 's relentless eastward expansion has brought the western military alliance hard up against Russia 's borders and deep into former Soviet territory .
American military bases have spread across eastern Europe and central Asia , as the US has helped install one anti-Russian client government after another through a series of colour - coded revolutions .
Now the Bush administration is preparing to site a missile defence system in eastern Europe transparently targeted at Russia .
By any sensible reckoning , this is not a story of Russian aggression , but of US imperial expansion and ever tighter encirclement of Russia by a potentially hostile power .
That a stronger Russia has now used the South Ossetian imbroglio to put a check on that expansion should hardly come as a surprise .
What is harder to work out is why Saakashvili launched last week 's attack and whether he was given any encouragement by his friends in Washington .
If so , it has spectacularly backfired , at savage human cost .
And despite Bush 's attempts to talk tough yesterday , the war has also exposed the limits of US power in the region .
As long as Georgia proper 's independence is respected - best protected by opting for neutrality - that should be no bad thing .
Unipolar domination of the world has squeezed the space for genuine self - determination and the return of some counterweight has to be welcome .
But the process of adjustment also brings huge dangers .
If Georgia had been a member of NATO , this week 's conflict would have risked a far sharper escalation .
That would be even more obvious in the case of Ukraine - which yesterday gave a warning of the potential for future confrontation when its pro-western president threatened to restrict the movement of Russian ships in and out of their Crimean base in Sevastopol .
As great power conflict returns , South Ossetia is likely to be only a taste of things to come .
Six days that broke one country - and reshaped the world order August 16 , 2008 by Ian Traynor The Guardian Pity Georgia 's bedraggled First Infantry Brigade .
And its Second .
And its hapless Navy .
For the past few evenings in the foothills of the Southern Caucasus on the outskirts of Joseph Stalin 's hometown of Gori , reconnaissance units of Russia 's 58th Army have been raking through the spoils of war at what was the Georgian Army 's pride and joy , a shiny new military base inaugurated only last January for the First Infantry , the Army Engineers , and an Artillery Brigade .
A couple of hours to the west , in the town of Senaki , it 's the same picture .
A flagship military base , home to the Second Infantry Brigade , is in Russian hands .
And down on the Black Sea coast , the radars and installations for Georgia 's sole naval base at Poti have been scrupulously pinpointed by the Russians and destroyed .
Gori and Senaki are not ramshackle relics of the old Red Army of the type that litter the landscape of eastern Europe .
" These bases have only recently been upgraded to NATO standard , " said Matthew Clements , Eurasia analyst at Jane 's Information Group .
" They have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the Georgian military . "
" There is a presence of our armed forces near Gori and Senaki .
We make no secret of it , " said the general staff in Moscow .
" They are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of Gori and Senaki without any guard whatsoever . "
The " enormous arsenals " are American - made or American - supplied .
American money , know - how , planning , and equipment built these bases as part of Washington 's drive to bring NATO membership to a small country that is Russia 's underbelly .
The American " train and equip " mission for the Georgian military is six years old .
It has been destroyed in as many days .
And with it , Georgia 's NATO ambitions .
" There are a few countries that will say ' told you so ' " about the need to get Georgia into NATO , " said Andrew Wilson , Russia expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations .
" But many more will want to walk away from the problem .
And for the next few years , Georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up . "
If Georgia and NATO are the principal casualties of this week 's ruthless display of brute power by Vladimir Putin , the consequences are bigger still , the fallout immense , if uncertain .
The regional and the global balance of power looks to have tilted , against the west and in favour of the rising or resurgent players of the east .
In a seminal speech in Munich last year , Putin confidently warned the west that he would not tolerate the age of American hyperpower .
Seven years in office at the time and at the height of his powers , he delivered his most anti-western tirade Pernicious
To an audience that included John McCain , the White House contender , and Robert Gates , the US defence secretary and ex-Kremlinologist , he served notice : " What is a unipolar world ?
It refers to one type of situation , one centre of authority , one centre of force , one centre of decision - making .
It is world in which there is one master , one sovereign .
This is pernicious ... unacceptable ... impossible . "
This week , he turned those words into action , demonstrating the limits of US power with his rout of Georgia .
His forces roamed at will along the roads of the Southern Caucasus , beyond Russia 's borders for the first time since the disastrous Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s .
As the Russian officers sat on the American stockpiles of machine guns , ammunition , and equipment in Gori , they were savouring a highly unusual scenario .
Not since the Afghan war had the Russians seized vast caches of US weaponry .
" People are sick to the stomach in Washington , " said a former Pentagon official .
And the Russians are giddy with success .
Celebrating the biggest victory in eight years of what might be termed Putinism , the dogged pursuit by whatever means to avenge a long period of Russian humiliation and to deploy his limited range of levers - oil , gas , or brute force - to make the world listen to Moscow , the Russian prime minister has redrawn the geopolitical map .
In less than a week , Putin has invaded another country , effectively partitioned Georgia in a lightning campaign , weakened his arch - enemy , President Mikheil Saakashvili , divided the west , and presented a fait accompli .
The impact - locally , regionally , and globally - is huge .
" The war in Georgia has put the European order in question , " said Alexander Rahr , one of Germany 's leading Russia experts and a Putin biographer .
" The times are past when you can punish Russia . "
That seems to be the view among leading European policymakers who have been scrambling all week to arrange and shore up a fragile ceasefire , risking charges of appeasing the Kremlin .
" Do n't ask us who 's good and who 's bad here , " said Bernard Kouchner , the French foreign minister , after shuttling between Tbilisi and Moscow to try to halt the violence .
" We should n't make any moral judgments on this war .
Stopping the war , that 's what we 're interested in . "
His boss , President Nicolas Sarkozy , went to the Kremlin to negotiate a ceasefire and parade as a peacemaker .
Critics said he acted as Moscow 's messenger , noting Putin 's terms then taking them to Tbilisi to persuade Saakashvili to capitulate .
Germany also refused to take sides while Italy warned against building an " anti-Moscow coalition " .
That contrasted with Gordon Brown 's and David Milliband 's talk of Russian " aggression " and Condoleezza Rice 's arrival in Tbilisi yesterday to rally " the free world behind a free Georgia " .
The effects of Putin 's coup are first felt locally and around Russia 's rim .
" My view is that the Russians , and I would say principally prime minister Putin , is interested in reasserting Russia 's , not only Russia 's great power or superpower status , but in reasserting Russia 's traditional spheres of influence , " said Gates .
" My guess is that everyone is going to be looking at Russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead . "
In Kiev certainly .
Ukraine 's pro-western prime minister , Viktor Yushchenko , Saaksahvili 's fellow colour - revolutionary , is chastened and wary .
His firebrand anti-Russian prime minister , Yuliya Tymoshenko , has gone uncharacteristically quiet .
Invasion of the Ukraine ?
" An invasion of Ukraine by ' peacekeeping tanks ' is just a question of time , " wrote Aleksandr Sushko , director of Kiev 's Institute of Euro - Atlantic Cooperation .
" Weimar Russia is completing its transformation into something else .
If Russia wins this war , a new order will take shape in Europe which will have no place for Ukraine as a sovereign state . "
All around Russia 's rim , the former Soviet " captive states " are trembling .
Even Belarus , the slavishly loyal " last dictatorship in Europe " , went strangely silent , taking days before the regime offered Moscow its support .
" Everybody 's nervous , " said Wilson .
The EU states of the Baltic and Poland are drumming up support for Georgia , with the Polish president Lech Kaczynski declaring that Russia has revealed " its true face " .
That divides the EU since the French and the Germans refuse to take sides and are scornful of east European " hysteria " towards Russia .
Rahr in Berlin says the German and French governments are striving to keep the Poles and the Baltic states well away from any EU - led peace negotiations .
It was the Germans and the French who , in April , blunted George Bush 's drive to get Georgia into NATO .
They will also resist potential US moves to kick Russia out of the G8 or other international bodies .
There are many who argue that Putin 's gamble will backfire , that he has bitten off more than he can chew , that Russia remains weak , a " Saudi Arabia with trees " in the words of Robert Hunter , the former US ambassador to NATO .
Compared to the other rising powers of China , India or even Brazil - the companions referred to as the BRIC - Russia does indeed appear weak .
Its economy struggles to develop goods or services , depends on raw material exports and on European consumption and the price of oil for its current wealth .
Resources But Putin 's talent is for playing a weak hand well , maximising and concentrating his limited resources , and creating facts on the ground while the west dithers .
" There is a lack of a clear and unified European policy towards Russia , " said Clements .
In the crucial contest over energy " the Russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any European response " .
Putin may now calculate he can call off the dogs of war , having achieved his aims and able to pocket his gains very cheaply .
The Georgia campaign becomes the triumphant climax of Putinism .
" In politics , it is very important to know one 's measure , " wrote Aleksey Arbatov , director of Moscow 's International Security Centre .
" If Russia continues to inflict strikes on Georgian territory , on facilities , on population centres , we may lose the moral supremacy we have today . "
But Wilson and many in eastern Europe worry that rather than being the climax of Putinism , the Russians in Georgia signal the start of something else .
" This may not be a culmination , but only step one , " said Wilson .
" If you do n't stop this kind of behaviour , it escalates . "

It was the pro-Israeli crowd in the Republican Party that pulled the old switcheroo and refocussed on the Middle East rather than Eurasia .
Now , powerful members of the US foreign policy establishment ( Brzezinski , Albright , Holbrooke ) have regrouped behind the populist " cardboard " presidential candidate Barak Obama and are preparing to redirect America 's war efforts to the Asian theater .
Obama offers voters a choice of wars not a choice against war .

A 1991 article in the Arizona Star at the time of the adoption only mentions that the children were from an orphanage that was started by Mother Teresa .
It does not mention a meeting with Mother Teresa or her asking McCain to bring the girls to the US .
This is the pattern :
A story that shows the McCains ' genuine compassion and faith is embellished over the years to make the story a little more perfect , a little more salient , a little better as a narrative .
It 's especially important to add these embellishments when your goal is to appeal to a fundamentalist base , when your own prickly , personal and private faith is n't very marketable .
And when your adopted daughter is Bangladeshi , and when that fact has been disgracefully used against you by the Bush machine in 2000 , and when some fringes of your base get queasy about multi-racial families , what better way to describe the adoption than as something Mother Teresa herself " implored " you to do ?
More interesting : the first actual reports of this event do not mention this fact .
They are added later .
I note that this false story was on the McCain website and has since been corrected .
Now , the question is whether and when Cindy McCain met with Mother Teresa :
A McCain source acknowledged that Cindy McCain did not meet Mother Teresa during the 1991 trip to Bangladesh but said McCain did meet her later on , although the source could not say when or where .
The campaign has since reworded the reference to the adoption on its website .
Can we nail down the date of that meeting ?
Or are these questions no one should dare ask of a POW war hero ?

We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
For a generation , most people accepted the idea that the core of what makes America tick was an economy governed by free markets .
And whatever combination of goods , services and jobs the market cooked up was presumed to be fine for the nation and for its citizens -- certainly better than government meddling .
No longer .
Spurred by the continued housing crisis , turmoil in financial markets , spiking oil prices , disappearing jobs and shrinking retirement savings , the nation and its political leaders have begun to sour on the notion that the current market system is the key to a fair , stable and efficient society .
“ We ’re at a hinge point , ” said William A. Galston , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who helped craft President Clinton ’s market - friendly agenda during the 1990s .
“ The strong presumption in favor of markets , which has dominated public policy since the late 1970s , has been thrown very much into question . ”
Advertisement
Now , to a degree not seen in years , politicians and outside experts are looking with favor at more , not less , government involvement in the economy .
Of course , Americans always grouse during troubled times .
And as market advocates are quick to point out , the current run of bad economic breaks has yet to result in the throwing over of free - market principles in favor of some drastically different approach -- such as a government - directed economy .
“ There may be a backlash against markets at the moment , ” acknowledged Kevin A. Hassett , economic studies director at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and an advisor to presumed Republican presidential nominee John McCain .
“ But the backlash does n’t seem to be informed by any alternative view of how the world works . ”
Yet the sheer volume of setbacks that people have been dealt has sent consumer confidence to some of its lowest levels in half a century , according to Reuters / University of Michigan surveys .
A remarkable 84 % of Americans are convinced that the nation is on the “ wrong track , ” according to a recent Gallup poll .
Advertisement
In just the last week , the financial markets have provided ample new evidence that markets are not working smoothly .
Washington had to ride to the rescue of two government - chartered mortgage giants -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which hold or guarantee nearly half of the nation ’s $ 12 trillion in mortgage debt -- after investors all but extinguished the pair ’s market value amid fears that falling home prices would push them into insolvency .
Meanwhile , federal regulators seized IndyMac Bancorp , a $ 32 - billion mortgage lender based in Pasadena , in what regulators called the second - largest bank failure in U.S. history .
And the already battered stock market took another sharp dip .
The fact that experts keep pushing back the date when conditions may improve and the failure thus far of any national leader -- including either of the major - party presidential candidates -- to offer a convincing vision of how America will make its way back to sustained prosperity suggest that the current crisis will probably be very different from other recent economic bad patches .
Advertisement
So may Americans ’ reaction to it .
Even the Bush administration , which took office arguing that the Social Security crisis could be solved , in part , by tying some of retirees ’ future benefits to Wall Street , has begun advocating more government regulation of financial markets .
When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which are government - chartered but investor - owned , began to teeter last week , the administration quietly went to work on possible government action .
“ If the pendulum swung away from government toward much greater confidence in markets during the last generation , the pendulum is clearly swinging back again now , ” said Daniel Yergin , whose 1998 book with coauthor Joseph Stanislaw , “ The Commanding Heights , ” chronicled the worldwide spread of the free - market credo .
“ Everything is weighing in at the same time , and that affects how people view markets and government , ” Yergin said .

“ Nobody in this country really believes in unfettered free markets , and nobody really believes in socialism , ” said UC Davis historian Eric Rauchway , but economic crises of the past have produced constituencies favoring the reining in of markets and regulation of the economy -- constituencies that ultimately grew large enough to produce change .
Consider just a few of the things that are pushing people in that direction now :
The price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline has nearly doubled in the last year , while that for a barrel of crude oil has more than doubled , cutting short Americans ’ love affair with gas - guzzlers and driving the nation ’s trucking , auto and airline industries into deep trouble .
Most mainstream economists assert that these increases are simply the logical outcome of booming global demand meeting limited global supply .
Advertisement
But the price run-ups seem out of whack with demand , which has increased only about 1 % worldwide .
The mismatch has fueled suspicion among many Americans and their political leaders that the third financial bubble of the decade -- after tech stocks and housing -- is underway , this time in energy .
Both presidential candidates have fingered market speculators , rather than the forces of supply and demand , for helping drive up prices .
At a recent hearing , Rep. John D. Dingell ( D - Mich . ) cornered the federal official whose agency regulates the market where oil futures are traded .
“ How is it that the market is n’t working to the benefit of the consuming public ? ” the lawmaker demanded .
The agency has launched a number of studies to discover whether speculators are behind the price increases , the official answered .
Advertisement
“ Do n’t tell me you ’re doing studies ! ” Dingell shot back .
“ You ’ve spent more than a year sitting idly by ” while oil prices jumped .
At least half a dozen measures have been introduced in Congress to limit speculation or to tax oil company profits .
Similar anger -- and similar legislative efforts to intervene in the marketplace -- can be seen in housing .
While Americans have been accustomed to some fluctuation in the value of their homes , most expected their houses to rise in value over time .
And for much of the last several decades , that ’s what happened .
Advertisement
But starting in mid-2004 , the upward arc of house prices began to flatten , and by 2007 it was falling -- sharply .
Prices , especially along the West and East coasts , have skidded as much as 16 % during the last year alone , their steepest decline in two decades .
Many analysts predict further slippage .
In large part , the rise in house prices and the recent plunge grew out of an almost unregulated corner of the mortgage market -- the one for riskier loans .
As with fuel , “ the message that Americans are getting is that something went wrong with the markets and you got hurt , ” said economist Robert E. Litan of the Brookings Institution and the Kauffman Foundation of Kansas City , Mo .
“ With energy , it ’s the speculators .
With housing , it ’s predatory lenders or crummy credit - rating agencies or stupid banks .
We ’re not ready to throw out markets altogether , ” he said , “ but we want government to do something about the excess . ”
Advertisement
A similar pattern of hopes raised and hopes dashed shows up in global trade and retirement investing .
Americans entered the new century convinced that “ we had a new economy built on services and information technology that would let us win globally , ” said Harvard economist Robert Z. Lawrence .
“ The whole premise of globalization in the year 2000 was that it worked well for us and the other developed countries but that the developing countries would need help , ” Lawrence said .
Today , virtually all those optimistic assumptions have been turned on their heads .
Advertisement
“ We ’ve seen unprecedented growth in the developing countries , while the developed countries are being led into a slowdown by the United States , ” Lawrence said .
“ We ’ve found out that instead of services and information technology , it ’s all about oil and other commodities ” that are not the nation ’s strong suit .
Finally , when it comes to investment , especially for retirement , recent years have brought unsettling disappointments as the stock market has failed to regain and maintain the peaks that it reached in 2000 .
An investor who put a dollar in a broad market index fund early in this decade not only would have made no money by today but would have lost a little of his initial amount .
Advertisement
That ’s a far cry from the 1990s , when people told pollsters that they expected to make 15 % annual gains indefinitely .
Historians watching the nation ’s current economic and financial troubles say that just because Americans do n’t throw up their hands about markets and rush to an opposite pole , such as socialism , it does n’t mean that change is n’t underway .
As UC Davis ’ Rauchway pointed out , the devastating panics and depressions of the late 19th century eventually resulted in the progressive reforms of the early 20th century and , later , the New Deal of the 1930s .
Today , Americans are not ready to throw out markets altogether , said economist Litan , but “ what people may be demanding is New Deal lite . ”

PROXIMITY TO RUSSIA IS IRRELEVANT ….
On Friday , my friend Kevin Drum came up with a clever little way to preemptively mock Republicans ’ claims about Sarah Palin ’s foreign policy experience .
“ Is n’t Alaska a central front in the new Cold War ?
That ’s foreign policy experience right there ! ”
Kevin joked .
If only the Republican establishment was n’t serious about this .
For example , Fox News ’ Steve Doocy , with a straight face , insisted , “ [ T ] he other thing about her , she does know about international relations because she is right up there in Alaska right next door to Russia . ”
( This led Jon Stewart to call Doocy a “ moron . ” )
This morning , Cindy McCain made the exact same argument , telling George Stephanopoulos , in response to a question about national security experience , “ [ R] emember , Alaska is the closest part of our continent to Russia .
It ’s not as if she does n’t understand what ’s at stake here . ”
Has Palin ever been to Russia ?
No .
Has she ever demonstrated any expertise on U.S. policy towards Russia ?
No .
Does she have any background in international relations at any level ?
No .
But for Republicans , the fact that she ’s lived near Russia is somehow a qualification for national office .
The mind reels .
The Sun newspaper has come over a bit modest .
Following a Channel 4 documentary about media reporting of Muslims , the paper accepts some of its stories were " distorted " .
But they 're not doing themselves justice .
They were n't distorted – they were entirely made up .
For example , a story about a Muslim bus driver who ordered his passengers off the bus so he could pray was pure fabrication .
But if reporters are allowed to make up what they like , that one should be disciplined for displaying a shocking lack of imagination .
He could have continued , " The driver has now won a case at the Court of Human Rights that his bus route should be altered so it only goes east .
This means the 37A from Sutton Coldfield will no longer stop at Selly Oak library , but go the wrong way up a one - way street and carry on to Mecca .
Local depot manager Stan Tubworth said , ' I suggested he only take it as far as Athens but he threatened a Jihad , and a holy war is just the sort of thing that could put a service like the Selly Oak Clipper out of business ' . "
Then there was a story about " Muslim thugs " in Windsor who attacked a house used by soldiers , except it was another invention .
But with this tale the reporter still claims it 's true , despite a complete absence of evidence , because , " The police are too politically correct to admit it . "
This must be the solution to all unsolved crimes .
With Jack the Ripper it 's obvious – he was facing the East End of London , his victims were infidels and he'd have access to a burqua which would give him vital camouflage in the smog .
But do the pro-Muslim police even bother to investigate ?
Of course not , because it 's just " Allah Allah Allah " down at the stations these days .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Maybe Muslim newspapers should retaliate by publishing their own made - up stories .
So it will be reported that " Barmy PC teachers in Leicester have banned children from playing Noughts and Crosses , claiming the cross reminds Church of England kiddies of the suffering undertaken by Lord Jesus .
A spokesman for the Board of Education said , ' We have to be sensitive .
Which is why we 've replaced the game with ' Noughts and Hexagons ' .
We did look into calling it ' Noughts and Crowns of Thorns ' but decided Hexagons was more appropriate . "
Or , " Doctors have been told that patients are no longer to be referred to as ' stable ' , as this is offensive to followers of Jesus , who was said to have been born in one .
So medical staff have been informed they must use an alternative word , or if they can't think of one just let the patient die . "
The most common justification for ridiculing Islam is that the religion is " backward " , particularly towards women , as a fundamental part of its beliefs .
The Sun 's old political editor suggests this as a defence of his newspaper 's stance , saying that under Islam , " women are treated as chattels " .
And it 's true that religious scriptures can command this , such as the insistence that , " a man may sell his daughter as a slave , but she will not be freed at the end of six years as men are . "
Except that comes from the Bible – Exodus , Chapter 21 , verse 7 .
The Bible is packed with justifications for slavery , including killing your slaves .
So presumably the Sun , along with others who regard Islam as a threat to our civilisation , will soon be campaigning against " Sunday Schools of Hate " where children as young as seven are taught to read this grisly book .
And next Easter they 'll report how , " I saw a small child smile with glee as he opened a Cadbury 's egg filled with chocolate buttons .
But behind his grin I could n't help but wonder whether he wanted to turn me into a pillar of salt , then maybe sprinkle me on his menacing confectionary treat . "
In his defence of making stuff up , the Sun 's ex-political editor spoke about the amount of domestic violence suffered by Muslim women .
But there 's just as much chance of suffering domestic violence if you 're not a Muslim , as one of the 10 million such incidents a year that take place in Britain .
Presumably the anti-Islam lobby would say , " Ah yes , but those other ones involve secular wife - beating , which is not founded on archaic religious customs , but rational reasoning such as not letting him watch the snooker . "
And finally the Sun 's man defends the line of his paper by saying that , after all , these Muslims " are trying to bomb our country " .
So it 's their civic duty to make stuff up – the same as keeping a look - out for spies during the Second World War .
So we should all do our bit , and every day send in something , until the press is full of stories like " Muslims in Darlington have been raising money for semtex by organising panda fights . "
Or " In Bradford all nurseries have been ordered to convert their dolls ' houses into miniature mosques so that Muslim teddies have somewhere to pray . "
From the pool report :
Sen .
Obama gathered the pool outside after services at St. Luke 's Lutheran Church .
He told us that his camapaign plans to mobilize its huge e-mail list of supporters to volunteer or send money once the impact of Gustav becomes apparent and authorities know better what kind of help is needed .
He said his campaign is coordinating with local authorities .
" We can activate an e-mail list of a couple million people who want to give back , " he said .
" I think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary . "
Your pooler asked him if McCain 's visit now is appropriate .
His response : " A big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and I think for John to want to find out what 's going on is fine . "
" The thing that I always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether we 're drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the Secret Service and various security requirements , sometimes it pulls police , fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job . "
" I 'm assuming that where he went that was n't an issue .
Were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then we 'll probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible . "
Kangaroo Farming Could Reduce Global Warming
August 11th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
What if you could drastically reduce greenhouse gases just by changing your eating habits ?
According to a new study by the University of New South Wales , farming kangaroos instead of sheep or cattle could lower national greenhouse gases in Australia by 3 percent a year .
Methane from burps and farts of cows and sheep is an often overlooked contributor to global warming , but it accounts for 67 % of Australia ’s agricultural sector methane emissions .
It also contributes 11 % of Australia ’s total emissions .
In contrast , kangaroos barely produce any methane .
Of course , changing an entire nation ’s eating habits is n’t easy .
Australia sells relatively little kangaroo meat for consumption compared to other types of meat , and then there ’s the issue of kangaroos being a national icon .
But Australia produces 1.5 of the world ’s carbon emissions , so drastic steps certainly should n’t be out of the question .
If the farming project actually takes off , the authors of the University of New South Wales study estimate that rangelands could support 240 million kangaroos — and only 175 million kangaroos are needed to produce the same amount of meat currently harvested from rangelands .
Fortunately for those of us living outside of Australia , other countries are embarking on similar projects to reduce methane by farming low - emissions animals .
Examples include springbok in South Africa , red deer in the UK , and bison in the United States .
With CO2 emissions from other industries showing no signs of slowing down , eating a red deer burger does n’t sound so bad .

Ezra Pound ’s
In a Station of the Metro , first published in 1913 is considered one of the leading poems of the Imagist tradition .
The poem , written in a Japanese haiku style , took a year and a half to write , and was reduced from thirty lines to only fourteen words .
This poem typifies Imagism ’s focus on economy of language , precision of imagery and experimenting with non-traditional verse forms .
Pound explains in his article “ Vorticism ” , found in the April 1916 publication ‘ Gaudier Brzeska ’ that upon seeing faces in the crowd he was inspired by such beauty .
He wished to convert this into language but all he could see was ‘ splotches of colour ’ , ideal for expression in a painting .
It took Pound two years to find an ‘ equation ’ to translate this vision into a poem .
The poem ’s brevity means that no word works independently but when used collectively they create tension and emotion .
The apparition of these faces in the crowd ;
Petals on a wet , black bough .

Every Sunday , more than 4 million Americans tuned in to Meet the Press seeking help in trying to understand the issues and the candidates .
They chose that program because Tim Russert was among the most astute , discerning and relentless pursuers of truth in the nation , and had been for years .
James Poniewozic of Time described his routine the best : " There was almost a kind of instinctual , animal acuity on display when Russert did an interview .
He would lean forward , savoring what he took in , seeming to smell and taste the answers more than hearing them , picking up immediately and viscerally on the slightest off note . "
Pound wished to translate his perception of beauty in the midst of ugliness into a single , perfect image in written form .
Russert believed that politics could change the trajectory of people 's lives .
He held his guests to account for inconsistent past statements and doggedly followed up on evasions .
Through his craft , he was trying to make us all better .

BALTIMORE —
A toddler whose remains were found inside a suitcase in Philadelphia in April was starved to death by members of a religious cult , including his mother , in part because he refused to say “ amen ” after meals , police said .
Ria Ramkissoon , the mother of Javon Thompson , was charged Sunday with first - degree murder in the boy ’s death .
Baltimore police said Monday that three other members of a group called 1 Mind Ministries have also been charged with first - degree murder .
Police and Ramkissoon ’s family say the group is a cult .
Members did not seek medical care for Javon when he stopped breathing , and the boy died in his mother ’s arms , according to court documents .
He would have been about 19 months old when police say adults stopped feeding him in December 2006 .
Ramkissoon , 21 , was being held Monday in the psychiatric ward of Baltimore ’s Central Booking and Intake Center , and a bail review was postponed until today .
Her public defender declined comment .
The three other people charged in Javon ’s death — Queen Antoinette , 40 , also known as Toni Ellsberry or Toni Sloan ; Marcus Cobbs , 21 ; and Trevia Williams , who turns 21 today — were already in custody .
Ramkissoon ’s family said she should not be held responsible for her son ’s death .
“ She had no control over that situation at all , ” her stepfather , Craig Newton , said Monday .
Ramkissoon ’s mother , Seeta Khadan - Newton , told The ( Baltimore ) Sun on Sunday that it was n’t her daughter ’s decision not to feed the boy .
“ My daughter was a victim , just like my grandson , ” Khadan - Newton said .
“ Somebody made that decision to not feed that child , and my daughter had to follow instructions . ”
According to court documents , Ramkissoon joined 1 Mind Ministries after Javon was born .
Ramkissoon ’s mother last saw her daughter in April 2006 .
She later sued for custody of her grandson , writing in a letter to a judge that “ the cult leaders ” were preventing her from contacting her daughter .
Court documents show police interviewed two school - age children who had been part of the group but were taken away from members by Philadelphia police .
The children told investigators that members stopped feeding Javon in December 2006 , in part because the boy refused to say “ amen ” after dinner .
Members also viewed Javon as “ a demon . ”
Another unnamed informant told police that after Javon died , Antoinette left the boy ’s body in a room for more than a week , claiming , “ God was going to raise Javon from the dead , ” the documents show .
Afterward , Antoinette burned the boy ’s clothing and a mattress and placed his body in a green suitcase , which she would periodically open and spray with disinfectant to mask the odor , police claim in the court documents .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Disease spread to wild bees from commercially bred bees used for pollination in agriculture greenhouses may be playing a role in the mysterious decline in North American bee populations , researchers said on Tuesday .

Bees pollinate numerous crops , and scientists have been expressing alarm over their falling numbers in recent years in North America .
Experts warn the bee disappearance eventually could harm agriculture and the food supply .
Scientists have been struggling to understand the recent decline in various bee populations in North America .
For example , a virus brought from Australia has been implicated in massive honeybee deaths last year .
Canadian researchers studied another type of bee , the bumblebee , near two large greenhouse operations in southern Ontario where commercially reared pollination bees are used in the growing of crops such as tomatoes , bell peppers and cucumbers .
The researchers first observed that the commercial bumblebees regularly flew in and out of vents in the sides of the greenhouses , escaping from the facilities .
The researchers then devised a mathematical model to predict how disease might spread from this “ spillover ” of runaway commercial bees to their wild cousins .
The model predicted a relatively slow build - up of infection in nearby wild bumblebee populations over weeks or months culminating in a burst of transmission generating an epidemic wave that could affect nearly all of wild bees exposed .
The model also predicted a drop - off in infection rates as you get further from the greenhouses .
GREENHOUSE BUMBLEBEE PARASITES
The researchers then sampled wild bumblebee populations around the greenhouses , catching bees in butterfly nets , holding them in vials and taking them back to a laboratory to screen for pathogens , including testing their feces .
The patterns that had been predicted by their mathematical model were borne out by studying the wild bees , they said .
Most of the parasites in the wild bumblebees were found to be at normal levels except for one intestinal parasite known as Crithidia bombi that is common in commercial bee colonies but typically absent in wild bumblebees .
The researchers found that up to half of wild bumblebees near the greenhouses were infected with this parasite .
“ All of the different species of bumblebees that we sampled around greenhouses showed the same pattern : really high levels of infection near greenhouses and then declining levels of infection as you moved out , ” said Michael Otterstatter of the University of Toronto , one of the researchers .
“ It was quite obvious that this was coming from the greenhouses and it was a general adverse effect on the bumblebees , ” Otterstatter added in a telephone interview .
He said the parasite weakens and often kills bees .
The “ spillover ” of disease from commercial colonies may be a factor in the decline of bee populations in North America , he added .
The study , published in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE , can be readhere .
JUST when it appeared that the world had found a means of easing one big problem ( carbon emissions ) it looks like the chosen solution is contributing to other woes .
That , in a nutshell , is the current debate over biofuels .
The World Bank president , Robert Zoellick , has just added fuel to the fire ( so to speak ) by calling for reform to biofuel policies in Europe and America .
Mr Zoellick , speaking on the sidelines of the G - 8 summit , said biofuels ( especially those made from rapeseed and corn in those two regions ) were contributing to rising food prices .
Mr Zoellick is not the first to make the observation , but the timing of his remarks , at a top - level summit where food and fuel prices are high on the agenda , give them added punch .
Britain has just announced plans to slow its transition to biofuels , citing worries about the impact on both food prices and land use .
Ruth Kelly , the transport minister , told the Commons on Monday that " it is right to adopt a more cautious approach until the evidence is clearer about the wider environmental and social effects of biofuels . "
In addition , she added , more time is needed for sustainable biofuel technologies to be developed .
Ms Kelly 's remarks followed publication of a report on the environmental and social impact of biofuels by the government 's Renewable Fuels Agency .
The so - called Gallagher Review calls for a shift in the renewable transport fuel obligation , which sets a percentage of biofuels to be mixed into road transport fuel in the coming years , and recommended a lower percentage than current plans call for .
Green groups said the review did not go far enough , and renewed their calls for biofuel targets in the fuel plan to be scrapped entirely .

Olbermann finished the script shortly after 3 A.M.
He e-mailed copies to his producers , and then he went to bed .
The jeremiad against Bush was a signature Olbermann effort , the sort of stylized , mocking tirade that has lately made him a cable - news sensation , the Edward R. Murrow of the Angry Left .
Olbermann was pleased with the script , and the next day , before going on the air with it , he posted excerpts on the liberal blog Daily Kos , which is a fairly good representation of the Olbermann fan base .
The Kossacks wholly approved .
( “ You excoriated the bloodyhanded , warmongering imbecile . ”
“ This country cannot survive without you . ”
“ Dude , you ’ve got a pair of steel ones ! ” “ I ’m gonna print it out , hang it up and memorize it . ” )
At MSNBC , the feedback was slightly more cautious .
Olbermann ’s original script identified the “ cold - blooded killers ” as everyone at the Pentagon and in the Bush Cabinet ; when a colleague noted that that would include such relative moderates as Colin Powell and Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Olbermann modified the line .
Phil Griffin , the senior vice - president in charge of MSNBC ( “ Phil thinks he ’s my boss , ” Olbermann says ) , raised the matter of tone .
Why did Olbermann need to end his commentary by telling the President of the United States to “ shut the hell up ” ?
“ Because I ca n’t say , ‘ Shut the fuck up , ’ that ’s why , frankly , ” Olbermann responded .
The line stayed in .
Phil Griffin is a compact , nearly bald man with the intensity and the revved - up metabolism of a TV - news field producer , which is how he spent his early career .
He speaks in quick bursts , and his conversations tend to the elliptical .
Griffin was Olbermann ’s first television producer , nearly thirty years ago , when both of them were at the start of their careers , Griffin as a CNN producer , Olbermann as an innovative , eccentric radio sportscaster making his first foray into television .
It was Griffin ’s job to handle Olbermann , to teach him about the frenetic , video - hungry new world of cable news .
In a way , he still sees himself as Olbermann ’s handler .
“ You do n’t take Keith on by just saying , ‘ You ca n’t do that , ’ ” Griffin told me .
“ Keith is reasonable .
But you ’ve got to be smart .
Keith is usually two steps ahead of me , when I do come and say , ‘ Keith . . .’
It ’s a give - and - take . ”
When , in 1981 , Olbermann arrived at CNN , then still in its startup throes , he was , at twenty - two , seen as a sportscasting wunderkind — smart , offbeat , and possessed of an encyclopedic range of knowledge .
He also had the reputation , even among those who admired his talents , of being somewhat difficult .
Growing up in suburban Hastings - on - Hudson , in Westchester County , he was the sort of kid who , when his parents thought psychological testing was in order , responded to the Rorschach test by saying , “ It looks like an inkblot . ”
Advised that Keith might be better served by a private education , his parents — Theodore , a commercial architect , and Marie , a preschool teacher — enrolled him at the Hackley School , in Tarrytown .
It was n’t an easy adjustment ; Keith had skipped a grade and was younger than anyone else in his class , and he was n’t a jock .
But he was a good student , and the school ’s radio station became his home .
Olbermann worked as a sports stringer in college , at Cornell , and when he graduated , in 1979 , he went directly to a sportscasting job at UPI radio in New York .
Olbermann ’s style stood out from the start .
He gently mocked the conventions of sportscasting ( in his deep broadcaster ’s timbre ) even while observing them .
At UPI , he became famous for drolly tallying the number of times athletes said “ Y’ know ” during interviews .
He also had a sometimes overbearing self - certainty .
When he was twenty - three , he told Bill MacPhail , the former CBS Sports executive who had overseen the introduction of instant replay , that MacPhail did n’t know anything about television sports .
In an argument with one of his supervisors at UPI , he so forcefully advocated his position ( “ God damn it , this is the minor leagues here , ” he said , “ and it ’s things like this that are keeping us the minor leagues ’’ ) that he was fired that afternoon .
( The Wire Service Guild stepped in and saved his job . )
His three - year career at CNN was , he says , “ a continuing pitched battle . ”
He moved to a television station in Boston , and lasted a few months .
At the age of twenty - five , he moved back home , a flameout , with few prospects .
His agent sent his highlight tapes to stations around the country , but most station managers did n’t quite know what to make of him .
“ The standard response , ” he says , “ was ‘ I like him , but is Baltimore ready for him ? ’ ”
Jeff Wald , who was then the news director of KTLA Channel 5 , in Los Angeles , had heard the stories , but he saw Olbermann ’s tapes , and was curious .
“ I just said , ‘ He ’s the guy , ’ ” Wald recalls .
“ Regardless of the baggage he may or may not have , I want to meet this guy and see if he ’s the real deal .
And he was . ”
Wald wanted someone unusual , and he got it .
For one thing , Olbermann almost certainly was the only television sportscaster in Los Angeles who did n’t drive .
Olbermann , who is six feet three and a half , once bumped his head while leaping into a subway car ; it permanently upset his equilibrium , which makes driving a trial .
( He says he loses depth perception at speeds greater than fifteen miles per hour . )
He also hates flying , and that made it difficult to follow the local teams , but it was just as well ; Olbermann firmly resisted the chumminess that often develops between sports journalists and their subjects .
Wald says that the only argument he had with Olbermann came when Olbermann refused an assignment to cover spring training .
“ He thought that was going to compromise his objectivity and reporting , ” Wald recalls .
“ I did n’t know at the time that he did n’t like to fly , but I think that he was probably right in his reasons . ”
In 1992 , Olbermann joined ESPN , where his erudite , wise - guy style flowered into an artful , full - blown satire of the cliché - ridden form : “ That ’s a six - four - three double play if you ’re scoring at home .
Or if you ’re by yourself . ”
Olbermann ’s tenure at ESPN was characteristically contentious .
One of his co-anchors , Suzy Kolber , has said that Olbermann was sometimes so overbearing that she would lock herself in the bathroom and cry .
Another colleague , Mike Soltys , has said that when Olbermann left the network , in 1997 , “ he did n’t burn bridges here — he napalmed them . ”
Olbermann was glad enough to be leaving the grind of full - time sportscasting behind .
His new job brought him out of the toy department and into the news side of broadcasting , with a show on NBC ’s new cable - news channel , MSNBC .
The producer of the broadcast , called “ The Big Show , ” was Phil Griffin , who was delighted to be working with Olbermann again .
But in 1998 , when the news cycle was hijacked by the Monica Lewinsky scandal , Olbermann found himself the anchor of a nightly newscast called “ White House in Crisis . ”
He grew so weary of the story that getting him on the air every day became a battle .
“ Keith just did n’t want to go there , ” Griffin recalls .
“ He did n’t want to do the story , and it evolved into the hottest story of the time .
It made my life miserable .
It was bad .
And it did not end pretty . ”
Once again , Olbermann left a job unhappily , returning to sportscasting at Fox Sports .
He was subsequently fired , and the remainder of his contract was paid off .
( “ I fired him , ” Rupert Murdoch said recently .
“ He ’s crazy . ” )
But Phil Griffin continued to admire Olbermann ’s on - air talents , and helped to bring him back to MSNBC in 2003 , to do a new show called “ Countdown . ”
Shortly afterward , Griffin ran into an old colleague at CNN , who told him that that network had considered hiring Olbermann , but focus - group tests showed that audiences did n’t like him .
“ I can honestly tell you it shook me up a little bit , ” Griffin recalls .
“ But we knew what we were getting . ”
He added , “ I ’ve known Keith for twenty - seven years .
CNN .
First day he was in TV , I knew right away that Keith had something that I ’d never seen .
He was made for this .
I mean , the guy is crazy , but he is made for this . ”
Olbermann chose his office , a corner office on the fourth floor of NBC ’s Rockefeller Plaza headquarters , for its view .
From his desk , he can look out the window and see , directly across Sixth Avenue , the studios of Fox News , the broadcast home of his rival Bill O’Reilly .
“ Sometimes I imagine that I hear a howl coming from there , ” Olbermann told me during a visit one afternoon .
“ I have been accused of having an obsession with him .
I am a minor - leaguer compared to his obsession with me . ”
The Olbermann - O’Reilly feud , which is wholly Olbermann ’s creation , began with a wisecrack in 2003 , the first year of “ Countdown . ”
It evolved after Olbermann instituted a farcical segment called “ The Worst Person in the World , ” in which O’Reilly , depicted as a pompous buffoon , was regularly cited .
O’Reilly , the biggest draw of the highest - rated cable - news network , could only lose by engaging with Olbermann , but he could not resist .
Refusing to mention Olbermann by name , he sponsored a petition drive to have him replaced , and eventually began to aim on - air broadsides against NBC ’s parent company , General Electric , and its chairman , Jeffrey Immelt .
“ If my child were killed in Iraq , I would blame the likes of Jeffrey Immelt , ” O’Reilly asserted in April , citing G.E. ’s business relationship with Iran .
( The company began phasing out its contracts there in 2005 . )
This only encouraged Olbermann , who subjected Bill - O ( as Olbermann calls him ) to near - daily barrages of acid caricature .
Instead of using video clips of O’Reilly for his routines , Olbermann began voicing O’Reilly ’s words himself , in a demonic mimicry of the Ted Baxter character on “ The Mary Tyler Moore Show . ”
When “ Countdown ” was still new , in 2004 , Rick Kaplan , then the president of MSNBC , told Olbermann that he wanted the program to be the cable network ’s “ newscast of record . ”
Largely owing to the license that Olbermann took in his on - air duelling with O’Reilly , it has become more like a nightly political insult - comedy routine .
Olbermann ’s Fox - bashing struck a chord with a core audience deeply sympathetic to the view that the conservative - leaning Fox News ( “ Fox Noise , ” Olbermann calls it ) has degraded journalism “ in the same sense that George Bush lowered and made even more disreputable the Presidency of the United States . ”
“ Bill O’Reilly made Keith Olbermann , ” Phil Griffin says .
Olbermann concurs , saying , “ I really do owe him a percentage of my salary . ”
The O’Reilly feud was the gateway to Olbermann ’s emergence as a political polemicist .
It was a short leap from denigrating Bill - O to Olbermann ’s first “ Special Comment , ” aimed at then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , in August , 2006 .
While waiting out a flight delay in Los Angeles , Olbermann read the highlights of a speech that Rumsfeld had just delivered to the American Legion , in which he charged that some critics of the Administration ’s war plan suffered “ moral or intellectual confusion about what is right or wrong . ”
Downing “ a couple of screwdrivers , ” Olbermann says , he wrote a rebuke of the Defense Secretary , which he read on the air the next day .
“ The man who sees absolutes where all other men see nuances and shades of meaning is either a prophet or a quack , ” he began .
“ Donald H. Rumsfeld is not a prophet . ”
Olbermann went on to lecture Rumsfeld about the workings of a democracy and the nature of fascism , and concluded by quoting from Edward R. Murrow ’s 1954 denunciation of Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism .
He says that he did n’t know how the commentary would play , with the NBC brass or with the audience .
“ I really did think , Well , if this is the end of my career , I will have gone down for a good cause . ”
His bosses loved it .
“ I think we ’re onto something , ” the president of NBC News , Steve Capus , told me .
“ That ’s what we keep hearing from the audience , more and more , is that they appreciate that we have people who are actually speaking truth to power , or being transparent in their own personal viewpoints . ”
That ’s another way of saying that liberals , after many failed attempts , seem finally to have found their own Bill O’Reilly .
Fox News still dominates the cable competition , and MSNBC over all continues to lag behind second - place CNN .
O’Reilly ’s audience is more than twice as big as Olbermann ’s , which airs in the same prime - time period .
But Olbermann ’s ratings grew by nearly seventy - five per cent the year he began doing Special Comments , and the show is making money , a rare hit in MSNBC ’s twelve - year run .
“ All of a sudden , he took off , ” Griffin says .
“ In ways that MSNBC never had a show take off . ”
Olbermann ’s success , like O’Reilly ’s , is evidence of viewer cocooning — the inclination to seek out programming that reinforces one ’s own firmly held political views .
“ People want to identify , ” Griffin says .
“ They want the shortcut .
‘ Wow , that guy ’s smart .
I get him . ’
In this crazy world of so much information , you look for places where you identify , or you see where you fit into the spectrum , because you get all this information all day long . ”
Capus and Griffin insist that Olbermann ’s broadcast is like an opinion section in a newspaper , suitable to what they call MSNBC ’s “ cable sensibility . ”
Olbermann differs .
He begins each “ Countdown ” with the Beethoven theme from NBC ’s “ Huntley - Brinkley Report , ” and concludes with Murrow ’s signature sign - off , “ Good night , and good luck . ”
He maintains that “ Countdown ” is very much part of that continuum .
“ It is a newscast with commentary and analysis , the way most really good newscasts used to be , ” he says .
“ Dosages of the various components vary in a greater degree than we ’re used to , or maybe were even done in the heyday of this kind of thing .
But if you listen to those daily Murrow newscasts in the forties on the radio , Murrow would do the news , two and a half , three minutes , take a break , and then do a two - or three - minute commentary . ”
It could be argued that Murrow ’s work in wartime London — he would report on the Battle of Britain , and also advocate against continued American neutrality in the war — is hardly the same thing as telling the President to “ shut the hell up , ’’ or posing the question regarding Bush ( as Olbermann did ) : “ Pathological Presidential Liar or an Idiot - in - Chief ? ”
But Olbermann contends that the labored pretense of neutrality in the news business is a fruitless exercise .
“ There are people who , with absolute conviction , believe that Brian Williams is a Communist , ” he said .
“ There are people who , with absolute conviction , believe that Katie Couric is in the pay of the Pentagon .
There are people who are absolutely certain that Charlie Gibson sleeps with Hillary Clinton , based on the last debate .
This is an old schoolyard thing I learned from being repeatedly beat up in the fourth grade .
It finally dawned on me one day — they are going to keep beating me up whether I respond to them or not . ”
Olbermann continued , “ Brian sometimes looks like his collar button is going to burst from the restraint that he has .
I know the pain that he goes through ; he measures each word like an apothecary — and they beat him up , too .
The point is , why not ?
Why not add something to the discourse ? ”
Wait .
A man was sentenced to 66 months in prison , most of which he ’s already served and then when he gets out he stays in forever ?
Right .
The White House - chosen military panel – not a jury – at Camp Justice at occupied Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , issued a split decision Wednesday in the case of the notorious driver of Osama bin Laden , Salim Hamdan .
The panel acquitted him on the original conspiracy charges , but convicted him of material support for terrorism .
It was the first “ trial ” under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 .
Today , on the panel ’s recommendation , the “ judge ” in the case sentenced Hamdan to a mere 66 months , minus the time he ’s already spent in detention .
Though the “ prosecutors ” had asked for 30 years to life , it would seem he would be free to go after about 5 months , according to McClatchy Newspapers who ’ve apparently counted .
But as announced by the military on Tuesday , even if Hamdan had been acquitted , they would still hold him as an enemy combatant for the rest of his life anyway – as they will after he ’s served his 5 months .
Hail Caesar !
How would you like to carry around your entire DVD collection on a single disk ?
That is the promise of a new holo­graphic digital storage technology being developed by General Electric and coming to a computer near you around 2012 .
Although not the first commercial holographic storage system — that honor goes to InPhase Technologies ’
Tapestry ™ 300r holographic drive — GE ’s system could be the first one aimed at consumers .
( In Phase ’s holographic drives , which debuted last year , sell for $ 18,000 and target broadcasters who need to archive television programs . )
Holographic media can store huge amounts of data because information is encoded in layers throughout the entire disk , not just on a single reflective surface as in today ’s optical media .
In GE ’s system , a single CD - size disk made of plastic will be able to store about 1 terabyte of data , equivalent to 110 typical movie DVDs .
This kind of capacity would make it possible to back up all your music , photos , home movies , and e-mails in one place ; it would also allow for totally new , extremely data - intensive applications , such as Micro­soft ’s MyLifeBits project , which aims to capture in digital form every­thing that happens in an individual ’s life .
Besides automatically archiving and indexing things like e-mails and text documents , the project includes a wearable camera that snaps a picture at least once every 30 seconds , creating a visual index of every day .

How it works
To store data holographically , a laser beam ( 1 ) is split in two ( 2 ) .
One half of the beam passes through an array of hundreds of thousands of gates ( 3 ) .
Each gate can be opened or closed to represent a binary 1 or 0 .
The gates either block or pass the beam , filtering it into a coded pattern , or signal .
The other half of the beam , known as the reference beam , is bounced off a mirror ( 4 ) , so that the reference beam and the signal beam encoded with digital information intersect somewhere within the plastic storage medium ( 5 ) .
Light waves from the two beams interfere with each other , imprinting into the plastic a hologram — a three - dimensional pattern .
By varying the angle of the mirror , millions of holograms can be created in the same piece of plastic .
To read data from storage , the reference beam alone is used to illuminate the hologram .
The resulting image can be read by a sensor and converted back into 1s and 0s .

Kucinich investigates Yankee Stadium perks for NYC officials Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 7 , 2008
Print This Email This Rep. Dennis Kucinich is opening an investigation into perks for New York City officials being offered as part of a deal to build a new stadium for the New York Yankees .
Kucinich ( D - OH ) chairs a House Oversight subcommittee , and he has made similar inquiries regarding the New York Mets stadium , which offers similar perks for city officials .
In its investigation of the deal between the Yankees and New York City for land on which the new stadium is to be built , Kucinich 's Domestic Policy Subcommittee found that the lease allows city officials free use of a luxury box in the new stadium and priority rights to purchase up to 180 tickets per game .
A letter Kucinich sent to the Yankees Thursday requests details on the perks .
The subcommittee 's investigations , which have been ongoing for more than a month , are examining whether the IRS can change its regulations and allow stadium projects such as the new Yankee Stadium to receive public - backed financing that comes with tax breaks .
The Yankees are seeking an extra $ 350 million in public funds to build the new stadium .
The team wants additional public support from the city 's industrial development agency to be added to the $ 941 million in tax - exempt public bonds the organization already has issued for the $ 1.3 billion stadium .
The stadium has been under construction since 2006 and is set to open next year .
With wire reports Kucinich 's letter is reprinted below : August 7 , 2008 Mr. Randy Levine President New York Yankees Yankee Stadium New York , New York 10451 Dear Mr. Levine : The Domestic Policy Subcommittee of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has held two hearings [ 1 ] and issued a number of requests concerning the public financing of professional sports stadiums .
[ 2 ]
In conjunction with our specific investigation into the financing of the new Yankee Stadium , the Subcommittee has learned that pursuant to the lease agreement between the Yankees and the New York City Industrial Development Agency ( NYCIDA ) , the City of New York , as assignee of the NYCIDA , is , among other rights , granted : ( 1 ) the right to use a luxury box for Yankee games in the new Yankee Stadium free of charge ; and ( 2 ) priority rights for the purchase of up to 180 tickets for each Yankee home game . [ 3 ]
I hereby request the following documents : ( 1 ) All documents relating to the lease provision , section 4.04 , or any other agreement , draft or final , granting the NYCIDA or the City of New York any right to use or purchase any luxury boxes or tickets for any event at the new Yankee Stadium , including without limitation all documents relating to the origination of the concept , negotiation , execution , interpretation , and economic value of any such provision or agreement .
The Oversight and Government Reform Committee is the principal oversight committee in the House of Representatives and has broad oversight jurisdiction as set forth in House Rule X .
An attachment to this letter provides information on how to respond to the Subcommittees request .
I request that you provide these documents as soon as possible , but in no case later than 5:00 p.m. on Monday , August 18 , 2008 .
Sincerely , Dennis J. Kucinich Chairman Domestic Policy Subcommittee

The wonder of evolution is that it works at all .
I mean that literally :
If you want to marvel at evolution , that 's what 's marvel - worthy .
How does optimization first arise in the universe ?
If an intelligent agent designed Nature , who designed the intelligent agent ?
Where is the first design that has no designer ?
The puzzle is not how the first stage of the bootstrap can be super - clever and super - efficient ; the puzzle is how it can happen at all .
Evolution resolves the infinite regression , not by being super - clever and super - efficient , but by being stupid and inefficient and working anyway .
This is the marvel .
For professional reasons , I often have to discuss the slowness , randomness , and blindness of evolution .
Afterward someone says : " You just said that evolution can't plan simultaneous changes , and that evolution is very inefficient because mutations are random .
Is n't that what the creationists say ?
That you could n't assemble a watch by randomly shaking the parts in a box ? "
But the reply to creationists is not that you can assemble a watch by shaking the parts in a box .
The reply is that this is not how evolution works .
If you think that evolution does work by whirlwinds assembling 747s , then the creationists have successfully misrepresented biology to you ; they 've sold the strawman .
The real answer is that complex machinery evolves either incrementally , or by adapting previous complex machinery used for a new purpose .
Squirrels jump from treetop to treetop using just their muscles , but the length they can jump depends to some extent on the aerodynamics of their bodies .
So now there are flying squirrels , so aerodynamic they can glide short distances .
If birds were wiped out , the descendants of flying squirrels might reoccupy that ecological niche in ten million years , gliding membranes transformed into wings .
And the creationists would say , " What good is half a wing ?
You 'd just fall down and splat .
How could squirrelbirds possibly have evolved incrementally ? "
That 's how one complex adaptation can jump - start a new complex adaptation .
Complexity can also accrete incrementally , starting from a single mutation .
First comes some gene A which is simple , but at least a little useful on its own , so that A increases to universality in the gene pool .
Now along comes gene B , which is only useful in the presence of A , but A is reliably present in the gene pool , so there 's a reliable selection pressure in favor of B .
Now a modified version of A* arises , which depends on B , but does n't break B's dependency on A / A* .
Then along comes C , which depends on A * and B , and B* , which depends on A * and C .
Soon you 've got " irreducibly complex " machinery that breaks if you take out any single piece .
And yet you can still visualize the trail backward to that single piece : you can , without breaking the whole machine , make one piece less dependent on another piece , and do this a few times , until you can take out one whole piece without breaking the machine , and so on until you 've turned a ticking watch back into a crude sundial .
Here 's an example : DNA stores information very nicely , in a durable format that allows for exact duplication .
A ribosome turns that stored information into a sequence of amino acids , a protein , which folds up into a variety of chemically active shapes .
The combined system , DNA and ribosome , can build all sorts of protein machinery .
But what good is DNA , without a ribosome that turns DNA information into proteins ?
What good is a ribosome , without DNA to tell it which proteins to make ?
Organisms do n't always leave fossils , and evolutionary biology can't always figure out the incremental pathway .
But in this case we do know how it happened .
RNA shares with DNA the property of being able to carry information and replicate itself , although RNA is less durable and copies less accurately .
And RNA also shares the ability of proteins to fold up into chemically active shapes , though it 's not as versatile as the amino acid chains of proteins .
Almost certainly , RNA is the single A which predates the mutually dependent A* and B .
It 's just as important to note that RNA does the combined job of DNA and proteins poorly , as that it does the combined job at all .
It 's amazing enough that a single molecule can both store information and manipulate chemistry .
For it to do the job well would be a wholly unnecessary miracle .
What was the very first replicator ever to exist ?
It may well have been an RNA strand , because by some strange coincidence , the chemical ingredients of RNA are chemicals that would have arisen naturally on the prebiotic Earth of 4 billion years ago .
Please note : evolution does not explain the origin of life ; evolutionary biology is not supposed to explain the first replicator , because the first replicator does not come from another replicator .
Evolution describes statistical trends in replication .
The first replicator was n't a statistical trend , it was a pure accident .
The notion that evolution should explain the origin of life is a pure strawman — more creationist misrepresentation .
If you 'd been watching the primordial soup on the day of the first replicator , the day that reshaped the Earth , you would not have been impressed by how well the first replicator replicated .
The first replicator probably copied itself like a drunken monkey on LSD .
It would have exhibited none of the signs of careful fine - tuning embodied in modern replicators , because the first replicator was an accident .
It was not needful for that single strand of RNA , or chemical hypercycle , or pattern in clay , to replicate gracefully .
It just had to happen at all .
Even so , it was probably very improbable , considered in an isolated event — but it only had to happen once , and there were a lot of tide pools .
A few billions of years later , the replicators are walking on the moon .
The first accidental replicator was the most important molecule in the history of time .
But if you praised it too highly , attributing to it all sorts of wonderful replication - aiding capabilities , you would be missing the whole point .
Do n't think that , in the political battle between evolutionists and creationists , whoever praises evolution must be on the side of science .
Science has a very exact idea of the capabilities of evolution .
If you praise evolution one millimeter higher than this , you 're not " fighting on evolution 's side " against creationism .
You 're being scientifically inaccurate , full stop .
You 're falling into a creationist trap by insisting that , yes , a whirlwind does have the power to assemble a 747 !
Is n't that amazing !
How wonderfully intelligent is evolution , how praiseworthy !
Look at me , I 'm pledging my allegiance to science !
The more nice things I say about evolution , the more I must be on evolution 's side against the creationists !
But to praise evolution too highly destroys the real wonder , which is not how well evolution designs things , but that a naturally occurring process manages to design anything at all .
So let us dispose of the idea that evolution is a wonderful designer , or a wonderful conductor of species destinies , which we human beings ought to imitate .
For human intelligence to imitate evolution as a designer , would be like a sophisticated modern bacterium trying to imitate the first replicator as a biochemist .
As T. H. Huxley , " Darwin 's Bulldog " , put it :
Let us understand , once and for all , that the ethical progress of society depends , not on imitating the cosmic process , still less in running away from it , but in combating it .
Huxley did n't say that because he disbelieved in evolution , but because he understood it all too well .
WHAT WENT WRONG by SEYMOUR M. HERSH The C.I.A. and the failure of American intelligence .
Issue of 2001 - 10-08
Posted 2001 - 10-01
After more than two weeks of around - the - clock investigation into the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , the American intelligence community remains confused , divided , and unsure about how the terrorists operated , how many there were , and what they might do next .
It was that lack of solid information , government officials told me , that was the key factor behind the Bush Administration 's decision last week not to issue a promised white paper listing the evidence linking Osama bin Laden 's organization to the attacks .
There is consensus within the government on two issues : the terrorist attacks were brilliantly planned and executed , and the intelligence community was in no way prepared to stop them .
One bureaucratic victim , the officials said , may be George Tenet , the director of the Central Intelligence Agency , whose resignation is considered a necessity by many in the Administration .
" The system is after Tenet , " one senior officer told me .
" It wants to get rid of him . "
The investigators are now split into at least two factions .
One , centered in the F.B.I. , believes that the terrorists may not have been " a cohesive group , " as one involved official put it , before they started training and working together on this operation .
" These guys look like a pickup basketball team , " he said .
" A bunch of guys who got together . "
The F.B.I. is still trying to sort out the identities and backgrounds of the hijackers .
The fact is , the official acknowledged , " we do n't know much about them . "
These investigators suspect that the suicide teams were simply lucky .
" In your wildest dreams , do you think they thought they'd be able to pull off four hijackings ? " the official asked .
" Just taking out one jet and getting it into the ground would have been a success .
These are not supermen . "
He explained that the most important advantage the hijackers had , aside from the element of surprise , was history : in the past , most hijackings had ended up safely on the ground at a Third World airport , so pilots had been trained to coöperate .
Another view , centered in the Pentagon and the C.I.A. , credits the hijackers with years of advance planning and practice , and a deliberate after - the - fact disinformation campaign .
" These guys were below everybody 's radar — they 're professionals , " an official said .
" There 's no more than five or six in a cell .
Three men will know the plan ; three wo n't know .
They 've been ' sleeping ' out there for years and years . "
One military planner told me that many of his colleagues believe that the terrorists " went to ground and pulled phone lines " well before September 11th — that is , concealed traces of their activities .
It is widely believed that the terrorists had a support team , and the fact that the F.B.I. has been unable to track down fellow - conspirators who were left behind in the United States is seen as further evidence of careful planning .
" Look , " one person familiar with the investigation said .
" If it were as simple and straightforward as a lucky one - off oddball operation , then the seeds of confusion would not have been sown as they were . "
Many of the investigators believe that some of the initial clues that were uncovered about the terrorists ' identities and preparations , such as flight manuals , were meant to be found .
A former high - level intelligence official told me , " Whatever trail was left was left deliberately — for the F.B.I. to chase . "
In interviews over the past two weeks , a number of intelligence officials have raised questions about Osama bin Laden 's capabilities .
" This guy sits in a cave in Afghanistan and he 's running this operation ? " one C.I.A. official asked .
" It 's so huge .
He could n't have done it alone . "
A senior military officer told me that because of the visas and other documentation needed to infiltrate team members into the United States a major foreign intelligence service might also have been involved .
" To get somebody to fly an airplane — to kill himself , " the official added , further suggests that " somebody paid his family a hell of a lot of money . "
" These people are not necessarily all from bin Laden , " a Justice Department official told me .
" We 're still running a lot of stuff out , " he said , adding that the F.B.I. has been inundated with leads .
On September 23rd , Secretary of State Colin Powell told a television interviewer that " we will put before the world , the American people , a persuasive case " showing that bin Laden was responsible for the attacks .
But the widely anticipated white paper could not be published , the Justice Department official said , for lack of hard facts .
" There was not enough to make a sale . "
The Administration justified the delay by telling the press that most of the information was classified and could not yet be released .
Last week , however , a senior C.I.A. official confirmed that the intelligence community had not yet developed a significant amount of solid information about the terrorists ' operations , financing , and planning .
" One day , we 'll know , but at the moment we do n't know , " the official said .
" To me , " he added , " the scariest thing is that these guys " — the terrorists — " got the first one free .
They knew that the standard operating procedure in an aircraft hijacking was to play for time .
And they knew for sure that after this the security on airplanes was going to go way up .
So whatever they 've planned for the next round they had in place already . "
The concern about a second attack was repeated by others involved in the investigation .
Some in the F.B.I. now suspect that the terrorists are following a war plan devised by the convicted conspirator Ramzi Ahmed Yousef , who is believed to have been the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
Yousef was involved in plans that called for , among other things , the releasing of poisons in the air and the bombing of the tunnels between New York City and New Jersey .
The government 's concern about the potential threat from hazardous - waste haulers was heightened by the Yousef case .
" Do they go chem / bio in one , two , or three years ? " one senior general asked rhetorically .
" We must now make a difficult transition from reliance on law enforcement to the preëmptive .
That part is hard .
Can we recruit enough good people ? "
In recent years , he said , " we 've been hiring kids out of college who are computer geeks . "
He continued , " This is about going back to deep , hard dirty work , with tough people going down dark alleys with good instincts . "
Today's C.I.A. is not up to the job .
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union , in 1991 , the C.I.A. has become increasingly bureaucratic and unwilling to take risks , and has promoted officers who shared such values .
( " The consciousness of kind , " one former officer says . )
It has steadily reduced its reliance on overseas human intelligence and cut the number of case officers abroad — members of the clandestine service , now known formally as the Directorate of Operations , or D.O. , whose mission is to recruit spies .
( It used to be called the " dirty tricks " department . )
Instead , the agency has relied on liaison relationships — reports from friendly intelligence services and police departments around the world — and on technical collection systems .
It wo n't be easy to put agents back in the field .
During the Cold War , the agency 's most important mission was to recruit spies from within the Soviet Union 's military and its diplomatic corps .
C.I.A. agents were assigned as diplomatic or cultural officers at American embassies in major cities , and much of their work could be done at diplomatic functions and other social events .
For an agent with such cover , the consequence of being exposed was usually nothing more than expulsion from the host country and temporary reassignment to a desk in Washington .
Today , in Afghanistan , or anywhere in the Middle East or South Asia , a C.I.A. operative would have to speak the local language and be able to blend in .
The operative should seemingly have nothing to do with any Americans , or with the American embassy , if there is one .
The status is known inside the agency as " nonofficial cover , " or NOC .
Exposure could mean death .
It 's possible that there is n't a single such officer operating today inside Islamic - fundamentalist circles .
In an essay published last summer in The Atlantic Monthly , Reuel Marc Gerecht , who served for nearly a decade as a case officer in the C.I.A.'s Near East Division , quoted one C.I.A. man as saying , " For Christ 's sake , most case officers live in the suburbs of Virginia .
We do n't do that kind of thing . "
Another officer told Gerecht , " Operations that include diarrhea as a way of life do n't happen . "
At the same time , the D.O. has been badly hurt by a series of resignations and retirements among high - level people , including four men whose names are little known to the public but who were widely respected throughout the agency : Douglas Smith , who spent thirty - one years in the clandestine service ; William Lofgren , who at his retirement , in 1996 , was chief of the Central Eurasia Division ; David Manners , who was chief of station in Amman , Jordan , when he left the agency , in 1998 ; and Robert Baer , an Arabic speaker who was considered perhaps the best on - the - ground field officer in the Middle East .
All left with feelings of bitterness over the agency 's procedures for running clandestine operations .
" We 'll never solve the terrorism issue until we reconstitute the D.O. , " a former senior clandestine officer told me .
" The first line of defense , and the most crucial line of defense , is human intelligence . "
Baer , who was awarded a Career Intelligence Medal after his resignation , in late 1997 , said , " You would n't believe how bad it is .
What saved the White House on Flight 93 " — the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania — " was a bunch of rugby players .
Is that what you 're paying thirty billion dollars for ? "
He was referring to the federal budget for intelligence .
He and his colleagues are n't surprised that the F.B.I. had no warning of the attack .
" The bureau is wonderful in solving crimes after they 're committed , " one C.I.A. man said .
" But it 's not good at penetration .
We 've got to do it . "
Today , the C.I.A. does n't have enough qualified case officers to man its many stations and bases around the world .
Two retired agents have been brought back on a rotating basis to take temporary charge of the small base in Karachi , Pakistan , a focal point for terrorist activity .
( Karachi was the site of the murder , in 1995 , of two Americans , one of them a C.I.A. employee , allegedly in retaliation for the arrest in Pakistan of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef . )
A retired agent also runs the larger C.I.A. station in Dacca , Bangladesh , a Muslim nation that could be a source of recruits .
Other retirees run C.I.A. stations in Africa .
One hard question is what lengths the C.I.A. should go to .
In an interview , two former operations officers cited the tactics used in the late nineteen - eighties by the Jordanian security service , in its successful effort to bring down Abu Nidal , the Palestinian who led what was at the time " the most dangerous terrorist organization in existence , " according to the State Department .
Abu Nidal 's group was best known for its role in two bloody gun and grenade attacks on check - in desks for El Al , the Israeli airline , at the Rome and Vienna airports in December , 1985 .
At his peak , Abu Nidal threatened the life of King Hussein of Jordan — whom he called " the pygmy king " — and the King responded , according to the former intelligence officers , by telling his state security service , " Go get them . "
The Jordanians did not move directly against suspected Abu Nidal followers but seized close family members instead — mothers and brothers .
The Abu Nidal suspect would be approached , given a telephone , and told to call his mother , who would say , according to one C.I.A. man , " Son , they 'll take care of me if you do n't do what they ask . "
( To his knowledge , the official carefully added , all the suspects agreed to talk before any family members were actually harmed . )
By the early nineteen - nineties , the group was crippled by internal dissent and was no longer a significant terrorist organization .
( Abu Nidal , now in his sixties and in poor health , is believed to be living quietly in Egypt . )
" Jordan is the one nation that totally succeeded in penetrating a group , " the official added .
" You have to get their families under control . "
Such tactics defy the American rule of law , of course , and the C.I.A.'s procedures , but , when it comes to Osama bin Laden and his accomplices , the official insisted , there is no alternative .
" We need to do this — knock them down one by one , " he said .
" Are we serious about getting rid of the problem — instead of sitting around making diversity quilts ? "
A few days after the attacks , Vice - President Dick Cheney defended the C.I.A.'s director , George Tenet , on television , saying that it would be a " tragedy " to look for " scapegoats . "
President Bush subsequently added a note of support with a visit to C.I.A. headquarters .
In an interview last week , one top C.I.A. official also defended Tenet .
" We know there 's a lot of Monday - morning quarterbacking going on , but people do n't understand the conditions that George inherited , " he told me .
" You can't penetrate a six - man cell when they 're brothers and cousins — no matter how much Urdu you know . "
The official acknowledged that there was much dissatisfaction with the C.I.A.'s performance , but he said , " George has not gotten any word other than that the President has full confidence in him . "
He went on , " George would n't resign in a situation like this . "
I was informed by other officials , however , that Tenet 's days are numbered .
" They 've told him he 's on his way out , " one official said .
" He 's trying to figure it out — whether to go gracefully or let it appear as if he 's going to be fired . "
A White House adviser explained Cheney 's public endorsement of Tenet by saying , " In Washington , your friends always stab you in the chest .
Somebody has to take the blame for this . "
It was his understanding , he added , that " after a decent interval — whenever they get some traction on the problem — he will depart .
I 've heard three to six months . "
Even one of Tenet 's close friends told me , " He 's history . "
Tenet 's standing was further undermined , after September 11th , by what proved to have been a series of wildly optimistic claims about the effectiveness of the C.I.A.'s Counter Terrorism Center , which was set up in 1986 after a wave of international bombings , airplane hijackings , and kidnappings .
The idea was to bring together experts from every American police agency , including the Secret Service , into a " fusion center , " which would coördinate intelligence data on terrorism .
In October , 1998 , after four men linked to bin Laden were indicted for their role in the bombings at the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya , reporters for Newsweek were given a tour of the center .
The indictments , Newsweek reported , " were intended as a clear message to bin Laden and his fugitive followers : the United States knows who they are and where to find them .
. . .
The story of how the C.I.A. and F.B.I. , once bitter bureaucratic rivals , collaborated to roll up bin Laden 's elusive network is a tale of state - of - the - art sleuthing — and just plain luck . "
But in fact the C.T.C. was not authorized to recruit or handle agents overseas — that task was left to the D.O. and its stations in the Middle East , which had their own priorities .
The C.T.C. was bolstered with more money and more manpower after the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 , but it remained a paper - shuffling unit whose officers were not required to be proficient in foreign languages .
Many of the C.I.A.'s old hands have told me that the C.T.C. , despite its high profile , was not an assignment of choice for a young and ambitious D.O. officer .
The C.T.C. and two of the other major intelligence centers — dealing with narcotics and nuclear - nonproliferation issues — are so consumed by internecine warfare that the professional analysts find it difficult to do their jobs .
" They 're all fighting among each other , " said one senior manager who took early retirement and whose last assignment was as the director of one of the centers .
" There 's no concentration on issues . "
In 1986 , Robert Baer , freshly arrived as a case officer from Khartoum , was drafted into the Counter Terrorism Center , a few months after it was set up , by its director , Duane ( Dewey ) Clarridge .
A draft of a memoir Baer wrote , which will be published by Crown this fall , depicts what happened next :
The first few months was about as exhilarating as it can get in the spy business .
Dewey had authority to pretty much do anything he wanted against the terrorists .
He had all the money he wanted .
. . .
It was n't long , though , before the politics of intelligence undermined everything Dewey tried to do .
. . .
It was too risky .
A botched — or even a successful — operation would piss off a friendly foreign government .
Someone would be thrown out of his cushy post .
Someone could even get killed .
. . .
You 'd ask [ the C.I.A. station in ]
Bonn to recruit a few Arabs and Iranians to track the Middle East émigré community in West Germany , and it would respond that it did n't have enough officers .
You 'd ask Beirut to meet a certain agent traveling to Lebanon , and it would refuse because of some security problem .
It was nothing but bureaucratic foot - dragging , but it effectively hamstrung anything Dewey tried to do .
After six months ,
Dewey could put his hands on only two Arabic speakers — another officer and me .
Many people in the intelligence community , in their conversations with me , complained bitterly about how difficult it was to work with the Directorate of Operations , even during a crisis .
" In order to work on a problem with D.O. , " a former senior scientist told me , " you have to be in D.O. "
Similarly , a congressional observer of the C.I.A. came to understand the bureaucratic power of the D.O. " To succeed as director of Central Intelligence , " he said , " you have to ingratiate yourself with the D.O. "
Other intelligence sources have told me that the D.O. 's machinations led , at one point , to a feud with the National Security Agency over who would control the Special Collection Service , a joint undertaking of the two agencies that deploys teams of electronics specialists around the world to monitor diplomatic and other communications in moments of crisis .
The S.C.S. 's highly secret operations , which produced some of the Cold War 's most valuable data , are usually run from secure sites inside American embassies .
Competence and sophistication were hindered by an absurd amount of bickering .
A military man who in 1998 was involved in a Middle East signals - intelligence operation told me that he was not able to discuss the activity with representatives of the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. at the same time .
" I used to meet with one in a safe house in Virginia , break for lunch , and then meet with the other , " the officer said .
" They would n't be in the same room . "
If the current crisis does lead to an overhaul of the agency , the Senate and House intelligence committees are not likely to be of much help .
Lofgren , Smith , Manners , and Baer , among others , repeatedly met with legislators and their staffs and testified before Congress in an effort to bring about changes .
But nothing was done .
Not surprisingly , Republicans and Democrats have differing explanations for what went wrong .
One Republican staff member said that Senator Richard C. Shelby , of Alabama , who was the committee 's chairman until early this year , understood that the problem was at the top of the agency .
" We do have guys in the field with great ideas who are not supported by the establishment , " the staff member said .
But none of the senior Democrats , he said , wanted to embarrass the director , George Tenet , by holding an inquiry or hearings into the various complaints .
( Tenet had spent years working for the Democrats on the committee staff , and had served as a member of Bill Clinton 's National Security Council staff before joining the C.I.A.'s management team . )
One Democrat , however , blamed the process within the Senate committee , which , he said , neglected terrorism in favor of more politically charged issues .
" Tenet 's been briefing about bin Laden for years , but we were n't organized to consider what are threats to the United States .
We 're chasing whatever the hell is in the news at the moment . "
Former Senator Bob Kerrey , of Nebraska , who served for four years as the Intelligence Committee 's ranking Democrat and is now the president of the New School , in New York , is one of Tenet 's defenders .
But Kerrey also acknowledges that he no longer knows " how well we did our job " of legislative oversight .
" Nobody with any responsibility can walk away from this .
We missed something here . "
Kerrey remains angry about the U.S. policy toward Afghanistan in the years after its defeat of the Soviet Union .
" The Cold War was over , and we shut down Afghanistan " — that is , ceased all intelligence operations .
" From Bush to Clinton , what happened is one of the most embarrassing American foreign - policy decisions , as bad as Vietnam , " Kerrey said .
He cited a botched 1996 C.I.A. plot to overthrow President Saddam Hussein of Iraq : " We also had a half - baked Iraqi operation and sent a signal that we 're not serious . "
Last June , Shelby , after a tour of the Persian Gulf and a series of intelligence briefings , told a Washington Post reporter that bin Laden was " on the run , and I think he will continue to be on the run , because we are not going to let up . "
He went on , " I do n't think you could say he 's got us hunkered down .
I believe he 's more hunkered down . "
After the bombing , however , Shelby was among the first to suggest publicly that it was time for Tenet to go .
" I think he 's a good man , and he 's done some good things , but there have been a lot of failures on his watch , " Shelby told USA Today .
Tenet , he said , lacked " the stature to control all the agencies .
In a sense , he is in charge , but in reality he 's not . "
One friend and former colleague of Tenet 's says that his refusal to urge the Senate leadership to deal with the hard issues was symptomatic of his problems as C.I.A. director .
" He 's a politician , too , " that person said of Tenet .
" That 's why he should n't have been there , because he had no status to tell the senators , ' You do n't know what you 're talking about . ' "
In his memoir , Robert Baer describes the " fatal malaise " that came over the Paris station of the C.I.A. in the early nineties : " Case officers were n't recruiting new agents .
The agents already on the books were old .
They 'd lost their access .
And no one seemed to care . "
Many in the agency were shocked in early 1992 when Milton Bearden , the head of the Soviet - East European division — he had also played a major role in the C.I.A.'s support for the Afghan rebels in their brutal war against the Soviet Union — informed his overseas stations that Russia would now be treated like any other friendly nation , such as Germany or France .
The C.I.A. was no longer in the business of recruiting agents to spy against the Russians .
In addition , C.I.A. surveillance apartments were closed and wiretaps turned off throughout the Middle East and Europe .
" We 'll never know the losses we had in terms of not capitalizing on the Soviet collapse , " a retired official said .
Former high - level Soviet officials with intelligence information or other data were rebuffed .
" Walk - ins were turned away .
It was stunning , and , as far as I knew , nobody fought it . "
Little changed when Bill Clinton took office , in 1993 .
Baer , now assigned , at his request , to the tiny C.I.A. outpost in Dushanbe , Tajikistan , near the Afghanistan border , watched helplessly as Saudi - backed Islamic fundamentalists — the precursors of the Taliban — consolidated training bases and began to recruit supporters and run operations inside the frontier nations of the former Soviet Union .
In 1995 , the agency was widely criticized after the news came out that a paid informant in Guatemala had been involved in the murders of an American innkeeper and the Guatemalan husband of an American lawyer .
The informant had been kept on the C.I.A. payroll even though his activities were known to the Directorate of Operations .
John Deutch , the C.I.A.'s third director in three years , responded to the abuses , and to the public outcry , by issuing a directive calling for prior approval from headquarters before any person with criminal or human - rights problems could be recruited .
The approval , Deutch later explained , was to be based on a simple balancing test :
" Is the potential gain in intelligence worth the cost that might be associated with doing business with a person who may be a murderer ? "
The " scrub order , " as it came to be known , was promulgated by Deutch and his colleagues with the best of intentions , and included provisions for case - by - case review .
But in practice hundreds of " assets " were indiscriminately stricken from the C.I.A.'s payroll , with a devastating effect on anti-terrorist operations in the Middle East .
The scrub order led to the creation of a series of screening panels at C.I.A. headquarters .
Before a new asset could be recruited , a C.I.A. case officer had to seek approval from a Senior Review Panel .
" It was like a cardiologist in California deciding whether a surgeon in New York City could cut a chest open , " a former officer recalled .
Potential agents were being assessed by officials who had no firsthand experience in covert operations .
( " Americans hate intelligence — just hate it , " Robert Baer recalls thinking . )
In the view of the operations officers , the most important weapons in the war against international terrorism were being evaluated by men and women who , as one of the retired officers put it , " would n't drive to a D.C. restaurant at night because they were afraid of the crime problem . "
Other bureaucratic panels began " multiplying like rabbits , one after another , " a former station chief said .
Experienced officers who were adamant about continuing to recruit spies found that obtaining approval before making a pitch had become a matter of going from committee to committee .
" In the old days , they 'd say , ' Go get them , ' " the retired officer said .
Yet another review process , known as A.V.S. — the asset - validation system — was put in place .
Another retired officer told me , " You 'd have to write so much paper that guys would spend more time in the station writing reports than out on the street . "
" It was mindless , " a third officer said .
" Look , we recruited assholes .
I handled bad guys .
But we do n't recruit people from the Little Sisters of the Poor — they do n't know anything . "
He went on , " What we 've done to ourselves is criminal .
There are a half - dozen good guys out there trying to keep it together . "
" It did make the workday a lot easier , " Robert Baer said of the edict .
" I just watched CNN .
No one cared . "
The C.I.A.'s vital South Group , made up of eight stations in central Asia — all threatened by fundamentalist organizations , especially in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan , with links to the Taliban and bin Laden — had no agents by the mid-nineteen - nineties , Baer said .
" The agency was going away . "
Unlike many senior officials at C.I.A. headquarters , Baer had lived undercover , in the nineteen - eighties , in Beirut and elsewhere in the Middle East , and he well understood the ability of terrorist organizations to cover their tracks .
He told me that when the C.I.A. started to go after the Islamic Jihad , a radical Lebanese group linked to a series of kidnappings in the Reagan years , " its people systematically went through documents all over Beirut , even destroying student records .
They had the airport wired and could pick the Americans out .
They knew whom they wanted to kidnap before he landed . "
The terrorists coped with the American ability to intercept conversations worldwide by constantly changing codes — often doing little more than changing the meanings of commonly used phrases .
" There 's a professional cadre out there , " Baer said .
Referring to the terrorists who struck on September 11th , he said , " These people are so damned good . "
It no doubt seems absurd to question the idea that deleveraging in underway .
We ’ve had three heroic central bank interventions , starting in August 2007 , to reverse seize - ups in the money markets .
The asset backed commercial paper market has been almost in run -off mode .
Leveraged buyout loans have been scarce to non-existent .
Banks have cut home equity credit lines and credit card borrowing limits .
Commercial and industrial loans have fallen .
The private mortgage securitization market is a shadow of its former self .
Yet the macro level data , at least as far as the US is concerned , tells a dramatically different , indeed troubling story ( click to enlarge ) :
The chart is admittedly a bit hard to read , but it is prepared from Fed ’s Funds Flows through the latest reporting date , which is March 31 , 2008 .
The chart comes courtesy Frank Veneroso ’s June 18 report , “ Why a Second Wave is Inevitable . ” ( no online version , but if you ask nicely , I can e-mail you a pdf ) .
The line is Total Credit Market Debt / GDP .
As you can clearly see , the steepness of the vertical ascent of the has not eased in the last year or two .
If anything , it may have gotten worse .
We will return to discuss the implications of how big the debt level is , but the graph itself should serve to focus the mind .
The March 31 level was 350 % of GDP .
The previous peak occurred in 1933 , during the Great Depression , at just under 270 % of GDP .
Note that the peak was reached due to the start of the rapid fall in GDP taking hold faster than debts were written off , a dynamic not in operation now .
So the comparable level to our situation is in fact lower than the 270 % peak .
An additional bit of cheery news comes from reader Bjomar : Japan ’s total debt to GDP in 1990 was roughly 250 % ( it took some triangulating among this , this , and this source , his interpolation of corporate debt at 100 - 140 % of GDP , household at 65 % , and government at 60 % ) .
And unlike us , Japan had a very high saving rate , so its net debt would have been less alarming .
On my recent quick turnaround trip to the West Coast , I had the opportunity to read all sorts of interesting research various readers had sent me that I simply could not get to previously .
All of it was useful , but the Veneroso discussion , and particularly his chart , seemed the most unrecognized , underappreciated element of the credit crunch .
Now the story in the first paragraph is not inaccurate .
Private sector credit growth has slowed , in fact pretty dramatically in the first quarter .
But “ slowing growth ” and “ deleveraging ” are two different conditions .
Alejandro Neut at Banco Bilbao provides a good overview of the Fed ’s funds flow data for the first quarter of 2008 :
Credit continued to decelerate in the first quarter of 2008 .
Total debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.5 % ( 1 pp lower than in the previous quarter and the lowest rate since 2001 ) .
Even when the reduction in debt growth was not as pronounced as the one in 2007Q4 , when debt eased from 9.1 % to 7.5 % , the decelerating trend shows no signs of abating .
This bleak assertion is based in the yet strong deceleration of households ’ debt , segment which remains the main driver of the current downtrend ( households ’ debt grew a meager 3.5 % compared with the previously seasonally annualized growth of 6.1 % in the previous quarter ) .
Debt in almost all sectors grew at a lower pace than anytime during 2007 .
The only exception was the federal government ’s debt , which grew at an impressive annualized rate of 9.5 % .
Business debt continued to expand at a healthy pace Business ’s debt grew 10.8 % yoy .
With interest payments at historical lows ( relative to profits ) debt growth in corporate America was robust .
This explains why businesses have been shifting the means to finance itself , from bond issuance to bank loans .
But risks are growing : the financial gap remains at a high level , indicating the need for external financing in order to keep current operations .
Note that even though the tone of the report is downbeat , credit is still growing , but at a slowing pace .
While certain individuals and institutions might be reducing their borrowings , on an overall level , private debt is still increasing .
And , of course , the other reason that we have n’t seen deleveraging is that our friendly foreign funding sources have kept the credit spigots open and government debt has grown at a an accelerating pace , thanks in part to Iraq , but to a bigger degree due to various interventions .
Tim Duy earlier focused on the role of foreign assistance in keeping a financial crisis from ( yet ) hitting the real economy to the same degree :
Perhaps most importantly , however , is the massive liquidity injections from the rest of the world , or what Brad Setser calls “ the quiet bailout . ”
In the first half of this , global central banks accumulated $ 283.5 billion of Treasuries and Agencies , something around $ 1,000 per capita .
This is real money – I outlined the likely implications in January .
Foreign CBs are happily financing the first US stimulus package ; will they be happy to finance a second ?
Do they have a choice ?
Their accumulation of Agency debt is also keeping the US mortgage market afloat .
Do not underestimate the impact of these foreign capital inflows .
If the rest of the world treated the US like we treated emerging Asia in 1997 - 1998 , the US economy would experience a slowdown commensurate with the magnitude of the financial market crisis .
Duy suggested that it might be possible for the US to rebalance and increase exports enough to reduce the need for more foreign funding .
However , China has announced its plans to slow the pace of yuan appreciation , a negative for US export competitiveness .
But even worse , the housing recession is far from over .
Plenty of measures ( prices relative to income and rents , duration of the late 1980s - early 1990s housing recession , comparisons to serious housing recessions in other developed economies ) suggests that we are at best only halfway through in terms of duration and average house price declines .
More housing losses means more trouble for the financial system , which means more interventions that depend on foreign support .
Frank Veneroso argues we have to get off the debt E - ticket ride , now .
Referring to the chart above , he writes :
This chart shows something that has gone vertical , something that is on a moon shot .
If it were the GDP of Argentina in pesos I would agree that the moon shot could go on and on .
But it is not the Argentine economy in domestic money terms .
It is a macroeconomic ratio of total debt to GDP .
Macroeconomic ratios cannot go on unending moon shots .
They are basically mean reverting series .
In many cases , such as an economy ’s investment ratio or its profit ratio , these values tend to be more or less the same on average over long periods of time .
There are some such ratios that exhibit an upward bias or a downward bias ; the ratio of service output to GDP and the ratio of industrial production to GDP are examples .
But even though there may be a secular “ tilt ” to the mean , the shift in that mean is always gradual .
Over short periods of time like a decade or so mean reversion tends to bring you close to where you came from .
For the above ratio of credit market debt to GDP there is no gradual tilt to this ratio over the last two decades …
How can that be , given that it is a macroeconomic ratio ?
… If we look back in history , we see one prior vertical takeoff in this ratio – the period from 1930 to 1933 .
In that episode economic agents did not want to increase their aggregate debt to GDP …..
A very bad recession from mid 1929 to mid 1930 started to take the denominator – nominal income – down rapidly … .
The resulting financial and economic carnage was so great that all economic agents wanted mean reversion .
But debt is a stubborn thing to dislodge .
It took a generation encompassing a wartime inflation to revert to the mean and eventually overshoot it to the downside .
Over the last year the U.S. has undergone the worst financial crisis in the three generations since that horrific episode of the 1930s .
Even though we have had a severe financial crisis the ratio of total credit market debt to GDP keeps on rising .
This could have occurred because government was socializing debt , but that has not happened yet .
Private debt to GDP rose as rapidly last year as it did before the onset of the financial crisis .
It even rose in the first quarter of this year as the financial crisis intensified .
But unlike the 1930s , when this ratio rose even though economic agents did not want it to rise because nominal income was falling , in this episode the private debt to GDP ratio has kept rising because fee hungry lenders continue to engage in expanding credit to profligate over - indebted borrowers .
If one looks at this chart with a historic perspective it is clear that this ratio cannot keep on rising .
But if you ask people in the market place whether we must go though a period in which credit falls sharply relative to income they will say that need not be .
It is widely acknowledged that it has taken several units of debt to produce a unit of GDP in recent years .
Most people strangely assume that will be the case in the next recovery .
The same attitudes hold for our policy makers .
They do not talk about an eventual reduction of credit relative to income .
They talk about providing new channels of credit to offset constricting ones ; for example , expanding the lending of the GSEs to offset the falloff in securitizations .
Can the moon shot in the debt to GDP ratio keep going on , like so many assume ?
Or has something happened that makes at least a reversal , if not mean reversion , imperative now ?
The answer is , reversal is imperative now .
Why ?
It is widely understood that starting in the mid 1990s we entered into a historically novel path of serial bubblizations .
Each asset bubble went hand - in - hand with an expansion of credit to the private sector …. we can see why the reversal of the moon shot in the debt to GDP ratio is imperative .
First , house prices now seem to be in an unstoppable downward spiral …..
It has been calculated from the flow of funds accounts that the ratio of aggregate mortgage debt to residential real estate value reached a peak of 50 % when the home price and home finance bubbles reached their peak at the end of 2006 .
But the flow of funds accounts do not capture second and third mortgages .
They do not capture the home equity loans that are in portfolios other than those of the commercial banks .
There is a large “ other ” household debt item in the flow of funds accounts which includes various such claims against residential real estate collateral .
I encountered one ratio calculated by the housing finance industry that suggested that , at the home price peak at the end of 2006 , the aggregate loan to value ratio was 57 % …..
If home prices fall nationwide by 35 % , it follows that the average loan to value ratio will exceed 90 % .
About 30 % of all residential real estate in value terms is without a mortgage .
For all real estate with a mortgage , the distribution of mortgage indebtedness is very skewed .
With the average loan to value ratio rising to almost 90 % , a huge share of almost all mortgage debt will be deeply underwater .
All studies show that when mortgages are well underwater there are defaults and foreclosures .
This applies to the majority of mortgage debt classified as prime as well as the margin of mortgage debt classified as subprime .
If home prices mean revert , the odds are high that in the shakeout that will follow the total credit market debt to GDP ratio will finally fall from its moon shot trajectory …..
There is another reason why .
There are no more serial bubbles to be blown that are beneficial to income and output , even in the short run .
The housing bubble was able to bailout the bursting of the tech bubble because it lifted household wealth and in turn employment , income , and output .
Not so , the next new bubble now underway – the commodity bubble ….. the effects on the economy from the commodity bubble are very different than those of the housing bubble .
The public is not on board this bubble .
They are not day trading tech stocks and feeling richer day by day .
They are not buying second homes and investment homes , pyramiding their real estate wealth .
The public ’s involvement in the commodity bubble market is vestigial at most .
Rather , the public is exposed to commodities primarily as goods which they must buy to use .
This bubble – and in particular the oil bubble – is squeezing the bejesus out of everyman .
Rather than being a new bubble that makes households feel richer , it is a bubble that is taxing them and thereby making them poorer .
The serial bubble solution to the problem of prior bubbles and the financial fragilities they spawn has come to a dead end with a third toxic oil bubble the financial authorities did not expect and do not want – the commodity bubble .
Now the serial bubblization of the policy makers portends recession , not recovery ….. The end of the moon shot in the debt to GDP would appear to be at hand .
Veneroso thinks the only way we might get a break is if the commodities bubble gets pricked and oil goes to $ 60 .
Since that is a wet dream for commodities bears , it looks likely that a grim scenario is not far from unfolding .
In case you view Veneroso as extreme , other analysts are leaning to a deflationary scenario , which presupposes deleveraging .
Forbes cites the views of Merrill Lynch ’s North American economist , David Rosenberg :
Where , tractor pulling happens .
Much like a truck pull .
A motor sport , where the idea is to pull a weight transfer machine , called a sled , as far as possible down a dirt track .
The farther down the track the more weight the sled transfers to the skid plate .
This makes the sled harder to pull down the track .
The more distance , the harder it is to pull it .
As the vehicle pulls the sled down the track , the weight moves forward , creating more resistance for the tractor to pull against .
Finally at the supreme moment of pull , the weight on the sled is directly over the front end of the sled .
This causes enormous friction with the ground , which finally brings the vehicle to a halt , with the distance the vehicle has traveled measured from a point called a starting line to the point at which the front of the sled now rests .
Pulling the entire length of the track is considered a full pull .
When two or more competitors , in the same class , cross the 300 foot line this results in a pull - off .
Consumers may be tightening their belts , but that reduction apparently has n't affected DVD sales just yet .
In fact , spending on DVDs and Blu-ray discs during the first half of 2008 showed a slight increase over the same period a year ago , according to data collected by Home Media Magazine .
Spending on rentals rose even more , indicating that perhaps part of consumers ' money - saving efforts involve cozying up to a movie at home for entertainment instead of heading out for a night on the town — or downloading from the Internet .
Home Media found that sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs rose from $ 6.8 billion in early 2007 to $ 6.87 billion in the first half of this year — a modest increase of 1.1 percent .
This number appears to coincide with " studio reports " saying that unit sales were also up 1.1 percent to 412.3 million discs in the first half of 2008 , according to the Hollywood Reporter .
Rentals increased by 2.6 percent , from $ 3.7 billion to $ 3.9 billion .
Analysts seem to think that these numbers also serve as proof that downloading — legal or illegal — is not hurting DVD sales as much as Doomsdayers would like to think .
" The fact is , despite what many on Wall Street seem to think , there is very little digital downloading going on , " Adams Media Research president Adams Media Research said .
" We 're talking about $ 118 million in 2007 spending , and about $ 254 million this year — so against a $ 24 billion packaged media market , it 's really not making much of a dent at this point . "
This is despite P2P traffic recently shifting its focus from music to movies and soaring BitTorrent traffic .
This , of course , is happening right alongside the IFPI 's and MPAA 's legal crackdowns on P2P sites .
In fact , many observers have questioned whether the motion picture industry 's efforts are backfiring and merely drawing more attention to the fact that people can find music , movies , and TV online for free .
So far , it appears that most of the general public is still happily doing things the old - fashioned way .
Not so for other traditional media , like CDs .
Online music stores have been moving quickly up in the ranks ( and recently taking the number one spot ) among all music retailers , while CD sales have been tanking for several years .
This is likely due to the fact that all four of the major labels have now ditched DRM in their online sales , while the movie and TV industries still act as if they will ride out DRM ( in their legit sales ) to the grave .
With heavy usage restrictions on online purchases / rentals and not - very - easy - to - use online services , it comes as no huge surprise that consumers are content to just relax with a bowl of popcorn , pop in a DVD or Blu-ray , and watch it on a giant flat - screen TV .
This might have been a story of how a couple of MIT scientists happened upon a breakthrough discovery in the electrolysis of water ; but they did n't ( and so it is n't ) .
This might also have been a story about an informed media which correctly and skeptically reports on such scientific discoveries -- in the midst of a public relations barrage from a leading university -- but nobody really expects such journalistic vigilance anymore .
Instead , this story will try to examine what ( if anything ) was discovered , and how this news affects the landscape of the looming energy crisis .
In addition , given that a number of encouraging research reports have surfaced suggesting a seamless transition to a hydrogen economy , I will revisit the fundamental challenge posed by moving to alternate liquid fuels : getting used to the idea of diffuse energy .
( Some names have been omitted to protect the less guilty ) .
What the Report Reportedly Reports
Massachussets Institute of Technology chemistry professor Daniel Nocera and a postdoctoral fellow ( who will remain blameless here ) have published a report in Sciencepress , a rapid online publication channel for the journal Science , entitled In Situ Formation of an Oxygen - Evolving Catalyst in Neutral Water Containing Phosphate and Co2 + ( link ) .
The report itself does not make outrageous claims , but when supercharged by misleading statements and exaggerated claims from Nocera to the media as well as by an apparent MIT public relations blitz , these modest research findings have been transformed into a calming salve for the public 's current angst over high energy prices .
A sampling :
So what is really in the report ?
Nocera et. al. are working to improve the economics of hydrogen production via electrolysis by reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of electrolyzers used to split water into the component gases .
Shown below is a simplified diagram showing the basics of water electrolysis .
The red and blue wires protruding into solution are the cathode and anode respectively .
( Note that the configurations of real electrodes are more complicated ) .
When sufficient voltage is applied across the electrodes , current will flow and oxygen gas ( O 2 ) will form at the anode and hydrogen gas ( H 2 ) at the cathode .
The needed voltage , from thermodynamics , is termed the Standard Potential for the overall reaction and is equal to 1.23 volts at 25C .
In reality , more voltage than the Standard Potential must be applied to get appreciable water splitting and gas production , for reasons discussed below .
This means that the electrolyzer is less than 100 % efficient in converting electric power to power theoretically available by recombining the gases in a fuel cell .
Remember that power is current times volts .
For example , if double the Standard Potential ( i.e. 2.46 ) volts is applied , only half of the power goes into splitting water and the rest is wasted -- giving an efficiency of 50 % .
Making A Better Electrode
Why is this extra voltage needed ?
Part is needed to overcome the resistance of the solution .
For this reason , electrolytes are added to make the liquid more conductive .
The more vexing problem has to do with the nature of the electrodes upon which the reactions take place .
The rate of a reaction at an electrode , known as the kinetics , limits how fast hydrogen can be generated and turns out to be very dependent on what the electrode is made of .
Precious metals such as platinum and palladium generally make good electrodes , but they are of course expensive .
The reaction can be " overdriven " by applying a larger voltage than the minimum required , but this reduces the efficiency .
For water splitting , the oxygen - evolving anode is the larger contributor to the problem , requiring a larger " overpotential " .
The goal of the Nocera et. al. research is to build a better ( smaller overpotential ) and cheaper anode .
They fabricated their anode by electrodepositing a thin film containing cobalt , phosphorous , potassium , and oxygen onto an inert ( but conductive ) surface .
They fully analyzed the film to determine its composition and to verify that it was indeed producing oxygen when a voltage was placed between it and a cathode .
They then measured how much current flowed ( i.e. how much hydrogen could be produced ) vs. how much voltage had to be applied .
The Early Returns
Cheaper ?
Perhaps .
but it depends on what you compare it to .
It 's eye - opening to contrast the price of cobalt with that of platinum , but commercial anodes are n't made of platinum .
It is difficult to get information on commercial electrolysis anodes , but most today are probably made of a nickel alloy .
Nocera makes much of the fact of having his cell at neutral pH and open to air ( where the nickel would n't function as well ) , but the cell has to be enclosed anyway to collect the hydrogen .
More Efficient ?
Not based on the data they presented .
For example , they reported a current density of 1 milliampere per square centimeter ( mA / cm ^ 2 ) with an overpotential of 410 millivolts .
In comparison , this patent from 1979 reports better performance ( e.g. 1 mA / cm^2 at < 200 mV overpotential ) for nickel anodes .
Remember , the goal is to minimize the overpotential for a given current density .
There have also been many recent reports of better performance for a variety of anode compositions , including alloys or oxides containing cobalt .
Anything ?
Hello ?
If the Nocera electrode material is n't more efficient , then we are back to cheaper .
This remains to be seen in the context of a working electrolyzer , but there might be some advantages to a neutral pH and the simplicity of fabrication .
Thus , this is research worth doing .
But what has been communicated to the outside world is that hydrogen will soon be flowing from our pores because of this research .
Let 's look at some of the more amazing claims .
Deconstructing the Media
I will chastise MIT first , since ( although they are not a disinterested party ) they should know better .
Here is one bold claim :
Until now , solar power has been a daytime - only energy source , because storing extra solar energy for later use is prohibitively expensive and grossly inefficient .
With today 's announcement , MIT researchers have hit upon a simple , inexpensive , highly efficient process for storing solar energy .
Inspired by the photosynthesis performed by plants , Nocera and [ the other guy ] , a postdoctoral fellow in Nocera 's lab , have developed an unprecedented process that will allow the sun 's energy to be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases .
No , they 've made an anode which may or may not be cheaper and is not more efficient .
And according to this report , capital costs ( of which the anode cost is only a part ) account for less than half of the overall cost of producing hydrogen -- the largest being the cost of the electricity .
And for smaller systems , since the amount of electrode material scales directly with capacity , more of the capital cost is incurred by other equipment such as control electronics and gas handling and compression hardware .
Inspiration from leaves aside , there are decades of precedence for the electrolysis of water .
Nocera does n't reference any of it , but you can easily find it with Google .
From EETimes we have this thermodynamically challenged claim :
A liquid catalyst was added to water before electrolysis to achieve what the researchers claim is almost 100 - percent efficiency .
" The hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen -- platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen .
But platinum works very poorly for oxygen , making you use much more energy , " said MIT chemistry professor Daniel Nocera .
" What we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy .
In fact , with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen . "
The MIT catalyst components are solids ( salts ) dissolved in water , but where would the 100 % claim come from ?
Perhaps from quoting Nocera : First , platinum is n't presently used for the anode anyway .
But the last sentence should be rewritten as " exactly 100 % " , since where else is the current going to go ?
An electrochemical cell is a closed circuit .
But that has nothing to do with efficiency , which is instead the amount of power effecting the chemical change relative to the total power input ( see earlier discussion ) .
Clearly , their anode is nowhere near 100 % efficient .
From Reuters , we have :
Nocera 's catalyst is made from cobalt , phosphate and an electrode that produces oxygen from water by using 90 percent less electricity than current methods , which use the costly metal platinum .
... " It 's cheap , it 's efficient , it 's highly manufacturable , it 's incredibly tolerant of impurity and it's from earth - abundant stuff , " Nocera explained .
...
" For the last six months , driving home , I 've been looking at leaves , and saying , ' I own you guys now , ' " Nocera said .
Periods of high prices and concern about availability have resulted in various efforts to conserve , reduce , or substitute for cobalt .
In many applications , further substitution of cobalt would result in a loss in product performance .
Potential substitutes include barium or strontium ferrites , neodymium - iron - boron , or nickel - iron alloys in magnets ; nickel , cermets , or ceramics in cutting and wear - resistant materials ; nickel base alloys or ceramics in jet engines ; nickel in petroleum catalysts ; rhodium in hydroformylation catalysts ; nickel or manganese in batteries ; and manganese , iron , cerium , or zirconium in paints .
It 's not clear where the 90 % figure comes from , since commercial anodes ( which do n't use platinum ) do at least as well as Nocera 's -- his claims are not supported by his report .
As for as the abundance of cobalt , it is a first - row transition metal .
But according to the Encyclopedia of Earth , the abundance in earth 's crust of cobalt ( 25 mg/ kg ) is less than that of nickel ( 84 mg/kg ) .
According to the U.S. Geological Survey , Mineral Commodity Summaries :
As for price , remember that soy oil was rather cheap before a new market ( biodiesel ) appeared for it .
Scientific American plays the platinum card as well :
Chemist Daniel Nocera , head of the M.I.T.'s Solar Revolution Project , focused on one side of the equation : splitting water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen molecules .
This can be done well , but it remains difficult to actually separate the molecules .
But Nocera and postdoctoral fellow [ the other guy ] discovered it could be accomplished by simply adding the metals cobalt and phosphate to water and running a current through it .
In contrast to platinum , cobalt and phosphate cost roughly $ 2.25 an ounce and $.05 an ounce , respectively .
" We [ have ] figured out a way just using a glass of water at room temperature , under atmospheric pressure , " Nocera says .
" This thing [ a thin film of cobalt and phosphate on an electrode ] just churns away making [ oxygen ] from water . "
No , they have n't invented water electrolysis , doing it in a glass of water at RT and 1 atmosphere is n't important , " separating the molecules " is n't the problem , and phosphate is n't a metal ( or even an element ) .
Churning is for butter .
The journalistic arms of scientific journals are n't much better .
From the print edition of Science ( 1 AUGUST 2008 VOL 321 ) :
The catalyst is n’t perfect .
It still requires excess electricity to start the water - splitting reaction , energy that is n’t recovered and stored in the fuel .
And for now , the catalyst can accept only low levels of electrical current .
Nocera says he ’s hopeful that both problems can be solved , and because the catalysts are so easy to make , he expects progress will be swift .
Further work is also needed to reduce the cost of cathodes and to link the electrodes to solar cells to provide clean electricity .
A final big push will be to see if the catalyst or others like it can operate in seawater .
If so , future societies could use sunlight to generate hydrogen from seawater and then pipe it to large banks of fuel cells on shore that could convert it into electricity and fresh water , thereby using the sun and oceans to fill two of the world ’s greatest needs .
That 's one ( il ) logical leap into the future .
Electrolysis in Context
Given that last vision , it 's best to put the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen into the broader context of the prospects for alternative energy .
Consider the following diagram :
Moving to hydrogen as an end - use fuel presents many challenges , and the cost and efficiency of electrolysis are rather minor in the larger scope .
Shifting from concentrated and easily transportable fuel sources ( oil converted to gasoline / diesel ) to diffuse sources ( solar / wind / biomass ) converted to a somewhat less concentrated and much less transportable fuel ( hydrogen ) will result in energy inefficiencies that cannot be overcome ( entropy problem ) .
In addition , substantial changes in infrastructure are needed , and in the context of higher energy costs in the near term , making these changes will be difficult .
( See the Hirsch Report for a sobering assessment . )
Both an articulation and an assessment of the real challenges are somehow absent in the excitement generated by the Nocera et. al. report .
Hydrogen will have uses , particularly in energy storage , but solving a few problems ( when they are actually solved ) will not painlessly transition us to a new energy future .
Summary
So I went ahead and did a podcast with Stewart Baker , former general counsel for the NSA and actually somebody I have a decent amount of respect for ( Google set me up with him during the SOPA debate , he understood everything I had to say , and he really applied some critical pressure publicly and behind the scenes to shut that mess down ) .
Does n’t mean I agree with the guy on everything .
I told him in no uncertain terms we had some disagreements regarding backdoors .
and if he asked me about them I ’d say as such .
He was completely OK with this , and in today ’s echo - chamber loving society that ’s a real outlier .
The debate is a ways in , and starts around here .
You can get the audio ( and a summary ) here but as usual I ’ve had the event transcribed .
Enjoy !
Steptoe Cyberlaw Podcast-070
Stewart : Welcome to episode 70 of the Steptoe Cyberlaw Podcast brought to you by Steptoe & Johnson ; thank you for joining us .
We ’re lawyers talking about technology , security , privacy in government and I ’m joined today by our guest commentator , Dan Kaminsky , who is the Chief Scientist at WhiteOps , the man who found and fixed a major and very troubling flaw in the DNS system and my unlikely ally in the fight against SOPA because of its impact on DNS security .
Welcome , Dan .
Dan :
It ’s good to be here .
Stewart :
All right ; and Michael Vatis , formerly with the FBI and the Justice Department , now a partner in in Steptoe ’s New York office .
Michael , I ’m glad to have you back , and I guess to be back with you on the podcast .
Michael :
It ’s good to have a voice that is n’t as hoarse as mine was last week .
Stewart : Yeah , that ’s right , but you know , you can usually count on Michael to know the law – this is a valuable thing in a legal podcast – and Jason Weinstein who took over last week in a coup in the Cyberlaw podcast and ran it and interviewed our guest , Jason Brown from the Secret Service .
Jason is formerly with the Justice Department where he oversaw criminal computer crime , prosecutions , among other things , and is now doing criminal and civil litigation at Steptoe .
I ’m Stewart Baker , formerly with NSA and DHS , the record holder for returning to Steptoe to practice law more times than any other lawyer , so let ’s get started .
For old time ’s sake we ought to do one more , one last hopefully , this week in NSA .
The USA Freedom Bill was passed , was debated , not amended after efforts ; passed , signed and is in effect , and the government is busy cleaning up the mess from the 48/72 hours of expiration of the original 215 and other sunsetted provisions .
So USA Freedom ; now that it ’s taken effect I guess it ’s worth asking what does it do .
It gets rid of bulk collection across the board really .
It says , “ No , you will not go get stuff just because you need it , and wo n’t be able to get it later if you ca n’t get it from the guy who holds it , you ’re not going to get it . ”
It does that for a pen trap , it does that for Section 215 , the subpoena program , and it most famously gets rid of the bulk collection program that NSA was running and that Snowden leaked in his first and apparently only successful effort to influence US policy .
[ Helping ] who are supposed to be basically Al Qaeda ’s lawyers – that ’s editorializing ; just a bit – they ’re supposed to stand for freedom and against actually gathering intelligence on Al Qaeda , so it ’s pretty close .
And we ’ve never given the Mafia its own lawyers in wiretap cases before the wiretap is carried out , but we ’re going to do that for –
Dan :
To be fair you were [ just ] wiretapping the Mafia at the time .
Stewart : Oh , absolutely .
Well , the NSA never really had much interest in the Mafia but with Title 3 yeah ; you went in and you said , “ I want a Title 3 order ” and you got it if you met the standard , in the view of judge , and there were no additional lawyers appointed to argue against giving you access to the Mafia ’s communications .
And Michael , you looked at it as well – I ’d say those were the two big changes – there are some transparency issues and other things – anything that strikes you as significant out of this ?
Michael : I think the only other thing I would mention is the restrictions on NSLs where you now need to have specific selection terms for NSLs as well , not just for 215 orders .
Stewart : Yeah , really the house just went through and said , ” Tell us what capabilities could be used to gather international security agencies ’ information and we will impose this specific selection term , requirement , on it . ”
That is really the main change probably for ordinary uses of 215 as though it were a criminal subpoena .
Not that much change .
I think the notion of relevance has probably always carried some notion that there is a point at which it gathered too much and the courts would have said , “ That ’s too much . ”
Michael : going in that , okay , Telecoms already retain all this stuff for 18 months for billing purpose , and they ’re required to by FCC regulation , but I think as we ’ve discussed before , they ’re not really required to retain all the stuff that NSA has been getting under bulk retention program , especially now that people have unlimited calling plans , Telecoms do n’t need to retain information about every number call because it does n’t matter for billing purposes .
So I think , going forward , we ’ll probably hear from NSA that they ’re not getting all the information they need , so I do n’t think this issue is going to go away forever now .
I think we ’ll be hearing complaints and having some desire by the Administration to impose some sort of data retention requirements on Telecoms , and then they ’ll be a real fight .
Stewart :
That will be a fight .
Yeah , I have said recently that , sure , this new approach can be as effective as the old approach if you think that going to the library is an adequate substitute for using Google .
They wo n’t be able to do a lot of the searching that they could do and they wo n’t have as much data .
But on the upside there are widespread rumors that the database never included many smaller carriers , never included mobile data probably because of difficulties separating out location data from the things that they wanted to look at .
So privacy concerns have already sort of half crippled the program and it also seems to me you have to be a remarkably stupid terrorist to think that it ’s a good idea to call home using a phone that operates in the United States .
People will use call of duty or something to communicate .
All right , the New York Times has one of its dumber efforts to create a scandal where there is none – it was written by Charlie Savage and criticized “ Lawfare ” by Ben Wittes and Charlie , who probably values his reputation in National Security circles somewhat , writes a really slashing response to Ben Wittes , but I think , frankly , Ben has the better of the argument .
The story says “ Without public notice or debate the Obama Administration has expanded NSAs warrant with surveillance of American ’s international internet traffic to search for evidence of malicious computer hacking ” according to some documents obtained from Snowden .
It turns out , if I understand this right , that what NSA was looking for in that surveillance , which is a 702 surveillance , was malware signatures and other indicia that somebody was hacking Americans , so they collected or proposed to collect the incoming communications from the hackers , and then to see what was exfiltrated by the hackers .
In what universe would you describe that as American ’s international internet traffic ?
I do n’t think when somebody ’s hacking me or stealing my stuff , that that ’s my traffic .
That ’s his traffic , and to lead off with that framing of the issue it ’s clearly baiting somebody for an attempted scandal , but a complete misrepresentation of what was being done .
Dan : I think one of the issues is there ’s a real feeling , “ What are you going to do with that data ? ”
Are you going to report it ?
Are you going to stop malware ?
Are you going to hunt someone down ?
Stewart :
All of it .
Dan :
Where is the – really ?
Stewart : Yeah .
Dan : Because there ’s a lot of doubt .
Stewart : Yeah ; I actually think that the FBI regularly – this was a program really to support the FBI in its mission – and the FBI has a program that ’s remarkably successful in the sense that people are quite surprised when they show up , to go to folks who have been compromised to say , “ By the way , you ’re poned , ” and most of the time when they do that some people say , “ What ?
Huh ? ”
This is where some of that information almost certainly comes from .
Dan :
The reality is , everyone always says , “ I ca n’t believe Sony got hacked , ” and many of us actually in the field go , “ Of course we can believe it . ”
Sony got hacked because everybody ’s hacked somewhere .
Stewart : Yes , absolutely .
Dan :
There ’s a real need to do something about this on a larger scale .
There is just such a lack of trust going on out there .
Stewart : Oh yeah .
Dan :
And it ’s not without reason .
Stewart : Yeah ; Jason , any thoughts about the FBIs role in this ?
Jason : Yeah .
I think that , as you said , the FBI does a very effective job at knocking on doors or either pushing out information generally through alerts about new malware signatures or knocking on doors to tell particular victims they ’ve been hacked .
They do n’t have to tell them how they know or what the source of the information is , but the information is still valuable .
I thought to the extent that this is one of those things under 702 , where I think a reasonable person will look at this and be appreciative of the fact that the government was doing this , not critical .
And as you said , the notion that this is sort of stolen internet traffic from Americans is characterized as surveillance of American ’s traffic , is a little bit nonsensical .
Stewart :
So without beating up Charlie Savage – I like him , he deserves it on this one – but he ’s actually usually reasonably careful .
The MasterCard settlement or the failed MasterCard settlement in the Target case , Jason , can you bring us up to date on that and tell us what lessons we should learn from it ?
Jason :
There have been so many high profile breaches in the last 18 months people may not remember Target , which of course was breached in the holiday season of 2013 .
MasterCard , as credit card companies often do , try to negotiate a settlement on behalf of all of their issuing banks with Target to pay damages for losses suffered as a result of the breach .
In April MasterCard negotiated a proposed settlement with Target that would require Target to pay about $ 19 million to the various financial institutions that had to replace cards and cover for all losses and things of that nature .
But three of the largest banks , in fact I think the three largest MasterCard issuing banks , Citi Group , Capital One and JP Morgan Chase , all said no , and indicated they would not support the settlement and scuttled it because they thought $ 19 million was too small to cover the losses .
There are trade groups for the banks and credit unions that say that between the Target and Home Depot breaches combined there were about $ 350 million in costs incurred by the financial institutions to reissue cards and cover losses , and so even if you factor out the Home Depot portion of that $ 19 million , it ’s a pretty small number .
So Target has to go back to the drawing board , as does MasterCard to figure out if there ’s a settlement or if the litigation is going to continue .
And there ’s also a proposed class action ongoing in Minnesota involving some smaller banks and credit unions as well .
It would only cost them $ 10 million to settle the consumer class action , but the bigger exposure is here with the financial institution – Michael made reference last week to some press in which some commentator suggested the class actions from data breaches were on the wane – and we both are of the view that that ’s just wrong .
There may be some decrease in privacy related class actions related to misuse of private information by providers , but when it comes to data breaches involving retailers and credit card information , I think not only are the consumer class actions not going anywhere , but the class actions involving the financial institutions are definitely not going anywhere .
Standing is not an issue at all .
It ’s pretty easy for these planners to demonstrate that they suffered some kind of injury ; they ’re the ones covering the losses and reissuing the cards , and depending on the size of the breach the damages can be quite extensive .
I think it ’s a sign of the times that in these big breaches you ’ll find banks that are insisting on a much bigger pound of flesh from the victims .
Stewart : Yeah , I think you ’re right about that .
The settlements , as I saw when I did a quick study of settlements for consumers , are running between 50 cents and two bucks per exposure , which is not a lot , and the banks ’ expenses for reissuing cards are more like 50 bucks per victim .
But it ’s also true that many of these cards are never going to be used ; many of these numbers are never going to be used , and so spending 50 bucks for every one of them to reissue the cards , at considerable cost to the consumers as well , might be an overreaction , and I would n’t be surprised if that were an argument .
Dan :
So my way of looking at this is from the perspective of deterrence .
Is $ 19 million enough of a cost to Target to cause them to change their behavior and really divest – it ’s going to extraordinarily expense to migrate our payment system to the reality , which is we have online verification .
We can use better technologies .
They exist .
There ’s a dozen ways of doing it that do n’t lead to a password to your money all over the world .
This is ridiculous .
Stewart :
It is .
Dan : I ’m just going to say the big banks have a point ; $ 19 million is –
Stewart : Does n’t seem like a lot .
Dan : to say , “ We really need to invest in this ; this never needs to happen again , ” and I ’m not saying 350 is the right number but I ’ve got to agree , 19 is not .
Stewart :
All right then .
Okay , speaking of everybody being hacked , everybody includes the Office of Personnel Management .
Dan : Yeah .
Stewart :
My first background investigation and it was quite amusing because the government , in order to protect privacy , blacked out the names of all the investigators who I would n’t have known from Adam , but left in all my friends ’ names as they ’re talking about my drug use , or not .
Dan : Alleged .
Stewart : Exactly ; no , they were all stand up guys for me , but there is a lot of stuff in there that could be used for improper purposes and it ’s perfectly clear that if the Chinese stole this , stole the Anthem records , the health records , they are living the civil libertarian ’s nightmare about what NSA is doing .
They ’re actually building a database about every American in the country .
Dan : Yeah , a little awkward , is n’t it ?
Stewart :
Well , annoying at least ; yes .
Jason , I do n’t know if you ’ve got any thoughts about how OPN responds to this ?
They apparently did n’t exactly cover themselves with glory in responding to an IG report from last year saying , “ Your system sucks so bad you ought to turn them off . ”
Jason :
Well , first of all as your lawyer I should say that your alleged drug use was outside the limitations period of any federal or state government that I ’m aware of , so no one should come after you .
I thought it was interesting that they were offering credit monitoring , given that the hack has been attributed to China , which I do n’t think is having any money issues and is going to steal my credit card information .
I ’m pretty sure that the victims include the three of us so I ’m looking forward to getting that free 18 months of credit monitoring .
I guess they ’ve held out the possibility that the theft was for profit as opposed to for espionage purposes , and the possibility that the Chinese actors are not state sponsored actors , but that seems kind of nonsensical to me .
And I think that , as you said , as you both said , that the Chinese are building the very database on us that Americans fear that the United States was building .
Stewart : Yeah , and I agree with you that credit monitoring is a sort of lame and bureaucratic response to this .
Instead , they really ought to have the FBI and the counterintelligence experts ask , “ What would I do with this data if I were the Chinese ? ” and then ask people whose data has been exploited to look for that kind of behavior .
Knowing how the Chinese do their recruiting I ’m guessing they ’re looking for people who have family still in China – grandmothers , mothers and the like , and who also work for the US government – and they will recruit them on the basis of ethnic and patriotic duty .
And so folks who are in that situation could have their relatives visited for a little chat ; there ’s a lot of stuff that is unique to Chinese use of this data that we ought to be watching for a little more aggressively than stealing our credit .
Stewart : Yeah ; well , that ’s all we ’ve got when it ’s hackers .
We should think of a new response to this .
Dan :
We should , but like all hacks [ attribution ] is a pain in the butt because here ’s the secret – hacking is not hard ; teenagers can do it .
Stewart : Yes , that ’s true .
Dan : [ Something like this can take just ] a few months .
Stewart :
But why would they invest ?
Dan :
Why not ?
Data has value ; they ’ll sell it .
Stewart : Maybe ; so that ’s right .
On the other hand the Anthem data never showed up in the markets .
We have better intelligence than we used to .
We ’ll know if this stuff gets sold and it has n’t been sold because – I do n’t want to give the Chinese ideas but –
Dan : I do n’t think they need you to give them ideas ; sorry .
Stewart :
One more story just to show that I was well ahead of the Chinese on this – my first security clearance they asked me for people with whom I had obligations of affection or loyalty , who were foreigners .
And I said I ’m an international lawyer – this was before you could just print out your Outlook contacts – I Xeroxed all those sheets of business cards that I ’d collected , and I sent it to the guys and said , “ These are all the clients or people I ’ve pitched , ” and he said , “ There are like 1,000 names here . ”
I said , “ Yeah , these are people that I either work for or want to work for . ”
And he said , “ But I just want people to whom you have ties of obligation or loyalty or affection . ”
I said , “ Well , they ’re all clients and I like them and I have obligations to clients or I want them to be .
I ’ve pitched them . ”
And he finally stopped me and said , “ No , no , I mean are you sleeping with any of them ? ”
So good luck China , figuring out which of them , if any , I was actually sleeping with .
Dan :
You see , you gave up all those names to China .
Stewart :
They ’re all given up .
Dan : Look what you did !
Stewart : Exactly ; exactly .
Okay , last a topic – Putin ’s trolls – I thought this was fascinating .
This is where the New York Times really distinguished itself with this article because it told us something we did n’t know and it shed light on kind of something astonishing .
This is the internet association I think .
Their army of trolls , and the Chinese have an even larger army of trolls , and essentially Putin ’s FSB has figured out that if you do n’t want to have a Facebook revolution or a Twitter revolution you need to have people on Twitter , on Facebook 24 hours a day , posting comments and turning what would otherwise be evidence of dissent into a toxic waste dump with people trashing each other , going off in weird directions , saying stupid things to the point where no one wants to read the comments anymore .
It ’s now a policy .
They ’ve got a whole bunch of people doing it , and on top of it they ’ve decided , “ Hell , if the US is going to export Twitter and Twitter revolutions then we ’ll export trolling , ” and to the point where they ’ve started making up chemical spills and tweeting them with realistic video and people weighing in to say , “ Oh yeah , I can see it from my house , look at those flames . ”
All completely made up and doing it as though it were happening in Louisiana .
Dan :
The reality is that for a long time the culture has managed .
We had broadcasts , broadcasters had direct government links , everything was filtered , and the big experiment of the internet was what if we just remove those filters ?
What if we just let the people manage it themselves ?
And eventually astroturfing did not start with Russia ; there ’s been astroturfing for years .
It ’s where you have these people making fake events and controlling the message .
What is changing is the scale of it .
What is changing is who is doing it .
What is changing is the organization and the amount of investment .
You have people who are professionally operating to reduce the credibility of Twitter , of Facebook so that , quote / unquote , the only thing you can trust is the broadcast .
Stewart : I think that ’s exactly right .
I think they call the Chinese version of this the 50 Cent Army because they get 50 cents a post .
But I guess I am surprised that the Russians would do that to us in what is plainly an effort to test to see whether they could totally disrupt our emergency response , and it did n’t do much in Louisiana but it would n’t be hard in a more serious crisis , for them to create panic , doubt and certainly uncertainty about the reliability of a whole bunch of media in the United States .
This was clearly a dry run and our response to it was pretty much that .
I would have thought that the US government would say , “ No , you do n’t create fake emergencies inside the United States by pretending to be US news media . ”
Jason : I was going to say all those alien sightings in Roswell in the last 50 years do you think were Russia or China ?
Stewart :
Well , they were pre Twitter ; I ’m guessing not but from now on I think we can assume they are .
Dan :
What it all comes back to is the crisis of legitimacy .
People do not trust the institutions that are around them .
If you look there ’s too much manipulation , too much skin , too many lives , and as it happens institutions are not all bad .
Like you know what ?
Vaccines are awesome but because we have this lack of legitimacy people are looking to find what is the thing I ’m supposed to be paying attention to , because the normal stuff keeps coming out that it was a lie and really , you know what , what Russia ’s doing here is just saying , “ We ’re going to find the things that you ’re going to instead , that you think are lying ; we ’re going to lie there too because what we really want is we want America to stop airing our dirty laundry through this Twitter thing , and if America is not going to regulate Twitter we ’re just going to go ahead and make a mess of it too . ”
Stewart : Yeah .
I think their view is , “ Well , Twitter undermines our legitimacy ; we can use it to undermine yours ? ”
Dan : Yeah , Russians screwing with Americans ; more likely than you think .
Michael : I ’m surprised you guys see it as an effort to undermine Twitter ; this strikes me as classic KGB disinformation tactics , and it seems to me they ’re using a new medium and , as you said before , they ’re doing dry runs so that when they actually have a need to engage in information operations against the US or against Ukraine or against some other country , they ’ll know how to do it .
They ’ll have practiced cores of troll who know how to do this stuff in today ’s media .
I do n’t think they ’re trying to undermine Twitter .
Stewart :
One of the things that interesting is that the authoritarians have figured out how to manage their people using electronic tools .
They were scared to death by all of this stuff ten years ago and they ’ve responded very creatively , very effectively to the point where I think they can maintain an authoritarian regime for a long time , without totalitarianism but still very effectively .
And now they ’re in the process of saying , “ Well , how can we use these tools as a weapon the way they perceive the US has used the tools as weapon in the first ten years of social media . ”
We need a response because they ’re not going to stop doing it until we have a response .
Michael : I ’d start with the violation of the missile treaty before worrying about this so much .
Stewart : Okay , so maybe this is of a piece with the Administration ’s strategy for negotiating with Russia , which is to hope that the Russians will come around .
The Supreme Court had a ruling in the case we talked about a while ago ; this is the guy who wrote really vile and threatening and scary things about his ex wife and the FBI agent who came to interview him and who said afterwards , after he ’d posted on Facebook and was arrested for it , “ Well , come on , I was just doing what everybody in hip hop does ; you should n’t take it seriously .
I did n’t , ” and the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether the test for threatening action is the understanding of the writer or the understanding of the reader ?
At least that ’s how I read it , and they sided with the writer , with the guy who wrote all those vile things .
Michael , did you look more closely at that than I did ?
Michael :
The court read into it a requirement that the government has to show at least that the defendant sent the communication with the purpose of issuing a threat or with the knowledge that it would be viewed as a threat , and it was n’t enough for the government to argue and a jury to find that a reasonable person would perceive it as a threat .
So you have to show at least knowledge or purpose or intent , and it left open the question whether recklessness as to how it would be perceived , was enough .
Stewart :
All right ; well , I ’m not sure I ’m completely persuaded but it probably also does n’t have enough to do with CyberLaw in the end to pursue .
Let ’s close up with one last topic , which is the FBI is asking for or talking about expanding CALEA to cover social media , to cover communications that go out through direct messaging and the like , saying it ’s not that we have n’t gotten cooperation from social media when we wanted it or a wiretap ; it ’s just that in many cases they have n’t been able to do it quickly enough and we need to set some rules in advance for their ability to do wiretaps .
This is different from the claim that they ’re Going Dark and that they need access to encrypted communications ; it really is an effort to actually change CALEA , which is the Communications Assistance Law Enforcement
Act from 1994 , and impose that obligation on cellphone companies and then later on voiceover IP providers .
Jason , what are the prospects for this ?
How serious a push is this ?
Jason :
Well , prospects are – it ’s DOA – but just to put it in a little bit of historical perspective .
So Going Dark has of late been the name for the FBIs effort to deal with encryption , but the original use of that term , Going Dark was , at least in 2008 / 2009 when the FBI started a legislative push to amend CALEA and extend it to internet based communications , Going Dark was the term they used for that effort .
They would cite routinely the fact that there was a very significant number of wiretaps in both criminal and national security case that providers that were not covered by CALEA did n’t have the technical capability to implement .
So it was n’t about law enforcement having the authority to conduct a wiretap ; they by definition has already definition had already developed enough evidence to satisfy a court that they could meet the legal standard .
It was about the provider ’s ability to help them execute that authority that they already had .
As you suggested , either the wiretap could n’t be done at all or the provider and the government would have to work together to develop a technical solution which could take months and months , by which time the target was n’t using that method of communication anymore ; had moved onto something else .
So for the better part of four years , my last four years at the department , the FBI was pushing along with DEA and some other agencies , for a massive CALEA reform effort to expand it to internet based communications .
At that time – this is pre Snowden ; it ’s certainly truer now – but at that time it was viewed as a political non starter , to try to convince providers that CALEA should be expanded .
So they downshifted as a Plan B to try to amend Title 18 , and I think there were some parallel amendments to Title 50 , but the Title 18 amendments would have dramatically increased the penalties for provider who did n’t have the capability to implement a wiretap order , a valid wiretap order that law enforcement served .
There would be this graduating series of penalties that would essentially create a significant financial disincentive for a provider not to have in their sight capability in advance or to be able to develop one quite quickly .
So the FBI , although it wanted CALEA to be expanded was willing to settle for this sort of indirect way to achieve the same thing ; to incentivize providers to develop an intercept solutions .
That was an unlikely Bill to make it to the Hill and to make it through the Hill before Snowden ; after Snowden I think it became politically plutonium .
It was very hard even before Snowden to explain to people that this was not an effort to expand authorities ; it was about executing those authorities .
That argument became almost impossible to make in the post Snowden world .
What struck me about this story though is that they appear to be going back to Plan A , which is trying to go in the front door and expand CALEA , and the only thing I can interpret is either that the people running this effort now are unaware of the previous history that they went through , or they ’ve just decided what the hell ; they have nothing to lose .
They ’re unlikely to get it through anyway so they might as well ask for what they want .
Stewart :
That ’s my impression .
There is n’t any likelihood in the next two years that encryption is going to get regulated , but the Justice Department and the FBI are raising this issue I think partly on what the hell , this is what we want , this is what we need , we might as well say so , and partly I think preparation of the battle space for the time when they actually have a really serious crime that everybody wishes had been solved and ca n’t be solved because of some of these technical gaps .
Dan :
You know what drives me nuts is we ’re getting hacked left and right ; we ’re leaking data left and right , and all these guys can talk about is how they want to leak more data .
Like when we finish here this is about encryption .
We ’re not saying we ’re banning encryption but if there ’s encryption and we ca n’t get through it we ’re going to have a graduated series of costs or we ’re going to pull CALEA into this .
There ’s entire classes of software we need to protect American business that are very difficult to invest in right now .
It ’s very difficult to know , in the long term , that you ’re going to get to run it .
Stewart :
Well , actually my impression is that VCs are falling all over themselves to fund people who say , “ Yeah , we ’re going to stick it to the NSA . ”
Dan : Yeah , but those of us who actually know what we ’re doing , know whatever we ’re doing , whatever would actually work , is actually under threat .
There are lots of scammers out there ; oh my goodness , there are some great , amazing , 1990s era snake oil going on , but the smart money is not too sure we ’re going to get away with securing anything .
Stewart : I think that ’s probably right ; why do n’t we just move right in because I had promised I was going to talk about this from the news roundup to this question – Julian Sanchez raised it ; I raised it with Julian at a previous podcast .
We were talking about the effort to get access to encrypted communications and I mocked the people who said , “ Oh , you can never provide access without that ; that ’s always a bad idea . ”
And I said , “ No , come on . ”
Yes , it creates a security risk and you have to manage it but sometimes the security risk and the cost of managing it is worth it because of the social values .
Dan : Sometimes you lose 30 years of background check data .
Stewart : Yeah , although I ’m not sure they would have .
I ’m not sure how encryption , especially encryption of data in motion , would have changed that .
Dan :
It ’s a question of can you protect the big magic key that gives you access to everything on the Internet , and the answer is no .
Stewart :
So let me point to the topic that Julian did n’t want to get into because it seemed to be more technical than he was comfortable with which is –
Dan : Bring it on .
Stewart : Exactly .
I said , “ Are you kidding me ?
End to end encryption ? ”
The only end to end encryption that has been adopted universally on the internet since encryption became widely exportable is SSL / TLS .
That ’s everywhere ; it ’s default .
Okay , but SSL / TLS is broken every single day by the thousands , if not the millions , and it ’s broken by respectable companies .
In fact , probably every Fortune 500 company insists that SSL has to be broken at their firewall .
And they do it ; they do it so that they can inspect the traffic to see whether some hacker is exfiltrating the –
Dan : Yeah , but they ’re inspecting their own traffic .
Organizations can go ahead and balance their benefits and balance their risks .
When it ’s an external actor it ’s someone else ’s risk .
It ’s all about externality .
Stewart :
Well , yes , okay ; I grant you that .
The point is the idea that building in access is always a stupid idea , never worth it .
It ’s just wrong , or at least it ’s inconsistent with the security practices that we have today .
And probably , if anything , some of the things that companies like Google and Facebook are doing to promote SSL are going to result in more exfiltration of data .
People are already exfiltrating data through Google properties because Google insists that they be whitelisted from these intercepts .
Dan :
What ’s increasingly happening is that corporations are moving the intercept and DLP and analytics role to the endpoint because operating it as a midpoint just gets slower and more fragile day after day , month after month , year after year .
If you want security , look , it ’s your property , you ’re a large company , you own 30,000 desktops , they ’re your desktops , and you can put stuff on them .
Stewart :
But the problem that the companies have , which is weighing the importance of end to end encryption for security versus the importance of being able to monitor activity for security , they have come down and said , “ We have to be able to monitor it ; we ca n’t just assume that every one of our users is operating safely . ”
That ’s a judgment that society can make just as easily .
Once you ’ve had the debate society can say , “ You know , on the whole , ensuring the privacy of everybody in our country versus the risks of criminals misusing that data , we ’re prepared to say we can take some risk on the security side to have less effective end to end encryption in order to make sure that people cannot get away with breaking the law with impunity . ”
Dan :
Here ’s a thing though – society has straight out said , “ We do n’t want bulk surveillance . ”
If you want to go ahead and monitor individuals , you have a reason to monitor , that ’s one thing but –
Stewart :
But you ca n’t monitor all of them .
If they ’ve been given end to end – I agree with you – there ’s a debate ; I ’m happy to continue debating it but I ’ve lost so far .
But you say , no , it ’s this guy ; this guy , we want to listen to his communications , we want to see what he is saying on that encrypted tunnel , you ca n’t break that just stepping into the middle of it unless you already own his machine .
Dan : Yeah , and it ’s unfortunately the expensive road .
Stewart : because they do n’t do no good .
Dan : is n’t there .
It is n’t the actual thing .
Stewart :
It is n’t here – I ’m over at Stanford and we ’re at the epicenter of a contempt for government , but everybody gets a vote .
You get a vote if you live in Akron , Ohio too , but nobody in Akron gets a vote about where their end to end encryption is going to be deployed .
Dan :
You know , look , average people , normal people have like eight secure messengers on their phone .
Text messaging has fallen off a cliff ; why ?
At the end of the day it ’s because people want to be able to talk to each other and not have everyone spying on them .
There ’s a cost , there ’s an actual cost to spying on the wrong people .
Stewart :
There is ?
Dan :
If you go ahead and you make everyone your enemy you find yourself with very few friends .
That ’s how the world actually works .
Stewart :
All right ; I think we ’ve at least agreed that there ’s routine breakage of the one end to end encryption methodology that has been widely deployed .
I agree with you , people are moving away from man in middle and are looking to find ways to break into systems at the endpoint or close to the endpoint .
Okay ; let ’s talk a little bit , if we can , about DNSSEC because we had a great fight over SOPA and DNSSEC , and I guess the question for me is what – well , maybe you can give us two seconds or two minutes on what DNSSEC is and how it ’s doing in terms of deployment .
Dan : DNSSEC , at the end of the day makes it as easy to get encryption keys as it is to get the address for a server .
Crypto should not be drama .
You ’re a developer , you need to figure out how to encrypt something , hit the encrypt button , you move on with your life .
You write your app .
That ’s how it needs to work .
DNS has been a fantastic success at providing addressing to the internet .
It would be nice if keying was just as easy , but let me tell you , how do you go ahead and go out and talk to all these internet people about how great DNSSEC is when really it ’s very clear DNS itself – it ’s not like SOPA fights , it ’s not going to come back –
Stewart : Yeah ; well , maybe .
Dan : – and it ’s not like the security establishment , which should be trying to make America safer , it ’s like , “ Man , we really want to make sure we get our keys in there . ”
When that happens [ it does n’t work ] .
It ’s not that DNSSEC is n’t a great technology , but it really depends on politically [ the DNS and its contents ] being sacrosanct .
Stewart : Obviously , DHS , the OMB committed to getting DNSSEC deployed at the federal level , and so their enthusiasm for DNSSEC has been substantial .
Are you saying that they have undermined that in some way that –
Dan :
The federal government is not monolithic ; two million employees , maybe more , and what I ’m telling you is that besides the security establishment that ’s keeping on saying , “ Hey , we ’ve got to be able to get our keys in there too , ” has really – we ’ve got this dual mission problem going on here .
Any system with a dual mission , no one actually believes there ’s a dual mission , okay .
If the Department of Transportation was like , “ Maybe cars should cars should crash from time to time , ” if Health or Human Services was like , “ Hey , you know , polio is kind of cool for killing some bad guys . ”
No one would take those vaccines because maybe it ’s the other mission and that ’s kind of the situation that we have right here .
Yeah , DNSSEC is a fantastic technology for key distribution , but we have no idea five years from now what you ’re going to do with it , and so instead it ’s being replaced with garbage [ EDIT :
This is rude , and inappropriate verbiage . ]
I ’m sorry , I know people are doing some very good work , but let me tell you , their value add is it ’s a bunch of centralized systems that all say , “ But we ’re going to stand up to the government . ”
I mean , that ’s the value add and it never scales , it never works but we keep trying because we ’ve got to do something because it ’s a disaster out there .
And honestly , anything is better than what we ’ve got , but what we should be doing is DNSSEC and as long as you keep making this noise we ca n’t do it .
Stewart : So DNSSEC is up to what ?
Ten percent deployment ?
Dan : DNSSEC needs a round of investment that makes it a turnkey switch .
Stewart : Aah !
Dan : DNSSEC could be done [ automatically ] but every server just does n’t .
We [ could ] just transition the internet to it .
You could do that .
The technology is there but the politics are completely broken .
Stewart : Okay ; last set of questions .
You ’re the Chief Scientist at WhiteOps and let me tell you what I think WhiteOps does and then you can tell me what it really does .
I think of WhiteOps as having made the observation that the hackers who are getting into our systems are doing it from a distance .
They ’re sending bots into pack up and exfiltrate data .
They ’re logging on and bots look different from human beings when they type stuff and the people who are trying to manage an intrusion remotely also looks different from somebody who is actually on the network and what WhiteOps is doing is saying , “ We can find those guys and stop them . ”
Dan :
And it ’s exactly what we ’re doing .
Look , I do n’t care how clever your buffer overflow is ; you ’re not teleporting in front of a keyboard , okay .
That ’s not going to happen .
So our observation is that we have this very strong signal , it ’s not perfect because sometimes people VPN in , sometimes people make scripted processes .
Stewart :
But they ca n’t keep a VPN up for very long ?
Dan : [ If somebody is remotely ] on the machine ; you can pick it up in JavaScript .
So you have a website that ’s being lilypad accessed either through bulk communications with command and control to a bot , or through interaction with remote control , churns out weak signals that we ’re able to pick up in JavaScript .
Stewart :
So this sounds so sensible and so obvious that I guess my question is how come we took this long to have that observation become a company ?
Dan : I do n’t know but we built it .
The reality is , is that it requires knowledge of a lot of really interesting browser internals .
At WhiteOps we ’ve been breaking browsers for years so we ’re basically taking all these bugs that actually never let you attack the user but they have completely different responses inside of a bot environment .
That ’s kind of the secret sauce .
Every browser is really a core object that reads HTML 5 , Java Scripted video , all the things you ’ve got to do to be a web browser .
Then there ’s like this goop , right ?
Like it puts it on the screen , it has a back button , uses an address bar , and lets you configure stuff , so it turns out that the bots use the core not the goop .
Stewart :
Oh yeah , because the core enables them to write one script for everything ?
Dan : Yeah , so you have to think of bots as really terribly tested browsers and once you realize that it ’s like , “ Oh , this is barely tested , let ’s make it break . ”
Stewart : Huh !
I know you ’ve been doing work with companies looking for intrusions .
You ’ve also been working with advertisers ; not trying to find people who are basically engaged in click fraud .
Any stories you can tell about catching people on well guarded networks ?
Dan : I think one story I really enjoy – we actually ran the largest study into ad fraud that had ever been done , of its nature .
We found that there ’s going to be about $ 6 billion of ad fraud at http://whiteops.com/botfraud, and we had this one case , so we tell the world we ’re going to go ahead and run this test in August and find all the fraud .
You know what ?
We lied .
We do that sometimes .
We actually ran a test from a little bit in July , all the way through September and we watched this one campaign ; 40 percent fraud , then when we said we were going to start , three percent fraud .
Then when we said we ’re going to start , back to 40 .
You just had this square wave .
It was the most beautiful demo .
We showed this to the customers – one of the biggest brands in the country – and they were just like , “ Those guys did what ? ”
And here ’s what ’s great – for my entire career I ’ve been dealing with how people break in .
This bug , that bug , what ’s wrong with Flash , what ’s wrong with Java ?
This is the first time in my life I have ever been dealing with why .
People are doing this fraud to make money .
Let ’s stop the checks from being written ?
It ’s been incredibly entertaining .
Stewart :
Oh , that it is ; that ’s very cool , and it is – I guess maybe this is the observation .
We wasted so much time trying to keep people out of systems hopelessly ; now everybody says , “ Oh , you have to assume they ’re in , ” but that does n’t mean you have the tools to really deal with them , and this is a tool to deal with people when they ’re in .
Dan :
There ’s been a major shift from prevention to detection .
We basically say , “ Look , okay , they ’re going to get in but they do n’t necessarily know what perfectly to do once they ’re in . ”
Their actions are fundamentally different than your legitimate users and they ’re always going to be because they ’re trying to do different things ; so if you can detect properties of the different things that they ’re doing you actually have signals , and it always comes down to signals in intelligence .
Stewart : Yeah ; that ’s right .
I ’m looking forward to NSA deploying WhiteOps technology , but I wo n’t ask you to respond to that one .
Okay , Dan , this was terrific I have to say .
I ’d rather be on your side of an argument than against you , but it ’s been a real pleasure arguing this out .
Thanks for coming in Michael , Jason ; I appreciate it .

A photograph of a nude six - year - old girl on the cover of a high - brow Australian art magazine today sparked an uproar after Prime Minister Kevin Rudd called it disgusting , infuriating liberal art critics .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This month 's taxpayer - funded Art Monthly Australia magazine placed the photograph of the young dark - haired girl on the cover , sitting and with one nipple showing , to protest censorship of a recent photo exhibition featuring similarly naked children .
" I can't stand this stuff , " said Rudd , a staunch Christian whose centre - left Labor government won a sweeping victory over conservatives last year , in part on a vow to reinvigorate Australia 's small but influential arts community .
" We 're talking about the innocence of little children here .
A little child cannot answer for themselves about whether they wish to be depicted in this way , " Rudd added , as officials said they would review the magazine 's funding .
Magazine editor Maurice O'Riordan said he hoped the July edition of the monthly magazine would restore " dignity to the debate " about artistic depictions of children and anyone else .
The magazine cover followed confiscation by police in May of photographs of a young girl taken by artist Bill Henson and briefly on display in a Sydney art gallery .
The cover photo , which had been on public exhibition in Australia for some time , was taken in 2003 by Melbourne photographer Polixeni Papapetrou and depicted her own daughter , Olympia Nelson , now aged 11 .
The Australian Childhood Foundation said parents had no ethical right to consent to nude photographs being taken of their children , as it could have a psychological impact in later years .
But Nelson and her father , art critic and professor Robert Nelson , defended the photo in a press conference outside their home in the southern city of Melbourne .
" I love the photo so much .
I think that the picture my mum took of me had nothing to do with being abused , and I think nudity can be a part of art , " Olympia Nelson said .
Rudd last week met with the leaders of Australia 's six states and said he would forge a national child protection system following a spate of shocking cases of child neglect and abuse .
His government also criticised Australia 's " binge drinking " culture and sharply lifted taxes on so - called " alcopops " blending alcoholic drinks like vodka or rum with soft drinks and juices , making them popular with young adults , especially women .
" We 're sick of being unjustly targeted by a small minority group of wowsers , " Australian Hotels Association chief executive Sally Fielke said , using an Australian term for an excessively puritanical person .
Fielke represents mainly the $ 25 bn local alcohol industry , but her thoughts echoed those of many social commentators and liberals .
Martyn Jolly , the head of photography and media arts at the elite Australian National University , said of the latest art controversy that the Henson photographs had been reviewed and approved by government censors .
" We are n't going to let politicians who are always wanting to jump on populous bandwagons dictate what we can and can't show , " Jolly said .
Man arrested for murder of French students Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez in which pair ' were tortured and killed for their PIN numbers '
A man is being questioned by detectives in connection with the murder of two French students , who may have been tortured for their bank details , after being arrested earlier today .
Detectives suspect Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez , both 23 , were killed in a robbery that escalated into the horrific double murder .
The Metropolitan Police said the 21 - year - old man was arrested at 3.40 am this morning and is in custody at a police station in south - east London .
It is understood that credit and charge cards are missing from the rented flat in New Cross , South - East London , where Mr Bonomo and Mr Ferez were gagged , tied to chairs , stabbed 243 times in the head , chest and back and finally set on fire .
Brutally murdered : Laurent Bonomo ( left ) and Gabriel Ferez were stabbed almost 250 times before their bodies were covered in an accelerant and set alight
They may have been tortured for hours to make them give up their PIN numbers .
Two new Sony PSP games consoles - worth £ 160 each - are also missing from Mr Bonomo 's flat , fuelling the theory that the men were murdered in a robbery at the hands of crazed drug addicts .
Six days before the murders , Mr Bonomo disturbed an intruder who stole a laptop as he took an early morning shower .
That theft and the murders may be connected .
Tribute : Laurent Bonomo's cousin Leo visits the flats today with flowers
The level of violence has led to speculation that the killer or killers were on crack cocaine when the bio-chemistry students were slaughtered on Sunday .
Last night the father of Mr Ferez paid tribute to his ' incredibly gifted son ' who was studying with Mr Bonomo at Imperial College , London .
Speaking for the first time about the killings , Olivier Ferez , a nurse , told the Daily Mail : ' We are just in shock and completely devastated .
' Gabriel is , was , the most intelligent , affectionate , wonderful son anyone could ever want .
He studied at the best university in France and then the best in England .
He had such a bright future and now that has gone . '
Divorced Mr Ferez , who yesterday comforted his daughter Helene , 20 , and 12 - year - old
younger son at the family home , added : ' It is the worst nightmare for any parent . '
Rejane Ferez , Mr Ferez 's grandmother , said he had been ' finding life in London tough ' .
She added : ' Gabriel loved travelling and had recently spent time in Mexico , but nothing had prepared him for London . '
She added : ' As well as all the usual problems , life in London could also be very lonely .
Both Gabriel and Laurent were greatly looking forward to getting back home . '
Tragic : Mr Bonomo , 23 , with his fiancee Mary Bertez .
Ms Bertez , also a student , has said their time together was the happiest of her life
The students were in the second year of a three - year master 's degree in France and had been selected to take part in a three month research project at Imperial College .
They were due to return home later this month .
Mr Bonomo , from Velaux , near Marseille , and Mr Ferez , from Prouzel , near Amiens , were popular characters at the Polytech Clermont - Ferrand in central France .
Yesterday parents of fellow students in London demanded that their children be brought home .
University director Claude - Gilles Dussap said : ' I have had a number of calls from families saying they are scared about their son or daughter and want them to come home .
They think London is dangerous . '
He added : ' I told them the same thing could happen here in France , in Paris or Lyon , it is just a freak terrible thing but it could have happened anywhere . '

Bound : Mr Ferez , 23 , had been visiting his friend 's flat when he was killed
Manhunt : Forensic teams comb the flat and surrounding area for any clues about the killer .
A white man was seen running from the flat after the explosion
Disarray : Inside Mr Bonomo's flat is a scene of chaos
The bodies of the 23 - year - olds were found at Mr Bonomo 's flat in the cul - de-sac of Sterling Gardens , New Cross , on Sunday night .
A white man was seen running away moments after an explosion .
Detective Chief Inspector Mick Duthie , leading the investigation , said : ' We are keen to hear from anyone who has recently been offered a laptop and two personal game consoles , or knows someone who has unexpectedly come to have them .
' A black Packard Bell laptop was taken during a burglary between 5 am and 6 am on June 23 . '
Detectives have said the burglary in which the laptop was stolen could be linked to the murders as forensic experts have found no evidence of forced entry , suggesting a stolen set of keys may have been used .
Speaking outside the flat , Mr Duthie said the fire was started to destroy forensic evidence .'
He added : ' We are still looking into how many weapons were used .
We have n't recovered any from the scene . '
He said 40 detectives were on the case , codenamed Operation Dockery .

The possible motives
Theft :
A burglar broke in to the bedsit six days earlier and stole a laptop .
Did he return and torture his pleading victims in a bid to obtain more valuable items ?
Sources described this as a key line of the inquiry .
Drugs :
The ferocity of the murders has prompted speculation that the killer or killers could have been on crack cocaine - which can cause paranoia and extreme violence .
Or , for whatever reason , did the men fall out with a local drug dealer ?
Mental illness :
The violence could be the work of a psychopath or person with an acute personality disorder .
Police will check on seriously mentally ill individuals in the area .
Sex :
Although neither victim suffered sexual injuries , police cannot rule out completely the possibility of a sexual motive .
Did the killer or killers get a sadistic pleasure from inflicting unimaginable pain ?
Was there a bizarre homosexual motive ?
Revenge :
Strong feelings of revenge can sometimes prompt horrific acts of violence .
But police see no obvious reason why the men would attract such hostile feelings .
Mistaken identity :
Were the men mistaken for other individuals who were the intended targets ?
Australian police are claiming the world 's biggest seizure of ecstasy after finding 4.4 tonnes of the drug , worth £ 197 m , hidden in tins of tomatoes .
The haul of around 15 million pills was seized after a series of raids across four states and in Europe .
Australian Federal Police said the banned amphetamine stimulant was imported from Italy into the southern city of Melbourne in June last year .
The operation followed a 12 - month investigation after a tip - off and X - ray imaging of a shipping container that arrived in Port Melbourne on 28 June last year .
Authorities replaced the ecstasy with a harmless substitute and kept the consignment under surveillance .
Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty said : " There have been 185,000 telephone intercepts in this operation and there have been 400 members of the AFP deployed to this operation .
" There have also been 10,000 hours of surveillance deployed to this operation to find the perpetrators of this world 's largest seizure and importation into our country .
" It is classic organised crime and we have done our best to shut down the syndicate . "
Raids were also underway in Belgium , the Netherlands and Italy .
So far , 21 people have been arrested around Australia .
Belfast Telegraph
BURKE , N.Y.  Everywhere that Janet and Ken Tacy looked , the wind companies had been there first .
Dozens of people in their small town had already signed lease options that would allow wind towers on their properties .
Two Burke Town Board members had signed private leases even as they negotiated with the companies to establish a zoning law to permit the towers .
A third board member , the Tacys said , bragged about the commissions he would earn by selling concrete to build tower bases .
And , the Tacys said , when they showed up at a Town Board meeting to complain , they were told to get lost .
“ There were a couple of times when they told us to just shut up , ” recalled Mr. Tacy , sitting in his kitchen on a recent evening .
Lured by state subsidies and buoyed by high oil prices , the wind industry has arrived in force in upstate New York , promising to bring jobs , tax revenue and cutting - edge energy to the long - struggling region .
But in town after town , some residents say , the companies have delivered something else : an epidemic of corruption and intimidation , as they rush to acquire enough land to make the wind farms a reality .
“ It really is renewable energy gone wrong , ” said the Franklin County district attorney , Derek P. Champagne , who began a criminal inquiry into the Burke Town Board last spring and was quickly inundated with complaints from all over the state about the wind companies .
Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo agreed this year to take over the investigation .
I was in Norway last week at the Norwegian Developers Conference , so I 'm afraid the Weekly Source Code is the bi-weekly source code this month .
It 's amazing how international travel can really slow a body down .
This trip just obliterated me .
I 'm slowly coming back to the world of the living , though .
I 've been getting more and more interested in how folks extend their applications using plugins and things .
In my new ongoing quest to read source code to be a better developer , Dear Reader , I present to you twenty - ninth in a infinite number of posts of " The Weekly Source Code . "
This week 's source is a clever " ClickOnce " - style hack for Ruby .
It 's cool because it brings together a number of technologies into a very clean end - user experience .
The intent is to make the running of a Ruby GUI Application effortless , and it works and it 's brilliant on several levels .
Thanks to Sam Saffron for pointing me to it !
To start out , it 's a hack says the author why the lucky stiff ( or " _why " for short ) , so it 's very early and there 's bugs .
You can check out the code on GitHub : http://github.com/why/shoes/tree/master or clone the whole tree using git via " git clone git://github.com/why/shoes.git "
Shoes
Ruby is a very aesthetically ( to me ) pleasing and flexible language .
Shoes is a GUI Toolkit for making Windowing Applications using Ruby .
I mentioned it back in TWSC12 .
Shoes is legendary for a number of reasons , but above all , it has the greatest API documentation in the history of all software documentation .
The main book on Shoes Development called " nobody knows shoes " is fantastic .
Even Chris Sells likes it !
Here 's part of an example phone book application written in Ruby and Shoes ) :
Shoes.app : width => 320 , : height => 350 do
stack : margin => 40 do
stack : margin => 10 do
para " Name "
@name = list_box :items => [ " Yes , please ! " , " NO .
No thankyou . " ]
end
stack : margin => 10 do
para " Address "
@address = edit_line
end
stack : margin => 10 do
para " Phone "
@phone = edit_line
end
stack : margin => 10 do
button " Save " do
Shoes.p [ @name.text , @address.text , @phone.text ]
end
end
end
end
It feels a lot like Tcl / Tk or Rebol .
It 'll be interesting to see if someone writes a mainstream application that is non-trivial .
Shoes works on XP , Vista , MacOSX and Linux .
Do note that you 'll need to right click and run it as Administrator on Vista as _why has n't put in an elevation prompt yet .
You 'll need Admin to do the initial bootstrap install .
However , in order to get Shoes to work , before today , you had to install Ruby , then get the Shoes libraries installed , usually via a gem .
Then you 'd need to run your app via ruby .
exe yourapp.rb or a shortcut you 'd setup .
The second comment on _why 's blog post announcement says it all :
" Wow , this is super .
We can actually give our apps to other people now : ) "
Here 's an explanation from _why on how the Shoes " bootstrapper " ( my word ) works :
If you poke around with a hex editor inside Windows ’
PE binary format , you ’ll find an .rsrc section at the end of the file which contains the icons and dialog boxes .
I insert the Ruby script into this mess .
binj = Binject ::EXE.new ( " blank.exe " ) binj.inject ( " SHOES_FILENAME " , " simple-accordion.rb " ) File.open ( " simple-accordion.rb " ) do |f| binj.inject ( " SHOES_PAYLOAD " , f ) end binj.save ( " accordion.exe " )
Fantastic hack .
He shoves the Ruby script into a Windows Resource !
He does the same thing for DMG ( Disk Images ) on Mac OSX , so you can create Ruby scripts that are portable to these two platforms .
When it runs , it checks for the existence of Shoes on your system .
It 's in C : \Program Files ( x86 ) \Common Files \Shoes\ .
If Shoes ( which includes a private copy of Ruby ) is not there , it 's downloaded and installed , and then your app runs .
Bam , one - click cross-platform GUIs .
I 'm not clear what the security ramifications are .
Well , I am .
I suspect there is no security that is n't already provided by the host operating system .
Once you 're running , the Ruby script has full control to do whatever it likes , so I suppose someone could write a malicious program just as they could write a malicious .NET app if they liked .
You can package your apps just by running shoes -- package and you 'll get this dialog .
You can chose to include Shoes and Ruby inside the resulting EXE if you like .
Shoes also supports custom " Widgets . "
For example , here 's a custom Speedometer control .
The code for the entire app , including the custom control is this :
class Speedometer < Widget
attr_accessor :range , :tick , : position
def initialize opts = {}
@range = opts [ : range ] || 200
@tick = opts [ : tick ] || 10
@position = opts [ : position ] || 0
@cx , @cy = self .
left + 110 , self.top + 100
nostroke
rect :top => self.top , : left => self .
left ,
: width => 220 , : height => 200
nofill
stroke white
oval : left => @cx - 50 , :top => @cy - 50 , :radius => 100
( ticks + 1 ) . times do |i|
radial_line 225 + ( ( 270.0 / ticks ) * i ) , 70..80
radial_line 225 + ( ( 270.0 / ticks ) * i ) , 45..49
end
strokewidth 2
oval : left => @cx - 70 , :top => @cy - 70 , :radius => 140
stroke lightgreen
oval : left => @cx - 5 , :top => @cy - 5 , :radius => 10
@needle = radial_line 225 + ( ( 270.0 / @range ) * @position ) , 0..90
end
def ticks ; @range / @tick end
def radial_line deg , r
pos = ( ( deg / 360.0 ) * ( 2.0 * Math : : PI ) ) - ( Math : : PI / 2.0 )
line ( Math.cos ( pos ) * r.begin ) + @cx , ( Math.sin( pos ) * r.begin ) + @cy ,
( Math.cos ( pos ) * r.end ) + @cx , ( Math.sin( pos ) * r.end ) + @cy
end
def position= pos
@position = pos
@needle.remove
append do
@needle = radial_line 225 + ( ( 270.0 / @range ) * @position ) , 0..90
end
end
end
Shoes.app do
stack do
para " Enter a number between 0 and 100 "
flow do
@p = edit_line
button " OK " do
@s.position = @p.text.to_i
end
end
@s = speedometer : range => 100 , : ticks => 10
end
end
It 's about 24 megs of libraries on disk when you 're done , but you 've got multimedia support and a lot of great library support in that space , not to mention a copy of Ruby itself .
The download is only 2.5 M bare or 6.8 M with Video support .
I think it'd be great to build a Twitter Client using Shoes .
The race is on !
Hopefully we 'll be able to get a Twitter Client done before some schmuck writes a Ruby Shoes virus .
I for one , will be keeping the Ruby Shoes virus I wrote to myself .
Well , not really a virus as it's a self propagating annoyance .
But still . :)
It 'll be fun to watch how this evolves .
I hope there will be a clean upgrade process .
If you want to try running your first Ruby / Shoes app , then run this EXE if you 've got Windows or this DMG if you 're on a Mac to see a basic demo application , but more importantly , to experience in the installer / bootstrapping process .
What the fuck , dude ?
Why would anyone get rid of the sole reason why people visit their site ?
It ’s like if a restaurant suddenly announced that they would stop serving food .
It ’s exactly like that .
The Nico community is mostly built around parodies on copyrighted material , so naturally a good number of the videos on the site will contain copyrighted material .
If you get rid of that , you ’re basically killing the community .
Simple as that .
And really , it ’s not like MAD movies or even openings and endings are full episodes .
Why get rid of them ?
I said it once , and I ’ll say it again – telling fans not to produce fanworks based on your product ( in this case , MAD movies ) is basically the same as telling them not to love your product .
Do these uptight suits with giant metal rods up their arses realize that these things are pure expressions of love ?
These guys making these things love your product , you motherfuckers !
Jesus Christ .
I really feel betrayed .
Nico always struck me as a cooler , more personal version of Youtube with a proper community that felt like family you never knew .
The fact that kumikyoku and MAD movies will be gone really makes me sour .
Where will the community go ?
Is an invasion of YouTube in order ?
Will some random JP anon make his own Nico clone ?
Who knows …
I can only hope that Nico eventually sees the errors in their ways and fixes things up , but I highly doubt it .
( Yes , I wrote this instead of watching Megazone 23 .
It ’s too late for that , anyway … )

Full transcript below the fold :
DENVER --John Kerry Wednesday at the Democratic National Convention .
Transcript courtesy of Federal News Service .
SEN .
KERRY : ( Cheers , applause . )
Thank you so much .
Thank you .
Four years ago you gave me the honor of fighting our fight , and I was proud to stand with you then and I am proud to stand with you now to help elect Barack Obama president of the United States .
( Cheers , applause . )
In 2004 we came so close to victory .
Well , my friends , we are even closer now .
And let me tell you , this time we 're going to win .
( Cheers , applause . )
Today -- today the call for change is more powerful than ever , and with more seats in Congress , with more people with more passion in our politics , and with a President Obama , we stand on the brink of the greatest opportunity of our generation to move this country forward .
The stakes could not be higher , because we do know what a Bush -- what a McCain administration would look like .
There 's a slip .
( Laughter . )
It would look just like the past , just like George Bush , and this country can't afford a third Bush term .
( Applause . )
Just think -- just think ; John McCain voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time .
Ninety percent of George Bush , my friends , is just more than we can take .
( Applause . )
Never in modern history has an administration squandered American power so recklessly .
Never has strategy been so replaced by ideology .
Never has extremism so crowded out common sense and fundamental American values .
Never has short - term partisan politics so depleted the strength of America 's bipartisan foreign policy .
( Cheers , applause . )
George Bush and John McCain at his side promised to spread freedom , but they delivered the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time .
They misread the threat and misled the country .
( Applause . )
Instead of freedom -- ( continued applause ) -- instead of freedom , it 's Hamas , Hezbollah , the Taliban , and dictators everywhere that are on the march .
North Korea can build more bombs and Iran is defiantly chasing one .
Our mission is to restore America 's influence and position in the world , and we must use all the weapons in our arsenal -- above all , our values .
President Obama and Vice President Biden will shut down Guantanamo -- ( audience cheers ) -- respect the Constitution , and make clear once and for all the United States of America does not torture -- not now , not ever !
( Cheers , applause . )
We must listen .
We must listen and lead by example , because even a nation as powerful as the United States needs some friends in this world .
We need a leader who understands all of our security challenges -- not just bombs and guns , but global warming , global terror , and global AIDS .
And Barack Obama understands there is no way for America to be secure until we create clean energy here at home -- not with a little more oil in 10 or 20 or 30 years , but with an energy revolution that begins now .
( Cheers , applause . )
I have known and been friends with John McCain for almost 22 years , but every day now I learn something new about Candidate McCain .
To those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician , I say let 's compare Senator McCain to Candidate McCain .
Candidate McCain now supports the very wartime tax cuts that Senator McCain once called irresponsible .
Candidate McCain criticizes Senator McCain 's own climate change bill .
Candidate McCain says he would vote against the immigration bill that Senator McCain wrote .
Are you kidding me , folks ?
( Laughter , cheers , applause . )
Talk about being for it before you 're against it !
( Cheers , applause . )
Let me tell you , before he ever debates Barack Obama , John McCain should finish the debate with himself .
( Laughter , applause . )
And what 's more , Senator McCain , who once railed against the smears of Karl Rove when he was the target has morphed into Candidate McCain , who is using the same Rove tactics , the same Rove staff , the same old politics of fear and smear .
Well , not this year ; not this time .
The Rove -McCain tactics are old and outworn , and America will reject them in 2008 .
( Cheers , applause . )
So remember , when we choose a commander - in - chief this November , we are electing judgment and character , not years in the Senate or on this Earth .
Time and again , Barack Obama has seen farther and listened harder and listened better and thought harder .
And time and again , Barack Obama has proven right .
John McCain stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier just three months after 9/11 and he proclaimed , next stop -- Baghdad .
The judgment immediately from Barack Obama was to see an occupation of undetermined length , undermined consequences , undetermined cost that , in his words , would only fan the flames of the Middle East .
Well , guess what ?
Mission accomplished .
( Boos from audience . )
So who can we trust to keep America safe ?
AUDIENCE : Barack Obama !
SEN .
KERRY : When Barack Obama promised to honor the best traditions of both parties and talk to our enemies , John McCain scoffed .
George Bush called it the false comfort of appeasement .
But today Bush 's diplomats are doing exactly what Obama said , talking with Iran .
So who can we trust to keep America safe ?
AUDIENCE : Barack Obama !
SEN .
KERRY : When democracy rolled out of Russia -- and Russia -- and the tanks rolled into Georgia , we saw John McCain immediately respond with outdated thinking of the Cold War .
Barack Obama responded like a true friend of Georgia and a statesman of the 21st century .
So who can we trust to keep America safe ?
AUDIENCE : Barack Obama !
SEN .
KERRY : When Democrats called for a timetable to make Iraqis stand up for Iraq and bring our heroes home , John McCain called it cut - and - run .
But today , even President Bush has seen the light , and he and Prime Minister Maliki agree on -- guess what ? -- a timetable .
So who can we trust to keep America safe ?
AUDIENCE : Barack Obama !
SEN .
KERRY : The McCain - Bush Republicans have been wrong again and again and again .
And they know they will lose on the issues .
So a candidate who once campaigned on the promise of a campaign of ideas , not insults , now has nothing left but personal attacks .
How insulting to suggest that those who question the mission question the troops .
How pathetic to suggest that those who question a failed policy doubt America itself .
How desperate to tell the son of a single mother , who chose community service over money and privilege , that he does n't put America first .
No one --
( Cheers , applause . )
No one can question Barack -- no one can question Barack Obama 's patriotism .
Like all of us , he was taught what it means to be an American by his family -- his grandmother , who worked on a bomber assembly line in World War II ; his grandfather , who marched in Patton 's Army ; and his great - uncle , who enlisted in the Army right out of high school at the height of the war .
And on a spring day in 1945 , that great - uncle helped liberate one of the concentration camps at Buchenwald .
Ladies and gentlemen , Barack Obama 's uncle is here with us tonight .
Please join me in saluting this American hero , Charlie Payne .
( Cheers , prolonged applause . )
SEN .
KERRY : Charlie , your nephew , Barack Obama , will end this politics of distortion and division .
He will be a president who seeks not to perfect the lies of swift - boating , but to end them once and for all .
( Cheers , applause . )
This election is a chance for America to tell the merchants of fear and division , you do n't decide who loves this country .
You do n't decide who is a patriot .
You do n't decide whose service counts and whose does n't .
Four years ago I said -- and I say it again tonight -- that flag that hangs from the rafters and that you have waved here this evening , that flag does n't belong to any ideology .
It does n't belong to any political party .
It is an enduring symbol of our nation , and it belongs to all the American people .
( Cheers , applause . )
( Audience chants " U - S - A ! " )
After all , patriotism is not love of power , or some trick .
( Chanting continues . )
Patriotism is love of country .
Years ago when we protested a war , people would weigh in against us , saying , my country , right or wrong .
Our answer , absolutely my country , right or wrong .
When right , keep it right , and when wrong , make it right .
( Cheers , applause . )
Sometimes loving your country demands that you must tell the truth to power .
This is one of those times , and Barack Obama is telling those truths .
In closing , let me say I will always remember how we stood together in 2004 , the largest number of Democrats in American history , not just in a campaign , but for a cause .
Now again , we stand together in the ranks ready to fight .
The choice is clear , our cause is just , and now is the time to make Barack Obama president of the United States of America .
Thank you .

It is hard for me to agree with the idea that an all - powerful god would allow so many errors , contradictions and horrible teachings to be in the Bible .
It seems obvious that the Bible was written by men long ago with no influence from a god .
At least not a god I would be interested in worshiping .
Below , I would like to explain why I have come to this conclusion .
Ex . 31:15 Kill anyone that has worked on a Sunday .
Ex . 21:17 Kill anyone who has ever got upset and used swear words against one of their parents .
Lev. 20:10
Kill anyone that commits adultery ( adultery is defined as marrying someone that has been divorced according to Matthew 5.32 )
Ex . 22:20 Destroy those that follow other religions .
Deuteronomy 17:2 - 7
Kill anyone with a different religion .
There are many more outrageous laws and teachings in the Bible .
Many Christians will say that since the above laws are in the Old Testament , Christians can ignore them because Jesus came to change those old laws .
But , the Bible tells a different story .
The writers of the Bible claim that the two verses below are direct quotes from Jesus .
Luke 16:17
“ But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail . ”
Matthew 5:17 - 19
“ Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets .
I did not come to abolish , but to fulfill .
For truly I say unto you , until heaven and earth pass away , not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law until all is accomplished .
Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments and so teaches others , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven .
But , whoever keeps and teaches them , he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven . ”
2 Timothy 3:16 “ All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , for training in righteousness . ”
Isaiah 40:8 “ the word of our God stands forever ”
1 Peter 24:25 “ but the word of the Lord abides forever ”
Psalm 19:7 “ the Law of the Lord is perfect ”
a believer can drink any deadly poison and it will not harm them ( Mark 16:18 )
do not resist who is evil ( Matthew 5:39 ) no one should have fought back against Hitler ?
whoever curses against their mother or father should be put to death ( Mark 7:10 )
there are verses that still approve slavery in the New Testament ( 1 Peter 2:18 , Ephesians 6:5 , 1 Timothy 6:1 - 2 ) these verses are telling the slaves to obey their masters
controlling behavior by making people afraid of going to a bad place after they die if they do not obey what the writers of the Bible say
keep the religion going a long time ( encourage having lots of kids and indoctrinate the kids early to believe that they will go to a bad place when they die if they do not follow the religion of their parents )
own slaves Leviticus 25:44 ( the writers of the Bible claim their god said it was ok to acquire slaves from the pagan nations , of course their race should not be slaves ) and Ephesians 6:5 ( they actually included a verse that told slaves to obey and serve their slave masters just like they would Jesus Christ )
God ’s people can acquire slaves from other nations
God ’s people should not be slaves
God says that the slaves need to obey their masters ( God ’s people )
Exodus 20:17 women are property of husband
Exodus 21:7 - 11 rules for selling your daughter into slavery
Leviticus 19:20 - 22 if a man rapes a female slave the female should be punished Deuteronomy 22:28 - 29 rules requiring a virgin to marry the man who raped her
1 Corinthians 14:34-35 women should remain silent in church
Ephesians 5:22 - 24 rules about how women should submit themselves to their husbands Numbers 31:17 - 18 here the writers of the Bible claim that their god has ordered them to kill all the Midianites except for the Midianite virgins which they can keep for themselves ( I wonder if the women doubted whether their loving god really inspired this verse ? )
Deuteronomy 22:20 - 21 kill women who are not virgins on their wedding night
there are many examples in the Bible where men have multiple wives ( another example of how the people who wrote the Bible keep favoring men over women )
get the masses to go to war to conquer new lands ( the Bible has helped motivate believers to go kill people in other lands that have different beliefs )
get money ( 10 % of everyone 's money is supposed to go to the people who created and then later promoted the religion )
make their race the most important ( the writers of the Bible made sure to claim that their God selected their race to be the “ chosen one ” ) would n’t it have been a lot more believable if the Bible was inspired by a god and the people writing the stories did not happen to be the chosen ones ?
to try to explain things that are probably always going to be unexplainable
Here is more of God ’s word ( according to the writers of the Bible ) .
Do any of these verses make it sound like parts of God ’s word should not be followed anymore ?
Why have so many Christians told me the Old Testament teachings are not relevant when there are so many verses that clearly state that this is not true ?
The same people who will tell me that the O.T. verses I quote are no longer valid will quote other O.T. verses and claim they are God ’s words which should be followed .
Many Christians will quote verses that say different things than the verses I quote .
Which makes an important point , the bible is full of contradictions !
You can find plenty of verses that say you should kill people and plenty of verses that say to be nice to people .
Some of the teachings of the New Testament are not that much of an improvement .
For example : Another major problem with the Bible is this .
Most of the stories are not from eye witnesses .
They were written by people sometimes hundreds of years later who were trying to promote the religion they were writing about .
Also , many of the stories in the Bible are very similar to stories that were written about other religions that had been created by men earlier .
The Mormons , Muslims , Christians and Jews appear to have a lot in common .
The men involved at the beginning of each religion claim that an angel or god himself told them what to write in their book ( Book of Mormon , Koran , Old Testament ) .
But , all 3 books have a lot of words that appear to have come from human sources , not from the mouth of a god or angel .
Many people have suffered or been killed because of those who follow the teachings of the Bible .
A human being is probably less likely to want to hurt another person unless there is a book they think comes from the word of God that tells them to kill people that have different religions or work schedules that require work on Sunday , etc .
Please do not make the argument that only radicals have done bad things in the name of religion .
In many cases , they are just doing what the Bible tells them to do .
How is that “ radical ” to just love the Lord and do what the word of God says ?
The writers of the Bible were probably writing words which they hoped would help them to accomplish many different things .
Below are some examples :
When the writers of the Bible include verses like that , it makes me wonder if they were ever concerned that it was going to be too obvious that they were just making up verses that would be to their benefit .
Look at the logic .
Is n’t that very convenient for God ’s people ?
( the people responsible for writing the Bible ) The Bible teachings about women are so anti-women that it seems obvious that men , not a loving god had to come up with them .
Look at the examples below .
Is n’t it amazing that a group of primitive men could write stuff like this and have it catch on and last for thousands of years ?
There are even examples in the Bible where there are references to the 4 corners of the earth and going up high to see all ends of the earth .
It appears that the writers of the Bible thought the earth was flat .
Why did n’t an all - knowing god inspire only verses that clearly state that the earth is round ?
Many people have told me that even if it is not true , Christianity is still a good thing .
Of course women , slaves , non-Christians , gays , Sunday workers and adulterers may have a different opinion .
Well , if is ok to believe in something that is probably completely made - up why do n’t we make up a new religion where there is not so much bad stuff written in the book the followers base their beliefs from .
Maybe the many problems with the Bible are a reason why Scientology was created and is popular with a lot of people .
Of course , another question is why do so many people feel the need to believe in fairy tales and a space daddy in the sky ?
Why ca n’t we just live our life with the rational idea that we just do not know how we got here and what happens after we die ?
Here is the most common point in favor of Christianity .
Something had to have created all this .
That may be true .
Maybe something did create this world .
But , how do you know hardly anything after that premise ?
Maybe this world was created by a few gods working together .
Maybe the god or gods that created this are not interested in being worshiped .
Worshiping is kind of a strange concept .
If you had the power to create an earth with human beings , would you require that they all had to worship you ?
Maybe whatever created the earth is not paying much attention to us anymore .
So , even if it is true that something created all this , we know virtually nothing about how this something wants us to live our lives .
The Bible is certainly not a consistent , moral , practical guide to live by .
And , I hope that most of this letter shows how obvious it is that a god did not inspire the Bible anyway .
Also , it is difficult to respect this something if it has the power to stop really bad things from happening and does not bother to do it .
Also , why do n’t the creators or creator make it easy for a rational thinking person to know they are around ?
Is it maybe because they are not involved here on this earth or maybe do not exist at all ?
Another common argument is “ what if you are wrong ? ” I have trouble understanding that argument .
If you want to believe in a religion just in case it might actually be true , how do you decide which one to believe in ?
Should I believe in the Greek gods just in case they might be true ?
Also , I do not see how I can pretend to believe in a religion if deep down I really do not think it is true .
What are the chances that the religion someone chooses to follow is actually truthful ?
Out of the thousands of religions that have been started throughout history only one could be completely true , and probably they are all wrong .
No one really knows what created all this and what happens after we die .
It is amazing how many religions are flourishing when there is so little evidence that any of them are telling the truth .
My experience has been that the more I read the Bible the more obvious it is to me that it was written by a small group of men trying to get a religion started that would benefit them .
When you read the Bible carefully , does it really appear to be inspired by an all - knowing , all - powerful and loving god ?
There are just way too many errors , contradictions and horrible teachings for the Bible not to be the work of human beings .
It makes sense to me that a group of men are likely to come up with a law where a raped virgin has to marry the man who raped her .
If more people would read the Bible carefully , I think there would be a lot more atheists and agnostics in this world .

IBM has unveiled a sneak peek of its new Lotus iNotes , a web app client for its Lotus Domino messaging server to bring email , calendar , and contacts to iPhone .
The move fulfills rumors of customized iPhone support for Lotus Notes and demonstrates IBM 's evolving interest in Apple within the enterprise .
Planned for delivery later this year , Lotus iNotes is built upon IBM 's existing Lotus Domino Web Access infrastructure .
The company 's web site invites users to " bring the enterprise to your Apple iPhone " and says the software will deliver a " rich Apple iPhone user experience . "
IBM published a series of screenshots of the tentative iNotes user interface , with the disclaimer that details are subject to change without notice .
Those changes may likely include closer adherence to Apple 's Human Interface Guidelines for the iPhone , as described in Apple 's Introduction to Safari Web Content Guide for iPhone .
The images below are AppleInsider 's composited representations of what the Lotus iNotes client will look like in the Safari browser , including support for email attachments , calendar events , and contacts .
The potential of a new platform
The original Lotus , which IBM purchased in 1995 , stumbled in the mid 80s in part due to its weak support for the new Macintosh .
The company then held a lock on the DOS spreadsheet market with Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 , but its equivalent product for Apple 's new Mac , called Lotus Jazz , failed miserably in part due to its lack of following Apple 's human interface guidelines .
Jazz was also expensive , late , and buggy .
That misstep allowed Microsoft to enter the Mac spreadsheet market virtually unchallenged , and rise from being a DOS license distributor into a new role as a significant desktop software developer with Excel on the Macintosh .
Microsoft later ported Excel to the DOS PC using its Windows environment , and quickly ate into Lotus ' 1 - 2 - 3 sales .
Lotus finally ported its 1 - 2 - 3 flagship to the Mac in 1991 , but by then it was too late .
After IBM purchased the remains of Lotus four years later , the pair floundered for years in the desktop software market , with Lotus ' SmartSuite continuously losing market share to Microsoft 's Office , in large measure due to the fact that Microsoft could sell Office licenses directly to PC makers tied to its dominant Windows platform .
Recently , IBM has embarked on a new strategy that backs Sun's OpenOffice suite .
IBM is marketing its distribution of the open source alternative to Microsoft Office under the name Lotus Symphony , and has announced plans to provide the suite for free to Mac users , as well as closely integrating the productivity suite to its Lotus Notes messaging server .
IBM betting on Apple
Support for the iPhone in Lotus Notes is only IBM 's latest step in investing in Apple 's platforms as a competitive alternative to Microsoft 's Windows .
An AP report from January cited IBM spokesman Mike Azzi as noting that his company has " a lot in common " with Apple .
" We 're going to cross- pollinate , " he said .
Earlier this year in May , IBM released its Informix Data Server 11 for Mac OS X Server .
And over the course of the last year , multiple groups within the company have launched pilot programs aimed at evaluating support for migrating to Apple 's Mac computers within the company .
An initial study at IBM Research , which started in October of 2007 , found that 86 % of those participating wanted to keep their MacBook Pro laptops over returning back to IBM ThinkPads running Windows .
It has been easier learning the Mac than learning Vista , one participant reported .
IBM has since expanded its Mac pilot program .
Enterprise a nearly untapped potential for Apple
Despite enthusiastic interest in Macs from users and a strategic competitive interest in Windows alternatives from Apple among executives , IBM currently has a very small share ( less than 1 % ) of its international workforce using Macs .
Many other companies similarly have a small proportion of Macs in their installed base .
However , Apple 's dynamic and sustained growth in other markets , including its education stronghold and the much easier to enter consumer market , are having an effect on adoption in the enterprise .
Sales of Apple 's Mac computers have sharply risen at a rate of between 30 and 40 % year over year ( Mac market share ) , in an overall PC market that is barely growing by 3 - 4 % .
A survey of 750 global IT administrators and C - level executives by the Yankee Group found that nearly four out of five businesses — or approximately 80 % — have at least a few Macs and the Mac OS X operating system installed in their networks , and nearly one - quarter said their firm had a " significant " number of Macs installed in their network of more than 30 to 50 units .
Stunningly lenient sentence for former bin Laden driver Associated Press
Published : Thursday August 7 , 2008
Print This Email
This A military jury gave Osama bin Laden 's driver a stunningly lenient sentence on Thursday , making him eligible for release in just five months despite the prosecutors ' request for a sentence tough enough to frighten terrorists around the globe .
Salim Hamdan 's sentence of 5 1/2 years , including five years and a month already served at Guantanamo Bay , fell far short of the 30 years to life that prosecutors wanted .
It now goes for mandatory review to a Pentagon official who can shorten the sentence but not extend it .
It remains unclear what will happen to Hamdan once his sentence is served , since the U.S. military has said it wo n't release anyone who still represents a threat .
The judge , Navy Capt .
Keith Allred , said Hamdan would likely be eligible for the same administrative review process as other prisoners .
Hamdan thanked the jurors for the sentence and repeated his apology for having served bin Laden .
" I would like to apologize one more time to all the members and I would like to thank you for what you have done for me , " Hamdan told the panel of six U.S. military officers , hand - picked by the Pentagon for the first U.S. war crimes trial in a half century .
The military has not said where Hamdan will serve his sentence , but the commander of the detention center , Navy Rear Adm .
David Thomas , said last week that convicted prisoners will be held apart from the general detainee population at the isolated U.S. military base in southeast Cuba .
" I hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country , and you 're able to be a provider , a father , and a husband in the best sense of all those terms , " the judge told Hamdan .
Hamdan , dressed in a charcoal sports coat and white robe , responded : " God willing . "

Does a freethinking vintner make California 's most interesting wine ?

Abe Schoener swears this is the path to one of his favorite vineyards .
We pull up in front of a modest home on a residential street outside Napa .
He skirts the manicured lawn , slips along the side of the house , past the detritus of air - conditioning compressors and long - dead pickup trucks .
This could n't possibly be the way , could it ?
" Wait till you see it , " he beams .
" It 's priceless . "
It 's an oversized garden : a single acre of scraggly vines in the backyard of John and Faye Guman , planted in 1982 as a favor by their friend Nathan Fay , who also once sold Warren Winiarski a key plot at Stag 's Leap Wine Cellars .
Twenty rows of vine trunks , stunted by viruses and oak root disease , provide less than half the fruit of normal vines , barely enough for 100 cases of wine .
The whole thing can be picked , by hand , in just one hour .
But these grapes - powerful , honeyed , almost salty , so thick - skinned they 're perceptibly tannic .
It 's prizefighter fruit .
Where other winemakers fled , Schoener swooned .
The Gumans ' vineyard became the heart of Nereides and Sylphs , his $ 80 Chardonnays .
" There 's a certain degree to which my vineyards are built from other people 's castoffs , " he says .
Schoener , 47 , is arguably California 's most radical winemaker .
The wines of his seemingly experimental winery , the Scholium Project , are bizarre , ingenious and polarizing - quite simply unlike anything else being made anywhere in this country .
Yet they radiate a hipster chic that tweaks California 's often ossified wine industry - right down to the photos on Schoener 's Web site ( scholiumwines.com ) , which resemble outtakes from a Mission District art project that went on a bender and woke up in a barrel room .
He has a devoted following .
Scholium bottles have found a ready home not only in venues like Thomas Keller 's French Laundry , but in New York 's outre restaurants Momofuku Ko and WD - 50 .
They are the perfect wines for a generation craving gastronomic whimsy .
By no means are all Schoener 's efforts successful .
I approach them with a mix of adoration , fascination and dismay .
But they are thoroughly unique , a tacit call to innovation - an expression of what California wine might be like if all the rules were chucked out and some very thoughtful ( if not pragmatic ) vintners rewrote them from scratch .
Schoener eschews varietal names in favor of vineyard designations - his way of driving home beliefs about terroir - and each wine gets a fanciful moniker , a sort of scholarly in - joke ( see " The stories behind the names , " Page F4 ) .
Doubters find the wines difficult and the names pretentious , Scholium devotees love the thrill of knowing that the Cena Trimalchionis ( " Trimalchio's dinner " ) , a dry Sauvignon Blanc completely infected with the noble rot botrytis , is a sly reference to the Latin text " Satyricon . "
Scholium can seem more an intellectual exercise than a real winery .
Vineyard owner Lee Hudson , Schoener says , calls it " thinly capitalized " - initially funded with credit cards and Schoener " wrecking " his pension .
He still resides in the same Carneros farmhouse he first rented ( from vintner Robert Sinskey ) nearly a decade ago , living off income from consulting projects .
A year ago he moved Scholium into its own facility , a metal barn in Fairfield shared with the Tenbrink family , Suisun Valley farmers whose grapes he uses in a wine called Babylon .
Yet Schoener pals around with some of California 's most famous vintners .
He found his best white wine vineyard with help from Screaming Eagle winemaker Andy Erickson .
Schoener 's mentor ( and tormentor ) is none other than John Kongsgaard , who makes some of California 's top Chardonnays .
Lacking any formal training , Schoener constantly throws wrenches into the traditional winemaking process .
Because he eschews commercial yeasts , his wines can take years to finish ; fermentation on most 2007s stopped short last winter and did n't restart until spring .
His white wines often sit on the grape skins for weeks or months to build complexity and texture , a technique typically reserved for reds .
He routinely leaves wines exposed to air or prone to bacteria - until vintner friends help reel his efforts back in .
" Abe just jumped in without having been plagued by that conservatism , and he 's friends with enough of us to keep from sliding off that cliff , " Kongsgaard says .
" I 'm often horrified to hear what he 's doing or not doing . "
Sometimes it goes too far .
Schoener tossed out three of nine barrels of his 2006 Pinot Grigio when they were n't decent enough to bottle .
" Those barrels represent mistakes I made , " he says .
" And I need to learn not to make those mistakes . "
When his efforts work , the wines can be unforgettable .
Schoener 's trademark wine , the Prince in His Caves , is an electrically tangy and unctuous Sauvignon Blanc that soaks on its skins for three weeks .
" You either despise it or are immediately attracted , " says Mark Snyder of Angel 's Share Wines , Schoener 's sometimes business strategist and New York distributor .
A study in wine
Essentially , a scholium is an annotation to a manuscript .
Schoener describes the Scholium Project as " undertaken for the sake of learning , understanding - hence a commentary , an essay , a study . "
That study has become Schoener 's sly - minded meditation on wine 's traditions .
With a blend of innocence and provocation , he questions the rules - asking , " But why ? " at each step in the winemaking process .
That has generated an enological bag of tricks , a " collection " of techniques from which Schoener cherry - picks .
In his world , Chardonnay need not be the sum of barrel fermentation , lees stirring and new oak .
It might be left unprotected to develop the same sort of surface yeast layer , known as flor , used to make wine in Jerez or France 's Jura region .
His logic makes more sense once you know of his previous career : as an assistant dean at St. John 's College , the Annapolis , Md. , school so devoted to Western classicism that all freshmen tackle not only Homer but Lucretius '
" On the Nature of Things . "
It somehow seems reasonable that Schoener once left a Syrah exposed to air until nearly spoiled , then rescued it from the drain when it seemingly revived itself , then dubbed it Scheria , after the spot where Odysseus was stranded before returning home .
The outsider status allows Schoener to be rebellious without being reactionary .
" I had nothing to rebel against , " he says .
" I was n't part of an orthodoxy .
I was an interloper . "
Schoener grew up on Manhattan 's Upper East Side - at least until his parents ( " late - blooming hippies " ) moved to rural Grafton , Vt .
He got his degree from St. John 's , followed by a doctorate in Greek philosophy at the University of Toronto .
There he began to develop a serious interest in wine , which lingered when he returned to teach at St. John's .
He joined a wine - tasting group and became fascinated by plant biology .
In 1998 , at his then wife 's suggestion , Schoener took a sabbatical in San Francisco .
Interested in the relationship between vine physiology and wine quality , Schoener reached out to a former student , Zach Rasmuson - now the winemaker at Goldeneye - and quietly landed an internship at Stag 's Leap Wine Cellars .
" They were kind of tickled , having a philosophy professor working for three bucks an hour , " he recalls .
( Winiarski did n't discover the St. John 's lecturer on his payroll for almost six weeks . )
Student finds a teacher
Schoener also befriended Kongsgaard , who invited Schoener to work with him at Luna Vineyards .
The veteran winemaker agreed to take on Schoener as his intern the following year .
Schoener asked for more leave from his teaching job to become , in essence , Kongsgaard 's student .
That dynamic remains today .
Schoener still addresses his benefactor as " Il dottore , " and when I witnessed Kongsgaard 's first visit to Schoener 's winery - filled with Kongsgaard 's used castoff barrels - he was quick to note technical faults in several of Schoener 's efforts .
" He gives me a lot of rope , " Schoener says , " and then I hang myself and then he points his finger at me . "
At Luna , Schoener became something of a vineyard hunter - chasing fruit sources for Luna 's popular Pinot Grigio .
He was named winemaker in 2002 , and finally relinquished his post at St. John 's after what had become a four - year sabbatical .
But the job was diverting Schoener from his real interest - vineyards and vines - and after two years he left .
Increasingly , Schoener was intrigued by the minimalist winemaking used for such crisp whites as Verdejo from Spain 's Rueda or Austrian Gruner Veltliner .
But his real awakening came during two visits to the Collio region of northeast Italy , near Slovenia .
Known for its almost biting white wines , the area is a hotbed of experimentalists , notably Josko Gravner , whose retrograde techniques include aging wines in clay amphorae buried in the ground ; and Stanislao Radikon , whose wines sit on their skins for months and are made without the preservative sulfur dioxide .
" It 's the only place in the world that I 've been to where white wine is king , " Schoener says .
Collio represented the very opposite the meticulous practices Schoener learned from Kongsgaard - keeping nascent wines as fresh as possible , painstakingly manipulating barrels and stirring lees .
" My inclination was to take that and push it , " he says .
Since Schoener can't always divine which techniques best highlight his intensely flavored grapes , he has a tendency to create sets of twinned wines - efforts made from the same parcel using opposing methods .
From the Farina vineyard on Sonoma Mountain , Schoener makes two Sauvignon Blancs : the Prince , exposed to air and left in barrel to mature at a pace that yields a saline tang and honeyed palate ; and La Severita di Bruto , immediately protected from air exposure and kept from evolving to be fresh and austere .
" Abe does n't know he 's being daring , " Kongsgaard says .
" He has a style that 's more advanced than most people who have been making wine for the period of time that he has . "
Vines , not winemaking , brought Schoener west .
The potential of often impractical parcels is clearly what intrigues him most , enough that he recently started another project reviving seemingly moribund vines in France 's Roussillon region .
Cultivating grapevines
His relationships with vineyards are , well , complicated - somewhere between " Anna Karenina " and " Great Expectations . "
At many sites , vines are nearing the end of their useful lives , or yield fruit in such tiny amounts that it hardly seems worthwhile .
( See " Schoelium 's sites , " Page F4 . )
Is this deliberate ?
Does he consider himself , I ask , a savior of lost soils ?
" That 's exactly something I said to myself a few years ago , " he replies .
What 's closer to the truth :
He makes a half dozen or more wines at any time , often in batches as small as 15 cases - and prices them aggressively , often at $ 50 or more per bottle .
( His entire production is still around 1,500 cases . )
These economics accommodate , if not justify , his preoccupation with difficult places .
" It would be an exaggeration to say I 'm out there saving vineyards , " he concludes .
" It 's not an obstacle , but it 's not a reason to go into the vineyard either . "
Yet Schoener lacks the usual pretense about geography .
He loves grapes from low places - sometimes literally .
His most unusual site is the Lost Slough vineyard , located below sea level outside Walnut Grove in the deep heart of the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta .
The 190 - acre parcel mostly grows fruit for large wineries - Gallo , Kendall - Jackson - but also small , if unruly , experimental plots of Verdelho and Gruner Veltliner that are meticulously picked by hand .
" It 's just the opposite of what you think of as terroir , " Schoener says .
This has been Schoener 's year of critical mass , with high - profile tastings on both coasts and deals to serve Scholium wines by the glass in such venues as New York 's Union Square Cafe .
The popularity comes after years of word - of - mouth evangelism .
High - profile buyers like former French Laundry wine director Paul Roberts ( whose first winemaking attempt , a botrytized Malbec , sits in Schoener 's winery ) drew the link between Scholium and those of Italian mavericks like Gravner , then prosetlytized to their sommelier friends .
It was a message that particularly resonated on the East Coast - with New Yorkers like Hearth 's Paul Grieco and the Tasting Room 's Colin Alevras - where fatigue over California wines was palpable .
" We did n't really push them from our end , " Mark Snyder recalls .
" It was more like : We 've got them , they 're completely unique , buyer beware . "
Suddenly , Schoener faces the mundane duty of running a real winery .
Popularity means an expectation of consistency , which means he can't change his winemaking rules each time .
He 's locking in long - term fruit contracts .
He still has no business plan - " but I at least recognize the importance of them , " he offers .
Vineyard collector
In one moment , Schoener claims he 's reached his limit on vineyards - he can't add a new one without dropping another .
" It 's like friendship , " he says .
" I do feel like I have a really good circle of friends , and I do n't need to add more . "
Yet he 's currently planning a new Verdelho from Lodi , plus a Mourvedre - based table wine from Contra Costa County that would sell for around $ 30 to attract new customers .
During a single afternoon of vineyard visits , he hands his business card to a Carignan grower in Oakley , and considers how to persuade his former boss at Luna to sell him some newly planted Tocai Friulano .
It sounds remarkably like Schoener 's experiment has borne the seeds of a real business .
Which raises one final possibility : that his effort to question the virtues of modern winemaking has become an irresistibly popular symbol of change .
" In the past few days , for the first time , I have an anxiety that I have n't had before , " he says .
" There 's a few people in the world who , if the Scholium Project went under , would miss it . "
It ’s taken some time , but here it is , the spankin new , fresh from the press Arch release , ambitiously called “ Overlord ” .
In this review , I ’ll have a look at it , and discuss a bit of the Arch philosophy in general .
Installation
So , when the new release appeared on the ftp servers today , I quickly grabbed the latest iso , burned it on a CD , popped it into the CD tray , booted up , and clicked on the “ Install Arch ” icon …
No wait , I did n’t .
What I did was booting into my existing Arch installation , ran “ pacman - Syu ” ( more on that later ) , and one minute later , my Arch was as recent as possible .
You see , a new Arch release does n’t mean as much as say , the newest Ubuntu or OpenSuse .
It ’s a Linux distribution with a rolling release model , which ideally means you install once and then never again .
New software will be in a testing repository for a while , and then transferred to the main ones .
That means that , if you update your system every day , it stays current .
If I installed “ Overlord ” , I ’d end up with the exact same system as I have now .
So then , what ’s the new release for ?
Well , every now and then , the Arch devs are good enough to provide a snapshot with all the current packages , so you do n’t have to update too much .
That ’s pretty much it .
Okay , almost it .
There are some changes to previous install CDs , but despite what the announcement says , they ’re not major , and they are n’t many ( certainly not when you compare them with an Ubuntu release ) .
They ’re just very nice .
From the announcement :
– ‘ base ’ category is always installed
– Use of UUIDs for persistent device naming
– Availability of USB disk images alongside traditional ISOs
– True live Arch installation environment
– Inclusion of the beginner ’s guide from the wiki
– Documentation updates
– Includes the current stable kernel , 2.6.25.6
The possibility to install from a USB - stick certainly will make some people happy , and the inclusion of the beginner ’s guide from the wiki even more .
See , no matter what people say , installing Arch is difficult .
Yes , I know some people wo n’t agree .
Okay , I know your girlfriend was able to install Arch from scratch .
Congrats , mine could never do it .
In fact , I could n’t even do it when I tried it about a year ago , but then again , I had tried it without reading the beginner ’s guide .
If that means I do n’t pass the girlfriends test … great ! 😉
Let me repeat , installing Arch is n’t easy .
Certainly not the first time , definitely not if you do n’t want to spend some time figuring things out , and it ’s downright impossible if you do n’t have a clear idea of what you want from your installation , or if you do n’t know what kind of hardware is in your PC ( especially graphic cards ) .
But if you do know all that , and you know what you want , and you have an afternoon off , and you have the beginner ’s guide or the official install guide near …well , it should n’t be a problem .
That ’s why I ’m thrilled with the inclusion with the guide on CD .
The Arch installer is ncurses based , which means it ’s graphical but looks like crap .
It works very well though , and asks you the same questions you get from a standard Ubuntu install , but be sure to change your keymap first if you do n’t live in the US .
It ’ll want to know where you want to install and where the swap partition is , what file system you want to use , what packages groups you want to install ( hint : all of them , that ’s easiest ) and then ask you if you want to run hwdetect .
There ’s a quote about this on the beginner ’s guide :
Advanced users who are thoroughly familiar with their hardware , required modules , and who are able to manually configure /etc/rc.conf , /etc/ mkinitcpio and /etc/ fstab , etc. from scratch may wish to choose ‘ no ’ .
( Needless to say , this option is very involved , beyond the scope of this guide , and therefore is not covered . )
To me , that means “ you ’re a noob , run hwdetect now ” .
So I did .
I must say it ’s as reliable as the hardware detection of any major Linux distributions now , and I never had any problems with it .
Then , you have to edit some files , which contain the configuration of your timezone , locale , network , processes that should be started at boot , etc .
It ’s the hardest part of the installation , but there are n’t many things you ’ll have to edit , because most of the defaults are just fine , and you do n’t have to worry about processes until later anyway .
Again , check the beginner ’s guide .
Everything you want to know is in there , and a lot of things you do n’t want to know are in there too .
Everything else is standard fare , like picking a root password , and choosing an ftp - mirror close to you .
The install itself is very fast … ten minutes or less on a decent system .
And after those ten minutes , you ’re greeted with your new , shiny , slick looking … command prompt ?
Configuration
That ’s right .
You wo n’t need the install cd any more , but there ’s a lot of tinkering left to do .
See , when you ’ve arrived at this point , you do n’t have anything even remotely resembling what most people would consider to be an operating system .
You do n’t have a user account , just root .
You do n’t have sound .
Most of all , you do n’t have a graphic environment .
You ’ll have to install and configure those yourself .
Many people would consider this a turn - off , but I think it ’s one of the biggest advantages of Arch : it ’s incredible versatility .
Sure , you ’ll spend some time getting things just right , but after you have , it ’ll be exactly what you want .
You want the newest KDE ?
No problem .
Or maybe you want XFCE with some delightful Compiz effects ?
You got it .
Or , you shudder at these screenshots , and you like something a little more sparse .
You have it .
Maybe something else ?
Gnome ?
PekWM ? XMonad ?
Awesome ?
Fluxbox ?
Openbox ?
It ’s all there , and it ’s all well - documented in the wiki .
But you ’ll have to do everything yourself , and I do mean everything .
Making sure your fonts look good .
Install and configure Alsa .
Install and configure X , and the right drivers .
Install and configure your favourite software .
It takes some time , and some effort , and much reading of the wiki , but the payback is that you end up with a system that ’s exactly as you like it .
Using Arch
So you see , the normal review criteria do n’t apply to Arch .
If you want to know what the default application for downloading torrents or burning CDs is …well , it ’s the one you choose to install .
Does it have a nice configuration center like Yast ?
Are you kidding me ?
No it does n’t !
Does it play multimedia out of the box ?
Er…no .
It does n’t do anything out of the box , except providing you with a very solid base for you to build your perfect desktop system upon .
Now , at this point you may think that Arch Linux is some kind of Linux From Scratch , where you have to do everything yourself , but that ’s not exactly true .
Arch does provide some very useful and unique features , like pacman and the wiki .
Pacman is Arch ’s package manager , and it ’s one of the best out there .
It has all the features a package - manager should have , and it ’s fast .
In my experience , faster than apt - get , much faster than any rpm package manager .
Yes , it ’s command - line only .
There are graphical front - ends like Shaman for those who are used to Synaptic or Adept , but command line is faster .
I mentioned the command “ pacman - Syu ” earlier , which is all that ’s needed to keep your system up to date .
the “ y ” refreshes your repository databases , the “ u ” upgrades your system .
For everything else , you ’ll need to consult the wiki .
Ahh , the wiki .
I once read that a distribution ’s wiki ( and not the forums ) should be the first stop for users looking for help .
In the case of Arch Linux , that ’s certainly the case .
The wiki is clear , easy to use , and huge .
If you have a problem , chances are the solution is in here .
There are other nice features , like the AUR , the repository of community - driven , unsupported packages .
It adds to the already impressive number of packages available in the official repositories .
And if that ’s not enough , there ’s always ABS , Arch ’s build system if you want to build packages yourself .
Conclusion
Basically , Arch is a do - it - yourself distro .
That ’s a totally different philosophy than the one used by Ubuntu , or OpenSuse , or Mandriva , or any other distribution that wants to provide an off - the - rack , works - for - everyone experience .
There ’s nothing wrong with that , but sometimes , despite all the effort , things do n’t work for everyone .
Most of those times , the solution is n’t very hard , but getting under the hood of those distro ’s is n’t always simple .
Arch is simple .
It ’s not easy at first , but it ’s simple …and “ simple ” has the knack of becoming “ easy ” when you ’re used to it .
After the install , you end up with a system that has everything you want it to have , but nothing more .
That means it ’s light - weight , and fast , and unique , and very easy to maintain .
After the initial hours of configuration , there ’s not much left to be done .
Upgrade the system every day .
Sit back .
Relax .
Enjoy .
I know I will .

Pit bull terriers were originally bred to be aggressive
A South African Rottweiler has helped rescue a two - year - old boy who was being mauled by a pit bull terrier .
The pit bull attacked Tshepang Taeli as he was walking with his grandmother in Oakdene , south of Johannesburg .
The dog was dragging the toddler down the road and would not let go , despite being kicked and beaten by residents .
One of the neighbours , Ricky Veludo , came to help and then went to fetch his dog , Blade .
" He fought the other dog to free the child , " he told a local paper .
" Blade is very protective , " Mr Veludo told Die Beeld newspaper .
The boy was then rushed to hospital where he is recovering from bites to his face , legs and stomach .
" I have never felt so much pain in my life .
The dog was attacking him and I was trying to release him and I could not , " the boy 's grandmother told The Star newspaper .
Police have opened an investigation into the attack .
Beyond the declines in overall violence in Iraq , several crucial measures the Bush administration uses to demonstrate economic , political and security progress are either incorrect or far more mixed than the administration has acknowledged , according to a report released Monday by the Government Accountability Office .
Over all , the report says , the American plan for a stable Iraq lacks a strategic framework that meshes with the administration ’s goals , is falling out of touch with the realities on the ground and contains serious flaws in its operational guidelines .
Newly declassified data in the report on countrywide attacks in May shows that increases in violence during March and April that were touched off by an Iraqi government assault on militias in Basra have given way to a calmer period .
Numbers of daily attacks have been comparable to those earlier in the year , representing about a 70 percent decline since June 2007 , the data shows .
While those figures confirm the assessments by American military commanders that many of the security improvements that first became apparent last fall are still holding , a number of the figures that have been used to show broader progress in Iraq are either misleading or simply incorrect , the report says .
As she screams out " I wish I had a father " while inhaling duster , I realized that this could be the title of this whole fucking show .
Honestly , I was sad that she was molested as a kid .
That is the ONLY element I felt sorry for .
Other than that , I have no heart .
I have mercifully not had a really direct experience with addiction like this so I can only really relate to one point in the episode where her sister said " All this stuff happened to me , too .
How come I do n't do this ? "
I find it hard to muster sympathy for anyone on this show .
I know it is a failing of mine and I am trying to work on it , but I was actually getting MAD when her sister was HUGGING her as the cats were taken away .
I was just like " Good , let them take the fucking cats .
Do n't comfort her .
She should feel bad about it .
That 's the point . "
I applaud all Jezebels and anyone else who has overcome addiction .
I know it is probably harder than the hardest thing I will ever have to do and it's an incredible feat .
Unfortunately , however , my sympathy is in need of improvement .
Millennium Falcon Grooms Cake
Once cake artisan Jennifer Luxmore of Sin Desserts in Providence , RI , caught sight of the Millennium Falcon cake by Charm City Cakes ( of Ace of Cakes fame ) plowing its way through the interweb tubes last week , she immediately contacted the one man whose respected position in the geeky cake community could launch her own incredible custom Star Wars cake work to the renown and fame it deserves .
And when that guy was n’t available , she got in touch with me .
As she told me about this 100 % - Certified EdibleTM “ yellow cake with chocolate ganache filling , covered in fondant with sugar paste add ons ” Millennium Falcon cake :
I just saw the Death Star and the millenium falcon that ace of cakes did , so I felt I should share one that I did last fall …..
It is as Master Yoda says , Jennifer : trust your feelings .
Share away .
It was made for a friend ’s wedding as the groom ’s cake .
After having finished all my regular work and the couples wedding cake .
I called a couple of friends , who knew the couple , to come over and help paint and do detailing as it was getting pretty late the night before the wedding !
My friend Jason Brockert is a painter so he did most of the painting on this one .
Well , cheers to Jason .
He contributed a fuggtastic amount of character and detail to the piece .
I can almost see shards of Tie Fighter wedged in the hull .
This is n’t Jennifer ’s first time crafting confectionery artwork in the form of a Millennium Falcon .
I consider this one the “ been around the universe a couple of times ” model .
I recently did another and it ’s a bit shiner …more of a “ just off the showroom floor model . ”
I personally like the “ been around the universe ” model .
Yeah , I like a model that ’s got a few miles under the hood , too .
If you know what I ’m sayin ’ .
About Star Wars cakes .
Uh. Yeah .
Some how I ’ve ended up doing a lot more of these weirder custom cakes rather than traditional wedding cakes .
When Jason gets married next year , the guys want me to do either a Death Star ( full size , well sort of ) or an AT - AT … that one ’s going to be hard !
We ’ll be looking forward to seeing more geeky goodness , Jennifer .
Thanks for getting in touch , and keep up the good work .
A report for Centrica warns prices may rise even more Consumer groups have expressed anger as British Gas owner Centrica revealed £ 5 m - per - day profits , after announcing a record price hike on Wednesday .
Centrica defended the price rise , and pointed to the high wholesale gas costs that had cut its profits by 20 % to £ 992 m during the first half of 2008 .
Energywatch said the size of Centrica 's profits and the 35 % price increase by British Gas would outrage consumers .
Age Concern warned that many pensioners would be unable to pay for winter fuel .
' Populist card '
The earnings report and anger at the planned price increase comes at a time when the UK is having to rethink the whole of its energy strategy .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Why has BG made a 35 % hike in prices when they have only taken a 20 % hit to profits ?
Mike , Chester Falling North Sea oil and gas production , coupled with record wholesale prices , have increased pressures on policymakers , companies and consumers .
Energy Minister Malcolm
Wicks told the BBC that Centrica 's results needed to be seen in context .
" I know as energy minister , we need massive investment in new energy infrastructure , power stations , " he said .
" I 'm not going to play a populist card saying profits are wrong when I know that profits are needed to invest in energy in the future to keep our lights on " .
Fuel poverty A committee of MPs recently warned that higher gas and electricity bills would have serious consequences for millions of households .
The committee was worried that the UK 's energy markets were not functioning " as efficiently as they should " .
Energy companies say they can't absorb wholesale price rises , but in light of their profits this will sound hollow
Patrick South ,
Age Concern
Record rise for British Gas bills After Centrica 's results , a group of council leaders said energy suppliers should be subjected to a £ 500 m annual charge to beat fuel poverty and cut carbon emissions .
Paul Bettision , chairman of the Local Government Association 's environment board , said : " Energy companies are making massive profits at the expense of hard working families . "
Centrica 's move to increase prices on Wednesday came after EDF Energy raised prices last week .
Analysts say other firms are likely to follow suit .
' Staggered ' Adam Scorer , Energywatch 's campaigns director , said households would be " staggered " at Centrica 's profits .
He added that customers would be outraged " to learn that while they ponder how to make ends meet , Centrica 's shareholders are enjoying an increase in their dividends " .
A lot of pension funds and people have got their savings invested in British Gas shares and we have to look after them
Sam Laidlaw ,
Centrica 's chief executive
Patrick South , Age Concern 's head of public affairs , said : " Energy companies say they can't absorb wholesale price rises , but in light of their profits this will sound hollow to the one - in - three pensioners likely to be in fuel poverty this winter . "
Centrica said the rise was justified and was needed to offset higher costs .
British Gas said it raised gas bills by 35 % to restore " reasonable profitability " .
Sam Laidlaw , Centrica 's chief executive , said : " This is a business that has got a million shareholders - a lot of pension funds and people have got their savings invested in British Gas shares and we have to look after them " .
Phil Bentley , British Gas managing director , told the BBC : " The price of gas for this winter , even though it 's fallen a little bit , it 's still double what was last year . "
Centrica said the results were " good " given the tough market conditions , and said it would raise its dividend to 3.9 pence a share from 3.35 p .
Its shares closed 3.25 pence , or 1 % , lower at 314.75 p .

What are these ?
Ninety - nine cents just does n’t go as far as it used to , and that ’s a problem for the 99 Cents Only Stores chain .
Faced with fast - rising inflation and soaring food prices , the retailer -- known for never selling anything for more than 99 cents -- is reevaluating its pricing strategy .
And that could mean breaking the $ 1 barrier for the first time in the company ’s 26 - year history .
“ There ’s no question we ’re going to need to do something , ” Chief Executive Eric Schiffer said to analysts this month after the company reported its second consecutive quarterly loss .
“ When you are part of a family that comes up with a concept , sometimes you ’re the last to admit that it needs to be changed . ”
Not surprisingly , many customers disagree .

“ That ’s just crazy .
Maybe they should start calling it the 99 Cents and Up store , ” said Kleshia Pittmon , 23 , while buying groceries recently at a 99 Cents Only near USC .
“ I would not shop here anymore . ”
99 Cents Only , founded in 1982 by Chairman David Gold , pioneered the single - price retail concept .
The City of Commerce - based chain opened its first store in Los Angeles and has since expanded to 277 locations , mostly in California but also in Nevada , Arizona and Texas .
The deep - discount retailer sells groceries , household supplies and health and beauty products , and remains one of the few true “ dollar ” stores .
At discount chain Dollar General of Goodlettsville , Tenn. , for instance , current promotions include $ 8 backpacks and $ 2 for a box of Ziploc sandwich bags .
Family Dollar Stores , a chain of more than 6,500 discount stores , is advertising Glad trash bags for $ 4.99 and Huggies diapers for $ 9.99 .

In fact , keeping prices at a buck or less was never part of the overall pricing scheme at Family Dollar , said Josh Braverman , a spokesman for the Matthews , N.C. - based company .
“ We try to keep our prices as low as possible , ” he said .
But “ it ’s hard to imagine getting anything for a dollar . ”
99 Cents
Only is able to offer such low prices because of a business model that is “ not based on having every single variety of every product out there , ” said President Jeff Gold , who is the chairman ’s son and the CEO ’s brother - in - law .
The chain often buys closeout or overstock items from suppliers and changes its offerings to reflect market prices and availability , he said .
But lately , the company just ca n’t get a wide - or attractive - enough selection of goods that it can turn around and sell for such a low price , Gold said .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ inflation calculator , 99 cents in 1982 has the same buying power as $ 2.26 in 2008 .

Those challenges led Schiffer to tell analysts in a conference call this month that a price hike possibility was “ definitely on the table . ”
He said the chain was looking at experimenting with its prices but had n’t set a timeline for implementing any changes .
“ Finally management has started to think outside the box , ” said Joan Storms , an analyst who follows the chain for Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles .
“ Some relief on the 99 - cent price point will provide more stability for their business . ”
By capping prices at 99 cents plus tax , the chain has had to play around with the quantity and size of its goods , which can confuse customers , she said .
For example , when eggs became too expensive , 99 Cents
Only temporarily began offering six - packs instead of a dozen to keep prices under a dollar .
The company also reduced the size of its milk cartons and stopped selling items such as peanut butter and cooking oil on a regular basis .

“ What ’s the point -- why not sell a standard size and price it accordingly ? ”
Storms said .
Over the years , 99 Cents
Only has made some changes to its pricing model .
At first , the chain sold every item for 99 cents or groups of items for a total of 99 cents .
Last year it added “ variable pricing , ” meaning products were sold at different prices -- which , of course , did n’t exceed 99 cents .
But selling items for a dollar or more is another matter for the company , where the number 99 has become a source of pride .
On its website , the chain boasts , “ Still nothing over 99 cents , ever ! ” and says its stores are open until “ 9 p.m. , nine days a week . ”

The company even does 99 - cent - themed promotions , such as selling iPod Nanos for 99 cents to the first nine customers in line at the recent grand opening of its Redondo Beach store ( the next 99 customers could purchase a scooter for 99 cents ) .
“ The number 99 is a magic number -- deviating from that is something we absolutely are not taking lightly , ” said Jeff Gold , who began working for the company when he was 14 .
“ I find significant discomfort emotionally about considering making the change . ”
He added that the company had n’t decided whether to change its name if prices were raised .
But other discount chains have weathered price increases without adopting new names .
When Motel 6 opened in 1962 , it cost $ 6 to rent a room for a night .
Today , rooms start at $ 29.99 , but the company has stuck with its easy - to - recognize name .
Advertisement
“ People get used to it , ” said Laura Rojo - Eddy , a spokeswoman for Motel 6 , which has more than 900 locations .
“ Even though the price is no longer $ 6 , we ’ve maintained the positioning of the brand , which is to have the lowest price of any national chain . ”
For DJ Thergood , who was picking up snack items at a 99 Cents Only in Silver Lake recently , the retailer ’s potential price increase “ always seemed like it was inevitable . ”
Still , you know the economy is hurting “ when things at the 99 - cent store cost $ 2 , ” said Thergood , 32 , an Echo Park artist .
Linda Harris , a high school teacher who was shopping Tuesday at a 99 Cents Only in Montebello , was less bothered .

“ I ’d rather see them raise the prices on things I want to buy rather than stock lower - quality items , ” Harris , 58 , said .
To keep customers from balking , 99 Cents Only would need to communicate price changes “ in a way that does n’t feel disingenuous , ” said Marshal Cohen , chief industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group .
“ If they market it and position it right , they can do it as , ‘ This is for you , ’ ” Cohen said .
“ They can wean customers in on the concept . ”
One benefit of increased prices , he said , would be a wider array of products , making 99 Cents Only more of a one - stop shop .
With prices as they are , customers still have to go to grocery stores and other retailers to get products that simply ca n’t be priced at 99 cents or less .

“ There are a lot more products that fit outside a dollar than inside a dollar , ” Cohen said .
“ They ’ve got to recognize that they need to raise the bar . ”
The chain might have no choice : Despite hard economic times that are driving many consumers to scale back their spending and look for bargains , 99 Cents Only this month reported a loss of $ 1.5 million , or 2 cents a share , for the fiscal first quarter that ended June 28 .
For now , those abundant 99 - cent deals can still be had .
But Jeff
Gold said although that concept had worked well for the last 26 years , going forward “ we have to be focused on what ’s going to be best for our company and our customers . ”
“ I think people realize that times are changing , ” he said .
“ As long as we continue to provide great value in a good shopping environment , I think that we ’ll be doing right by our customers . ”

Based on prices at the 99 Cents Only store at 6121 Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles on Tuesday .
Sources connected with the Heath Ledger investigation say the Drug Enforcement Administration set a new low for starf ** king .
People who have talked to TMZ off the record are now willing to go on record -- still anonymously -- about one of the most bizarre DEA power grabs ever .
How 's this for starters ... no one we 've spoken with connected with the case can point to a single DEA case where a massive investigation was launched over an accidental death in which no criminality was even hinted at .
We know the DEA went all over the country , in one case tracking down a guy in California who smoked a joint with Ledger in the '90s , telling him he had to testify in a Grand Jury probe .
And how 's this for chutzpah ... the DEA told the guy he would have to pay his own way to NYC to testify before the Grand Jury !
In another case , the DEA was nosing around a film set in Arizona looking for people who had information about possible Ledger drug connections .
We know the NYPD was furious at the DEA for making an immediate power grab to control what should have been a simple case .
NYPD cops felt " humiliated " by what one source called " utter disrespect " on the part of the DEA .

Believe it or not , we finally had to threaten a sit-in .
After more than two months of trying to schedule a brief meeting with Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) to deliver VFP ’s 23,000 impeachment signatures , we politely informed the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee , in writing , that we would drop by his Washington office with them .
And we would sit there until he met with us or hauled us off in handcuffs .
On June 10 VFP issued a news release explaining our intention to call on Conyers the following day .
Coincidentally (! ) the morning of the 11th , his scheduler called asking , “ I hear you ’re in town today , would you like to meet with the Congressman ? ”
In the 1930 ’s , who in Germany could correctly fix the day when fascism actually arrived ?
Today in the U.S. , who knows for sure how close we ’ve come to it ?
The human race learns slowly , but we do learn .
For example , as VFP members we ’ve learned that war is not the answer .
And in these perilous times more of our fellow citizens are learning that the “ Good German ” excuse just does n’t get it .
We know what our government is doing abroad .
We know that our republic here at home has been beaten nearly unto death .
We know we are the responsible parties who must set things right here at home – for our children , for the world .
One important way to begin absolving our complicity and discharging our responsibilities is to hold our malfeasant misleaders in Washington accountable through the way the Constitution provides – impeachment .
When we met with Congressman Conyers on June 11 ( link to video 2 minute of that meeting ) he said he had not yet read the 35 Articles of Impeachment Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) had introduced two days previously , but that he would do so and report back at a meeting in early July .
A second meeting was held , with even more VFP members attending , on July 9th ( link to 9 minute video of that meeting , and link to 45 minute video ) at which Conyers said he was still trying to make up his mind whether to call impeachment hearings in his committee .
He said he needs more support in Congress !
Yet another meeting is scheduled with VFP for July 25th .
The platoon of VFP members who attended the meeting say if he says he needs more support in Congress – we will give it to him .
Then there will be no more excuses .
We need your help to create this impeachment buzz on the Hill .
The Army used to tell us that it took 21 soldiers to keep each one of us grunts fighting in the field – providing us with our life support , from ammunition , to fire support , to medevac .
Today a platoon of us is working in Wash , DC on impeachment ; we can do it together but we need your support – raise your voice until Congress hears you .
JOIN THE ACTIONS :
Let us know if you took action !
Respond to this email at [ email protected ] and let us know how your phone call went !
FOR JUST NEXT 7 CRITICAL DAYS CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN AND DEMAND IMPEACHMENT .
If they are for impeachment have them push the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Rep Conyers , to act now .
We need as many calls , emails and letters as possible before July 25th .
GET YOUR FRIENDS AND NEGHBORS TO CALL .
If you are able come to Washington , DC , July 24th will be an impeachment lobbying day where we will personally visit Congressmen demanding impeachment .
On July 25th we will attend a Judiciary Committee Hearing , and then meet with Rep. Conyers .
CALL 202-224-3121 for the house switchboard and LEAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOUR OWN CONGRESSMAN TO IMPEACH .
Find your Congressman by ZIP Code
Call a member of the Judiciary Committee ( 202-225-3951 ) demand impeachment now .
( List of Judiciary Committee members ) Maybe your Congressman is on the Judiciary Committee call him again .
For our 4,118 KIAS , and the more than one million Iraqis killed by the Administration ’s lying & murderous policies , GET UP , & CALL CONGRESS !
Elliott Adams
President
PS : Here is a link to a memo I got from David Swanson , one of the most knowledgeable leaders of the impeachment movement , explaining what Congress members could do if they are seriously interested in preserving the rule of law and what is left of our republic .

The UK population is projected to become the largest in the EU The UK population is set to become the largest in the European Union , according to a report .
It is expected to increase from its current figure of 61 million to almost 77 million in 2060 - a rise of 25 % .
This would make it the largest population in the EU , ahead of the projections for France ( 72 million ) and Germany ( 71 million ) .
The EU 's statistical office Eurostat also predicts the EU population will be 506 m in 2060 , up from 495 m in 2008 .
It is expected to peak at 521 m in 2035 but then decline .
The report predicts the average age of the EU population will rise , due to " persistently low fertility and an increasing number of survivors to higher ages " .
The proportion of the population aged 65 or above in the UK is projected to reach 24.7 % in 2060 , from 16.1 % in 2008 .
The number of Britons aged 80 or above is expected to reach 9 % in 2060 , compared with the current figure of 4.5 % .
If the projection is correct , 42.1 % of the UK 's population would be above retirement age - that proportion is currently 24.3 % .
Ahead of the UK , the largest population growth within the EU is expected in Cyprus ( +66 % ) , the Irish Republic ( +53 % ) , Luxembourg ( +52 % ) .
A Home Office spokesman said : " Projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake - up to the immigration system for a generation .
" Centre - stage is our new Australian - style points - based system , which means only those we need can come here to work or study . "
Strategy call Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said the figures showed it was " essential we develop a coherent strategy to deal with population growth " .
He added : " This strategy must bring together policy on issues from the family to border control , housing to skills and planning to immigration control .
" We not only need to ensure that our population grows at a more sustainable rate but that we also prepare properly for that sustainable rate of growth .
" The government have shown that they have no answers to the challenges we face by failing to plan for our increasing population - this makes them part of the problem , not the solution . "
Alasdair Murray , director of think tank CentreForum , said the projection should not be considered a certainty .
He said : " Population statistics are predicted by using recent figures so this report will have used the statistics of immigration in the UK in the last few years .
The level is high so the prediction will be high .
" There are signs that immigration in this country is starting to tail off .
If you were to do this again in 2010 or 2011 I think it would be different .
" A more realistic assessment would be to consider the two factors of birth rates and immigration rates together when predicting population . "

What are these ?
Thank you , George W. Bush /
Without your dark and spectacular failures , we would n't be so ready to leap forward .
Kudos !
And then it came to pass that I happened to catch the tail end of a recent episode of " Miami Ink , " that odd little reality show on TLC about the trials and tribulations of an unabashedly macho but still adorably funky Florida tattoo shop offering all sorts of engaging quirks , especially if you harbor a mild appreciation for decent Koi fish tattoos and giant ridiculous motorcycles and lots of sweaty siliconed sun baked Miami cheese .
This episode featured the story of a young , fresh - faced Iraqi War vet , a big , shy sweetheart of a kid who , it turns out , had both of his legs blown off at the knee by an improvised explosive device .
As a commemoration , he came to the shop to get a giant flaming skull tattooed on his shoulder — a skull with , um , a couple of femur bones stuck in there , somehow , in honor of his former appendages .
Well , OK .
I hereby shall not question the kid 's garish taste in body art .
But in the process of describing his injury to the artist / camera , the guy said something rather startling , something I did n't quite expect , considering his young age and his lack of legs and the violence with which they were taken from him , even though it 's a refrain we 've all heard a million times before .
In sum , he said , You know what ?
Despite the horror of it , despite the brutal war , it turns out getting my legs blown off was probably the best thing to ever happen to me .
It made me appreciate life in a new way , discover new abilities , experience a new vitality .
In fact , only through getting my legs blown off do I finally feel truly alive , and what 's more , I actually feel sorry for people who do n't get to experience life this way .
That 's what he said .
More or less .
Now , I do n't always agree with this line of thinking .
In fact , I outwardly reject the idea that it 's only through trauma , through pain or suffering that you truly grow or learn , find your creative thrust or the " true " meaning of life .
It 's certainly one way , it 's certainly often wildly effective , it 's certainly the way it has to happen for some people before they finally wake up , but it 's far from the only way .
But then , as I 'm watching footage of this kid waterskiing and climbing mountains and grinning like crazy on his skinny metal prosthetics , I realized , well now , what an absolutely perfect analogy for our mauled , tattered , shell - shocked nation at this very moment in time .
Ain't it so ?
Because America has , figuratively speaking , had its legs blown off at the knee .
We have been hobbled and traumatized and numbed , our once indestructible ego ripped away , had our entire moral and ethical infrastructure blasted out from under us in the most bloody and irresponsible and ignoble way possible .
And the primary explosive that did it ?
A deadly and useless war .
Wait , that 's not quite right .
It was the inept leaders and disastrous reasoning behind the war , the pathetic cadre of hawks and neocons and insular kill - 'em - all demagogues in the Bush Administration who veered the nation so far off course we ended up in a bloody ditch just outside Purgatory , a place teeming with recession and torture and homophobia , Patriot Acts and surveillance and fear .
And so , like this kid who actually thanked the fates for blowing his legs off , I 'm here to suggest that maybe it 's time we offered up some sort of warped , tentative thanks to George W. Bush , for all the appalling trauma he hath wreaked upon us .
Maybe he is , in a slightly nauseating way , the best thing that ever happened to us .
You think ?
Maybe he 's exactly what we needed .
Maybe Bush 's brand of frighteningly inept politicking has been just the right kind of sociocultural emetic to induce a true purge of our congested system , just the thing to finally snap us out of our lethargy .
Hell , sometimes you gotta go deep into the darkness to realize just how much you need the light .
So thank you , George , for exemplifying and embodying everything that 's wrong with the neocon agenda , for serving as the final death knell of the failed conservative movement , of a once - noble Republican Party that 's run out of ideas and has turned bitter and nasty and paranoid .
Thank you , Dubya , for setting the stage for Obama and Hillary .
Because the truth is , even as recently as eight years ago , if you 'd have asked if we as a nation would be anywhere near ready for a female or black president , it would have felt incredibly premature , a good 20 years off before we could entertain such an idea .
But so potent has been the recoil against everything you stood for — the misogyny , homophobia , classism , fear of " the other , " of foreigners and minorities and alternative beliefs — that we are ready to be inspired and reinvigorated sooner than anyone thought possible .
Thank you for your embarrassing rejection of science , your refusal to support any climate change initiative , for furthering the war - for - oil agenda , for blocking stem - cell research , for serving all your masters in Big Energy , Big Agribusiness , Big Oil , Big Pharma , Big Auto .
Thanks for gutting the Constitution and front - loading the courts and trying to hack away at women 's rights , gay marriage , privacy rights and on and on .
Because it turns out , inviting all that darkness and corruption and holding back all the energy of progress and change is less about hastening the Second Coming ( sorry , better luck next time ) , and more like pulling back on a slingshot .
It just gets tighter and tighter and the pressure builds until eventually you just gotta let go , and then boom — or I should say , Obama .
Now , this is not to say it can't all happen again .
History is , unfortunately , a very bitchy and unreliable teacher .
I 'm guessing there were plenty of people who , post - Nixon , were saying , well thank God we 'll never go through that again , we 've sure learned our lesson .
I mean , fool me once shame on you , fool me twice and , um , fool me ... wo n't get fooled again .
We 'll just have to see .
For now , the bleeding is slowing , we are finally getting up off the sickbed , testing our shiny new prosthetics , hobbling toward the new .
Soon , maybe we 'll learn to run , ski , climb mountains , even dance on the international stage again with something resembling grace and renewed self - respect .
We might even say , you know what ?
It turns out getting our political , moral and spiritual legs blown off was the best thing that ever happened to us .
Dubya actually did us a huge favor .
Can you imagine ?

WASHINGTON , Aug. 4 — A former White House policy adviser , who was arrested in March and charged with multiple counts of shoplifting , pleaded guilty Friday to a single count , in a plea agreement under which he will pay a fine and make partial restitution but will avoid having a criminal record if he completes probation successfully .
The former official , Claude A. Allen , was initially charged with stealing more than $ 5,000 of merchandise from Target and other retailers in a fraudulent - return scheme .
At the time , Mr. Allen denied the charges through his lawyer and said there had been a mix - up concerning his credit card .
The accusations included at least 25 efforts to collect refunds on goods he never bought .
By pleading guilty in Montgomery County Circuit Court in suburban Maryland , Mr. Allen , 45 , avoided the maximum sentence of 18 years in prison .
Instead , Judge Eric Johnson ordered that he serve two years of supervised probation , perform 40 hours of community service , pay a $ 500 fine and make restitution of $ 850 to the Target Corporation .
With no conviction on his record , he would be permitted to resume practicing law .
In his guilty plea , Mr. Allen admitted to stealing a Kodak printer valued at about $ 235 .
In a short statement he made before the judge , Mr. Allen offered no explanation for stealing the printer , but he expressed “ deep remorse ” for his unlawful actions and broke down emotionally and wept .
MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif . --
As enterprises move more heavily into virtualization , they will have to overhaul their data backup and disaster recovery strategies because these wo n't apply so well to the new virtualized world .
That 's the case Deepak Mohan , senior vice president of Symantec 's ( NASDAQ : SYMC ) data protection group , made in a press briefing here at the company 's offices where he discussed its strategies for disaster recovery , high availability and data protection .
What the Obama campaign has lost sight of , I think , and what it needs to regain control of , is the essential message of his candidacy .
After the last eight years , we simply cannot risk a continuation of the same reckless , belligerent , argument - losing , ideological and deceptive foreign policy of the current crew .
The damage that neoconservatism has done to America , to the Middle East , to democratic norms , to Israel 's security , to civilized values and fiscal sanity is immense and deep .
From his knee - jerk COld War posture over Georgia to his Rovian campaign tactics , McCain is simply too close to this disastrous record to contemplate .
McCain 's trigger - happy temperament , shallow understanding of the complexities and passion for military force as the answer to everything is the bigger risk .
He is a recipe for more , wider and far more destructive warfare :

Washington , DC , July 17 , 2008 --
With the Bush regime sending a top State Department diplomat to sit down with Iranian officials , with signs that the US departure from Iraq may now be accelerated , and with Israel beginning to make deals with Hezbollah , some observers in this capital are beginning to celebrate Peace in Our Time in an outburst of midsummer euphoria .
But this perspective is an illusion : the United States and NATO now escalating the hopeless and unwinnable Afghan war , and is preparing to send US and NATO forces on the ground to seize parts of Pakistan , a country which is almost 3 times more populous than Iran , and possesses a nuclear arsenal and the means to deliver it .
The Bush - Cheney - neocon era in foreign policy is over , and the Brzezinski - Trilateral - Rockefeller - Soros phase of aggression has begun ; the US hit list now features Chinese allies like Sudan , Zimbabwe , and Pakistan .
Brzezinski is striving to put together some huge provocation for the Beijing Olympics , to make the Chinese government lose face and begin disintegrating .
The ultimate targets of the new Obama - Brzezinski foreign policy are Russia , China , and the other members and friends of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , the main pole of resistance in the world to the designs of Washington and London .
The stakes are now much higher than a mere conventional clash in the Persian Gulf .
Brzezinski's adventurism goes far beyond that of the neocons , and objectively places the danger of a thermonuclear exchange on the world agenda .
Watch for the Polish - Czech - Lithuanian missile crisis , a Balkan crisis , and a crisis between Georgia and Russia to point the world in this ominous new direction .
The US government is now being run by the Principals ' Committee , an interagency cabal that includes Defense Secretary Gates , Secretary Of State Rice , Joint Chiefs Chairman Mullen , Secretary of the Treasury Paulson , and other operatives of the Trilateral Wall Street financier faction .
It is clear that under the new policy , Iran will be able to continue to process uranium : ' The Bush administration 's decision to send a senior American official to participate in international talks with " More news and information about Iran . "
Iran this weekend reflects a double policy shift in the struggle to resolve the impasse over the country 's nuclear program .
First , the Bush administration has decided to abandon its longstanding position that it would meet face to face with Iran only after that country suspended its uranium enrichment , as demanded by the " More articles about Security Council , U.N. " United Nations Security Council .
Second , an American partner at the table injects new importance to the negotiating track of the six global powers confronting Iran - France , Britain , Germany , Russia , China and the United States - even though their official stance is that no substantive talks can begin until uranium enrichment stops .
The increased engagement raised questions of whether the Bush administration would alter its stance toward Iran as radically as it did with North Korea , risking a fresh schism with conservatives who have accused the White House of granting concessions to so - called rogue states without extracting enough in return . '
( New York Times , July 17 , 2008 ) This gambit of appeasing Iran is being done in the hopes of turning Iran against Russia and China ­ a project of incalculable folly .
Brzezinski is glad to see the Iranians have nukes , because he thinks he can keep them , pointed at Moscow .
At the same time , US and NATO forces are getting ready for a large - scale invasionof Pakistan , with the excuse of catching the phantomatic Bin Laden .
The real goal is to so humiliate and discredit the current US puppet regime in Pakistan that the country will descend intom civilwar and split apart , destroying a key Chinese ally in the proicess .
The timetable is short : ' ISLAMABAD , July 13 ( Reuters ) - The Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , visited Pakistan on the weekend , fueling speculation that the United States was about to take action against militants in northwest Pakistan . '
Even troops of other NATO states are getting ready to attack Pakistan : ' KABUL , July 16 ( Reuters ) - NATO forces in Afghanistan hit targets inside Pakistan with artillery and attack helicopters after coming under rocket fire from across the border , the alliance said on Wednesday .
Tension is high along the border with a sharp rise in attacks in eastern Afghanistan coming from inside Pakistan that Afghan and NATO officials blame on de-facto ceasefires between the Pakistani military and militants in its lawless tribal belt .
( Reuters North American News Service , July 16 , 2008 )
All of which goes to show that Brzezinski is mad as a hatter .
THE BRZEZINSKI - OBAMA PLAN FOR RUSSIA
Groaning under the weight of two lost wars , the terminal crisis of the US dollar , banking panic , and hyperinflation , the US ruling elite is attempting to unify itself around Obama for a breathtaking reversal of their entire strategic and ideological field .
The intent is to largely jettison the post - 9/11 enemy image of Islamic terrorism and the focus on the Middle East , and to shift target to Russia , China , and their allies in a vast global showdown or planetary end game for which Trilateral asset Obama is supposed to be the figurehead .
As outlined by the cold warrior and Russia - hater Brzezinski , the first phase is to eject the Chinese from Africa , cutting off their access to oil and raw materials , and thus sabotaging their current rapid industrial development .
All of Africa is rapidly becoming a battlefield of the US against the Chinese , and Obama is the ideal front man for this .
Chinese allies like Sudan and Zimbabwe , and also Pakistan and Burma , are all being targeted as part of this plan .
With Iran and Syria , the effort will not to attack them , but to turn them against Russia and China .
This Brzezinski design is why Obama says he wants to negotiate with Iran , but bomb Pakistan .
China is being weakened and destabilized by the Tibetan insurrection and other operations , and Zbig would like to stage a large - scale incident under the cover of the summer Olympics .
In the final stage , Zbig thinks he can drive the oil - starved Chinese in on Russia 's provinces of eastern Siberia , where there is much oil and few Russians .
Obama is thus the bearer of a plan for Sino - Russian World War III that far surpasses the insanity of the neocons .
Since Russia and China are both well aware of the Brzezinski plan , this entire lunatic project is sure to blow up in our faces , with cataclysmic results .
The Iraq war will seem a tea party by comparison .
The main grounds for aggression in the new phase will be humanitarian and human rights claims , not terrorism , so as to maximize left cover .
The Bin Laden pretext is now mainly for Afghanistan - Pakistan , where the existing war is being expanded and re-directed to fit the new policy .
OBAMA ESCALATES AFGHANISTAN , ATTACKS PAKISTAN
An example of the heightened aggressiveness that could be expected under the Brzezinski plan was the question of unilateral US bombing of Pakistan .
Not a few observers spent the first half of 2008 worrying about an imminent attack on Iran .
The reality was that the growing power of the Brzezinski faction in Washington made such an attack less and less likely , at least as far as the United States and the United Kingdom were concerned .
But these same observers were largely blind to a program of systematic aggression being carried out by the United States and the British against Pakistan , a country that was almost 3 times larger than Iran , and became equipped with nuclear weapons and medium - range ballistic missiles to deliver them .
Every gust of wind in the Persian Gulf was considered a harbinger of Armageddon , but the constant bombing raids in the northwest regions of Pakistan were considered a matter of scant importance .
The irony was that the bombing attacks on Pakistan had been demanded by none other than Obama .
Speaking indeed the July 2008 Democratic candidates ' debate held in Chicago , Obama had stated : ' what I said was that we have to refocus , get out of Iraq , make certain that we are helping Pakistan deal with the problem of al Qaeda in the hills between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
But , if we have actionable intelligence on al Qaeda operatives , including bin Laden , and President Musharraf cannot act , then we should .
Now , I think that 's just common sense .
I do n't know about you , but for us to authorize -- ( cheers , applause ) -- ( inaudible ) --.'
Senator Clinton had disagreed with this reckless and unilateral approach .
Senator Dodd had joined Clinton in criticizing Obama .
Senator McCain had scored Obama for making such a reckless and incendiary proposal .
Even Bush himself stated that he intended to work closely with President Musharraf in regard to all operations conducted by the United States on Pakistani territory .
Since the tenant of the White House had ruled out the unilateral bombing of Pakistan which Obama had demanded , the matter appeared to be closed .
Jake Tapper of ABC
News found it striking that Obama , who was posing as the peace candidate for Iraq , should be so aggressive in regard to Pakistan .
Tapper showed that Obama was raising the issue on the campaign trail , quoting him .
'" I understand that President Musharraf has his own challenges , " Obama said , " but let me make this clear .
There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans .
They are plotting to strike again .
It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al Qaeda leadership meeting in 2005 .
If we have actionable intelligence about high - value terrorist targets and President Musharraf wo n't act , we will . "
There it was again : unilateral US bombing of a sovereign state that had nuclear weapons .
Tapper commented : ' In many ways , the speech is counterintuitive ; Obama , one of the more liberal candidates in the race , is proposing a geopolitical posture that is more aggressive than that of President Bush . '
( Jake Tapper , ' Presidential Candidate Pushes Aggressive Stance Toward Pakistan , ' ABC News , August 1 , 2007 )
In other words , when it came to Pakistan , Obama was a bigger warmonger and any Republican or Democrat in sight , including Bush and McCain , to say nothing of Clinton .
Astoundingly , the power of Brzezinski in Washington grew so rapidly that Obama was destined to prevail over Bush , the alleged president , imposing his policy instead of the announced intentions of the man who kept calling himself the president of the United States .
Late in March 2008 , a press account revealed that the US had indeed gone over to unilaterally bombing northwest Pakistan : ' The United States has escalated its unilateral strikes against al - Qaeda members and fighters operating in " Pakistan 's tribal areas , partly because of anxieties that Pakistan 's new leaders will insist on scaling back military operations in that country , according to U.S. officials .
" We have always said that as for strikes , that is for Pakistani forces to do and for the Pakistani government to decide .
. . .
We do not envision a situation in which foreigners will enter Pakistan and chase targets , " said Farhatullah Babar , a top spokesman for the " Pakistan People 's Party , whose leader , Yousaf Raza Gillani , is the new prime minister .
" This war on terror is our war . "
But Kamran Bokhari , a Pakistani who directs Middle East analysis for Strategic Forecasting , a private intelligence group in Washington , said the new government will almost certainly take a harder line against such strikes .
" These . . . are very unpopular , not because people support al - Qaeda , but because they feel Pakistan has no sovereignty , " he said .
The latest Predator strike , on March 16 , killed about 20 in Shahnawaz Kot ; a Feb. 28 strike killed 12 foreign militants in the village of Kaloosha ; and a Jan. 29 strike killed 13 people , including senior al - Qaeda commander Abu Laith al - Libi , in North Waziristan .
( Robin Wright and Joby Warrick , : US Steps Up Unilateral Strikes in Pakistan , " Washington Post , March 27 , 2008 ) Soon it became clear that this was a systematic US bombing campaign and represented a scandal as big in its own way as the Nixon - Kissinger secret bombing of Cambodia back in the early 1970s .
This is no hyperbole ; we must simply remember that a nuclear power , and not some banana republic , is being attacked !
The US bombing campaign was being conducted with wild and reckless abandon , and members of Pakistani paramilitary formations were getting killed : ' Pakistan is condemning a " Pakistan : US airstrikes kill 11 border troops " U.S. air strike which allegedly killed 11 Pakistani paramilitaries as a " completely unprovoked and cowardly act . "
U.S. - led forces killed Pakistani troops in an air strike along the volatile Afghan border that Pakistan 's army condemned on Wednesday as " completely unprovoked and cowardly . "
U.S. officials confirmed that three aircraft launched about a dozen bombs following a clash between Taliban militants and Afghan and U.S. - led coalition forces late Tuesday .
Pakistan says the strikes killed 11 of its paramilitary troops .
The Pakistani army said the air strike hit a post of the paramilitary Frontier Corps in the Mohmand tribal region and was a " completely unprovoked and cowardly act . "
It launched a strong protest and reserved " the right to protect our citizens and soldiers against aggression , " the military said in a statement .
The statement said the clash " had hit at the very basis of cooperation " between the allies in the war on terror . '
The Pakistani government was now the one elected in the elections conducted after the death of Benazir Bhutto in December 2007 .
This was supposedly the regime the US had wanted to install , but Brzezinski was doing everything possible to humiliate , mortified , and thoroughly antagonize the new government in Islamabad .
' The Frontier Post of Pakistan reported : ' On June 10 , 2008 US - led coalition forces along the Afghan border launched an air strike on a Frontier Corps Sheikh Baba border post in the mountainous Gora Prai region in Mohmand Agency .
11 Pakistani paramilitary troops including one major , 10 civilian killed and several injured .
The incident took place inside Pakistan , near the border with Afghanistan .
Pentagon confirmed that coordinated artillery and air strikes was carried out .
On Jun 11 2008 , Prime Minister Gilani condemned the deaths , telling parliament : " We will take a stand for the sake of this country 's sovereignty , for the sake of its dignity and self - respect " .
He further revealed that " We do not allow our territory to be used .
We completely condemn this , and will take it up through the foreign office . " ( " NATO 's Senseless Aggressiveness in FATA , " Frontier Post )
By early July 2008 , the US was making preparations to escalate : ' US commandos are reportedly poised to launch raids against al - Qa'ida and Taliban targets in Pakistan as Washington moves an aircraft carrier into the Arabian Sea .
The redeployment of the Abraham Lincoln and its escort vessels from the Gulf yesterday came after US military intelligence officials recorded an increase in the number of foreign fighters travelling to Pakistan 's tribal areas to join with militants . '
What is Brzezinski doing ?
He is obviously using the absurd pretext of bin Laden , Al Qaeda , and the Taliban in order to destroy the central government of Pakistan , and promote civil war , Balkanization , partitioning , and subdivision in that country .
The goal is evidently the division of Pakistan into three or four or five petty states , including such areas as Sind , Pushtunistan , Baluchistan , Waziristan , and so forth .
This operation has nothing whatsoever to do with bin Laden , Al Qaeda , the Taliban , or the " global war on terror , " but had everything to do with the fact that Pakistan was a traditional Chinese ally and economic and trading partner .
Pakistan had to be destroyed as part of the Brzezinski strategy to strip China of all of allies , and promote the isolation and encirclement of the Middle Kingdom .
Northwest Pakistan is one of the very few parts of the world where the US continued to rely on the bin Laden - Al Qaeda myth to justify its policy .
Elsewhere , pretexts and cover stories about humanitarian intervention and human rights , and nuclear non-proliferation , are on the front burner .
GOP LAMENTS : LAME DUCK BUSH REDUCED TO CHILD'S PLAY
In the late spring and early summer of 2008 , it is clear that Bush , Cheney , and the neocons had indeed lost power to Brzezinski and company .
Bush and Cheney appear to have about as much power as the White House janitor or the groundskeeper at the Naval Observatory .
Bush and Cheney are variously described as finished , washed up , lame ducks , figureheads , and kaput .
Some Republicans were becoming concerned that Bush had lapsed into a figurehead - lame - duck status , and impotence and passivity so extreme that they might become a negative factor for McCain in the upcoming election .
One columnist noted : ' Some of President Bush 's allies tell the Political Bulletin they are embarrassed and angry that the White House seems to be wasting Bush 's time on frivolous events when much of the country is suffering through economic hard times .
" Look at the schedule for Monday , " says an outside Bush adviser .
" A highlight of his day was witnessing a tee ball game .
...
He is being reduced to child 's play . "
The adviser says Bush also signed a supplemental appropriations bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on Monday , but he adds that it did n't get much coverage and that the tee ball game set the wrong tone .
There is growing concern among Bush allies that the Democrats will effectively portray the President and GOP candidate John McCain as out of touch .
Some GOP insiders now predict that the Republicans will lose at least five seats in the Senate and 15 to 20 in the House , and it could get worse if gasoline prices continue to soar and the public remains in a disgruntled mood . '
RICE HUMILIATES CHENEY WITH NORTH KOREA DEAL Another leading symptom of this loss of power by Bush and Cheney is the announcement by Secretary of State Rice , another member of the Principals '
Committee , that a deal has been reached with North Korea concerning the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons program , in exchange for which the United States had pledged to remove North Korea from the State Department list of terrorist states .
The remaining neocons were apoplectic to the point of foaming at the mouth .
The British press revealed that the diehard Cheney had fought tooth and nail to block this deal , but had been vanquished by Rice -- and thus by the superior power of the Principals '
Committee , in our view : ' Vice President Dick Cheney fought furiously to block efforts by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to strike a controversial US compromise deal with North Korea over the communist state 's nuclear program Mr Cheney was so angry about the decision to remove North Korea from the terrorism blacklist and lift some sanctions that he abruptly curtailed a meeting with visiting US foreign experts when asked about it in the White House last week , according to the New York Times " I 'm not going to be the one to announce this decision .
You need to address your interest in this to the State Department , " he reportedly said before leaving the room .
" The exchanges between Cheney 's office and Rice 's people at State got very testy .
But ultimately Condi had the President 's ear and persuaded him that his legacy would be stronger if they reached a deal with Pyongyang , " said a Pentagon adviser who was briefed on the battle .
Top neocon John Bolton was beside himself with rage , and saw this deal with the DPRK as a harbinger of the final neocon Götterdämmerung : ' " It 's shameful , " said John Bolton , Bush 's former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .
" This represents the final collapse of Bush 's foreign policy . " ( CBS - AP , June 26 , 2008 )
The mood of his fellow neocon Richard Perle was equally apocalyptic : '" Usually the word ' meltdown ' applies to a nuclear reactor .
In this case it applies to Bush administration diplomacy which once aimed to halt the North Korean program and has now become an abject failure , " Richard Perle , chairman of the Pentagon defense policy board in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq invasion , told the Telegraph . '
( Daily Telegraph , June 28 , 2008 ) Both Bolton and Perel , for once , have it right .
Brzezinski and his tool Rice are running the show .
MULLEN WARNS ISRAELIS : DON'T ATTACK IRAN
At the same time , a pattern of intense diplomatic activity has emerged across the Middle East , even as the Israeli politician Shaul Mofaz was threatening Iran with an inevitable nuclear attack if it were to persevere in its alleged attempts to procure nuclear bombs .
The Israelis are known to be negotiating with Syria in a series of talks mediated by the Turkish government .
The Israelis were also making deals with Hamas and Hezbollah , something that was formally speaking a violation of the strict Bush doctrine in this regard .
Remarkably , the top levels of the US government have issued some unusual warnings to the Israelis , telling them to back off from any plan to strike at Iran : President Bush and the top " U.S. Armed Forces " U.S. military commander warned " Israel " Israel ... against bombing Iran , suggesting the " U.S. does n't want to get involved in a third war .
" This is a very unstable part of the world and I do n't need it to be more unstable , " " Michael G. Mullen " Adm .
Mike Mullen , the Joint Chiefs chairman [ and leading member of the ruling Principals ' Committee ] , said at a briefing .
Bush said , " I have made it clear to all parties [ including Israel ] that the first option is diplomacy , " in getting Iran to stop enriching uranium that could be used for a nuclear weapon .
The warnings came after the disclosure that Israel had conducted air operations over the Mediterranean that could simulate a strike on Iran . '
In addition to these public warnings , there are also reports of private messages telling the Israelis to back off .
One was personally delivered by Admiral Mullen of the Principals ' Committee , according to the Israeli press : ' The US did not give the green light for an Israeli attack on Iran , Prof .
Anthony H. Cordesman , a former Pentagon official and currently the top defense analyst at the ABC TV network , said Monday .
Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen .
Cordesman was speaking during a meeting with Israeli defense analysts held by the Institute of National Security Studies .
He said IDF Chief of General Staff Lt. - Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi was notified of the United States ' stance regarding Iran by Admiral Michael Mullen , the top uniformed US military officer , during Mullen 's visit here at the end of June .
The US has opted at this point to stick to the diplomatic track in its efforts to keep Iran from going nuclear , and has made clear to Israel that it should n't attack Iran without White House approval , Cordesman said .
He added that the current US policy is likely to remain unchanged at least until the next US president is sworn in .
Israeli officials confirmed that Cordesman 's statements indeed reflected the current tone of US policy . '
There are solid indications that Iran is being offered the possibility of continuing to enrich uranium at the level of its present capacity to do so , while opening a negotiation with Javier Solana of the European Union .
This was welcomed by the Iran Foreign Minister Mottaki , and was widely regarded as the prelude to a deal or modus vivendi between the US under Brzezinski and the Iranians : '' Iran agreed to enter into talks with the European Union about its nuclear program before the end of the month , Iranian state - run media said .
The EU , which recently placed sanctions on Iran , has offered a package of political , economic and security incentives to Iran if it halts uranium enrichment .
Iran 's top nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , called EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to tell him the response to that offer was coming , according to Iran 's Islamic Republic News Agency , and Solana 's office characterized Jalili 's tone as friendly and positive .
The EU has proposed suspending further sanctions if http://topics.edition.cnn.com/topics/Iran "
Iran takes a six - week break from installing or manufacturing any more centrifuges that enrich uranium .
Iran would be allowed to continue to run the more than 3,000 centrifuges it already has but could not manufacture more ( " Iran ready to discuss EU 's nuclear offer , " CNN , July 4 , 2008 )
In the midst of these negotiations , Iran launched a number of medium and short range ballistic missiles .
The neocons tried to beat the drum , but the response of Secretary Gates of the Principals '
Committee was as low - key and placid as could be imagined : ' The United States is no closer to confrontation with Iran after Tehran test - fired missiles it says could reach Israel and U.S. assets in the Middle East , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday .
Asked if the United States was any closer to confrontation , Gates told reporters : " No , I do n't think so . "
Gates also said it was " highly unlikely " that Russian air defense missiles would be in Iranian hands soon .
An improved air defense system would make a strike on Iran more difficult . '
( Reuters : " Pentagon chief : US no closer to Iran confrontation , " July 9 , 2008 ) Gates also mentioned the terrible consequences which any hostilities with Iran would have .
The following day , there were press reports that the US was allowing the Israelis to use Iraqi airspace to ready an attack on Iran .
These reports were quickly denied by the Pentagon .
An Israeli attack could not be ruled out , but there was no doubt that the US and the British were strongly opposed to the idea , which would undercut Brzezinski's entire plan to turning Iran against the Russians .
There was yet another example of a Principals ' Committee member overriding Bush and making policy .
On July 11 , 2008 , it was reported that Treasury Secretary Paulson had convinced Bush that the administration policy of hostility ( based on Bush 's hatred of FDR and the New Deal in any form ) to Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac , the twin giant mortgage guarantors and lenders whose debts amounted to some $ 5.3 trillion , was risking a systemic crisis of the US banking system ­ a financial Armageddon .
Paulson reportedly told Bush that if he insisted on driving Freddie and Fannie into bankruptcy liquidation , systemic crisis would quickly follow and Bush would be Hooverized in very short order , long before he left office .
At this point , wheels were set into motion and the Federal Reserve signaled that Freddie and Fannie would get access to the discount window of the US central bank .
This story is highly relevant here because it shows the degree to which the members of the Principals Committee are now running the government and telling Bush what to do on most the major issues .
It is clear that Brzezinski and his fellow Trilateral oligarchs intend to maintain and consolidate the current preeminence of the Principals '
Committee under a possible future Obama administration , and also if McCain becomes president , although that variant is much less promising for their hopes of giving US imperialism a hyper - demagogic facelift .
In the case of McCain , the Trilateral inside operative would be Ian Brzezinski , the neocon son of the clan patriarch , who tells McCain what to say about world affairs .
NEOCONS DISPLACED BY TRILATERALS , 2006 -2008
The erosion of neocon power had proceeded apace , starting around the time of the 2006 US congressional elections .
Around that time , British intelligence began signaling the urgent necessity of shifting target towards Russia by staging to bombastic intelligence circuses in the form of the Politkovskaya murder and the Litvinenko radiation bomb affair , both of which were immediately blamed on Russian President Putin .
The British also stepped up their subversion efforts inside the Russian Federation under the cover of cultural exchanges conduit through the Foreign Office front organization , the British Council .
As a result of the new Democratic majority in the Congress , the discredited neocon factional leader Rumsfeld was forced out and replaced by Robert Gates , a Sovietologist who had served as the Russophobe Zbigniew Brzezinski's office boy at the National Security Council during 1977 , 1978 , and 1979 .
Gates had also been active in Brzezinski's mujaheddin operations against the Soviets , operations which had been given birth to the CIA Arab Legion , Al Qaeda .
At the end of 2006 , the report of the Iraq study group , also known as the Baker - Hamilton commission , signaled a change in oligarchical policy and with it the beginning of the end of the neocon dominance in Washington .
The Iraq study group recommended that there be no US attack on Iran , and that negotiations with Syria and Iran be begun immediately .
James Baker , a former secretary of state under Bush the Elder , stated explicitly that he had procured Syria as an ally for the United States during the first Gulf War , and that he could do so again .
Neocon press organs screamed that Baker and Hamilton were " surrender monkeys , " but the handwriting was now on the wall .
The middle of the year saw the fall of the crypto-neocon Tony Blair , a creature of Rupert Murdoch and the last of the major European leaders who had cooperated with Bush and the neocons to unleash the Iraq war in the first place .
The last serious attempt of the neocon faction to launch war with Iran probably occurred at the end of August and the beginning of September 2007 , when rogue forces allied with Cheney in effect hijacked a B - 52 intercontinental strategic bomber carrying six nuclear armed cruise missiles , and flew it from North Dakota to Louisiana .
One of more of these missiles was probably destined to join in the Israeli attack on Syria which occurred on September 6 .
The fact that this B - 52 was not allowed to proceed , and that a consensus against letting it leaves the United States rapidly emerged in the higher levels of the oligarchy , probably represented the last gasp of the US - UK neocons as far as starting a wider war was concerned .
Bush 's outbursts in October and November about World War III were partly directed against Putin , and partly expressed his frustration that no strategic attacks on Iran were likely .
This overall impression was solidified in December 2007 with the issuance of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran , which concluded that there was no longer any active Iranian program to build nuclear bombs .
In 2008 , attention was already shifting to such classic Brzezinski gambits as Kosovo independence and the emerging Polish missile crisis , along with the Tibet insurrection , threats to attack Sudan , and a clear desire to use a humanitarian emergency in Burma as a pretext for a humanitarian invasion and regime change because the Burmese junta was not an efficient distributor of relief supplies .
In these same months , the US Supreme Court was handing down majority opinions striking down the Bush - Cheney military commissions plan for alleged terrorist captives , and then asserting the right of habeas corpus for the prisoners being held in the US exclave of Guantánamo Bay Cuba .
Once again , the neocons howled in their impotence .
Then came the deal to de-list North Korea as a terrorist state , followed by increasing indications of an imminent deal with Iran , even as the attacks on Pakistan escalated and that country teetered on the brink of civil war and partition .
The years had not been kind to the neocons : Scooter Libby had been convicted , and only escaped prison through bushes highly controversial pardon .
Lord Conrad
Black , arguably an even bigger neocon then Libby , was now actually serving a multi- year prison sentence in a US federal penitentiary for embezzling money from his companies .
Lord Black had been one of the major funders of the American Enterprise Institute , where no less a personage than Lynn Cheney , as well as Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen had been employed .
As for neocon Michael Ledeen , his problems might only be beginning : a report from the Senate Intelligence Committee alleged that Ledeen and his old Iran - Contra friend Ghorbanifar had conspired to manipulate US intelligence during the run-up to the Iraq war .
This report had no doubt received much personal attention from the Committee Chairman , who was none other than Senator John D. Rockefeller IV , of the Trilateral - Rockefeller faction which also included Brzezinski .
Other neocons like torture advocates and Geneva Convention deniers Addington ( Cheney 's Cheney )
Yoo were hauled in front of the Nadler committee of the House to be grilled and lambasted .
These were some of the steps by which the Trilaterals had ousted the neocons from their previous positions of power , had neutralized Bush and Cheney , and had generally introduced a demagogic left turn in the entire posture of Anglo American foreign policy , propaganda , and intelligence operations .
Now , all they needed was a figurehead to become the spokesman for this deceptive and cynical left turn -- and this was obviously the role assigned to Obama .
If the American people could imagine no conflict worse than the Iraq war , or even the now - unlikely Iran war , they were obviously suffering from a severe poverty of imagination .
Zbigniew Brzezinski's imagination was richer than that .
He could and did imagine a drive to break up both Russia and China , reducing both to a congeries of warlords and petty states , all absolutely impotent to resist the Anglo - Americans .
That would give London and Washington another century of world domination .
Brzezinski would always claim that his intention was to accomplish all this using proxies , surrogates , and pawns , and without embroiling the US in direct war with Russia and China .
His approach had all the defects of the old Astor family - Cliveden set of the 1930s , who were convinced that they could build up Hitler , turn him east , play him against Stalin , and then destroy both Germany and the USSR in the process , letting the British Empire survive for another hundred years .
Unfortunately , they had been too clever by half , and their plan had blown up in their faces when Hitler turned west before going east .
That had caused World War II .
Now , it was clear that Brzezinski 's fantastic strategy was also destined to blow up in his face , and in all our faces , except now there are ICBMs and H - bombs .
The Russian leader Vladimir Putin and his faction clearly had read Brzezinski's intentions accurately : " Where did you get a public opinion that we should fully disarm and then , according to some theoreticians , such as Brzezinski , divide our territory into three or four states ?
If there is such a public opinion , I would disagree with it , " Putin had stated on June 4 , 2007 .
OBAMA A ONE - WAY TICKET TO THERMONUCLEAR WAR An Obama regime was therefore a probable one - way ticket to thermonuclear war , an outcome several orders of magnitude worse than anything the neocons had ever plotted .
Brzezinski and his friends were more aggressive , more adventurous , more intelligent , and more insane than the neocons .
The American people , if they succumbed to Obama , were about to leap out of the frying pan and into the fire .

Seascout , a prototype robot from New Zealander Andre Harley , is designed to rescue folks at sea .
The robot is designed to scoop up stranded folks in the water .
It can be manually deployed or guided via GPS and contains a two way radio along with lights .
Seascout does contain a small motor on each side , but no word on how it actually moves through big waves .
We would n’t want stranded folks to become shark food thanks to a propeller blade now would we ?

A couple of years ago I found that I was completely sick of the bland and derivative games that were being released by the top publishers ( Fifa 200X indeed : ) ) .
So , I went looking around the web for something better , games that could draw me in with innovative and immersive gameplay .
This is how I became acquainted with the indie gaming scene .
Since that time I ’ve compiled a small list of indie games that have really stood out from the crowd for me , games that I felt were more than worth the price I payed for them .
I thought I would share these games with the world in one convenient list .
None of the games here are what I would term ‘ casual games ’ ( no puzzlers , tetris clones or tower defense types ) , also none of these are multiplayer .
However , just about all of these are innovative games that will keep you busy for hours on end at a fraction of the price you would normally pay for commercial games ( they have certainly kept me entertained for longer than most commercial titles ) .
Well , without further ado , here is the list , in no .
Mount and Blade is a truly innovative one - of - a - kind game .
Have you ever dreamed of being a knight and commanding an army and fighting it out with bandits or lords , for possession of castles or for prisoners , or just for the hell of it .
If you have than this game is for you , it simulates medieval combat to a level of realism not seen in any commercial game ( not that there are many commercial games that simulate medieval combat ) .
This game lets you control castles and villages , recruit men for you army , hunt down bandits , and rival lords , fight in the arena etc .
There is individual combat and army combat , as well as plenty of RPG elements .
An excellent game , with a great community , and it is also highly moddable , with new mods constantly being produced .
This game has been on production for a couple of years and has recently been picked up by Paradox for publication , to be released in September .
You can pick up the beta now for a bargain price which will let you get the full version for free when it comes out .
Do n't miss it !
2. New Star Soccer 3
This game looks at soccer simulation from a different angle , why do you have to control or manage the whole team , you 're only one person , why not control and manage the career of only one player .
That is exactly what you get to do in this game .
It is a strategy / simulation / sports game , you get to create a player and sign him up for a club , then you work on his skills , to make him better , you get to be this player in games against other clubs ( you only control yourself on the field ) .
As you get better you can join bigger clubs and make more money , as you get rich you can buy your player better houses , cars and all sorts of other stuff , you can enter into sponsorship deals , so much to do .
And controlling your player on the field is lots of fun as well !
NSS4 is currently in the works , and should be out pretty soon hopefully , until then you have to play this game !
It was a while ago that I accidentally happened upon a game called Smugglers 3 , I gave it a bit of a play and liked it , so it was a good day when I found out that Smugglers 4 has been released , I went and bought the game straight away and I was n't disappointed .
The same formula that made Smugglers 3 great is still here , with improvements and additions all - round .
You start as a low ranked pilot in a military of your choice , war is raging between the various factions in the galaxy , it is up to you to swing the balance of forces in the favour of your faction .
As you go along you will rise in rank and get to control bigger ships , you can even be granted a planet of your own .
This game reminds me a bit of Pirates ! , and since Pirates ! was awesome , i loved this game too .
Have you ever thought that you can make games better than the current publishers and surely you could have made the SNES much more popular than it ever was , well in this game you get the chance to give it a go .
You can create games as well as launch platforms and if you 're good you watch the money roll in to finance your next big project .
If you 're any kind of gamer you will want to try this out .
Go ahead make the N64 a worldwide sensation .
Best of all this game is FREE !
I am not even going to try to describe this , you have to check this out , anything with a title like that , you have to check out .
Lets just say there are zombies and ninjas and pirates and funky cars that fly through space and wacky graphics and … and … c'mon – ninjastarmageddon – play it !
The indie scene makes a lot of good RPGs , but even there the Geneforge series stands out .
Genforge 4 continues the Genforge saga .
You take the role of a young shaper , someone with the ability to create life ( creatures ) , how will you use your ability , will you help the rebels or will you support the empire .
The world is massive , there are several classes to choose from that all require a different style of play , there are many endings .
This game is good for much more than just one play - through .
You have probably already heard of Kudos , it is one of the few indie games that has gained some mainstream limelight .
Kudos is a life sim developed by Positech Games , you control a character and perform their day to day activities , the point is to achieve a balance in all areas of your life , social , professional , personal etc .
It is a highly original game and the graphics are pretty awesome too .
Give it a try .
A game by the same people who made Kudos ( title probably gives it away :) ) .
In this game you get to control a rock band and take them to startdom .
This time your objective is to keep all the band members happy and raise the popularity of the band .
You get to play gigs and write songs , record CDs and sign with a record label , can you become a rock legend .
Try this game and find out .
The graphics are just as nice as Kudos .
Another game by Positech Games , those guys do some good work ( actually one guy Cliff Harris , Cliffsky ) .
This time you get to try your hand at running a country , we all think we can do it better than the current government , c'mon admit it .
So , this game gives you a chance to prove it .
You can set the policies , raise or lower taxes , try to get your country out of debt and watch your wise decisions , lead your country to glory , or ruin whatever the case may be .
This game has a cool interface , so many options yet so easy to access .
Well worth the money .
This is possibly the best indie RPG currently out there in my opinion .
You start a a barbarian leader of a new faction in the city of Jorvik .
You must destroy various monster that threaten the city and complete quests given by the characters in town .
At the same time you compete with other factions in Jorvik , you can either be warlike or diplomatic .
Recruit other members to your faction to bolster your power and defenses .
If you do n't complete the quests given to you fast enough , they become harder as monster hordes grow and split to form more monster leaders .
The gameplay is innovative and fun , there is a slew of options , the character development options are well thought out , the graphic are great .
This game has everything !
I usually do n't like card - type games , but something about this one drew me in and kept me playing for quite a while .
You play a druid and you have powers over the elements ( air , fire , water etc. ) , you also control certain creatures , you must travel the world and fight groups of creatures to gain control of more creatures and more elemental powers , so that you can fight it out against other druids and win .
There is also a quest mode that you can take part in which gives you special creatures to control .
If you like card - style games , you will like this , if you do n't give it a go anyway , you might change your mind .
Have you ever though you could make it as a writer well in this simulation you get to put your prowess to the test .
You control the life of an aspiring writer trying to get his work published , you make all the decisions .
What kind of books will you write , will you get an education or will you be a self - study , how long do you spend on your book projects , negotiate with publishers for royalties .
Can you write the next Harry Potter , try it and find out .
Another addictive little game by the same people who brought you the Smugglers series .
This time we have a fantasy strategy RPG mix , with a twist .
Build up your castle , hire men , go take over villages , avoid your destroy your rival , then go down into the dungeon to find treasure and all this on a tiny little map , you would n't think such a simple looking game would have so much depth and yet , it is fun , give it a go .
Aveyond 2 looks like an old - school console RPG , and in essence that is what it is since it was made with RPG Maker .
But if you 're going to dismiss it because of that , I suggest you think again .
From the very first moments you start playing this game , the amount of thought and effort that was put into it , starts to shine through .
And this impression is only reinforced as you continue playing .
You can recruit companions to help you on your quest , you can shapeshift , you can join a guild and get karma for doing good things .
If you loved games like Final Fantasy and miss the console RPGs of yore , give this game a try .
Eschalon is an isometric RPG , so it also looks a little like the old console RPGs , but the impression is misleading .
This game has won multiple awards , and has had numerous excellent reviews and high ratings from all over the web .
Most of the game is very random , as everything is calculated through dice rolls .
The game is extremely open ended and the world is very dynamic .
This is not Oblivion by any stretch of the imagination , but if you like to see a great story unfold and are nostalgic for the ' RPG that used to be ' then give this game a try .
I wo n't spoil it for you any more .
16 . Evochron Renegades
This is an Elite - style game ( if you do n't know what Elite is , you owe it to yourself to google it , it is a progenitor of a whole genre ) .
Just like most games of this sort you start out in space with a ship and go from there .
There is lots to do and the gameplay is very freeform .
This game has very nice 3D graphics as well which is awesome for an indie game .
The amount of options you have is staggering , you can explore , trade , race , fight , mine etc. etc .
This game also has a lot of information about it on the website as well as an excellent community around it .
Flatspace 2 is also an Elite - style game .
You start out with a ship in space and you have to travel around and do missions , such as transporting passengers or hunting down enemies .
The gameplay is very open ended , so it is up to you to discover what else you can do in the universe .
You can upgrade your ship or get new ones .
If you like space games , give this one a go .
This is a very interesting game , it is a blend of strategy and RPG set in a fantasy universe .
Essentially you have to manage a team of gladiators that you recruit , and have them fight it out against other teams , in order to rise through the ranks and the divisions of the gladiatorial combat arena .
You train your mercenary gladiators , to improve their skills , you buy them spells and when you are ready , you fight it out against the computer in turn based combat .
Fun !
This game is a real gem .
Developed by Bay12 games and released absolutely free ( that 's right , free ) , this game is so massive in scope it is hard to believe .
This is essentially a rogue - like , if you do n't know what that is , it essentially means that the graphics are ASCII based , but do n't let that turn you off , because this game is awesome .
It is basically 2 games in one , the first is a like a standard rogue - like , the second is the fortress mode .
In fortress mode , you start with a few dwarves and some supplies and set out to build a new outpost for your dwarven kingdom .
You can control everything , where the dwarves mine , you make them build workshops and sleeping quarters , you create goods for trade , you fight off intruders .
If you do well more dwarves come to join your outpost , if you like strategy , simulation and management games , this game is a dream come true .
Do n't be put off by the graphics , take the time to learn the controls , you wo n't be sorry !
Well that ’s the list .
I hope you can get as much enjoyment out of it as I did , most of these games have excellent demos , so you can certainly try them out .
Games of this calibre deserve our support , so if you really like any one of these games then go and buy them .
I hope that mainstream publishers take a note of these games not just for their innovative ideas and excellent execution , but for the value that they provide the gaming community .
I thought this was going to be a small post , but it ended up being massive :) , hope you enjoy reading it and discover some cool new games .

Preface :
If you question the FBI ’s anthrax investigation , but do n’t want to read anything questioning the government ’s 9/11 investigation , please read this first .
There are numerous parallels between the anthrax and 9/11 investigations .
This essay will touch on a couple of them .
1. Continuously - Changing Story When Caught in Misstatements
The government has continuously changed it story each time it has been caught in a misstatement in both the anthrax and 9/11 investigations .
Anthrax
When it was pointed out that the FBI ’s timeline made no sense , they simply changed it without explanation .
And the government initially claimed that Iraq was behind the attack .
When the Iraqi connection was disproven , the government tried to blame it on Mark Hatfill .
After Hatfill won a multi-million dollar judgment against the FBI for defamation , they had to change their tune yet again .
“ In April , it was reported that the FBI had been focusing on as many as four suspects .
Fox News identified them as a “ former deputy commander , ” presumably in the U.S. Army , a “ leading anthrax scientist , ” and “ a microbiologist . ”
The fourth suspect was given no description .
Now the bureau is “ confident that Dr. Ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks , ” according to the assurances of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia . ”
And yet , after Ivins ’ death , the FBI is now trying to pin it solely on the dead guy .
article continues below
9/11
The military put out 3 entirely different stories about what happened on 9/11 .
Specifically , Norad was forced to give 3 entirely different versions of what happened that day , as each previous version was exposed as false , or as providing evidence that the government could in fact have intercepted the hijacked planes had they followed standard protocols .
The Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission , who led the 9/11 staff ’s inquiry , said “ I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described ….
The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years … .
This is not spin .
This is not true . ”
Indeed , the falsity of Norad ’s explanations were so severe that even the 9/11 Commission considered recommending criminal charges for the making of false statements .
2. Pre-Ordained Conclusions
In regards to both anthrax and 9/11 , the government decided on a politically - acceptable explanation , discounted any other possibilities , and then made arguments to support the acceptable conclusion .
Anthrax
The government ’s pre-ordained conclusion is that only one person was involved in the anthrax attacks .
However , leading experts say that it would have taken more than one person to produce the advanced , weaponized anthrax .
Moreover , as mentioned above , the initial pre-ordained conclusion was that Iraq was responsible .
Moreover , as mentioned above , the initial pre-ordained conclusion was that Iraq was responsible .
Specifically , the FBI was actually instructed to blame the Anthrax attacks on Al Qaeda by White House officials .
Once the alleged Iraqi connection became impossible to maintain ( and once the false connection had already succeeded in helping to provide a justification for launching the Iraq war ) , the blame switched to a single rogue U.S. scientist ( Hatfill ) , and then – once Dr. Ivins died – to the conclusion that Ivins was the culprit , as that would provide a tidy ending to the story .
In fact , as shown below , the FBI had not been convinced that Ivins was the culprit even a few months before his death .
9/11
The Joint Congressional Inquiry was only authorized to look at “ intelligence failures ” , and nothing else .
The pre-ordained conclusion , therefore , is that intelligence failures were the sole cause of the 9/11 attacks , a politically acceptable conclusion .
The 9/11 Commission could only publish a report which was approved by the White House .
Moreover , the Commission specifically said that “ it is not our purpose to assign blame ” for the attacks .
It necessarily follows that if blame could not be assigned , then the only possible conclusion could be that “ no one could have foreseen ” 9/11 .
As shown elsewhere , other agencies tasked with investigating other aspects of 9/11 were tasked with supporting the pre-ordained conclusions of the official account .
3. Failure to Follow Leads
In both cases , the government failed to follow any leads which contradicted the pre-ordained conclusion .
Anthrax
The FBI apparently failed to conduct investigations at the most likely points of origin : Dugway , Battelle , or the numerous other labs which had the strain .
The FBI also failed to follow up on investigating a letter sent before the attacks which may very well have pointed to the culprit .
9/11
Because a Bush White House insider was executive director of the 9/11 Commission , and determined which issues and lines of evidence would be considered , many relevant lines of inquiry were not followed .
As examples of uninvestigated leads , the the 9/11 investigators did not follow up on the substantial evidence that the White House had specific warnings before the attacks .
The government allowed members of the Saudi royal family , including the Bin Ladens , to leave the country right after 9/11 , without meaningful interrogation .
4. Suppression of Evidence
The government suppressed evidence in both cases .
Anthrax
The FBI kept Congress in the dark about the investigation for many years .
Until recently , “ the FBI has completely shut Congress out of its … investigation into anthrax attacks on Capitol Hill and around the nation ” .
The FBI has also failed to share with the public even details of its investigation which could not conceivably threaten national security .
9/11
Investigators for the Congressional Joint Inquiry discovered that an FBI informant had hosted and rented a room to two hijackers in 2000 and that , when the Inquiry sought to interview the informant , the FBI refused outright , and then hid him in an unknown location , and that a high - level FBI official stated these blocking maneuvers were undertaken under orders from the White House .
The official investigators into the collapse of the World Trade Centers were denied access to the site and the evidence contained there , or even access to such basic information as the blueprints for the world trade center .
The government claims that no flight recorders were recovered from the airplanes which hit the Twin Towers .
However , firefighters stated they did recover the flight recorders .
And Dan Rather confirmed that they were recovered .
The 9 - 11 widows who pressured the administration to create the 9/11 Commission have declared it a failure which ignored 70 % of their detailed questions and “ suppressed important evidence and whistleblower testimony that challenged the official story on many fronts “ .
5. Destruction of Evidence
The government allowed important evidence to be destroyed in both cases .
Anthrax
The FBI allowed 70 years of Ames - related anthrax samples to be destroyed .
As noted in the San Francisco Chronicle :
“ Scientists in and out of government say the rush to destroy the spores may have eliminated crucial evidence about the anthrax in the letters sent to Congress and the media . ”
As a top bioweapons expert and insider to the FBI investigation said :
“ This was an astonishing thing to do .
It should have been preserved as evidence .
This was a roadmap of everybody and anybody that had gotten access to develop the super - strain that hit Leahy and Daschle . ”
Moreover , according to the Associated Press :
“ FBI scientists early on had — but destroyed — the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to Dr. Bruce Ivins … : *** [ This was anthrax that ]
Ivins took from his Army lab in February 2002 and gave investigators ”
The FBI ’s excuse for destroying the anthrax sample which Ivins gave them makes no sense .
9/11
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The government filmed the interrogations at Guantanamo of 9/11 suspects , who – according to the 9/11 Commission – were the key basis for the Commission ’s findings – but hid the existence of the tapes , and then destroyed the tapes before any outside observers could watch them .
The tape of interviews of air traffic controllers on - duty on 9/11 was intentionally destroyed by crushing the cassette by hand , cutting the tape into little pieces , and then dropping the pieces in different trash cans around the building as shown by this NY Times article ( summary version is free ; full version is pay - per- view ) and by this article from the Chicago Sun -Times .
And the government hauled away and then promptly shipped overseas virtually all of the steel from ground zero before it could be analyzed by scientists .
Indeed , the former head of the fire science and engineering division of the agency now investigating the world trade center disaster , who is a professor of fire protection engineering , wrote that evidence necessary to determine the cause of the collapse of the World Trade Centers was being destroyed .
6. Allegations of Bribery
The government apparently attempted to bribe people to support its story in both cases .
Anthrax
The FBI offered Ivins ’ son $ 2.5 million plus the sports car of his choice if he would turn over evidence implicating his father .
If the FBI attempted to bribe Ivins ’ own son , it is logical to assume that they attempted to bribe other people ( perhaps successfully ) .
9/11
According to a Pulitzer - prize winning reporter , the U.S. paid $ 5 million to an Iraqi for his assistance in letting the CIA forge and backdate a letter falsely linking 9/11 to Iraq .
7. Skeptical Congressmen
Congress people who have examined the evidence are skeptical about the government ’s explanation in both cases .
Anthrax
Senators Grassley , Daschle and Leahy , and Congressman Holt question the FBI ’s anthrax conclusions .
9/11
Congress people from both sides of the aisle question the government ’s version of 9/11 .
8. Skeptical Experts
Experts who have examined the evidence are also skeptical about both cases .
Anthrax
Many top anthrax experts are skeptical that Ivins could have done it by himself ( and see this ) .
9/11
Top scientists , engineers , arthitects , high - level intelligence officials , military leaders and others with relevant expertise are skeptical of the government ’s explanation of 9/11 .
The foregoing list just begins to document the many parallels between the anthrax and 9/11 investigations .
I started with a list of 14 major parallels but – for the sake of brevity – reduced it to 8 .
There are many other parallels which could be written about .
Writers should take up the task of listing additional parallels .
Even for the parallels mentioned , the list is in no way intended to be exhaustive .
Again , for the sake of readability , I solely gave a couple of examples for each parallel , when entire essays could ( and hopefully will ) be written about each one .

In short , is it functional ?
At the heart of every piece of practical design , whether it be a website , product package , office building , manufacturing system , piece of furniture , software interface , book cover , tool , or anything else , there is a function , a task the item is expected to perform .
Most functions can be achieved in a variety of ways , but there are some basic elements a designer needs to take into account to create a product that best fulfills its intended function .
These are the elements of functional design , the process of responding to the needs or desires of the people who will use an item in a way that allows their needs or desires to be met .
Functional design is both an outcome and a process .
As an outcome , it describes products that work well to perform their assigned tasks ; as a process , functional design is a set of practices guided by the principles that produce that positive outcome .
( Functional design is also a computer modeling technique , but that ’s not what we ’re discussing here . )
You may want to take a look at related articles :
In order to create a product that works , there are seven questions you should keep in mind about the product you ’re designing , who will be using it , and how they ’ll be using it .
1. Consider the product ’s goal
Consider the screwdriver .
The goal of a screwdriver is pretty straight - forward : to drive screws .
Although there ’s certainly a lot of room for innovation in screwdriver design — there are screwdrivers with more ergonomic handles , ratchet - assemblies , magnetic tips , and exchangeable heads — ultimately everything in a screwdriver ’s design is aimed towards the accomplishment of that single goal : driving screws .
Ultimately everything in a screwdriver 's design is aimed towards the accomplishment of that single goal : driving screws .
Image source .
Now , consider a website like Amazon.com .
What is the goal of Amazon ’s website ?
Amazon has a lot of different uses , some intended by Amazon and its designers and some not intended — you can look up reviews , compare product prices while you ’re in a store considering a purchase , promote your brand by leaving lots of reviews , scam shoppers by creating fake storefronts , collect images of book covers for a school project , search book text for half - remembered quotes , and so on .
For the folks at Amazon , the website has one purpose : to sell stuff .
All the features that allow those other uses were put in place as ways to sell more products .
But none of those are the reason the site was built .
For the folks at Amazon , the website has one purpose : to sell stuff .
All the features that allow those other uses were put in place as ways to sell more products .
( And it seems to be working ! )
2. Consider who will be using it
Perhaps the single most important consideration in the design process — and the one most often forgotten — is the intended audience for the product .
What works perfectly well for one user might be completely dysfunctional for another .
And if the hoped - for users fall more into the second category than the first , you ’ve got a problem .
Think about the way your parents or grandparents use their computers .
Anyone with a bit of tech - savviness has probably fielded dozens of “ tech support ” calls from family members who are simply baffled by things like adding an email account to their email program , downloading family pictures from the Web , or dealing with a too - full hard drive .
Since CNN 's web - site is supposed to be used by huge and versatile audience , it has to work equally well for all its potential users if it's to accomplish its goal .
Why do people have so much trouble with their computers ?
They do n’t know enough about how computers work .
They do n’t have enough experience with computers .
They do n’t have time to figure things out .
They do n’t enjoy tinkering until they find a solution to a computer problem .
The manuals are written in a dense , uninviting language that they find boring and difficult to comprehend .
Considering the kinds of problems they have can give us a clue about the kinds of questions designers should be asking about their audience .
What kind of knowledge do your users bring with them ?
How much experience do they have ?
What kind of time do they have ?
Are they looking for a leisurely diversion or do they want to get in and out fast ?
What kind of personalities do they have ?
How much support will they need , and what form should it take ?
Obviously there are likely to be several audiences for any given product .
Plenty of computer users have the knowledge , experience , and personality types to easily do whatever they choose to do on their computers .
If you ’re designing a niche product — a website for Linux users , for example — perhaps you can get away with directing yourself towards only one , narrow audience .
In most cases , though , a product has to work equally for all its potential users if it ’s to accomplish its goal .
3. Consider what your audience intends to do with it
As we saw in the case of Amazon.com , there are a lot of ways that users use a product besides those that directly fulfill the product ’s main goal .
In fact , every user comes to a product with his or her own intention — and they are rarely the goals that designers have in mind .
For example , nobody in the history of humankind has ever wanted to record what was on channel
Three between 9 pm and 10 pm on Thursday the 27th — yet for years that was how VCR designers insisted we program our VCRs .
No surprise , then , that few people programmed their VCRs .
Instead , what people want to do is record House tomorrow night .
Likewise , your dad does n’t want to configure his POP3 and SMTP settings .
He does n’t even want to send and receive email .
He wants to send pictures of the baby to Aunt Jill in Iowa .
Engineers and designers have long suffered from a tendency to substitute concrete specifications and processes for fuzzy user behaviors — but users do n’t do that .
Engineers and designers have long suffered from a tendency to substitute concrete specifications and processes for fuzzy user behaviors — but users do n't do that .
Adequate knowledge of who your audience is requires some sense of what their intentions are and how they are going to think about your product .
That ’s what Tivo did when they replaced the complicated process of recording a show on a VCR with a process that better reflected their users ’ intentions — just select a show you want to record and hit “ Record ” .
4 . Is it clear how to use it ?
The best design , as often said , “ speaks for itself ” .
It is immediately clear — at least to its target audience (s ) — what a product does and how to use it .
Clarity is key to functional design .
Probably one of the best - designed objects in the world is the ball .
With minimal instruction , even infants can use it !
In contrast , look at the website above .
That ’s the home page for Chipotle , the Mexican fast food restaurant known for its use of free - range , organic , and locally - grown ingredients .
Not that you ’d know that from the homepage .
What you know is a ) they have a logo , and b ) there ’s something you should know about jalapeño peppers .
If there were no food scare involving jalapeños , you ’d see only the logo .
What do you do ?
We can assume the site has a goal — probably to get you to buy some tasty Mexican food — but how do you , the visitor , fulfill your own goal of finding what you want to know about Chipotle ?
This is a classic example of what Vincent Flanders calls mystery meat navigation ( presumably free - range , organically - grown mystery meat ) , a website navigation system so clever , so stylish , that visitors have no idea what the site does or how to do it .
Make your product difficult enough to understand and it wo n’t get used at all — which means it does n’t achieve its goal , which in turn means it does n’t function .
5 . How does your user know it ’s working ?
Remember in the Bad Old Days of the Web , when you ’d make a purchase online and the “ Submit ” button would say underneath something like :
Please press the “ Submit ” button only once .
Pressing more than once will duplicate your purchase .
We ’ve come a way since then , but it ’s surprising how many times you still come across a website feedback form that does n’t tell you when your message has been sent , or a search form that does n’t tell you that it ’s working on your request .
This problem is by no means limited to the online world .
How often do you double - check to see that your alarm clock is set to go off , and at the right time , before you can relax and go to sleep ?
Or maybe you ’ve run into this problem : you hit “ Program ” on your CD player ( assuming you still have one ) and key in the tracks you want to hear , but are n’t sure whether to hit “ Program ” again or just hit “ Play ” — and if you hit the wrong one , whether your program will be lost and you ’ll have to re-do it .
These are all examples of inadequate feedback — it ’s not clear whether you ’ve completed the task you inteded to do or if there are more steps still required .
While technically a product is functioning even if you do n’t know it ’s working , it ’s not functioning well from the user ’s standpoint — and products that do n’t function well tend not to create very loyal users .
6 . Is it engaging to your users ?
One of the great products of recent years , at least in terms of engagement , is the Blackberry .
Blackberry owners can’t stop fiddling with their devices — they check their email , flick the trackball around , check email again , send a text , scroll around the home screen , and then do it all over again .
And again .
It ’s no accident it ’s earned the nickname “ Crackberry . ”
Usability testing and paper prototyping are common methods to understand the way your target group will interact with you web - site and find out if it is engaging to your users .
Image source .
Good design draws users in , whether through visual appeal , feel , ease of use , or sheer amazement .
Anyone who has ever picked up a well - made hand tool and felt the desire to build something has experienced this — the tool just feels right .
This is , in part , the aesthetic value of the design — we are naturally drawn to things we find pretty .
But aesthetics are hardly the limit of what makes something engaging .
There are plenty of websites out there that are downright hideous — but they work .
Those long - form sales pages that litter the Web hawking “ get rich quick ” programs and miracle cures ( like this landing page which won the SEOmoz landing page contest last year ) are as ugly as human ingenuity can make them — but they consistently succeed in leading visitors ( at least the kind of users that the pages are designed for ) to the inevitable sale .
7 . How does it handle mistakes ?
How often have you visited a web page , realized it did n’t have the information you were looking for , clicked the “ Back ” button , and ended up on the same page again ?
You made a mistake , to be sure — you clicked the wrong link — but that happens .
It was the designer , though , who decided to make your mistake difficult to undo .
Good design takes into account the possibility that users make mistakes .
Unless your only desired user is a member of that very small demographic of people who do n’t ever make mistakes , your design should accommodate and even anticipate mistakes as much as possible .
Web designers have come up with all sorts of ways to accommodate visitors ’ mistakes , from persistent menus and “ breadcrumbs ” to 404 pages ( “ Page Not Found ” pages ) that link to the pages the websurfer was likely to have been looking for .
Designers who do n’t make room for — and offer solutions to — users ’ mistakes create non-functioning products .
Conclusion
Design is necessarily a relationship between users with problems to solve and designers with solutions to offer .
Too often , though , users are left out of the designer ’s considerations .
Whoever designed the Chipotle site , for instance , had no conception of how any part of their target audience would approach the site .
They had a clever idea — “ it ’s minimalism , man ! ” — and ran with it , to the detriment of potential diners , and possibly to the detriment of Chipotle .
Unless your specialty is creating concepts that have no possibility of being made into actual products , the ultimate goal is to design things that will be used .
Think about how and why your product will be used , and by whom , as a central part of the design process to assure that your designs not only can be used , but will .
Whether PC gaming is dying or not , one thing is certain : piracy of PC games is a serious talking - point for developers on either side of the debate .
A growing number of developers big and small have become increasingly vocal about piracy rates for PC games .
One developer , though , has finally put aside the complaints , the indignant state of mind , and is asking the pirates directly a simple question : why ?
Cliff Harris , an independent game developer with Positech Games , has put out a call to pirates asking for an explanation .
Not seeking to turn around and refute the pirates ' reasons or to simply oust the pirates and turn them over to the authorities , Harris is earnestly sincere about learning what drives pirates to steal his games .
Harris is asking for pirates to send him e-mails detailing the reasons why they are pirating games .
Why ?
" What I do n't know is why people pirate my games , " Harris wrote on his website , where he made the open call for e-mails .
" I might be able to get a general idea as to why people pirate stuff * in general * from reading warez forums , and every other story on digg , but I 'm not interested in the general case .
I want to improve my business , and ensure I stay afloat , and to do that , it would be mad to sit in the corner and ignore the opinions of that section of the public who pirate my games . "
Harris promises not to publicly out any pirates for the sake of trying to get to the bottom of the issue .
" I wo n't publicise who e-mailed me , or even store the addresses , share them , tell anyone them , or make any use of them whatsoever .
I 'll just read them , nothing else .
It will be entirely off - the - record and effectively anonymous .
I wo n't hand any email addresses to the RIAA , MPAA , BSA or anyone at all under any circumstances ever . "
What he will do , however , is read every e-mail in an attempt to understand why pirates pirate and what developers can do to change the way that PC gaming is going .
Cliff Harris
Harris , who has worked on many PC - specific titles including Democracy and Kudos , was driven to act not only as a result of the increased publicity surrounding PC game piracy but more so from comments made on his blog .
" I occasionally post about piracy on my blog , and I get a lot of comments from people who defend piracy , or think I am too strongly against it , or that I blow it out of proportion , " Harris told Ars today .
" The last few times I read these comments , I got to thinking about the other side of the fence , and wondering if there was something I just did n't get .
Pirates never talk to the developers , so I thought I 'd see if there was something I could learn from it if I asked them for their honest views . "
The pricing controversy surrounding Braid , a recently - released Xbox Live Arcade game which has garnered positive response from critics but negative attention from some gamers not willing to cover its $ 15 price tag , was a particular sore spot for Harris .
" I think it 's crazy for people to resent such a small price for a game .
I do n't feel like the world has ended , though .
We all routinely spend more than $ 10 or $ 15 on things that do n't last as long as a decent PC game , " he said .
Referencing a recent Penny Arcade comic , Harris continued .
" A $ 15 t- shirt can be a spur - of - the - moment buy , but a game for the same cost needs to be a work of genius .
I do n't get why that is . "
" Because I can "
Harris ' plight has already drawn a significant response from visitors to his website and others on the web .
In the first 24 hours after he made the call , Harris notes that he has received " tons , hundreds , if not more " responses .
" Most of them have been generic piracy points , which is interesting , although not the original request , " said Harris .
" I have got a few sarcastic ones , but a lot of very long , well - thought - out explanations , mainly from people who do n't pirate games now , but used to in the past . "
Responses for piracy have been wildly varied .
Some responders parrot popular reasons for piracy .
Some pirate so that they can try the game before they buy , as though a pirated copy of the game were a free demo .
Some do it to spit in the face of publishers who use copy - protection methods .
And for others , it 's as simple as " because I can . "
One response reads , almost mercilessly , " pirates deliver a more convenient product at a better price . "
Harris anticipated exactly these remarks .
" There are lots [ of reasons why piracy exists ] , " said Harris .
" The ones that bug me are the people who are just trying to save money but could afford it , or the ones with some ' intellectual ' justification for believing it's their human rights to get free stuff . "
In spite of Harris ' continued interest in developing for the PC , though , he does concede that he 's being pushed towards closed console development .
" I have considered console gaming , and also online gaming , " said Harris .
" The thing is , I personally prefer single - player games , so that 's the style of game I design .
I do think a lot about the best way to set up my game demos , the website , and what after sales support , content and patches to provide in order to reduce the extent of piracy for my games . "
Piracy has long been a maddening reality for game developers — and , for that matter , all software developers and media companies in general .
It 's not a new phenomenon for gaming , to be sure , but as the business grows and more money is pumped in to projects big and small , the risk - to - reward ratio is a cause for concern for developers .
Perfect solutions do not yet exist : developers have to find them .
And while the stop - gap measure for now may be DRM or some kind of one - use reward for players who actually purchase games , developers continue to hunt for new ways to get move the majority of gamers in the direction of being patrons rather than pirates .
Harris , frustrated with the balance tipping the wrong way , has found a new avenue to search for answers .
Hopefully the answers that he finds help the industry at large .
" I honestly think I might learn something .
IP owners characterize all pirates as freeloading scum , " said Harris in closing .
" Pirates characterize all IP owners as fat - cat billionaires in gold - plated Ferraris .
It 's about time we both listened to each other more . "
To other developers , he offered his support .
" Do n't be afraid to talk about [ piracy ] .
A lot of big - name developers have blamed piracy for disappointing sales , and there is a perception that the minute you mention it , everyone will kick you in the face , because it 's happened a lot recently .
" The problem is , devs need to be really honest about the topic .
Blaming piracy for a move to the consoles is fine if it 's really true , but if it 's just an excuse to cover up a really badly made game , or one that nobody had machines that ran , that 's just silly .
It 's easy to discount everything [ pirates ] say as justifications for theft , but if someone tells you your game 's over - priced , buggy and the DRM is a nightmare , then it 's madness not to listen to them . "
Trans - fats are used in many fried and baked foods California has become the first US state to ban restaurants and food retailers from using trans - fats , which are linked to coronary heart disease .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said the new legislation , which will take effect in 2010 , represented a " strong step toward creating a healthier future " .
Violations will incur fines of between $ 25 ( £ 13 ) and $ 1,000 ( £ 502 ) .
Trans - fats are chemically altered vegetable oils , used to give processed foods a longer shelf - life .
Some cities , like New York City , Philadelphia and Seattle , have already banned the fats .
Many food makers and restaurant chains have also been experimenting with replacements for oils and foods that contain them .
' Tremendous benefit ' Trans - fats are produced artificially in a process called hydrogenation which turns liquid oil into solid fat .
They can be used for frying or baking , or put into processed foods and ready - made mixes for cakes and drinks like hot chocolate .
Trans - fats are used because they are cheap , add bulk to products , have a neutral flavour and give products a long shelf - life .
TRANS - FATS
They are partially hydrogenated vegetable oils , turning oily foods into semi- solid foods
Used to extend shelf life of products
Put into pastries , cakes , margarine and some fast foods
Can raise levels of " bad " cholesterol
Even a small reduction in consumption can cut heart disease
They have no nutritional benefit The US Food and Drug Administration estimates that on average , Americans eat 4.7lb ( 2.14kg ) of trans - fats each year .
A review by the New England Journal of Medicine in 2006 concluded that there was a strong connection between the consumption of trans - fats and coronary heart disease .
It found they boosted " bad " cholesterol levels in the body .
The review said that eliminating artificial trans - fats from the food supply could prevent between six and 19 % of heart attacks and related deaths each year .
The legislation signed by Mr Schwarzenegger will ban from 1 January 2010 the use of trans - fats in oil , shortening and margarine used in spreads or for frying .
The president of the California Academy of Family Physicians , Jeffrey Luther , said that the law , " when it finally takes effect , will be a tremendous benefit " , adding that there was no safe level of consumption , as with cigarettes .
The California Restaurant Association opposed the ban , but a spokesman said that it had no plans to challenge it in the courts , in part because some restaurants have already begun to phase out trans - fats to satisfy customers .

A report released Tuesday by the Justice Department has documented the Bush administration ’s unprecedented -- and illegal -- effort to politicize the ranks of the agency ’s prosecutors and civil service employees with conservatives and true believers in the religious right ’s agenda .
Under then - Atty . Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales , a thirtysomething lawyer named Monica M. Goodling -- a graduate of a law school founded by Pat Robertson -- had virtual veto power over the appointment of U.S. attorneys , other prosecutors and immigration judges .
Goodling , as the Washington Post reported , demanded that candidates “ espouse conservative priorities and Christian lifestyle choices , ” especially on issues such as abortion and same - sex marriage .
The goal , according to the report , was to create a Republican “ farm system ” inside the Justice Department .
While Goodling was pursuing that mission , something not dissimilar was going on at the White House .
According to an article by New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer in the latest New York Review of Books , “ President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and a small handful of trusted advisors sought and obtained dubious legal opinions [ on national security ] enabling them to circumvent American laws and traditions . ”
She details how they used these legal opinions to dramatically expand executive power .
When the next administration and Congress begin the urgent work of sorting out precisely how and why the Bush - Cheney regime systematically undermined the rule of law , there are a couple of things that ought to be kept in mind .
Advertisement
One is that their efforts were essentially ideological rather than partisan .
That ’s an important distinction , because although those involved in the White House campaign to subvert legal safeguards of all sorts obviously were Republicans , many Republicans working inside the administration -- some of them deeply conservative -- gave up their jobs rather than go along with the putsch .
Former Assistant Atty . Gen. Jack Goldsmith , who did heroic work trying to undo the mischief wrought by John Yoo , his predecessor in the Office of Legal Counsel , is one of those .
His offense was to tell then - vice presidential counsel David Addington -- now Cheney ’s chief of staff -- that , despite Yoo ’s obliging opinions , U.S. law does not permit torture .
The Navy ’s general counsel , Alberto Mora , was forced out of his job as well , for trying to stop the abuse of detainees by interrogators at Guantanamo .
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Matthew Waxman fought a losing battle to get the United States to abide by its moral and legal obligations under the Geneva Convention governing the treatment of prisoners .
In her new book , “ The Dark Side , ” Mayer drew particular attention to a group of FBI agents who refused to participate in the torture of Al Qaeda operatives in U.S. custody .
It ’s a safe bet that few of them are ACLU members , but most have now “ retired and joined private security firms , taking vast amounts of wisdom about Islamic terrorism with them . ”

An accurate record of this low , dishonest epoch in our history should also reflect the particular courage of the military lawyers -- many of them from the Navy and Marine Corps -- who sacrificed their careers demanding that their clients at Guantanamo receive a modicum of due process .
The article in the New York Review of Books also cites the example of a military prosecutor , Lt. Col .
Stuart Crouch , who enlisted in the Marines as a military lawyer because a close friend was the copilot on the second hijacked airliner that flew into the World Trade Center on 9/11 .
Crouch was assigned to prosecute Mohamedou Ould Slahi , an Al Qaeda operative alleged to have aided the Hamburg cell that planned and carried out the attack on the twin towers .
But when Crouch discovered that he was expected to put on a case based on information obtained through torture , he refused as a matter of conscience .
Others have been less scrupulous for reasons that do them even less credit than ideological fanaticism .
Take , for example , former Pentagon general counsel William J. Haynes II .
In a sworn statement , Air Force Col.
Morris Davis -- the former top prosecutor in the Office of Military Commissions -- says he resigned after being pressured by Haynes to move forward with politically “ sexy ” prosecutions even though Morris believed the evidence against the defendants had been obtained by torture .
Davis said he also told Haynes that a few acquittals at Guantanamo , if warranted , would send a message that the commissions sitting there were fair , just as the not - guilty verdicts against some Nazi defendants had done for the Nuremberg trials .
Haynes ’ response was emphatic , according to Morris : “ We ca n’t have acquittals !
We ’ve got to have convictions ! ...
If we ’ve been holding these guys for so long , how can we explain letting them get off ? ”

At some point , the American people will demand a precise accounting of how and why their government and its officials behaved in this reckless , appalling fashion .
That will require following the chain of command into the White House .
When it happens , you can bet that Cheney , Rumsfeld , Addington et al will demand every protection of the law and insist on every comma of the due process they ’ve derided as mere inconvenience .

Ablog readers Kathy and Dennis write that McCain asked if they could get “ back ” to the Supreme Court issue when it had n’t come up yet .
It had , however , for Obama .
Either McCain was confused , or he had been told the Supreme Court was one of the questions and could n’t remember if it had come up yet .
Here ’s the transcript :
WARREN : Let ’s deal with abortion .
I , as a pastor , have to deal with this all the time , every different angle , every different pain , all of the decisions and all of that .
Forty million abortions since Roe v. Wade .
Some people , people who believe that life begins at conception , believe that ’s a holocaust for many people .
What point is a baby entitled to human rights ?
MCCAIN : At the moment of conception .
( APPLAUSE ) .
I have a 25 - year pro-life record in the Congress , in the Senate .
And as president of the United States , I will be a pro-life president .
And this presidency will have pro-life policies .
That ’s my commitment .
That ’s my commitment to you .
WARREN : OK , we do n’t have to beleaguer on that one .
Define marriage .
MCCAIN : A union — a union between man and woman , between one man and one woman .
That ’s my definition of marriage .
Could I — are we going to get back to the importance of Supreme Court Justices or should I mention —
WARREN : We will get to that .
MCCAIN : OK .
All right .
OK .
WARREN : You ’re jumping ahead …
The dolphin was removed by environmental health officers
Mystery surrounds the discovery of a dead dolphin in the garden of two sailors in Dorset who live on a steep hill half a mile ( 0.8 km ) from the sea .
Mike Elliott , 28 , and housemate Gary Harvey , woke to find the 3ft ( 0.9 m ) dolphin in Portland on Thursday .
The mammal appeared to have two puncture wounds in its stomach as if it had been speared .
Police carried out house - to - house inquiries but said there was no evidence a crime had been committed .
Mr Harvey , 23 , said : " I woke up , looked out of my window and saw what appeared to be a dolphin in the garden .
' No tidal wave '
" I went downstairs to have a closer look and that confirmed it - there was a three foot dolphin in the back garden .
" I really do n't know how it got there .
I was pretty amazed .
I thought I was dreaming to start with .
" There was no tidal wave and we live about half a mile from the sea quite a bit above sea level at the top of Portland so it must have been dumped there . "
The two men , both Royal Navy marine engineers , called police who made enquiries about the dolphin .
" There was no evidence a criminal offence had been committed , " a Dorset Police spokesman added .
Environmental health officers from Weymouth and Portland Borough Council were contacted and removed the mammal , which died of unknown causes .
It does not look as if Mr. Mugabe , an 84 - year - old liberation hero who has ruled Zimbabwe for 28 years , will leave office without a fight .
After early election results from the March 29 vote indicated he was losing to the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , the election commission put the brakes on announcing results .
The presidential results still have not been released , and a recount begun Saturday in 23 Parliament races is now threatening to drag things out further  the opposition has deemed it “ illegal . ”

If there is a runoff between Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Tsvangirai , many fear it could get even bloodier .
Human Rights
Watch issued a report on Saturday saying members of Mr. Mugabe ’s party were running “ torture camps ” where they took opposition supporters for nightly beatings .
On Sunday , the leading opposition party , the Movement for Democratic Change , said more than 400 supporters had been arrested , 500 attacked , 10 killed and 3,000 families displaced .
The party released a detailed , day - by - day chronicle of violence that listed huts being burned , people getting cracked in the head with bottles and farms being invaded .
The party blamed Mugabe supporters and sometimes government soldiers .
The government has denied any wrongdoing and accused opposition leaders of treason .
Mr. Tsvangirai has said it is too dangerous for him to stay in Zimbabwe and has been spending time in South Africa .
The border between South Africa and Zimbabwe stretches about 150 miles , and it is headache - hot out here .
“ Beware of crocodile ” signs shimmer in the sun , the grass is yellow and crisp , and at night , the trees churn with clouds of heat - crazed insects .
For the people who make it through , there is a pipeline of sympathy waiting on the other side .
Fellow Zimbabweans living in South Africa  often perfect strangers  have taken in border jumpers , giving them a safe house and a warm cup of porridge , and helping them along their way to Messina , about 10 miles south , and then onward to the bigger cities of Johannesburg and Cape Town .
New York City Transit is finally moving against perverts who use crowded trains as an opportunity to grope women .
Weeks ago ,
The Post exclusively reported that agency officials were holding back on an ad campaign against sicko straphangers out of internal fears that it could actually provoke the deviants .
But the agency has now opted to roll out the campaign next month .
The posters read , “ Sexual harassment is a crime in the subway , too – a crowded train is no excuse for an improper touch .
Do n’t stand for it or feel ashamed , or be afraid to speak up .
Report it to an MTA employee or police officer . ”
The first 2,000 posters will be distributed throughout the system and should remain up for at least three months to “ assess its impact , ” said NYC Transit spokesman Paul Fleuranges .
The campaign was sparked by a report last year by Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer that found 10 percent of women surveyed claimed to have been sexually abused and 63 percent reported having been sexually harassed .
Scalia : Gore to blame for 2000 decision Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday June 26 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has claimed , in a recent interview with the UK newspaper Telegraph , that then Vice President Al Gore was to blame for George W. Bush being declared the victor of the 2000 presidential election .
" Richard Nixon , when he lost to Kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in Chicago , which was very likely true with the system at the time , " said Scalia .
" But he did not even think about bringing a court challenge .
That was his prerogative .
So you know if you do n't like it , do n't blame it on me .
" I did n't bring it into the courts .
Mr Gore brought it into the courts , " he continued .
" So if you do n't like the courts getting involved talk to Mr Gore . "
The first state court case in Florida was filed by Palm Beach County voters who felt they were disenfranchised by the infamous butterfly ballot design .
It was the Bush Cheney campaign who first took the case to federal court , filing a federal lawsuit on Nov. 11 , 2000 .
A complete timeline of the Florida fiasco is available here .
Recently , Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean claimed the 2000 election was stolen by ' five intellectually bankrupt judges . '
Scalia , on the other hand , argued that if a critic wanted " to look for partisan decisions , " the Florida supreme court 's ruling on the 2000 elections would be a prime candidate .
Scalia continued , claiming that ' of course ' he regretted the Supreme Court becoming involved with the 2000 presidential election .
" But I do n't know how we could have avoided it , " he said .
" Could we have declined to accept the case on the basis that it was n't important enough ?
... I think our decision in the case was absolutely right .
But if you ask me ' Am I sorry it all happened ? '
Of course I am sorry it happened , there was no way that we were going to come out of it smelling like a rose . "

9 : Coming into the office , I 'm jazzed .
I log in , check my email , read the news , check a bunch of blogs where people who are n't as smart as I think I am rant on and on about how Bush stole Ohio and Social Security is going to cause everyone to die at fifty and think that anyone actually cares about Dean v. Rosenberg .10 : Coffee !
Go out , walk down the street , get a cup , and by the time I get back , it 's almost 11 , which means ... 11 : Plan for lunch !
Get out the menus I 've got in my desk and fantasize about the food I can have at the many reasonably priced , easily - walkable lunch establishments in downtown San Francisco !
After a bit of that , I 'm ready for 12 : Lunch " hour . "
An " hour " gives you fifteen minutes of leeway on either side .
The Lunch Choice Of The Day will probably involve Moo Goo Gai Pan or a 2/3 LB Monster Bacon Butter Cheese Human Lard Plus Thickburger , Topped With Whipped Cream and Deep Fried or ( if I 'm really unlucky ) , Subway sandwiches that suck so much even that alien cyborg Jared Fogle could n't eat them and lost weight .
I go to Subway ; it 's close .1 : Still at lunch " hour . "
Done with eating , spending time at the table at Subway watching all of the really hot advertising chicks who would only talk to me if I threatened their mothers with a garrotte , and only then if they'd get a new handbag out of the deal .
1:20 : Back to the office , time to check on the news in case anything happened in the late morning ( Hey , Rudy T is quitting the Lakers ! ) .
Then it 's food coma .
Sit at my desk clicking the mouse every few seconds to shift between programs , trying to make the windows somehow make a pattern as interesting as the screen saver I used to get stoned to back in college when I were supposed to be doing term papers .
All that education is getting a workout now !
2 : Still food coma .
It 's about now that I should probably get some actual " work " done .
Nothing like some cover sheet composition and printer paper jams to pass the time .
2:30 : Ah , a post - lunch dump with a couple of printouts from ESPN.com .
Bliss .2:45 Oh no .2:50 Christ , no .2:55 : It 's almost here , shit .
Finally , I get off the toilet just in time for ... 3:00 THE INFINITE HOUR .
Time grinds to a halt .
It 's too early to think about leaving , the food is gone from your stomach , you can't leave for a coffee break because you spent so much time on the can earlier and someone would notice .

3:25 : Start revenge fantasies .
If 3:00 were a person .
Shit , it * is* a person .
3:00 is that little pimply - faced fuck who * everybody * hated in elementary school ; not because he was a nerd ( the nerds kicked him out ) , but because he was a little bastard .
That fuckhead tattled on everyone , made fun of the geeks for their subpar transformers collection , insulted the big guys for having too much earwax , tried to make girls touch his private regions during square dancing , and ( to top it off ) , sucked at kickball .
He'd be standing there insulting everyone while teams were chosen , and both captains would look at 3:00 for five long minutes and eventually embark on a best - of - 11 rock - paper - scissors match to see who would have to take the little fucker .
Then he'd kick into double plays , drop the bouncy red balls , pick his nose and wipe it on other people , and once he even pooed his pants .
At age ten !
What an ass .
3:30 : That rant only lasted five minutes ?
3:00 must die .3:32:41

Somebody post a funny blog entry or let a natural disaster strike somewhere or let George Bush say something stupid or anything at all .
I hate my computer and I hate my co-workers and if that stupid fuck from Siebel calls again to help me maximize my sales potential I will hunt down his children and turn them into a poorly done , first - try - is - just - for practice taxidermy project .

It 's obvious
He hates me , and invented the human race for his sick sport .
Otherwise
He would have made the day 23 hours , instead of 24 .
I pray to Satan instead , offering to become a serial killer and harvest souls for His Dark Majesty if He 'll only make the next three minutes go by at any semblance of normal speed .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
St. Paul , Minnesota — August 12 , 2008 — Impeach for Peace ( IfP ) , along with others looking to demonstrate at the Republican National Convention ( RNC ) , filed a lawsuit Friday with the help of the ACLU of Minnesota in Ramsey County District Court demanding our right to free speech .
Plaintiffs include : Jodin Morey and Mikael Rudolph of Impeach for Peace , Colleen and Ross Rowley , and Ron Deharporte .
Impeach for Peace is a grassroots , nonpartisan organization based in Minnesota with chapters in twelve states throughout the country working to achieve the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney and holding them and future elected officials fully accountable under the Rule of Law .
The RNC is having their election year convention in St. Paul , Minnesota at the Xcel Energy Center .
During this event , the St. Paul Police have decided to relegate most speech activities in what they call the “ ˜Primary Event Area ’ to an inadequate “ ˜Designated Public Assembly Area ’ or free speech zone .
The “ ˜Primary Event Area ’ remains to be fully defined by the police , making it impossible for people to know where in St .
Paul they can exercise their rights to freedom of expression and assembly .
At the convention , members of congress , mayors , governors , the President and Vice - President of the United States are expected to be in attendance .
This provides IfP and other potential demonstrators with a unique opportunity to express their political messages to these governmental officials .
The lawsuit alleges that the St. Paul City Council and police have created guidelines for the RNC which restrict free speech to areas that are “ inadequate and unacceptably small . ” 
The ACLU also alleges that the City Council / Police denied IfP their due process rights as stipulated in the Minnesota State Constitution by failing to give notice of their plans regarding free speech restrictions , which would have allowed for public comment and a public hearing .
The ACLU also contends that the City Council / Police has also reserved the right to modify the guidelines at any time in ways that the ACLU contends are in violation of the Minnesota State Constitution .
The lawsuit seeks to have the guidelines declared by the court to be in violation of IfP ’s free speech rights , to have the Primary Event Area and the Designated Public Assembly Area clearly defined and officially released to the public , and to have the Designated Public Assembly Area include additional areas that are within sight and sound of the convention .
John Choi , the St. Paul city attorney has said “ These two [ lawsuits ] represent an attempt by the plaintiffs to get another bite at the apple in state court . ”
He continued that the city has afforded “ unprecedented access and accommodations for the protesters . ”
Mr. Choi is incorrect regarding IfP ’s “ bite at the apple , ”  as the plaintiffs on this lawsuit have not previously been a plaintiff in a lawsuit regarding their free speech rights at the RNC .
There was a previous lawsuit with different plaintiffs , but it dealt primarily with a march planned , not the specifics of the Designated Public Assembly Area .
Secondly , while Mr. Choi and Impeach for Peace may differ as to what is an acceptable amount of restriction on free speech , these differences could have been worked out if the city had engaged in its constitutional due process requirements .
Those interested in IfP ’s plans for the RNC , are invited to attend a meeting at Joe ’s Garage on the north side of Loring Park in Minneapolis on Sunday , August 17 , at 4 p.m .

Netflix is scrambling to find answers over delays and outages .
According to the company it is hoping to bring its systems online overnight .
These issues will come with a price and cost Netflix roughly $ 1.8 million to $ 3.6 million in revenue a day , according to Citi analyst Tony Wible .
On Thursday , Netflix continued to “ to experience significant shipping issues . ”
We were able to ship some DVDs from about half of our distribution centers yesterday but we have n’t yet been able to resume shipping this morning .
Our engineers continue to work around the clock to restore normal operations .
In the meantime , we ’re notifying affected customers via personal email and we ’ve posted a notice on the Netflix Web site .
We ’re as frustrated about this as you are and we once again apologize for the inconvenience .
Longer term , its unclear what impact this will have on the Netflix brand .
I suppose that Netflix ’s problems could be a win for Blockbuster , but it ’s far too early to make that assessment .
Netflix runs on proprietary custom - inventory and customer tracking software .
Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey said the company does n’t “ talk that much ” about the company ’s internal systems .
But he did acknowledge that Netflix ’s back - end systems are mostly home grown .
“ We developed a lot ourselves , ” he said .
Connecting 2 wires to the 2 leads on the vibrator motor is waaaayyyyy more difficult than I anticipated .
Try it yourself and then let me know whether this is more incompetence on my part or legitimate difficulty .
But be forewarned : I broke one phone and spent over 6 hours trying to get this element just right .
Some things I did figure out :
- remove the back of the phone along with the battery and sim card .
after you unscrew the 6 weird screws and pop out the cover to the usb port , the front of the phone will come off as well w/ a little force along the edges .
- the keypad assembly contains the vibrating motor and can be disconnected from the rest of the phone .
if you 're looking down at the keypad , force it upwards on the right side and it'll pop out a snap - on connector .
flip up the ribbon cable connector on the other side and that 'll pop off , too ; my note on the picture below should make this a little more understandable .
- the ribbon cable that runs to the vibrating motor and speaker can also be disconnected .
yeah , this took me forever to figure out : )
In the end , I used a flat ribbon cable from a dismantled cdrom drive just wedged and taped into place .
When this broke , I switched to 2 wires from an ide cable and soldered the more accessible of the 2 while wedging in the other .
We 'll see how long this lasts : )
You know you 've got this wired correctly when you get a brief reading for voltage / amperage on your multimeter when you make the phone vibrate and connect the multimeter leads to the 2 wires from the vibrator motor .
Where the US goes , the UK follows - and this time it 's back into the boom and bust cycles that defined previous decades , says Heather Stewart
Britain and America 's special relationship may have frayed in recent years , but the credit crunch has provided a sharp reminder that where the economy is concerned , it remains rock solid .
Wall Street and the City still march shoulder to shoulder - and the pain being felt by thousands of homeowners on Main Street , USA , will be echoed in the cul - de- sacs and housing estates of Britain before too long .
So when US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was forced to deny on Friday that he was drawing up panic plans to bail out Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , the two giant government - backed mortgage lenders , investors on this side of the Atlantic took fright , and the FTSE100 plunged to its lowest level since late 2005 .
Ever since Paulson brokered the bargain basement takeover of investment bank Bear Stearns earlier this year , investors have clung to a faint hope that the worst of the crisis was over .
But this fresh drama showed the credit crunch entering a new and more damaging phase .
It also provided a worrying omen about the consequences of a long - lasting housing downturn .
For thousands of workers in the UK - in financial services , housebuilding , estate agency - the credit crunch has already hit home in the harsh form of a P45 .
City banks have laid off one wave of staff after another since the new year ; and as the mortgage shortage has sent house prices into a nosedive , mass layoffs have followed in sectors closely tied to the decade - long property boom .
The Home Builders Federation had warned repeatedly that without an urgent cut in interest rates or government - backed action to increase the supply of mortgages , its members would have to make thousands redundant ; and it has been proved depressingly correct .
Barratt Developments announced 1,200 job losses last week , taking the running total of job losses in the industry to more than 5,000 ; and boss Mark Clare warned that there could be more than 30,000 redundancies in the sector before the downturn is over .
Record fuel prices , combined with the threat of a severe economic slowdown , have led many commentators to compare the situation now with the ' stagflation ' of the 1970s ; but as the housing market becomes gloomier by the week , economists have begun to play down the parallels with that era , and mutter instead about echoes of the devastating recessions of the 1980s and early 1990s .
The latest quarterly survey by the British Chambers of Commerce , released last week , showed confidence among its members at its lowest since those years .
It used to be received wisdom among housing market bulls that there could n't be a crash without the ' trigger ' of high unemployment .
But , according to the Halifax , house prices declined by 2 per cent in June alone , and are now down 8.6 per cent on a year ago - while the impact of the credit crunch on the labour market has only just begun .
Mike Hume , chief European economist at Lehman Brothers , says we are already seeing the most rapid decline in property prices for at least 50 years - and raises fears of a major shake - out in the labour market .
Business leaders who remember the boom - bust economy of the 1970s say it is hard to imagine a return to that period .
Martin Sorrell , chief executive of advertising firm WPP and an industry veteran , describes Britain back then as , ' like the Dark Ages ' .
' It was tough .
The country lurched from one crisis to another : miners ' strikes , the four - day week , blackouts and secondary picketing .
At times it was quite depressing : it was hard to see the chinks of light . '
There was barely any respite between this bleak period and the recession of the early 1980s - not through boom and bust but the Thatcher government 's persistence with the monetarist experiment , despite its disastrous effect on employment in manufacturing , and a desire to crush the trade unions at any cost .
In the recession of the early 1990s , social strife may have been less pronounced , but the job losses came thick and fast .
Between the middle of 1990 and the end of 1992 , unemployment increased by 1.4 million , with some 45,000 people joining the dole queue every month .
George Buckley , chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank , sees a number of parallels with the early 1990s , when John Major 's government refused to slash interest rates to kick - start a recovery , because it was determined to stay within the European exchange rate mechanism ( ERM ) , and had to prop up the pound .
' Both then and today , the Bank of England has its hands tied . '
In the downturns suffered since 1997 - during the Asian financial crisis , the dotcom crash and the mini housing slowdown of 2005 - the Bank has been able to ride to the rescue by cutting rates , but this time it is trapped by rocketing oil prices .
' I think that if they came to the view that the economy is heading into a period of negative growth , rather than very weak growth , they would start cutting rates .
The issue is , how quick they 'll be to take that view - and I think they 'll probably drag their feet a bit , ' says Hume .
He believes a recession is now all but inevitable , and forecasts that Bank governor Mervyn King and his colleagues will eventually be forced to slash rates to just 3.5 per cent .
Meanwhile , it is clear that high - profile job losses at financial services firms and housebuilders are just the beginning .
Just as the Bear Stearns rescue marked a hiatus in America 's financial crisis , rather than the end , analysts believe the nationalisation of Northern Rock , and a rash of write - offs and cash calls from Britain 's beleagured banks could be just the first round .
Graham Turner , of GFC Economics , compares the questions over Fanny and Freddie to the plight of cash - strapped lender Bradford & Bingley .
' People are in the markets in both cases asking , what happens if the housing market keeps going down into 2009 ?
They 're getting the same answer , ' he says .
' We 're certain to see more insolvencies in the UK - it 's just a question of when . '
And the longer the banking crisis persists , the more lending will be squeezed , the faster house prices will fall - and the greater becomes the risk to many thousands of jobs .
' This is the most calamitous fall in values that we have seen , ' said one senior City source .
' We 're doing another round of job cuts .
It 's so depressing . '
In construction , there is likely to be a huge knock - on effect among the many thousands of contractors who are already feeling the impact from the precipitous fall in the number of new homes being built , bought and sold .
Alan Ritchie , general secretary of construction union Ucatt , says : ' We 've seen thousands of job losses among housebuilders but that 's just the tip of the iceberg because construction is the most casualised industry in the country .
Most workers are forcibly self - employed .
They do n't get redundancy .'
The big question is how far the lay - offs will spread .
Unemployment is what economists call a ' lagging indicator ' : employers lay off staff only when times have been hard for some months .
' Unemployment actually responds about six months later , ' says Deutsche Bank 's Buckley .
' Firms will keep their labour on : they 'll want to see how serious the potential slowdown 's going to be ; how long it 's going to last .
But there comes a point at which they can't afford it . '
Consumer spending is under extreme pressure , with wages rising relatively slowly while basic costs are spiralling .
With a sharp slowdown in consumer spending looking inevitable , and a number of retailers already reporting falling sales , a rash of job losses in that sector could be around the corner .
Most economists are predicting a sharp increase in unemployment over the next two years .
The OECD has forecast 100,000 job losses , pushing the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent from 5.4 per cent now ; Buckley thinks it will hit 6 per cent .
For the Labour party , the problem with the chilly climate is that it is not only sapping the feelgood factor , but also undermining the oft - repeated claim that Britain 's economy rests on strong foundations , carefully laid down by what Gordon Brown likes to call ' long - term decisions ' made during the government 's early years in power .
Instead , many analysts argue that although the credit crunch was its proximate cause , today 's downturn is in part the inevitable consequence of an extraordinary build - up of personal debt , and a rampant property bubble that was left unchecked - just as America 's travails are partly the payback for the Greenspan boom years .
The Prime Minister has promised an ' economic plan ' to help Britain through these torrid times , and Chancellor Alistair Darling has hinted heavily that he could cancel October 's planned 2 p rise in fuel duty , as a sop to businesses , and the Treasury is hurriedly examining measures to help homeowners .
But there is little cash to spare for a radical tax - cutting package like that launched in the US earlier this year ; and once a housing market downturn gathers pace there is little the government can do , particularly given the high levels of indebtedness among British households .
' Sadly , I think it 's a case of watching the adjustment take place , ' says Hume .
' There is far too much debt in the system , and that 's going to have to unwind , and it 's going to be very painful . '
A recession primer
· Politicians and number - crunchers are all saying that the housing market is overdue for a correction - in other words , however much you thought your home was worth , you were wrong .
· There 's an awful lot of deleveraging going on - banks that have made risky loans trying to get their finances back in order by lending less and asking for more cash from shareholders .
· The Bank of England believes inflation will be brought under control only once a margin of spare capacity has opened up .
In blunt terms , that means higher unemployment , mothballed factories and empty shops and offices .
· In the US , things are more fuzzy : a panel called the Business Cycle Dating Committee decides when a recession is under way - usually some months after the event .
Its definition is 'a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy ... normally visible in real GDP , real income , employment , industrial production , and wholesale - retail sales ' .
Link of the day - How PickyDomains.com Changed The Domain Game For Good
As barriers to the design and photography industries fall , the professionals are getting nervous .
Independent graphic designers and commercial photographers , as well as small companies within the industry , feel threatened by a flood of low - cost images , often produced by amateurs , available online .
So - called microstock
Web sites offer to sell photos submitted by users for as little as $ 1 an image .
Other sites let buyers post open calls for designs and pay for only the submission they like best , a practice that riles graphic designers who say it amounts to working for free .
Affordable digital cameras and desktop design software unlocked the tools of these trades , but the dilemma is n't unique to visual professionals .
In any industry where technology has enabled passionate amateurs to try their hands , businesses face new competitors who may not be motivated by profit .
The line separating professionals from dabblers blurred a little more on July 8 , when leading stock photo agency Getty Images partnered with photo - sharing site Flickr to bring select Flickr users into the Getty collection .
The move comes two years after Getty acquired iStockphoto , a microstock site that sells royalty - free photos uploaded by users .
Small Companies Still Dominate
The rap against microstock sites is that they reduce photos to low - cost commodities .
" People gravitate toward the lowest common denominator , and a lot of the time that has to do with price , " says Martin Trailer , president of the Advertising Photographers of America , a trade group .
Designers , meanwhile , direct their ire at crowdsourcing sites like 99designs , crowdSPRING , and Pixish .
Buyers on these sites bid out work for graphics they need , often at prices that appeal only to hobbyists .
Richard Grefé , director of design association AIGA , says such services miss the point that professional design encompasses more than crafting visuals .
" What you 're getting is a superficial mark , " he says .
Small companies still dominate graphic design and photography .
Of more than 16,700 graphic design firms in the U.S. in 2006 , nearly 80 % had four or fewer employees , and just 24 firms had more than 100 , according to the latest U.S. Census data .
Likewise , 85 % of commercial photography companies employed four or fewer people .
Those figures do n't count the thousands of self - employed designers and photographers , who the government does n't track to such granular levels .
So how much do the new Web offerings really hurt these pros ?
Defenders argue they 've created a new market at a lower price range for customers who never would have paid the fees professional designers or traditional photo agencies charge .
" The great thing that we see in the emergence of microstock is that it 's significantly expanding the pool of people paying for imagery , " says Getty Chief Operating Officer Nick Evans - Lombe .
Backlash
That has n't dampened the backlash any .
Ask Derek Powazek , a designer , photographer , and CEO of Pixish , a San Francisco - based company that lets anyone submit photos or illustrations online in response to open calls for work .
Powazek says that within days of the site 's launch in February , posters on blogs and forums said Pixish would " destroy the design industry . "
He has little sympathy for his critics : " If a three - day - old site can destroy the graphic design industry , then it deserves to be destroyed , " he says .
But to placate them , he posted an extended response on the site and banned logo designs from the permitted assignments .
Powazek argues that the people posting jobs on his site , who generally offer rewards of $ 100 or less , are n't the same customers that use graphic design shops .
Sites like Pixish give talented hobbyists ways to build their portfolios and get exposure , he adds .
Professionals scapegoat microstock sites and crowdsourced design services instead of examining why their own businesses are struggling , Powazek contends .
" This is n't Flickr 's fault .
It 's yours , " he adds .
But what should photographers and graphic designers do ?
They need to target that part of the market that is n't looking for the lowest price , experts say , because budget Web sites have already won those customers .
" Designers as a profession should be moving up the value chain , " says the design association 's Grefé .
" What designers need to do is to explain that inherent in most design is the branding and the essence of the company . "
Persistence Required
As the burden shifts to professionals to explain the value of their work , that may put some creative types out of their comfort zones , Grefé says .
" They have to reposition themselves in their promotional material .
They have to get out and talk to small and medium size businesses .
They 've got to be in front of the Rotary Club and the Kiwanis , " he says .
Photographers likewise should develop relationships with clients more interested in quality than price , say industry players on both sides of the debate .
One company positioning itself as a photographer - friendly alternative to microstock sites with its PhotoShelter site is Bitshelter .
The New York startup , founded in 2005 , wo n't let photographers list their images for sale for less than $ 50 .
" We really want to take a stand against the $ 1 image , " says PhotoShelter CEO Allen Murabayashi .
The company is targeting image buyers like ad agencies , design firms , and publications �the part of the market that belongs to traditional stock agencies rather than microstock sites .
It offers photographers 70 % of sales , compared with the 20 % to 30 % Getty offers .
But it 's not yet clear whether PhotoShelter will become a viable avenue for photographers .
San Francisco freelancer Lane Hartwell said she never made a sale on PhotoShelter , nor had any colleagues she knew of .
Ultimately , creative professionals need to communicate the value they create for clients so they can differentiate themselves from commodity - priced images .
Dan Heller , an independent photographer in Marin County , Calif. , and author of Profitable Photography in Digital Age , says beginning photographers should expect to spend four years creating an online presence , networking , and building their own brands before they turn a profit .
It takes persistence and business sense as much as talent , he says .
" Selling yourself is not selling your photos , " Heller says .
" You can't say , ' My images are worth a premium , ' but you can say , ' I am worth a premium . ' "

GENEVA ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s most powerful particle accelerator , aimed at unlocking secrets of the universe , will be launched on September 10 , the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) said on Thursday .

The world 's most powerful particle accelerator , aimed at unlocking secrets of the universe , will be launched on September 10 , the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Handout
The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , housed in an underground tunnel 27 kilometers ( 17 miles ) in circumference , will recreate conditions just after the Big Bang which many scientists believe gave birth to the universe .
It will seek to collide two beams of particles at close to the speed of light .
“ The first attempt to circulate a beam in the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) will be made on September 10 , ” the Geneva - based CERN said in a statement .
The LHC will study a new frontier of physics , producing beams with seven times more energy than any previous machine .
But starting it up is not as simple as flipping a switch .
Each of its eight sectors must be cooled to their operating temperature of minus 271 degrees Celsius ( minus 456 degrees Fahrenheit ) , colder than outer space .
This phase is reaching a successful conclusion but electrical testing must follow .
“ We ’re finishing a marathon with a sprint , ” said LHC project leader Lyn Evans .
“ It ’s been a long haul and we ’re all eager to get the LHC research program underway . ”
Scientists hope the experiment will help explain fundamental questions such as how particles acquire mass .
They will also probe the mysterious dark matter of the universe and investigate why there is more matter than antimatter .
Some 10,000 scientists from around the world have worked on the complex 10 billion Swiss franc ( $ 9.5 billion ) apparatus since construction began in 1994 , a spokesman said .
The US dollar rallied fast and furious last week .
The dollar rally was the biggest in 8 years vs. the Euro .
This immediately brought out calls of Dollar Intervention such as the one below .
Note : the arrow and circle in deep blue were added by me .

The very large drop recently ( the pale blue line ) tells part of the story .
Another part is told by the Treasury site itself - that recent data about the drop was delayed for almost three weeks before it was made public .
Another part is told by very recent data not being made public for the last two weeks running .
What the ESF did is simply sold about 10 billion Euros and bought dollars - plain and simple massive intervention that virtually everyone has missed or ignored or pretended does n't exist or whatever .
The raw facts are sitting there at U.S. International Reserve Position .
Mystery Solved
On July 15th the US Dollar Index closed at 71.87 , the lowest close since reaching its record low in April .
However , rather than continue lower and fall off the edge of the cliff , the Dollar Index suddenly and mysteriously reversed course .
It has now risen on 12 of the 17 trading days since reaching that low , and closed today at 74.55 , a 5 - month high .
What caused this index to suddenly pull back from the brink and then reverse course to shoot higher over the past three weeks ?
There has not been any news exceptionally favorable to the dollar .
In fact , the banking problems in the United States continue to mount , while the federal government 's deficit continues to soar out of control .
On July 28th Reuters reported that " The Bush administration on Monday plans to project the U.S. budget deficit will soar to a new record ... because of the slowing economy and an economic stimulus plan approved this year . "
So what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks ?
In a word , intervention . ...
Oil was falling which would help the US balance of trade .
Container shipments into the US were weakening which would also suggest an improvement in the balance of trade .
Economic activity in Europe had started to crater .

Marc Faber Weighs In
Can Currency Intervention Halt the U.S. Dollar ’s Nosedive
The story below from the Associated Press , the largest news agency in the world , may be most notable for acknowledging the potential for government intervention in the currency markets -- market manipulation , really -- and for reporting the surmise of an expert in the energy business that oil has been monetized , replacing the U.S. dollar as the world currency , becoming the " new gold . "
It would take great sums of money to make any difference .
The foreign exchange market is the largest in the world , with over $ 1 trillion traded each day .
Intervention advocates must believe that if the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and a few other central banks joined the fray , that a better outcome would be achieved .
However , any additional efforts to artificially prop up the ailing dollar will be equally ineffective .
Even if ECB intervention could slow the dollar ’s descent , what possible reason would the Fed ’s European counterpart have for doing so ?
The ECB is already concerned about inflation and is preparing to raise rates as a result .
A Look At Japan 's Intervention in 2003 - 2004
Why is Japan intervening ?
Because it believes the yen needs to be held down to keep Japanese exports competitive .
The policy of intervention began in earnest in August last year , when the decline of the dollar gathered pace .
In 2003 , the Japanese government spent $ 100 bn buying dollars in an attempt to hold down the value of the yen .
In the first two months of this year , it spent another $ 100bn .
And Japan ’s parliament has authorised the spending of a further $ 360 bn this year .

The Primary Trend Cannot Be Suppressed
To Scroll Thru My Recent Post List
About two years ago I was looking at a map of the world and noticed that Britain seemed disproportionately large .
My companion remarked that this was because in days of yore whoever was drawing the map always made their country look bigger and more important .
This nugget of information sticks in the brain .
So for the last two years I 've been taking pictures of Britain on world maps .
Not accurate maps , but drawings or illustrations of maps .
The differences are amazing .
You might assume that all maps were accurate , or at least accurate - ish .
But no , designers play fast and loose with the truth making the host country bigger , more important or more central .
Look at Britain in these photos .
Look at the size of it compared to Europe .
It 's the same , but different .
Americans will be used to seeing this map of the world .
Whereas Europeans will be used to seeing this map of the world .
In this instance one is n't more accurate than the other , but the perception is very different and the power designers wield in shaping that perception is huge .
New Zealanders can often play Spot Our Country .
Next time you see a map of the world on the BBC News or in the paper , look for New Zealand .
Odds are it will have been left out in the name of aesthetics .
If it 's not left out then it 's cropped to within an inch of it's life .
Most New Zealanders would probably prefer their maps to look like this .
The answer to most of these problems is to look at the world via Buckminster Fuller 's amazing Dymaxion Map .
OK , OK , we 're drifting off the point a little bit .
Map projection is a huge topic and this Wikipedia page is a good place to start .
There 's also a good article called The Map Gap on BBC News .
Back to where we started .
Over the last few months I took lots of photos of maps , you can see them on Flickr .
Today I traced over England , Scotland and Wales .
Please note these tracings were done quickly and are n't massively detailed .
The results are quite odd .
They all look pretty different do n't they ?
You know it 's Great Britain , but some of them are wild approximations .
Next I dropped them all on top of each other ( here I left off Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland because I wanted to compare just one shape ) .
That 's a bit higgledy piggledy so I filled them all in .
Viola !
The mean shape of England , Scotland and Wales by 14 graphic designers .
Not very accurate , is it ?
This is n't a cartography blog and I know some of these maps are over stylised for a reason but I want to make a wider point about graphic designers and the assumptions we make and how easily they are accepted .
If you look at all the maps on Flickr they all look kind of OK .
When I put them all together it looks like madness .
Like people having been taking liberties with the truth .
Think of other times you do this .
Hierarchies are a good example .
The point of bold and italic and underline is to make one piece of text more important than the other .
But how many times do you see a poster where the text is bold , italic and underlined ?
I bet I could get a load of notices like that and achieve the same effect as the 14 shapes above .
Everything would be bold .
Premiumisation - there 's a word that really fucks me off .
I once heard the MD of a famous packing company droning on about how his firm 's USP was that they could design premiumisation into any old piece of packaging .
In case you 're wondering , that means lots of over elaborate folds , some foil blocking and a healthy does of script and moody photography .
Problem is , take a look at the chocolate cakes in Tescos , I bet you 'll find 10 ' premiumised ' brands , 4 value brands and nothing inbetween .
What I 'm saying is that graphic designers have a certain amount of power , people tend to trust what they see without much questioning .
We should use that power carefully .
' SUPPORT THE troops " is an American lie .
This nation is grievously and knowingly failing the young men and women who wear the uniform of its military services , and nothing demonstrates that more powerfully than the suicides of soldiers .
According to the Army 's own figures , the rate of suicide among active duty personnel nearly doubled between 2001 and 2006 .
The number then grew even higher in 2007 , when suicide ranked third as the cause of death among members of the National Guard .
Even if proximate causes vary from war zones to home fronts , such data are anomalous , since suicide rates among soldiers historically go down during wartime , not up .
Veterans , too , are in trouble .
In May , the head of the National Institute of Mental Health warned of " a gathering storm . "
Thomas Insel told the American Psychiatric Association that one in five of the 1.6 million soldiers who have been deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan ( or more than 300,000 ) suffer from post - traumatic stress syndrome or depression .
Potentially life - threatening mental disorders , including self - destructive behavior like addiction , raise the prospect , in Insel 's words , of " suicides and psychological mortality trumping combat deaths . "
As America has steadily averted its gaze from the actualities of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , so , too , has the nation refused to look at what is happening to those it sends to fight .
Repeated deployments to war zones , combined with meager support upon returning home , are leaving many soldiers adrift .
Each one who commits suicide , or attempts to ( more than 2,000 last year ) , shows this .
It would be presumptuous to draw conclusions from any single instance of such despair , but taken as a whole , these acts of self - destruction lay bare some difficult truths .
The war in Iraq , in particular , is an exercise in the obliteration of meaning .
The war 's essence is its lack of essence .
The war 's catch - 22 is that its stated goal is social order , while the American presence itself creates disorder .
Our troops know this .
They arrive in the war zone with every intention of protecting an innocent population from the enemy , only to discover that the enemy and the population are indistinguishable .
" Insurgents " often turn out to be , not ideologues , much less " terrorists , " but only cousins of those already killed .
Victims and victimizers are alike .
Suspicion is ubiquitous .
No one trusts Americans .
Such contradictions make the war controversial in the United States , but in Iraq they make the soldiers ' situation intolerable .
These particular problems exist within a larger context of collapsing sources of meaning .
The myths on which the military ethos depend have been broken .
Whatever ethnic fevers grip Iraqis , for example , American soldiers know , if only unconsciously , that the passion for nationhood on which 19th - and 20th - century wars depended is being undercut by the global citizenship of the 21st century .
Not since Earth was seen whole from the moon is nationalism what it was .
Even more transforming , faith in technological violence as an instrument of justice is being undercut by the catastrophic planetary outcome that can already be anticipated if technological violence is not curbed .
The human naiveté that uses violence in the name of ending violence can no longer be sustained .
For Americans plunged into the heart of this contradiction , the unbridled violence of their own nation points to the suicide of the very species .
But for American soldiers , it is more personal even than that .
For meaning 's sake , their purpose has been defined around loyalty .
Unit cohesion is the absolute virtue .
Thus our soldiers prepare to die not for Iraq , nor even for America , but for one another .
" I 've got your back , " they promise .
In combat , such commitment is often heroically fulfilled , but , alas , once the bureaucracy replaces the buddy , loyalty , too , is found to be a lie .
Harsh to say , but the American military cares nothing for the individuals who comprise it , only for the mission those individuals , in formation , can accomplish .
Hence the shameful exploitation of troops in disabling redeployments , and the resulting abuse of their families .
Hence the nation 's abandonment of those , who , upon discharge , find no unit , no cohesion , and their backs against the wall .
Support the troops ?
On your bumper .
Suicide is always a tragedy , and , whether accompanied by a note , always a message - one that survivors must read .
In the case of soldier suicides , we Americans are all their next of kin .
Their despair demands our attention .
What are they telling us ?
James Carroll 's column appears regulary in the Globe .

In a paper published in the journal Nature Materials , EPFL professor Michael Graetzel , Shaik Zakeeruddin and colleagues from the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have achieved a record light conversion efficiency of 8.2 % in solvent - free dye - sensitized solar cells .
This breakthrough in efficiency without the use of volatile organic solvents will make it possible to pursue large scale , outdoor practical application of lightweight , inexpensive , flexible dye - sensitized solar films that are stable over long periods of light and heat exposure .
Dye - sensitized solar cell technology , invented by Michael Graetzel at EPFL in the 1990s , shows great promise as a cheap alternative to expensive silicon solar cells .
Dye - sensitized cells imitate the way that plants and certain algae convert sunlight into energy .
The cells are made up of a porous film of tiny ( nanometer sized ) white pigment particles made out of titanium dioxide .
The latter are covered with a layer of dye which is in contact with an electrolyte solution .
When solar radiation hits the dye it injects a negative charge in the pigment nanoparticle and a positive charge into the electrolyte resulting in the conversion of sunlight into electrical energy .
The cells are inexpensive , easy to produce and can withstand long exposure to light and heat compared with traditional silicon - based solar cells .
Currently , state - of - the - art dye - sensitized cells have an overall light conversion efficiency greater than 11 % , still about two times lower than silicon cell technology .
A major drawback to the dye - sensitized cell technology is the electrolyte solution , which is made up of volatile organic solvents and must be carefully sealed .
This , along with the fact that the solvents permeate plastics , has precluded large - scale outdoor application and integration into flexible structures .
To overcome these limitations , Graetzel and his colleagues developed a new concept -- a mixture of three solid salts as an alternative to using organic solvents as an electrolyte solution .
When the three solid components are mixed together in the right proportion they turn into a melt showing excellent stability and efficiency .
Graetzel is confident that further development of these types of electrolyte mixtures will lead to large - scale practical application of dye - sensitized solar cell technology , reinforcing solar energy 's role as a cornerstone of alternative energy production .

X Factor girl who made false rape claim against her ex-fiance walks free from court
Vengeful : Capon had earlier accused Mr Tysoe of kissing another woman
A woman who auditioned for the X Factor has walked free from court after crying rape against her former fiance .
Gemma Capon invented the allegation after she and Graham Tysoe 's turbulent six - month relationship came to an end .
The 20 - year - old , who has twice auditioned for the hit ITV show , told detectives he forced his way into their home and attacked her on the living room sofa .
Mr Tysoe , also 20 , was arrested in front of colleagues at the pub where he works as a chef and held for almost 24 hours .
He was interviewed , had his DNA , fingerprints and mugshot taken and was subjected to intrusive forensic examinations .
When police confronted Capon with discrepancies in her story a day later she confessed that she had made it all up and was charged with wasting police time .
District Judge Tim Daber said her behaviour had undermined the ' credibility ' of genuine complaints .
Yet , instead of a six - month maximum jail term , Capon was given a 12 - week suspended sentence and ordered to pay £ 95 costs .
Mr Tysoe 's mother , Sharon , a 42 - year - old staff nurse , said : ' I 'm livid .
She should never have got away with it .
' It was vicious and vindictive and the sentence has made a mockery of the justice system .
It sends the message that false accusers can get away with it .'
Mr Tysoe started dating Capon in November last year .
They had known each other from school but lost touch before being reunited over the internet , Southend Magistrates '
Court heard .
Falsely accused : Graham Tysoe was arrested in his workplace
On New Year 's Eve , after a whirlwind romance , Mr Tysoe proposed .
But in April the relationship faltered after Capon falsely accused him of kissing another woman .
He told her that he had been on ' a boys ' night out ' and had air - kissed a friend who was helping plan a surprise engagement party .
Within weeks the couple had split up .
At the beginning of June Mr Tysoe returned to the flat they shared in Shoeburyness , Essex , to collect his belongings .
But days later he was arrested on suspicion of rape .
Capon , who has twice auditioned for X Factor , accused him of barging in and raping her on the sofa .
' I was arrested at work in front of colleagues and customers .
It was humiliating , ' said Mr Tysoe .
' I thought , " Oh god , no , this ca n't be happening " .
' I thought I was going to be locked up for something I did n't do .
I just kept thinking , " What 's going to happen to me ? " .'
Mr Tysoe , who had an alibi , was released on bail and later that day Capon , a fast - food waitress , admitted lying to the police .
Officers spent 156 hours investigating the false claims , the court was told .
Alan Hurst , mitigating , said his client was ' genuinely sorry ' .
After the hearing , Mr Tysoe said : ' I hate her .
I do n't think she realises what she 's done . '

Sue Jones - Davies ( centre ) with the Monty Python team on the film
She 's not the messiah , she 's the mayor of Aberystwyth and she has a plan .
Sue Jones - Davies is trying to overturn a near 30 - year ban imposed by the town on Monty Python 's Life of Brian - the film in which she played a role .
Long before she donned her mayoral robes in the mid Wales town , she played Brian 's girlfriend in the movie .
Opponents claimed it made fun of Jesus , but she says it is " amazing " that a town like hers still officially bars a movie now regarded as a comedy classic .
In 1979 , however , it grabbed the headlines for the wrong reasons , with critics accusing the Python team of blasphemy with its story about a Jewish man who was mistaken for the messiah and then crucified .
Some religious groups picketed cinemas which screened the film .
Given what 's on TV now I think it 's amazing a ban in Aberystwyth still exists
Sue Jones - Davies
A number of areas in Wales banned it , as former Python John Cleese recalled during an interview on Channel 4's Richard and Judy programme on Wednesday .
But nearly 30 years on , the new mayor of Aberystwyth wants the restriction lifted in her town .
" Given what 's on TV now I think it 's amazing a ban in Aberystwyth still exists , " said Ms Jones - Davies .
" I think it should be lifted .
" I would like to think that any religion would have the generosity to see the film for what it is , which is a comedy .
" I was surprised at the outrage it caused at the time , but I did not expect or appreciate the impact and never thought it would turn out to be so popular . "
The movie has maintained its popularity .
It is usually at or near the top of lists of the greatest comedy films .
It featured some iconic lines , most famously the verdict by Brian 's mother on her son : " He 's not the messiah - he 's a very naughty boy " .
Parts of the script are still quoted at Ms Jones - Davies today , but she confessed the lines were wasted on her : " I ca n't remember the lines from the script now - it 's nearly 30 years ago , " she explained .
Sue Jones - Davies as Judith Iscariot in the Life of Brian Ms Jones - Davies played a revolutionary called Judith Iscariot , and she had a nude scene with the film 's hero , Brian , played by the late Graham Chapman .
But she very nearly did n't appear in the movie at all .
" I got the part because somebody dropped out , " she said .
" I had the same agent as John Cleese and was recommended for the part .
" I went for an interview at a flat in London and all the Monty Python crew were there .
" It was quite funny really because it was n't a proper interview at all , as you 'd expect with Monty Python .
" They were all chipping in and saying , ' Oh yes , she 'll be fine ' .
I was n't asked many questions . "
It was shot in Tunisia , but part of the crucifixion scene had to be filmed in a sandpit in Kent .
" It was great fun to work on , and we had the odd day off .
One day I went with Terry Gilliam to buy a carpet and driving along we came to a river , " she added .
" Local people nearby were warning us not to go through it , but Terry just drove on - I thought we were going to sink but we managed to make to the other side . "
Recalling her famous nude scene , Ms Jones - Davies said : " It was a part and I just played it , although I did call for a closed set .
' Commercial impact '
" It was filmed in a sort of small tunnel , and was n't very sensual at all . "
It is understood a committee made up of church leaders in Aberystwyth recommended a ban in 1979 .
Ceredigion council has the power to lift it , but a spokesman said no - one in the licensing department knew about the ban .
But Michael Davies , the owner of Aberystwyth 's Commodore Cinema , said he was sure it was still in place .
" As far as I know the Life of Brian is still banned from being shown at the cinema , " he explained .
" My father ran the cinema when the ban was imposed and I suppose it would have had a commercial impact at the time because it was a huge film and made a fortune .
" I do n't think lifting the ban now would make much of a difference . "
Stars such as Spike Milligan and ex-Beatle George Harrison , who financed the Life of Brian when no - one else would , played cameo roles .

A Long , Hard Look at Mr. Quammen’s
“ Evidence ” for Evolution In his National Geographic article , David Quammen remarked : Evolution is both a beautiful concept , and an important one� .
The essential points are slightly more complicated than most people assume , but not so complicated that they ca n’t be comprehended by any attentive person .
Furthermore , the supporting evidence is abundant , various , ever increasing , solidly interconnected , and easily available in museums , popular books , textbooks , and a mountainous accumulation of peer - reviewed scientific studies ( p. 8 ) .
So what is the evidence that is self - evident to “ any attentive person ” ?
Mr. Quammen summarized it in two distinct parts — the evolution of species , and natural selection .
As corroborating evidence , he listed four main areas : biogeography , paleontology , embryology , and morphology .
Fair enough .
Let ’s examine the evidence he provided in his article , and see if his assertion that evolution is a “ fact ” can be supported by the available evidence .
As a rebuttal to the information contained in David Quammen ’s article in the November 2004 issue of National Geographic , we offer the following .
Natural Selection Mr. Quammen , in commenting on how evolution is supposed to work , commented : “ Two big ideas , not just one , are at issue : the evolution of all species , as a historical phenomenon , and natural selection , as the main mechanism causing that phenomenon .
The first is a question of what happened .
The second is a question of how ” ( p. 8 , emp. added ) .
Quammen went to explain how natural selection works as a mechanism of evolution .
The gist of the concept is that small , random , heritable changes among individuals result in difference chances of survival and reproduction — success for some , death without offspring for others — and that this natural culling leads to significant changes in shape , size , strength , chemistry , and behavior among the descendants .
Excess population growth drives the competitive struggle .
Because less successful competitors produce fewer surviving offspring , the useless or negative variations tend to disappear , whereas the useful variations tend to be perpetuated and gradually magnified throughout a population ( p. 8 ) .
Conspicuously missing from the National Geographic article , of course , was any reference to the many evolutionists who have stated that natural selection is , in essence , little more than a tautology ( viz. , it is based on circular reasoning ) .
The truth is , Mr. Quammen ’s evolutionary cohorts have been acknowledging this obvious fact for years .
T.H. Morgan , the eminent geneticist and pioneer of fruit - fly research , seems to have been one of the first to spot the problem .
He wrote early in the twentieth century : “ For it may be little more than a truism to state that the individuals that are best adapted to survive have a better chance of surviving than those not so well adapted to survive ” ( as quoted in Bethell , 1976 ) .
British evolutionist Francis Hitching observed that “ Darwinism , as Darwin wrote it , could be simply but nonsensically stated : survivors survive .
Which is certainly a tautology ; and tells us nothing about how species originate , as even Darwin ’s supporters admit ” ( 1982 , p. 84 , emp. added ) .
Dr. Hitching even went so far as to note that “ a tautology ( or truism ) is a self - evident , circular statement empty of meaning , such as ‘ Darwin was a man , ’ or ‘ biology is studied by biologists . ’
The trouble with natural selection ( and survival of the fittest ) is that it seems to fall into this category ” ( p. 84 , parenthetical items in orig . ) .
Some well - known evolutionists have been trying for years to get their own colleagues to concede that natural selection is a tautology .
Somehow , natural selection is supposed to ensure the “ survival of the fittest , ” but the only pragmatic way to define the “ fittest ” is ( you guessed it ! ) “ those that survive . ”
At a professional symposium on Neo-Darwinism , geneticist C.H. Waddington of Edinburgh University opined :
The theory of neo -Darwinism is a theory of the evolution of the changing of the population in respect to leaving offspring and not in respect to anything else .
Nothing else is mentioned in the mathematical theory of neo-Darwinism .
It is smuggled in , and everybody has in the back of his mind that the animals that leave the largest number of offspring are going to be those best adapted also for eating peculiar vegetation , or something of this sort ; but this is not explicit in the theory .
All that is explicit is that they will leave more offspring .
There , you do come to what is , in effect , a vacuous statement : Natural selection is that some things leave more offspring than others ; and you ask , which leave more offspring than others ; and it is those that leave more offspring ; and there is nothing more to it than that .
The whole guts of evolution — which is , how do you come to have horses and tigers and things — is outside the mathematical theory ( as quoted in Moorhead and Kaplan , 1967 , p. 14 , emp. added ) .
Waddington is not alone in his assessment of the serious problems facing evolution as a result of natural selection having been shown to be a circular argument .
G.A. Peseley joined the ranks of those criticizing natural selection as evolution ’s mechanism when he stated :
One of the most frequent objections against the theory of natural selection is that it is a sophisticated tautology .
Most evolutionary biologists seem unconcerned about the charge and make only a token effort to explain the tautology away .
The remainder , such as Professors Waddington and Simpson , will simply concede the fact .
For them , natural selection is a tautology which states a heretofore unrecognized relation : the fittest — defined as those who will leave the most offspring — will leave the most offspring .
What is most unsettling is that some evolutionary biologists have no qualms about proposing tautologies as explanations .
One would immediately reject any lexicographer who tried to define a word by the same word , or a thinker who merely restated his proposition , or any other instance of gross redundancy ; yet no one seems scandalized that men of science should be satisfied with a major principle which is no more than a tautology ( 1982 , 38:74 ) .
Arthur Koestler , vitalist philosopher and author , incisively described the tautology of natural selection in these words :
Once upon a time , it all looked so simple .
Nature rewarded the fit with the carrot of survival and punished the unfit with the stick of extinction .
The trouble only started when it came to defining fitness ....
Thus natural selection looks after the survival and reproduction of the fittest , and the fittest are those which have the highest rate of reproduction ....
We are caught in a circular argument which completely begs the question of what makes evolution evolve ( 1978 , p. 170 ) .
Yet , as Harvard - trained lawyer Norman MacBeth observed : “ In the meantime , the educated public continues to believe that Darwin has provided all the relevant answers by the magic formula of random mutations plus natural selection — quite unaware of the fact that random mutations turned out to be irrelevant and natural selection a tautology ” ( 1982 , 2:18 ) .
James E. Lloyd , editor of the Florida Entomologist , condemned evolution with faint praise ( while simultaneously attempting to prop up its alleged factuality ) when he wrote : Natural selection , though it may be tautological and philosophically a poor theory in the various ways it is usually stated ( e.g. , “ survival of the fittest ” ) , and perhaps not even capable of being falsified , is nevertheless profound and axiomatic .
It provides the most useful insight for problem solving that biological science has , and is the heart and soul of behavioral ecology ( 1982 , 65:1 , emp. added ) .
The problem for natural selection , however , does not end there .
In fact , it gets even more serious .
As Stephen J. Gould observed : “ The essence of Darwinism lies in a single phrase : natural selection is the creative force of evolutionary change .
No one denies that selection will play a negative role in eliminating the unfit .
Darwinian theories require that it create the fit as well ” ( 1977 b , p. 28 ) .
Unfortunately , creating the fit is the one thing natural selection cannot do .
As the famous Dutch botanist Hugo deVries put it : “ Natural selection may explain the survival of the fittest , but it cannot explain the arrival of the fittest ” ( 1905 , pp. 825-826 ) .
The late English paleontologist Colin Patterson placed the matter in its proper focus when he commented that “ �most of the current argument in neo -Darwinism is about this question : how a species originates .
And it is there that natural selection seems to be fading out , and chance mechanisms of one sort or another are being invoked ” ( 1982 ) .
National Geographic ’s Quammen , like a skilled magician , employed natural selection as a mechanism for macroevolutionary processes , and then with a convenient sleight - of - hand trick , proceeded to offer as “ proof ” examples of microevolution .
With impressive , full - color photographs ( provided by Rob Clark ) , Quammen used the tired old argument of Darwin ’s finches ( pp. 26-27,30 ) as a demonstration of natural selection , citing specifically the well - known scientific studies of Peter Grant from Princeton University who , with his wife Rosemary , has spent the past several decades observing changes in finches ’ beaks on the Gal�pagos Islands ( p. 30 ) .
In the end , all that the Grants discovered was that finches ’ beaks change .
The finches , however , always remained finches .
They did not turn into something else .
Quammen also referred to variation among dogs ( pp. 16 - 17 ) .
If this is the best the evolutionists have to offer , then their theory is in far worse trouble than even they seem to realize .
Creationists never have objected to the idea of natural selection as a mechanism for eliminating the unfit , non-adapted organisms .
As a matter of fact , creationists long before Darwin were advocating natural selection as a conservation principle .
Few people are aware , apparently , that natural selection was not Charles Darwin ’s discovery .
A creationist zoologist / chemist by the name of Edward Blyth ( 1810 - 1873 ) wrote about it in the years between 1835 and 1837 , well before Darwin .
Some evolutionists , like the late Loren Eiseley ( Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science at the University of Pennsylvania ) , even have gone so far as to question the incredible similarity between Blyth ’s essays and those of Charles Darwin ( 1959 ) , hinting at plagiarism on Darwin ’s part .
Eiseley wrote that “ the leading tenets of Darwin ’s work — the struggle for existence , variation , natural selection , and sexual selection — are all fully expressed in a paper written by Blyth in 1835 ” ( 1979 , p. 55 ) .
That fact has not been lost on creationists .
Ian Taylor , in his book ,
In the Minds of Men , discussed Darwin ’s reading of Patrick Matthew ’s 1831 essay , Naval Timber and Arboriculture , which in its appendix contained the phrase “ this natural process of selection ” — a phrase that Darwin changed slightly to “ natural means of selection ” and incorporated into his very first essay , published in 1842 ( 1984 , p. 125 ) .
As a screening device for eliminating the unfit , natural selection represents the Creator ’s plan for preventing harmful mutations from affecting and even destroying the entire species .
Further , to employ an old adage , that which says too much says nothing at all .
The long neck of the giraffe and the short neck of the hippopotamus are both explicable by natural selection , as are both the dull coloration of the peppered moth and the brilliant colors of the bird of paradise .
Natural selection “ explains ” everything , and therefore really explains nothing .
It can not create new genera , families , phyla , etc .
It can not explain adaptation .
The fact that an organism is adapted to its environment tells us absolutely nothing about how it came to be adapted .
Any organisms not so adapted would not have survived , but this constitutes no proof that those organisms that did survive possessed adaptations produced by evolution .
Yet Gould has admitted that natural selection must be able to “ create the fit ” if it is to be deemed successful in an evolutionary scenario .
This , it can not do .
And it certainly cannot explain the vast complexity of life around us .
Tautologous arguments are not equipped with the power to “ explain ” such , much less “ create ” such .
As Swedish biologist S�ren L�vtrup wrote ( mincing no words ! ) :
After this step - wise elimination , only one possibility remains : the Darwinian theory of natural selection , whether or not coupled with Mendelism , is false .
I have already shown that the arguments advanced by the early champions were not very compelling , and that there are now considerable numbers of empirical facts which do not fit with the theory .
Hence , to all intents and purposes the theory has been falsified , so why has it not been abandoned ?
I think the answer is that current evolutionists follow Darwin ’s example — they refuse to accept falsifying evidence ( p. 352 , emp. added ) .
Enough said !
Biogeography
As one of his supporting pieces of “ evidence , ” Quammen leaned heavily on biogeography — a branch of science that attempts to document and understand spatial patterns of biodiversity among plants and animals .
In speaking of Darwin , Mr. Quammen commented : Biogeography , for instance , offered a great pageant of peculiar facts and patterns .
Anyone who considers the biogeographical data , Darwin wrote , must be struck by the mysterious clustering pattern among what he called “ closely allied ” species — that is , similar creatures sharing roughly the same body plan .
Such closely allied species tend to be found on the same continent ( several species of Zebra in Africa ) or within the same group of oceanic islands ( dozens of species of honeycreepers in Hawaii , thirteen species of Gal�pagos finch ) , despite their species - by - species preferences for different habitats , food sources , or conditions of climate� .
Why should “ closely allied ” species inhabit neighboring patches of habitat ?
And why should similar habitat on different continents be occupied by species that are n’t so closely allied ?
“ We see in these facts some deep organic bond , ” Darwin wrote .
“ This bond , on my theory , is simply inheritance . ”
Similar species occur nearby in space because they have descended from common ancestors ( pp. 9 - 10 , parenthetical items in orig , emp. added ) .
So there you have it .
Because certain plants or animals share “ roughly the same body plan ” and “ tend to be found on the same continent , ” they therefore are genetically related , and have come from a common ancestor .
Evolutionists suggest that only evolution can explain why there are certain creatures in one location ( like kangaroos in Australia ) , but not in another location .
One thing Mr. Quammen apparently “ forgot ” to mention as he was discussing his “ evidence ” is that biogeography is usually not even an “ experimental ” science .
It is mostly a comparative observational branch , due to the fact that the spatial and temporal scales are commonly too large for true experimentation .
Thus , this field speculates about what determines where a species to lives , and what prevents it from colonizing in other areas .
Most biogeographers try to evaluate three processes in explaining what is found in nature : evolution ; extinction ; and dispersal .
Obviously , however , formulating theories and predictions while having already accepted evolution as a “ fact , ” will grossly bias any interpretation of the scientific data .
For instance , we know today that many species have suspicious resemblances to supposedly different species that “ just happen ” to live nearby .
They appear this way , even though another species — designed differently — would seem to be a better fit .
For example , the trees on the remote island of St. Helena are unlike the trees anywhere else on Earth .
Sunflowers appear to be the “ closest relative ” to the strange gumwood tree and to the native cabbage - trees .
And , the most closely related sunflower is the local sunflower .
The scientific explanation is that this volcanic island originally was formed far away from any continent , and therefore started out with no land plants .
Eventually , some sunflower seeds managed to get there .
Since nothing else was filling the role of “ tree , ” these sunflowers filled that role .
Transformed by time , competition , and the demands of their role , they now look like trees .
The only problem with this explanation is that no macroevolution has occurred .
Sunflowers are still sunflowers .
Examples like this can be found on almost every remote island , and evolutionists are quick to try and use such examples as proof for their theory .
In the Gal�pagos Islands , the absence of woodpeckers has caused some finches — which obtain their food in a manner similar to woodpeckers — to fit into the “ woodpecker ” niche .
Most scientists today suspect that finches were one of the only “ land birds ” to occupy the Gal�pagos , and as such , the birds have modified beaks that allow them to take advantage of various food sources .
Moving to the North American continent , we now know that birds are the same on both sides of the Grand Canyon , yet there are different rodents on each side .
The obvious explanation is that the canyon isolates groups of rodents , but does not isolate birds .
Such differences permit us to speculate on what allows a species to live where it does , but they do not tell us anything about how the species got there in the first place !
Explaining such things as the origin of Australia ’s marsupial population is just as difficult for evolutionists as they claim it is for creationists .
Marsupials like kangaroos , opossums , wallabies , and koalas seem unusual , but monotremes ( i.e. , the echidna and the platypus ) are even more puzzling .
The main difference between marsupials and most other mammals centers on the reproductive system .
Marsupials give birth prematurely , and allow the fetus to develop in an external pouch .
In other mammals , ( excluding the monotremes , which lay eggs ) , the fetus develops within the uterus and is attached to , and nourished by , the placenta .
Neither biogeography nor evolution can explain why animals sharing the same tree , reproduce using an internal uterus ( e.g. , squirrels ) as opposed to an external pouch ( e.g. , opossums ) .
One of the most interesting facts about marsupials is that they nearly all have non-marsupial equivalents in other parts of the world ( see Dobzhansky , et al. , 1977 , Figure 9.3 , p. 267 ) .
The kangaroo has a similar role to the antelope that roams the African savanna .
The wombat resembles a badger , and even has a backward - pointing pouch so that it will not fill with dirt while burrowing !
There also are many small marsupials that have rodent counterparts .
Evolutionists , of course , are forced to attribute such similarities to “ parallel evolution ” in both homology ( being alike in form ) and analogy ( occupying a corresponding niche ) .
That is , they believe that these marsupials and their placental peers developed independently — while they share similar characteristics , they took different paths to get there ( see Simpson and Beck , 1965 , pp. 499-501 ) .
A common ancestry , combined with similar forces of natural selection , evolutionists assert , will result in the same sort of changes through time .
This common ancestor is thought to be the opossum because it is a marsupial , and is found in other areas of the world apart from Australia .
According to evolutionary theory , the opossum was a primitive mammal living 200 million years ago on a single southern land mass called Gondwanaland .
When parts of this supercontinent divided into what are now Australia and South America , the opossums were separated geographically .
Over eons of time , so the story goes , the Australian descendants of the opossum developed into the various types of marsupials seen today .
But in South America , they “ evolved ” placentas and eventually migrated to North America and Eurasia .
These evolutionary theories , however , suffer from a number of problems .
( 1 ) There are no intermediate fossils ( “ transitional forms ” ) showing the development of the marsupials from an opossum or opossum - like ancestor .
Furthermore , to suggest that one type of mammal could arise by supposed evolutionary mechanisms is incredible enough , but the probability of having both placental and non-placental forms evolve in the same way , at the same time , and in different regions , is remote , to say the least .
( 2 ) The humble opossum has been nominated as the ancestor of all mammals because it is supposed to be so “ primitive , ” having a relatively small brain and no “ specialized ” characteristics .
But the opossum has thrived virtually unchanged in many parts of the world .
In general , marsupials are often considered less “ advanced ” because they lack the complex internal reproductive system of placental mammals .
However , they possess many other characteristics that could give them an edge over their placental counterparts .
For instance , a female kangaroo can nourish two young ones of different ages at the same time , providing the appropriate formula from each teat .
Unlike placental mammals , marsupials can suspend or abort the embryo deliberately if adverse conditions arise .
And , of course , the pouch provides a superior place of protection for the young marsupial .
Yes , marsupials are different , but they are not inferior .
( 3 ) The distribution of marsupials is not well answered by evolutionary theories .
According to Michael Pitman , “ the most diverse fossil assemblies have been obtained from South America and , later ( Pliocene ) , Australia ” ( 1984 , p. 206 , parenthetical item in orig . ) .
That is , according to the fossil record , the marsupials already were well defined as a distinct group before the alleged separation of Australia from other continents .
Thus , geographic separation cannot be as significant to their development as evolutionists like to think ( or as they would like everyone else to think ) .
There also are numerous other puzzles in regard to the distribution of living ( and / or fossil ) organisms .
For example , evolutionists are forced to admit that marsupials once lived in Europe , Asia , and in abundance in North America , yet now are largely absent ( except for opossums in the Americas ) .
Consider the following revealing admission from two evolutionists : Living marsupials are restricted to Australia and South America ( which were part of the supercontinent Gondwana ) ; North American opossums are recent immigrants to the continent .
In contrast , metatherian fossils from the Late Cretaceous are exclusively from Eurasia and North America ( which formed the supercontinent Laurasia ) .
This geographical switch remains unexplained ( Cifelli and Davis , 2003 , 301:1899 -1902 , emp. added ) .
Closely related species in a certain geographical area ( like the thirteen species of finches in the Gal�pagos Islands that Quammen mentioned — species which , by the way , are now known to be interbreeding ! ) — may well have arisen from a single , original species ( a.k.a. , a “ common ancestor ” ) .
But that says nothing about where that single original species came from .
“ A finch ‘ changing ’ into a finch ” does not offer any explanation whatsoever as to how finches originated in the first place .
Such instances are textbook examples of sorting already - present genetic information ( and far more rapidly than evolutionists would expect ! ) .
But they are not examples of generating new information .
Furthermore , studies have now shown that many changes are actually the result of a built - in capacity to respond ( i.e. , adapt ) to cyclically changing climates .
For example , while a drought might result in a slight alteration in the specific size of a finch ’s beak , whatever changes take place during such a period of stress rarely are permanent .
The finch ’s beak generally returns to the original condition once the drought ends .
This same type of argumentation applies to the other examples ( anoles , mole rats , ants , pigeons , and fruit flies ) that Quammen employed in his National Geographic article .
Ascribing evolutionary interpretations to events we find in nature does not make those events the product of organic evolution .
Regardless of what David Quammen thinks , and contrary to what his November 2004 National Geographic article implies , creationists have no problem whatsoever with the production of new species — which are the end result of the reshuffling ( or loss ) of the genetic information in the original created kinds of organisms .
The disagreement in science today between evolutionists and creationists is not about the production of new species .
Rather , it is about the production of those groupings beyond the species level ( genus , family , class , order , or phylum ) .
Instances from biogeography of “ closely allied ” species says nothing whatsoever about how one kind of organism was able to “ evolve ” into another kind of organism .
When Darwin said that he saw in the facts of biogeography “ some deep organic bond , ” he was seeing exactly what he wanted to see , not what the data themselves revealed .
And when David Quammen , 145 years later , said that “ similar species occur nearby in space because they have descended from common ancestors , ” he was doing exactly the same .
The facts are one thing ; the interpretation of the facts is something else entirely .
Paleontology
In a section of his article that is an inexcusable gaffe on his part , and one that surely must represent a terrible embarrassment to his evolutionary colleagues , Quammen resurrected the long - dead concept of “ horse evolution . ”
Several decades ago , the American Museum of Natural History in New York City assembled a famous exhibit of fossil horses , from Eohippus ( now known as Hyracotherium ) to modern Equus .
This exhibit was presented as powerful evidence for Darwinism , with Equus being the ultimate “ goal ” of equine evolution .
Soon thereafter , this story of the horse family was included in practically all biology textbooks — from which no doubt , Mr. Quammen obtained his outdated information .
He wrote :
In North America , for example , a vaguely horselike creature known as Hyracotherium was succeeded by Orohippus , then Epihippus , then Mesohippus , which in turn were succeeded by a variety of horsey American critters .
Some of them even galloped across the Bering land bridge into Asia , then onward to Europe and Africa .
By five million years ago they had nearly all disappeared , leaving behind Dinohippus , which was succeeded by Equus , the modern genus of horse ( p. 12 ) .
Interestingly , another editor of a well - known magazine tried this tact several years earlier , and ended up being publicly scolded for it .
John Rennie , editor of Scientific American , wrote in the July 2002 issue of that publication : “ Actually , paleontologists know of many detailed examples of fossils intermediate in form between various taxonomic groups� .
A sequence of fossils spans the evolution of modern horses from the tiny Eohippus ” ( 2002 , 287[ 1]:83 ) .
The alleged evolutionary tree that depicts the rise of modern - day horses Evolutionists themselves long ago abandoned horse evolution as an example of transitional forms , since they no longer believe the fossil record represents anything like a straightforward progression , but instead a bush with many varying branches .
As Heribert Nilsson correctly pointed out as long ago as 1954 :
The family tree of the horse is beautiful and continuous only in the textbooks .
In the reality provided by the results of research it is put together from three parts , of which only the last can be described as including horses .
The forms of the first part are just as much little horses as the present day damans are horses .
The construction of the horse is therefore a very artificial one , since it is put together from non-equivalent parts , and cannot therefore be a continuous transformation series ( pp. 551-552 , emp. added ) .
Mr. Quammen apparently does not realize that as far back as the 1950s , scientists already had cast aside the false notion of horse evolution via classic Darwinian changes .
[ In fact , the vast majority of textbooks ( including ones published by National Geographic ! ) have abandoned the horse in favor of the camel — a species they believe can paint the same picture but that has not been so publicly ridiculed . ]
David Raup of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago , Illinois , acknowledged :
Well , we are now about 120 years after Darwin , and knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded ....
Ironically , we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin ’s time .
By this I mean that some of the classic cases of Darwinian change in the fossil record , such as the evolution of the horse in North America , have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information — what appeared to be a nice , simple progression when relatively few data were available now appears to be much more complex and much less gradualistic ( 1979 , pp. 24,25 ) .
The late eminent paleontologist of Harvard , George Gaylord Simpson , summed it up well when he wrote : “ The uniform , continuous transformation of Hyracotherium into Equus , so dear to the hearts of generations of textbook writers , never happened in nature ” ( 1953 , p. 125 , emp. added ) .
Another scientist from Harvard — and a man for whom Dr. Simpson served as mentor — Stephen J. Gould , bemoaned the continued use of what he termed “ misinformation ” such as horse evolution .
He wrote .
Once ensconced in textbooks , misinformation becomes cocooned and effectively permanent , because , as stated above , textbooks copy from previous texts .
( I have written two essays on this lamentable practice : one on the amusingly perennial description of the eohippus , or “ dawn horse , ” as the size of a fox terrier , even though most authors , including yours truly , have no idea of the dimensions or appearance of this breed� ) [ 2000 , 109 [ 2]:45 ; to read his exposure of the fallacy of horse evolution , see Gould , 1991 , pp. 155-167 ] .
Creationist Jonathan Sarfati wrote along these lines :
Even informed evolutionists regard horse evolution as a bush rather than a sequence .
But the so - called Eohippus is properly called Hyracotherium , and has little that could connect it with horses at all .
The other animals in the “ sequence ” actually show hardly any more variation between them than that within horses today .
One non-horse and many varieties of the true horse kind does not a sequence make ( 2002a ) .
Truer words were never spoken : “ One non -horse and many varieties of the true horse kind does not a sequence make . ”
It will require much better evidence than this from evolutionists if they hope to convince knowledgeable people that their theory is correct ( much less a “ fact ” of science ) .
Apparently , however , they have no better evidence , as was evident from Mr. Quammen ’s next feeble attempt to produce an intermediate form in the fossil record .
Alleged Reptile - to - Bird Evolution
As if Quammen ’s horse - evolution gaffe were not bad enough , he then resurrected the long - defunct idea of Archaeopteryx as some sort of reptile - to - bird transitional form .
[ Interestingly , Scientific American ’s John Rennie tried using it , too .
He wrote : “ One of the most famous fossils of all time is Archaeopteryx , which combines feathers and skeletal structures peculiar to birds with features of dinosaurs ” ( 2002 , 287[ 1]:83 ) . ]
Both men , as it turns out , are wrong — as many of their own evolutionary colleagues have long admitted .
For over 100 years , evolutionists considered a creature known as Archaeopteryx to be the best example of a transitional form between land - dwelling animals and birds .
In 1860 , a single refined , asymmetrical feather was discovered in the Solnhofen Limestone ( named after the small town of Solnhofen , Germany ) .
This discovery provided the ultimate gift of the evolutionary gods to scientists of the day who were searching diligently for something ( anything ! ) in the fossil record that portrayed the combined traits of two distinct classes of animals .
The animal from which the feather was alleged to have come eventually was named Archaeopteryx lithographica , a creature that must have had a considerable impact on a society that already was discussing Darwin ’s intriguing proposals regarding the theory of evolution .
This “ missing link ” was the first real evidence that Darwinists felt supported their position of a transition from land - dwelling animals into birds .
Evolutionists used to consider Archaeopteryx as the transitional form that allowed land - dwelling animals finally to get off the ground .
In the past , practically all evolution - based science textbooks contained a breathtaking photographic reproduction , and equally fascinating description , of Archaeopteryx , with genealogical lines showing the descent of modern birds from this ancient “ intermediate . ”
According to paleontologists , the available fossils of Archaeopteryx reveal that it was a crow - sized animal that may have been able to fly , but probably not very far .
Archaeopteryx had a wingspan of about 1.5 feet , was approximately 1 foot long from beak to tail , and likely weighed around 11 to 18 ounces .
However , this one “ missing link ” — which was supposed to revolutionize mankind ’s understanding of bird evolution — ultimately created more problems than solutions for evolutionists .
An ongoing debate as to whether or not this animal was merely a bird , or a true intermediate , continued nonstop for over a century .
The famous American dinosaur hunter Othniel C. Marsh once said : “ He is certainly a wise man who today can tell a bird from a reptile , with only the fragments of an ancient form before him ” ( 1890 ) .
Two years after German paleontologist Herman von Meyer published his description of Archaeopteryx , Sir Richard Owen , the curator of the British Museum of Natural History , published his own description .
As far as Owen was concerned , Archaeopteryx was unequivocally a bird — a peculiar and distinctive bird , but a bird nevertheless .
So what is it about this famous fossil that has some people seeing birds and others seeing dinosaurs ?
The urgency of needing to find some sort of “ intermediate , ” caused evolutionists to concentrate on as many features of Archaeopteryx as possible in order to discover “ combined ” traits .
According to Niles Eldredge of the American Museum of Natural History , Archaeopteryx had “ advanced characteristics of birds and retained a tremendous amount of ‘ primitive ’ characteristics , like teeth ” ( as quoted in Sunderland , 1988 , p. 78 ) .
However , some fish have teeth , some do not .
Some amphibians have teeth , some do not .
How can a scientist look at the presence of teeth and simply assume that this animal evolved from something else ?
Many scientists point out things like an opposable hallux ( big toe ) , the furcula ( wishbone ) , which is formed by two clavicles that have fused in the midline , and an elongated pubis directed backwards — and see nothing but a bird .
Evolutionist Alan Feduccia stated : “ Paleontologists have tried to turn Archaeopteryx into an earth - bound , feathered dinosaur .
But it ’s not .
It is a bird , a perching bird .
And no amount of ‘ paleobabble ’ is going to change that ” ( as quoted in Morell , 1993 , 259:764 , emp. added ) .
A more recent fossil bird from Mongolia — Mononychus — had hands and arms like those of digging animals ( as well as teeth ) , and is dated at only half as old as Archaeopteryx .
Writing for Science News , Richard Monastersky observed : Mongolian and U.S. researchers have found a 75 - million - year - old , bird - like creature with a hand so strange it has left paleontologists grasping for an explanation ....
Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago notes that Mononychus had arms built much like those of digging animals .
Because moles and other diggers have keeled sternums and wrists reminiscent of birds , the classification of Mononychus becomes difficult , he says ( 1993 , 143:245 ) .
Thus , evolutionists now are faced with the possibility that birds may have evolved from moles instead of reptiles !
Consequently , scientists are trying to discern how it is that animals that normally burrow in the ground suddenly decided to abandon their usual environment and “ just fly away . ”
[ We imagine that a goodly number of farmers would be interested in learning how to get these pesky creatures to abandon their fields and “ just fly away ” ! ]
So what is the truth about Archaeopteryx ?
Perhaps the late Colin Patterson , senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History , summed it up best when he stated that Archaeopteryx has simply become a patsy for wishful thinking .
Is Archaeopteryx the ancestor of all birds ?
Perhaps yes , perhaps no : there is no way of answering the question .
It is easy enough to make up stories of how one form gave rise to another , and to find reasons why the stages should be favoured by natural selection .
But such stories are not a part of science , for there is no way of putting them to the test ( as quoted in Sunderland , 1988 , p. 102 ) .
The story surrounding Archaeopteryx has been complicated by another discovery that has left evolutionists scratching their heads in regard to where , exactly , the creature actually fits in the evolutionary scheme of things .
In 1986 , Sankar Chatterjee and colleagues at Texas Tech University discovered the fossilized remains of two crow - sized birds allegedly 75 million years older than Archaeopteryx ( i.e. , approximately 225 million years old according to evolutionary dating schemes ) [ see Beardsley , 1986 ; Chatterjee , 1991 ] .
Chatterjee named the find Protoavis texensis ( “ first bird from Texas ” ) , and has reported that the skull of Protoavis has 23 features that are fundamentally bird - like .
In commenting on this , one author wrote in Science concerning Chatterjee ’s work : “ His reconstruction also shows a flexible neck , large brain , binocular vision , and , crucially , portals running from the rear of the skull to the eye socket — a feature seen in modern birds but not dinosaurs ” ( Anderson , 1991 , 253:35 ) .
Archaeopteryx lithographica
All of this has caused evolutionists severe problems because Protoavis appeared at the time of the earliest dinosaurs , which means that if it is accepted as genuine , then birds obviously could not have evolved from dinosaurs , and Archaeopteryx could not be the ancestor of modern birds .
After looking at the evidence for Protoavis , Kansas University paleontologist Larry Martin suggested : “ There ’s going to be a lot of people with Archaeopteryx eggs on their face ” ( as quoted in Anderson , 253:35 ) .
For more than a century , the approach of some evolutionists has been to find some supporting evidence , tout it as “ proof ” of evolution , and then ignore conflicting theories or data .
But what do the actual facts reveal about creatures such as Archaeopteryx ?
In reality , the story that scientists have attempted to weave in regard to this ancient “ missing link ” is unraveling before their very eyes .
Scientific data have shown colossal differences in reptilian and bird lungs , scales as opposed to feathers , and the embryological hand development of dinosaurs versus birds .
It may well be that we are witnessing the last gasps of a dying hypothesis about how birds evolved from dinosaurs !
Faced with such overwhelming evidence against true evolutionary descent , it would be unrealistic to accept the position that Archaeopteryx lithographica is anything like the missing link that evolutionists once claimed it was .
Colin Patterson admitted in his 1999 book , Evolution : “ Fossils may tell us many things , but one thing they can never disclose is whether they were ancestors of anything else ” ( p. 109 ) .
Henry Gee , the chief science writer for Nature , confirmed that point in his 1999 book , In Search of Deep Time , when he admitted :
We know that it is impossible when confronted with a fossil , to be certain whether it is your ancestor , or the ancestor of anything else , even another fossil .
We also know that adaptive scenarios are simply justifications for particular arrangements of fossils made after the fact , and which relay for their justification on authority rather than on testable hypotheses ( p. 127 ) .
While the “ Piltdown Man ” hoax was able to fool evolutionists for more than forty years , the Archaeopteryx hoax appears to have lasted far longer — and continues in some quarters to this very day , in spite of such admissions as this one from evolutionary ornithologist Allan Feduccia who wrote in Science almost a decade ago : I conclude that Archaeopteryx was arboreal and volant [ i.e. , possessing extended wings for flight — BT / BH ] , considerably advanced aerodynamically , and probably capable of flapping , powered flight to at least some degree .
Archaeopteryx ... was , in the modern sense , a bird ( 1993 , 259:792 ) .
And so , once again , it is not merely the “ link ” that ’s missing in evolutionary theory — it ’s the entire chain !
Given all the facts about the origin of birds , it is little wonder that Charles Darwin remarked in a letter to his American friend , Asa Gray , on April 3 , 1860 : “ [ T ] rifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable .
The sight of a feather in a peacock ’s tail , whenever I gaze at it , makes me sick ! ” ( as quoted in MacBeth , 1971 , p. 101 ) .
Mr. Darwin , considering the paucity of the fossil record , and the elegance of the design inherent in a single feather ( see “ Words of a Feather ” for evidence regarding the intricate design of feathers ) , we certainly can understand why .

Cows ( or Antelopes ? ) to Whales ?
As Quammen continued his ( by now ) greatly weakened defense of evolution , he dug still deeper into his bag of alleged evolutionary intermediate forms , bringing to the reader ’s attention the work of Philip Gingerich of the University of Michigan .
Gingerich , a paleontologist , is well known in evolutionary circles for his work on whale evolution .
Falling back on his own field of literature , Quammen wove a tale about being in Gingerich ’s office and having him “ put a small lump of petrified bone , no larger than a lug nut , into my hand .
It was the famous astragalus , from the species he had eventually named Artiocetus clavis .
It felt solid and heavy as truth ” ( p. 31 ) .
This , from a man whose experience in biology amounts to walking through rain forests and talking to biologists !
What Quammen forgot to share with his readers was the fact that this “ solid ” heavy truth ( the astragalus ) was discovered down a slope , over 2 meters away from the embedded fossils that were identified as Artiocetus .
In the original report , Gingerich admitted : “ No other mammalian specimens were found in the vicinity ” ( Gingerich , et al. , 2001 , 293:2240 ) .
Nevertheless , this “ solid ” evidence was assumed to be a part of a fossil ( found in a different location ) that “ proved ” whale evolution .
This appears to be the modus operandi for those who promote whale evolution .
Find a bit of a jaw or skull , have an artist draw a four - legged creature , call a press conference , and offer up unprovable speculations about how whales evolved from land mammals .
The origin of whales has dominated media headlines over the past several years as scientists have wrestled with why aquatic creatures would grow legs , walk the Earth , and then inexplicably decide to return to the water ( thus explaining the differences between fish and aquatic mammals such as dolphins and whales ) .
Scientific American ’s editor , John Rennie , in his now - infamous July 2002 issue , concluded : “ Whales had four - legged ancestors that walked on land , and creatures known as Ambulocetus and Rodhocetus helped to make that transition ” ( 2002 , 287[ 1]:83 ) .
Daryl Domning , a paleontologist at Howard University , stated : “ We essentially have every stage now from a terrestrial animal to one that is fully aquatic ” ( Mayell , 2001 ) .
That bold declaration was made in National Geographic News on - line , October 10 , 2001 , after a sea-cow skeleton was found in Seven Rivers , Jamaica .
Evolutionists contend that this find , which they have labeled an entirely new genus and species , played an important role in helping terrestrial animals make the transition from land to water .
In 1859 , Darwin suggested that whales arose from bears , sketching a scenario in which selective pressures might cause bears to ultimately evolve into whales .
But , embarrassed by criticism ( and , we might add , rightly so ! ) , he removed his hypothetical “ swimming bears ” from later editions of the Origin of Species ( see Gould , 1995 , p. 359 ) .
Evolutionists were unsure how to proceed , since they knew that whales were different from fish ; thus , a different evolutionary account was required .
Whales are warm - blooded vertebrates that regulate their internal temperature via heat generated by a high metabolism .
Like most mammals ( the exception being the duck - billed platypus ) , female whales bear live young , which are nursed by mammary glands .
While adult whales are not covered in hair or fur , they do acquire body hair temporarily as fetuses .
These features make whales unequivocally mammalian — a fact that poses a mountainous hurdle for evolutionists .
The November 2001 issue of National Geographic presented additional propaganda in an article titled “ Evolution of Whales . ”
While the official scientific names and full - color reconstructions contained in the article appear quite impressive , the data are far from it .
A closer examination of two alleged whale predecessors — Pakicetus and Ambulocetus — reveals that these creatures had little in common with whales , and thus do not represent the animals ’ ancient ancestors .
[ Remember our earlier statement that “ November is not a very good month for National Geographic ” ?
The fraudulent Archaeoraptor creature appeared in November 1999 .
Two years later , in November 2001 , the whale - evolution gaffe was published .
Then , three years later , in November 2004 , Quammen ’s pitiful defense of evolution — using such erroneous examples as horse evolution and Archaeopteryx — appeared .
You would think that Bill Allen , the editor of National Geographic , would learn something from these repeated embarrassing failures .
Apparently not .
Surely , there ’s a message of some kind here . ]
Pakicetus was discovered in 1983 by Gingerich , who claimed the find as a primitive whale — even though he found only a jaw and skull fragments ( see Gingerich , 1994 , 2001 ) .
So what makes National Geographic so sure this creature is the long - lost “ walking ” ancestor of modern whales ?
Douglas Chadwick ( author of the November 2001 article ) stated :
What causes scientists to declare the creature a whale ?
Subtle clues in combination — the arrangement of cups on the molar teeth , a folding in a bone of the middle ear , and the positioning of the ear bones within the skull — are absent in other land animals but a signature of later Eocene whales ( 2001 , 200:68 ) .
Artist ’s rendition of an “ aquatic ” Pakicetus
So , from mere dimples in teeth and folded ear bones , this animal somehow “ qualifies ” as a walking whale ?
Interestingly , prominent whale expert J.G.M.
Thewissen and his colleagues later unearthed additional bones of Pakicetus ( Thewissen , et al. , 2001 ) .
The skeletons of Pakicetus published by Thewissen , et al . do not look anything like the swimming creature featured in either Gingerich ’s original article or in National Geographic .
In fact , in a commentary in the same issue of Nature in which the article by Thewissen , et al. was published , the following statement appeared : “ All the postcranial bones indicate that pakicetids were land mammals , and �indicate that the animals were runners , with only their feet touching the ground ” ( see de Muizon , 2001 , 413:260 ) .
National Geographic , however , deceptively chose to display the Pakicetus in a swimming position , obviously trying to sway the reader into believing that Gingerich ’s fossilized jawbone and skull fragments represented some type of aquatic creature — which they do not .
The next alleged ancestor , Ambulocetus natans , was proposed as a whale long before the dust settled from its fossilized remains .
The name itself , “ Ambulocetus natans , ” comes from the Latin words “ ambulare ” ( to walk ) , “ cetus ” ( whale ) , and “ natans ” ( swimming ) , meaning quite literally a walking , swimming whale .
The scientists who discovered and subsequently named this fossil screamed “ walking whale ” well in advance of a complete analysis , and the illustrator for National Geographic exercised a vast amount of “ artistic license ” in assigning webbed feet to the creature .
While such feet definitely make the creature look more aquatic , it is impossible to come to any such conclusion from a study of the fossils themselves .
Soft tissues ( such as webbed feet ) normally do not fossilize well .
There is no evidence this creature ever spent any amount of time in the water — yet the drawing shows an animal with rear legs that appear to be built for an aquatic environment .
An examination of the actual skeleton ( see Carroll , 1998 , p. 335 ) quickly dispels the notion that the rear legs performed as obligatory fins .
The legs on Ambulocetus were not fins at all , but rather legs made for walking and supporting weight .
While artists make the transition appear easy , the logistics of going from a terrestrial environment to an aquatic one would be incredibly complex .
Evolutionist Anthony Martin admitted : “ Principally it meant developing a new mode of locomotion ( from walking to swimming ) , a physiology to cope with a dense medium ( water rather than air ) , new methods of detecting and catching prey , and a means of breathing efficiently at the sea surface ” ( 1990 , p. 12 , parenthetical items in orig . ) .
Martin ’s analysis did not even address the metabolic , neuronal , reproductive , and cellular changes required for such animals to live underwater .
Duane Gish summed it up well when he stated :
It is quite entertaining , starting with cows , pigs , or buffaloes , to attempt to visualize what the intermediates may have looked like .
Starting with a cow , one could even imagine one line of descent which prematurely became extinct , due to what might be called an “ udder failure ” ( 1995 , p. 198 ) .
Udder failure indeed !
Yet in his National Geographic article , David Quammen related the story of Philip Gingerich ’s find of additional fossils that “ challenged the prevailing view in paleontology . ”
According to Quammen ,
It was half of a pulley - shaped anklebone , known as an astragalus , belonging to another new species of whale .
A Pakistani colleague found the other half .
When Gingerich fitted the two pieces together , he had a moment of humbling recognition� .
Here was an anklebone , from a four - legged whale dating back to 47 million years , that closely resembled the homologous anklebone in an artiodactyls .
Suddenly he realized how closely whales are related to antelopes ( p. 31 , emp. added ) .
Is this not the most fascinating “ tale of a whale ” you ’ve ever heard ?
Gingerich finds two pieces of bone , fits them together , suggests that they look like the anklebone of an artiodactyl ( a hoofed land animal , like an antelope ) , and then leaps from that to the statement : “ Here was an anklebone , from a four - legged whale ! ”
If this were not so serious , it would be laughable .
Terry Mortensen , in a review of the November 2004 issue of National Geographic that he authored , hinted at this when he wrote : Hold on !
When was the last time you saw a “ four - legged whale ” ?
Evolutionists are playing language games to call the fins and tail of a whale “ legs . ”
But if , as National Geographic says , the fossil “ closely resembled ” the anklebone in artiodactyls , then how on earth could this “ single piece of fossil evidence ” be interpreted as being in any way related to whales ?
( 2004 ) ALLEGED WHALE EVOLUTION
Top left : Gingerich ’s first reconstruction
Bottom left : what he actually found
Top right : more complete skeleton
Bottom right : more reasonable reconstruction
( courtesy of Answers in Genesis ; used by permission ) Good question .
Why would anyone think that antelopes and whales are somehow related ?
The answer , of course , has to do with homology and its use as a “ proof ” in evolutionary theory .
One argument frequently brought out as the “ big gun ” in support of the evolution has to do with what are known as the “ comparative ” sciences ( comparative anatomy , comparative embryology , comparative physiology , comparative cytology , comparative biochemistry , etc. ) .
As scientists have worked in these related fields , and have learned to compare one organism with another , basic similarities have arisen among , and between , various groups .
When making comparisons of parts of organisms , scientists commonly speak of homologous structures , suggesting that these particular structures go through similar stages of development , have similar attachments , etc .
In discussing these comparative arguments and homology , R.L. Wysong noted : Much of the case for amoeba to man evolution is built upon arguments from similarity .
Evolutionists argue that if similarity can be shown between organisms through comparative anatomy , embryology , vestigial organs , cytology , blood chemistry , protein and DNA biochemistry , then evolutionary relationship can be proven ( 1976 , p. 393 ) .
Michael Denton , in his text , Evolution : A Theory in Crisis , devoted a large portion of the book to such arguments and wrote : “ Since 1859 the phenomenon of homology has been traditionally cited by evolutionary biologists as providing one of the most powerful lines of evidence for the concept of organic evolution ” ( 1985 , p. 143 ) .
Denton is correct in his assessment .
Charles Darwin himself thought of the argument from homology as one of the greatest single proofs of his theory .
Denton commented that “ homology provided Darwin with apparently positive evidence that organisms had undergone descent from a common ancestor ” ( p. 143 ) .
Darwin stated as much in The Origin of Species when he wrote : “ We have seen that the members of the same class , independently of their habits of life , resemble each other in the general plan of their organization ....
Is it not powerfully suggestive of true relationship , of inheritance from a common ancestor ? ” ( 1962 , pp. 434-435 ) .
Denton therefore observed : “ The phenomenon of homology has remained the mainstay of the argument for evolution right down to the present day ” ( p. 144 ) .
Strausburg and Weimer , in their text , General Biology , suggested : “ The greater the similarity of structure , the closer the relationship , and , wherever close relationship is found , a common ancestry is indicated ” ( 1947 , p. 629 ) .
That statement was made in 1947 .
Decades later , the same kind of thinking is still standard fare .
For example , the 1981 edition of the respected Encyclopaedia Britannica gave pride of place to the argument from homology in discussing the evidence for evolution :
The indirect evidence for evolution is based primarily on the significance of similarities found in different organisms ....
The similarity of plan is easily explicable if all descended with modification from a common ancestor , by evolution , and the term homologous is used to denote corresponding structures formed in this way ....
Invertebrate animals , the skeleton of the forelimb is a splendid example of homology , in the bones of the upper arm , forearm , wrist , hand , and fingers , all of which can be matched , bone for bone , in rat , dog , horse , bat , mole , porpoise , or man .
The example is all the more telling because the bones have become modified in adaptation to different modes of life but have retained the same fundamental plan of structure , inherited from a common ancestor ( 1981 , 7:8 ) .
Denton acknowledged the importance of such thinking within the evolutionary camp , and showed why such thinking is so necessary , when he observed that “ without underlying homologous resemblance in the fundamental design of dissimilar organisms and organ systems then evolution would have nothing to explain and comparative anatomy nothing to contribute to evolutionary theory ” ( 1985 , p. 145 ) .
The late biochemist , Isaac Asimov , one of America ’s most prolific science writers , suggested that our ability to classify plants and animals on a groups - within - groups hierarchical basis virtually forces scientists to treat evolution as a “ fact ” ( 1981 , 89[9 ] :85 - 87 ) .
What is the creationist ’s response to all of this ?
Do similarities exist ?
And if so , is the evolutionist ’s explanation the correct , or the only , explanation that fits the facts of the case ?
First , let us note how the creationist does not respond to this argument .
Creationists do not deny the existing similarities ; similarities do exist .
Creationists are not ignorant of the existence of such facts of science .
It is here , however , that we can learn an extremely valuable lesson in the creation / evolution controversy .
That lesson is this : rarely is it the data that are in dispute — it is the interpretation placed on the data that is in dispute .
In the cases of basic similarities , whether at the anatomical or biochemical level , denying that such similarities exist serves no good purpose .
Creationists and evolutionists both have access to the same data .
The evolutionist , however , looks at the data and says that similarity is proof of common ancestry .
The creationist , on the other hand , examines the exact same data and suggests that similarity is evidence of creation according to a common design .
In essence , a stalemate exists .
Both sides have an answer to the data at hand .
And in many instances , either explanation might appear legitimate .
Second , however , the evolutionists ’ argument works only if certain portions of the data on homology are presented .
If all the available data are allowed full exposure , then the evidence from homology fails .
Many years ago , T.H. Morgan of Columbia University , himself a committed evolutionist , candidly admitted what many evolutionists do not want to become common knowledge : “ If , then , it can be established beyond dispute that similarity or even identity of the same character in different species is not always to be interpreted that both have arisen from a common ancestor , the whole argument from comparative anatomy seems to tumble in ruins ” ( 1923 , p. 246 ) .
Or , as Wysong wrote : “ If the law of similarity can be used to show evolutionary relationships , then dissimilarities can be used to show a lack of relationship ” ( 1976 , pp. 393-394 ) .
Evolution is a complete cosmogony .
It must explain both similarities and differences within its own framework .
It is not the similarities that present the problem ; it is the numerous differences .
As Sir Alistair Hardy , former professor of zoology at Oxford University , wrote : “ The concept of homology is fundamental to what we are talking about when we speak of evolution , yet in truth we cannot explain it all in terms of present - day biological theory ” ( 1965 , p. 211 ) .
What did Dr. Hardy mean when he said , more than thirty - five years ago , that “ we cannot explain it all in terms of present - day biological theory ” ?
He meant simply this : only when evolutionists are allowed to “ pick and choose ” similarities that fit their theory , can the argument from homology be made to work .
When evolutionists are forced to use all the data — including those documenting dissimilarity — the argument from homology utterly fails .
His point is well taken — even today .
It is a documented fact that evolutionists are guilty of filtering the data to make it appear as if homology supports evolutionary theory .
Now , however , that “ picking and choosing ” method has been exposed , as Lester and Bohlin have observed .
Another problem is that from the raw data alone , not one single phylogeny emerges , but several .
The one that agrees most closely with the traditional phylogeny is assumed to be the most “ correct . ”
This hardly demonstrates the independent confirmation of evolutionary relationships .
The combining of several phylogenies from different proteins combines not only strengths but also weaknesses ( 1984 , p. 173 , emp. in orig . ) .
Vincent Demoulin likewise pointed out the fallacy inherent in this kind of “ pick and choose ” game when he noted that “ the composite evolutionary tree encompasses all the weaknesses of the individual trees ” ( 1979 ) .
That is to say , adding up all the available data from homology studies makes for an even weaker argument than already is present when examining just a few of the data on this topic .
But there is no need to take any creationist ’s word on the subject .
Evolutionist Michael Denton stated quite succinctly just how valuable all this “ proof ” from similarity studies really is .
Invariably , as biological knowledge has grown , common geneology as an explanation for similarity has tended to grow ever more tenuous .
Clearly , such a trend carried to the extreme would hold calamitous consequences for evolution , as homologous resemblance is the very raison d’�tre of evolution theory .
Without the phenomenon of homology — the modification of similar structures to different ends — there would be little need for a theory of descent with modification ....
Like so much of the other circumstantial “ evidence ” for evolution , that drawn from homology is not convincing because it entails too many anomalies , too many counter - instances , far too many phenomena which simply do not fit easily into the orthodox picture .
The failure of homology to substantiate evolutionary claims has not been as widely publicized as have the problems in paleontology .
The discussion in the past three chapters indicates that the facts of comparative anatomy and the pattern of nature they reveal provide nothing like the overwhelming testimony to the Darwinian model of evolution that is often claimed .
Simpson ’s claim that “ the facts simply do not make sense unless evolution is true , ” or Dobzhansky ’s that “ nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution ” are simply not true if by the term evolution we mean a gradual process of biological change directed by natural selection ....
In the last analysis the facts of comparative anatomy provide no evidence for evolution in the way conceived by Darwin , and even if we were to construe with the eye of faith some “ evidence ” in the pattern of diversity for the Darwinian model of evolution , this could only be seen , at best , as indirect or circumstantial .... ... the same hierarchic pattern which may be explained in terms of a theory of common descent , also , by its very nature , implies the existence of deep divisions in the order of nature .
The same facts of comparative anatomy which proclaim unity also proclaim division ; while resemblance suggests evolution , division , especially where it appears profound , is counter - evidence against the whole notion of transmutation ( 1985 , pp. 154-155 ) .
What did Denton mean when he said that the “ evidence ” for evolution from homology studies “ entails too many anomalies , too many counter - instances , far too many phenomena which simply do not fit easily into the orthodox picture ” ?
The answer to that lies in an examination of the data that have become available during the past several years .
For example , Wysong provided an extensive list of such data , among which were the following examples :
The octopus eye , pig heart , Pekingese dog ’s face , milk of the ass , and the pronator quadratus muscle of the Japanese salamander are all very similar to analogous human structures .
Do these similarities show evolutionary relationships ?
The weight of the brain in proportion to body weight is greater in the dwarf monkey of South America , the marmoset , than in man .
Since this proportion is used to show relationship between primates and man , is the marmoset , therefore , more evolved than man ?
The plague bacterium ( Pasteurella pestis [ now designated as Yersinia pestis — BT / BH ] ) afflicts only man and rodent .
Does this similarity show close relationship ?
Plant nettle stings contain acetylcholine , 5 - hydroxytryptamine and histamine .
These chemicals are also found in man .
Are man and plant closely related ?
The root nodules of certain leguminous plants and the crustacean , Daphnia , contain hemoglobin , the blood pigment found in man .
Are these organisms closely related to man ?
If certain specific gravity tests are run on the blood of various animals , the frog and snake are found to be more similar to man than the monkey is to man .
If the concentration of red blood cells in animals is compared ( millions per cubic millimeter of blood ) , man is more similar to frogs , fish , and birds than he is to sheep .
Since bones are often used to show relationships , bone chemistry should be useful in this regard .
If the calcium / phosphorus ratio is plotted against bone carbonate , man proves to be close to the turtle and elephant , the monkey close to the goose , and the dog close to the horse but distant from the cat .
The tetrapyrole chemical ring is found in plant chlorophyll , in hemoglobin and other animal respiratory pigments , sporadically as a coloring pigment in molluscan shells , and also in the feathers of some bird species .
How does tetrapyrole similarity speak for relationships ( 1976 , pp. 394-395 ) .
After examining examples such as these , it is easy to understand Denton ’s point when he said that there are too many “ anomalies , ” too many “ counter - instances , ” and “ too many phenomena which simply do not fit easily into the orthodox picture . ”
Homology does not prove common ancestry .
When someone — like Philip Gingerich — picks up two bones , concludes that they very likely came from an organism like an antelope , and then assigns them to a “ four - legged whale , ” that is not homology at work .
Nor is it good science at work .
It is sheer imagination and wishful thinking !
Four - legged whales indeed !
Embryology
In a continuing attempt to locate some type of scientific evidence that “ proves ” evolution to be a fact , David Quammen turned to the field of embryology , and in doing so , invoked the long - ago - discarded concept of embryonic recapitulation .
He wrote : Embryology too involved patterns that could n’t be explained by coincidence .
Why does the embryo of a mammal pass through stages resembling stages of the embryo of a reptile ?
Why is one of the larval forms of a barnacle , before metamorphosis , so similar to the larval form of a shrimp ?
Why do the larvae of moths , flies , and beetles resemble one another more than any of them resemble their respective adults ?
Because , Darwin wrote , “ the embryo is the animal in its less modified state ” and that state “ reveals the structure of its progenitor ” ( p. 13 ) .
Embryology , as its name implies , is the study of the embryo .
In The Origin of Species ( 1859 ) , Darwin did indeed employ embryology .
In fact , he asserted ( in a discussion occupying no less than twelve pages ) that similarity among the various embryos of animals and man was a primary proof of the theory of evolution .
In fact , he called it “ second to none ” in importance .
In The Descent of Man ( 1871 ) , Darwin devoted the entire first chapter to this line of evidence , stressing how critical it was to the success of his theory .
Then , along came Ernst Heinrich Haeckel ( 1834-1919 ) , a German biologist who was such a devoted follower of Darwin that he was dubbed “ the apostle of Darwinism in Germany . ”
He taught at the University of Jena , and became famous for his popularization of the so - called “ theory of embryonic recapitulation ” ( or , as he referred to it , the great “ Biogenetic Law ” ) .
[ NOTE : Haeckel ’s “ Biogenetic Law ” should not be confused with the Law of Biogenesis , which correctly states that all life comes from previous life of its kind . ]
Haeckel suggested that the successive stages of human embryonic development repeat the evolutionary stages of our animal ancestry .
The catch - phrase he developed to popularize this idea was that “ ontogeny [ the development of one ] recapitulates [ repeats ] phylogeny [ the development of the race ] . ”
In other words , the human embryo passes through all stages representing its ancestors — from the one - celled stage to the human .
Seeing a human embryo grow would therefore be like watching a silent , moving picture of all our ancestral history .
Today , we recognize that this argument is specious , and those who keep up with the scientific literature no longer use it .
Why ?
To quote the late George Gaylord Simpson of Harvard : “ It is now firmly established that ontogeny does not repeat phylogeny ” ( Simpson , et al. , 1965 , p. 352 ) .
Over seventy years ago , Sir Arthur Keith bluntly stated :
It was expected that the embryo would recapitulate the features of its ancestors from the lowest to the highest forms in the animal kingdom .
Now that the appearances of the embryo at all stages are known , the general feeling is one of disappointment ; the human embryo at no stage is anthropoid in appearance .
The embryo of the mammal never resembles the worm , the fish , or the reptile .
Embryology provides no support whatsoever for the evolutionary hypothesis ( 1932 , p. 94 , emp. added ) .
A word of explanation is in order .
Haeckel was an accomplished artist who used his artistic talent to falsify certain of the drawings that accompanied his scientific articles .
One writer summarized the matter as follows :
To support his theory , however , Haeckel , whose knowledge of embryology was self - taught , faked some of his evidence .
He not only altered his illustrations of embryos , but also printed the same plate of an embryo three times , and labeled one a human , the second a dog and the third a rabbit to show their similarity ( Bowden , 1977 , p. 128 ) .
Haeckel even went so far as to alter the drawings of some of his colleagues , including the famous embryologist , professor L. Rutimeyer of Basel University , and professor Arnold Bass .
The two university professors , after realizing what Haeckel had done , publicly condemned his actions .
In the end , as H.H. Newman of the University of Chicago put it , Haeckel ’s works “ did more harm than good to Darwinism ” ( 1932 , p. 30 ) .
Haeckel ’s falsified drawings were published around 1866 .
One of the major points stressed by Haeckel in his “ research ” — and one of the items that has remained ensconced in the evolutionary literature to this very day — is the idea that the human embryo possesses gill slits that are leftovers from its past fish - like ancestor stage .
Evolutionist Irvin Adler , in his book , How Life Began , wrote :
The embryo of each species seems to repeat the main steps by which the species developed from the common ancestor of all living things .
All mammal embryos , for example , pass through a stage in which they have gills like a fish , showing that mammals are descended from fishlike ancestors ( 1957 , p. 22 ) .
Fast - forward almost fifty years to the twenty - first century .
In an educational program produced in 2001 by the University of Chicago for its Newton Electronic Community division , the following statement appeared : “ All mammals have gill slits in their very early fetal development ” ( Myron , 2001 , p. 1 ) .
We have known for almost 150 years that the “ Biogenetic Law ” is not correct , and that human embryos do not possess gill slits ( see Assmuth and Hull , 1915 ; Grigg , 1996 , 1998 ; Pennisi , 1997 ; Richardson , 1997a , 1997 b ; Youngson , 1998 ) .
Even though it was common knowledge by the end of the 1920s that Haeckel ’s concepts , to use Stephen Jay Gould ’s words , had “ utterly collapsed ” ( 1977a , p. 216 ) , Haeckel ’s drawings and ideas still continue to turn up in modern biology texts and instructional tools as a “ proof ” of evolution .
Modern editions of most high school and college textbooks rarely present the latest evolutionary ideas on embryology , but instead remain content to rest their case on century - old woodcuts and misnamed “ gill slits . ”
As incredible as it seems , even today the “ Biogenetic Law ” still is being taught as a scientific fact in many public schools and universities .
Of fifteen high school biology textbooks being considered for adoption by the Indiana State Board of Education as late as 1980 , nine offered embryonic recapitulation as evidence for evolution .
But advance almost two decades — to 1998 .
It was in that year that George Johnson and Peter Raven published their popular , Biology : Principles and Explorations , which presents the pictures of Haeckel ’s embryos — without even so much as a hint to the student that they are fraudulent ( and have been known to be so for more than a century ) !
Three years later , the eminent professor emeritus and taxonomist of Harvard , Ernst Mayr , published his book , What Evolution Is , and on page 28 , used Haeckel ’s original drawings — again , with no mention to the reader that they are deceptive as they are fraudulent .
Interestingly , the same year that the Johnson / Raven book was published , researcher Michael Richardson , in a letter to the editor of Science that appeared in the August 28 , 1998 issue of that journal , lamented : “ Sadly , it is the discredited 1874 drawings that are used in so many British and American biology textbooks ” ( 281:1289 ) .
Yes , sadly , it is .
Stephen J. Gould lamented : “ We should not therefore be surprised that Haeckel ’s drawings entered nineteenth - century textbooks .
But we do , I think , have the right to be both astonished and ashamed by the century of mindless recycling that has led to the persistence of those drawings in a large number , if not a majority , of modern textbooks ” ( 2000 , 109 [ 2 ] :44 , emp. added ) .
One would assume that a well - known publication like National Geographic would possess the ability to internally review and check such basic tenets , in an effort to present only the truth to its readers .
Yet , that same long - discredited material — which even prominent evolutionists admit makes them “ ashamed ” — is exactly what David Quammen attempted to portray in the November 2004 issue of National Geographic as a “ proof ” of evolution .
The question is :
Why is the use of such material — which is known to be fraudulent — allowed to continue ?
Evolutionists themselves have been forced to concede that the idea of embryonic recapitulation apparently has become so deeply rooted in evolutionary dogma and textbook production that it simply cannot be “ weeded out . ”
Paul Ehrlich observed : “ Its shortcomings have been almost universally pointed out by modern authors , but the idea still has a prominent place in biological mythology ” ( 1963 , p. 66 ) .
Indeed it does !
Gould once wrote that embryonic recapitulation is “ an evolutionary notion exceeded only by natural selection itself for impact upon popular culture ” ( 2000 , 109 [ 2] :44 ) .
The evidence of such an assessment is obvious when one looks at just how far - reaching Haeckel ’s drawings have become .
America ’s famous “ baby doctor , ” Benjamin Spock , perpetuated Haeckel ’s recapitulation myth in his well - known book , Baby and Child Care .
Spock confidently assured expectant mothers that each child as he develops is retracing the whole history of mankind , physically and spiritually , step by step .
A baby starts off in the womb as a single tiny cell , just the way the first living thing appeared in the ocean .
Weeks later , as he lies in the amniotic fluid of the womb , he has gills like a fish ( 1998 , p. 223 ) .
Such imagery persists in the popular media , too .
As an example , consider the position of the late atheist Carl Sagan and his third wife , Ann Druyan .
In an article on “ The Question of Abortion ” that they co-authored for Parade magazine , these two humanists contended for the ethical permissibility of human abortion on the grounds that the fetus , growing within a woman ’s body for several months following conception , is not a human being .
Sagan and Druyan stated that the embryo begins as “ a kind of parasite ” that eventually looks like a “ segmented worm . ”
Further alterations , they wrote , reveal “ gill arches ” like that of a “ fish or amphibian . ”
Supposedly , “ reptilian ” features emerge , which later give rise to “ mammalian ... pig - like ” traits .
By the end of two months , according to these two authors , the creature resembles a “ primate but is still not quite human ” ( Sagan and Druyan , 1990 , p. 6 ) .
Although they never mentioned Haeckel by name , their point was clear : abortion in the first few months of pregnancy is acceptable because the embryo or fetus is a lower form of life during this period .
Their conclusion , therefore , was that the killing of this tiny creature is not murder .
And what was the basis for this assertion ?
Sagan and Druyan argued their case by subtly employing the concept known as “ embryonic recapitulation . ”
When , three years later , USA Today published an article on genetic similarities as proof for evolution , the author ’s analogy and sole illustration invoked the icons of comparative embryology ( Friend , 1993 ) .
The cover story of the November 11 , 2002 issue of Time magazine detailed what were at the time the latest findings in human fetal development .
Juxtaposed between the illustrations and the article were photo - captions that contained throwbacks to the outdated concept of embryonic recapitulation theory : “ 32 days : ... The brain is a labyrinth of cell - lined cavities , while the emerging arms and legs still resemble flipper - like paddles .
40 days :
At this point , a human embryo looks no different from that of a pig , chick or elephant .
All have a tail , a yolk sac and rudimentary gills ” ( Nash , 2002 , 160 [ 20 ]:71 ) .
The article itself presented a “ marvelous , ” seemingly “ miraculous , ” and “ vastly complicated ” embryonic process .
But the glossy pictures that accompanied the article — the ones that people tend to remember — had captions that painted an entirely different picture .
The scientific community has known for decades that Ernst Haeckel — the man responsible for conjuring up this theory and then falsifying drawings to support it — purposely misled the public during the late 1800s .
Embryologist Erich Blechschmidt regarded Haeckel ’s “ Great Biogenetic Law ” as one of the most egregious errors in the history of biology .
In his book , The Beginnings of Human Life , he minced no words in repudiating Haeckel ’s fraudulent forgeries : “ The so - called basic law of biogenetics is wrong .
No buts or ifs can mitigate this fact .
It is not even a tiny bit correct or correct in a different form .
It is totally wrong ” ( 1977 , p. 32 ) .
Biologist James W. Leach of Ohio State University bluntly commented :
The undeniable tendency of a complex animal to pass through some developmental stages reminiscent of the adult conditions of a selected and graduated series of lower forms has long been described as the “ Biogenetic Law . ”
But as “ law ” inscribed by nature it is perhaps more full of “ loopholes ” and “ bypasses ” than any law thus far inscribed by man ( 1961 , p. 44 ) .
In their widely used high school biology textbook , Life : An Introduction to Biology , George Gaylord Simpson and William Beck included a footnote to their student readers on this point .
They wrote : “ The human embryo does not have any differentiated gill tissue , and the gill - like pouches do not have open gill slits as in fishes .
Fins are lacking .
The tail is not at all like any fish ’s tail .
Indeed , the resemblance to an adult fish is vague and superficial ” ( 1965 , p. 240 ) .
Simpson and Beck went on to conclude : “ It is now firmly established that ontogeny does not recapitulate phylogeny ” ( p. 241 , emp. in orig . ) .
Haeckel ’s drawings of embryos at three different stages for ( from left to right ) : fish , salamander , tortoise ,
chick , hog , calf , rabbit and man ( from 1876 , Plates VI - VII ) .
The supposed “ gill - slits ” are shown in red .
Why , then , does the concept of embryonic recapitulation persist ?
Perhaps John Tyler Bonner , former head of the biology department at Princeton University , explained it best when he admitted : “ We may have known for almost a hundred years that Haeckel ’s blastaea - gastraea theory of the origin of the metazoa is probably nonsense , but it is so clear - cut , so simple , so easy to hand full - blown to the student ” ( 1961 , p. 240 ) .
Yes , it is .
But is it right ?
No , it is not .
In fact , recognition of Haeckel ’s falsehoods still appears in scientific journals from time to time , as was evident in a letter to the editor in the May 15 , 1998 issue of Science .
The seven authors of the letter pointed out ( correctly ) that Haeckel was overzealous , and purposely gave incorrect details in his embryonic drawings ( Richardson , et al. , 1998 ) .
In her book , Essays in the History of Embryology and Biology , Jane Oppenheimer observed that Haeckel ’s work “ was the culmination of the extremes of exaggeration which followed Darwin ” ( 1967 , p. 150 ) .
She lamented : “ Haeckel ’s doctrines were blindly and uncritically accepted ” and “ delayed the course of embryological progress . ”
Almost thirty years earlier , W.D. Matthew , former chairman of the geology department at the University of California , had acknowledged the fact that , sadly , some doctrines are “ blindly and uncritically accepted . ”
He wrote : “ Many a false theory gets crystallized by time and absorbed into the body of scientific doctrine through lack of adequate criticism when it is formulated ” ( 1939 , p. 159 ) .
Never was there a more blatant case of such , than Haeckel ’s “ Biogenetic Law ” with its catch - phrase of “ ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny . ”
In fact , it is so blatant that Harvard ’s late renowned paleontologist , Stephen J. Gould , devoted one of his articles in Natural History ( the magazine for which he wrote a column each month for twenty - five years ) to the fraud .
He titled it “ Abscheulich ! , ” which is a word from a German dialect meaning “ atrocious ! ”
The subtitle of the article was “ Haeckel ’s distortions did not help Darwin . ”
No , fraudulent to the core as they are , they certainly did not .
Yet that did not stop National Geographic ’s David Quammen from resurrecting embryonic recapitulation as a proof of evolution .
In his “ Abscheulich ! ” article , Dr. Gould concluded by saying : “ But Haeckel ’s High Victorian ( or should I say Bismarckian ) misdeeds provide no fodder to foes of Darwin or evolution ” ( p. 48 ) .
Excuse us for asking , but “ Why not ? ! ”
If fraud in the name of science does not provide such fodder , what would ?
The proof from embryology that Darwin claimed was “ second to none ” in proving evolution true turned out to be worthless at best , and fraudulent at worst .
So what , then , should be the creationist ’s response to embryology as an alleged proof of evolution ?
Our response — if , indeed , any is needed in light of the startling facts presented above — is exactly the same as that offered by the eminent Canadian biologist , W.R. Thompson , in the “ Introduction ” he authored for the 1956 edition of Darwin ’s Origin of Species .
He wrote : “ The ‘ Biogenetic Law ’ as a proof of evolution is valueless ” ( 1956 , p. xvi ) .
Biologist Aaron Wasserman observed that the mammalian embryo “ can in no sense be called a fish ; it never actually develops functional gills and is at all times a mammal ” ( 1973 , p. 497 ) .
Jonathan Sarfati noted : “ A human embryo never looks reptilian or pig- like .
A human embryo is always a human embryo , from the moment of conception ; it is never anything else .
It does not become human sometime after eight weeks ” ( 2002 b , p. 202 , emp. in orig . ) .
Indeed , embryology no longer can be offered as a legitimate proof of evolution .
Although Haeckel ’s theory has fallen into disfavor , embryonic recapitulation is attempting to survive in a newly modified form .
Why , evolutionists ask ( as Quammen did in National Geographic ) , “ do larval forms of a barnacle , before metamorphosis , so similar to the larval form of a shrimp ?
Why do the larvae of moths , flies , and beetles resemble one another more than any of them resemble their respective adults ? ” ( p. 13 ) .
In the current version of embryology as a proof of evolution , adherents argue that similar “ patterns of embryo development ” in different animals establish their common descent .
For example , the neck folds in human embryos ( which Haeckel labeled as “ gill slits ” ) eventually give rise to the jaw .
These folds develop from a similar area of the vertebrate column , and are controlled by similar gene sequences , as the gill arches of fish embryos ( e.g. , Gould , 1990 , p. 16 ; cf. also Gould 2000 , p. 49 ) .
The evolutionist concludes from this that fish and humans had a common ancestor .
However , this similarity also is evidence of common design .
Mice , men , and pigs have four appendages and a head , and therefore it is not surprising that embryos should follow a similar path of development .
Indeed , the ability of embryos to form in such perfection demands something more than evolution .
Natural selection works primarily on organisms exposed to the environment or competition .
Yet the embryo is isolated from the outside world .
Evolutionary processes are at a loss to explain the origin of the mechanism that causes a fertilized egg to develop into a young version of the adult .
Life ’s startling complexity — complete with DNA - coded instruction causing each embryo to be totally different from all others — is compelling evidence of a masterful plan of design inherent in the system .
As one writer put it : ... in terms of DNA and protein , right at conception each of these types of life is as totally different chemically as each will ever be structurally ....
Embryonic development is not even analogous to evolution , which is meant to indicate a progressive increase in potential .
The right Greek word instead would be entelechy , which means an unfolding of potential present right from the beginning .
That ’s the kind of development that so clearly requires creative design ( Morris , 1982 , p. 34 , italics in orig . ) .
What could be clearer ?
From DNA to the organs of the body , evidence of design is everywhere , while gradualistic development is countered by the perpetual discontinuity seen in nature .
There is nothing — either in the proposed mechanisms , or by direct observation — to show that Darwin ’s theory of general evolution is a “ fact ” of science .
I found a Google Talk on a topic that 's related to the motto of my blog - " good coders code , great reuse " .
In this talk , professor Tao Xie speaks about his research on using public code repositories together with code search engines for finding common API usage patterns and anti-patterns .
His research software uses the following four code search engines .
Google Code Search with billions of lines of code .
Krugle with 2.5 billion LOC .
Koders with 760 million LOC .
Codase with 250 million LOC .
He suggests to view Raphael Volz 's analysis for more information about these search engines .
Tao has developed three tools , which use the aforementioned search engines :
PARSEWeb for finding API usage patterns ,
XWeb for finding forgotten exception handlers , and
NEGWeb for finding misuses of API calls .
See the code mining project website for more information .
The lecture is done in a very academic manner and it's very hard to follow .
Be sure that you are really interested in this topic before watching it .
Some excerpts from the lecture :
[ 04:26 ]
A problem with data mining on source code is that it might not have enough data points ( usages of API ) to discover common patterns .
[ 04:58 ]
It is crucial to have a lot of data points to get good results out of data mining
[ 08:37 ] Google Code Search indexes publicly hosted SVN and CVS repositories .
[ 09:20 ]
Example of searching for C stdlib 's fopen usage on Google Code Search ( query : " lang : C file : .c$ fopen\s * \ ( "
[ 11:08 ] Example of the same search on Krugle .
[ 16:40 ]
Code search engines return partial code samples .
Various heuristics are used for type inference .
[ 22:05 ]
Example of integrating Tao's PARSEWeb into Eclipse .
[ 28:15 ]
Interesting idea of constructing and issuing multiple queries to find more code samples .
[ 36:20 ]
A study showed that a proper deallocation of resources after an exception resulted in 17 % performance increase .
I 'd like to hear some comments on websites that you use for finding code examples !
With violence rising in Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden still at large , there are ample signs of the United States ’ continued battles with terrorism .
But Mr. Bush and his advisers say that seven years without an attack has lulled many Americans .
“ As Sept. 11 , 2001 , recedes into the past , there are some people who have come to think of it as kind of a singular event and of there being nothing else out there , ” Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey told House lawmakers in July .
“ In a way , we are the victims of our own success , our own success being that another attack has been prevented . ”
Mr. Mukasey laid out the administration ’s thinking in a July 21 speech to a conservative Washington policy institute in response to yet another rebuke on presidential powers by the Supreme Court : its ruling that prisoners at Guantánamo Bay , were entitled to habeas corpus rights to contest their detentions in court .
The administration wants Congress to set out a narrow framework for those prisoner appeals .
But the administration ’s six - point proposal goes further .
It includes not only the broad proclamation of a continued “ armed conflict with Al Qaeda , ” but also the desire for Congress to “ reaffirm that for the duration of the conflict the United States may detain as enemy combatants those who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported Al Qaeda , the Taliban and associated organizations . ”
That broad language hints at why Democrats , and some Republicans , worry about the consequences .
It could , they say , provide the legal framework for Mr. Bush and his successor to assert once again the president ’s broad interpretation of the commander in chief ’s wartime powers , powers that Justice Department lawyers secretly used to justify the indefinite detention of terrorist suspects and the National Security Agency ’s wiretapping of Americans without court orders .
The language recalls a resolution , known as the Authorization for Use of Military Force , passed by Congress on Sept. 14 , 2001 .
It authorized the president to “ use all necessary and appropriate force ” against those responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks to prevent future strikes .
That authorization , still in effect , was initially viewed by many members of Congress who voted for it as the go - ahead for the administration to invade Afghanistan and overthrow the Taliban , which had given sanctuary to Mr. bin Laden .
But the military authorization became the secret legal basis for some of the administration ’s most controversial legal tactics , including the wiretapping program , and that still gnaws at some members of Congress .

A Cuyahoga County judge intends to crusade for stricter deterrents against sex between patients at a state - run mental hospital .
Judge Nancy Margaret Russo called officials from the Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare facility to Common Pleas Court on Thursday to question them about their handling of a mentally ill Shaker Heights woman who the judge sent for treatment last year .
Russo said she was shocked to learn the 33 - year - old woman received birth - control pills and counseling after she was caught having sex three times with two other patients at the facility .
Russo questioned Dr. Joy Stankowski , a Northcoast psychiatrist , who said some patients are mentally competent to engage in sexual relationships .
" I am appalled that you think sex is a freedom they deserve , " Russo said .
" I believe it 's a betrayal of the trust I placed in you " to treat the mentally ill woman .
In its policy statement , Northcoast acknowledges that sexual behavior between patients at the hospital , while discouraged , is " not always harmful or possible to prevent . "
Russo said she plans to send a transcript of the hearing to Gov. Ted Strickland and to the Ohio Department of Mental Health , which overseas the Northcoast facility .
Russo also ordered the woman not to engage in sex at the hospital again , and ordered the staff to enforce her restrictions .
" I do n't care if they tell you it 's OK to have a boyfriend , " Russo told the woman .
" I 'm telling you it 's not . "
Northcoast spokeswoman Amy Cooper said officials there are open to reforms .
" We stand united with the judge , " Cooper said , " and we are more than happy to discuss any of our policies with her . "
The number of powerful psychiatric drugs prescribed to England 's children has risen by more than half in four years , government figures have revealed .
GPs in England are handing out prescriptions for anti-psychotic drugs for children as young as seven at the rate of 250 a day , according to figures obtained by The Independent on Sunday .
Latest data compiled for the NHS show that tranquillisers designed to treat serious conditions including schizophrenia in adults were prescribed to young people 57,000 times in 2003 .
But the total had risen to more than 90,000 by 2006 – a 59 per cent rise in three years .
The figures do not include drugs dispensed in hospitals .
Experts believe the increase is partly down to early detection and treatment of serious mental health problems in children , but there is also concern they are being used inappropriately to treat psychological and learning difficulties .
Shortage of staff and resources are further factors .

The drugs , which are designed to treat symptoms such as visual hallucinations , hearing voices and delusional thoughts , have serious side effects including weight gain , tiredness , sexual dysfunction and lactation .
The safety and effectiveness of these drugs , which were designed for adults , have not been fully tested on children .
Official guidelines say they should be used only as part of a wider treatment package , but there are concerns GPs are relying on them too heavily because other treatments are unavailable .
Some GPs , however , stand accused of ignoring or being ignorant of the guidelines .
England 's mental health chief , Louis Appleby , said , " We are aware that anti-psychotic drugs are sometimes used as a last resort by clinicians dealing with highly disturbed behaviours in young people , and we are now considering how to prepare clinical guidance on this area of practice . "
Psychiatrists and mental health charities have warned against using anti-psychotic drugs on developing minds .
Paul Corry , director of public affairs for the mental health charity Rethink , said : " It is worrying that these very powerful drugs designed for adults are being given in such high numbers to children before their brains are fully developed .
" If the increase is because previously undiagnosed teenagers are now getting treatment , then that is positive .
But it is difficult to justify the widespread use of these drugs in younger children because it is actually unlikely they will have schizophrenia at such a young age . "
Anti-psychotics are commonly used to treat conditions including schizophrenia , mania and delusional disorder by blocking the chemical dopamine in the brain .
But they have also been widely used for their " calming " effects in other conditions , such as autism and hyperactivity .
MPs and pressure groups have already complained about the use of anti-psychotic drugs in care homes to manage people with dementia – often to treat " behaviour that is neither distressing nor threatening , such as restlessness or being vocal " .
But experts have raised further concerns about their growing use on young people .
A study by the University of London 's School of Pharmacy last month found that the prescription of the drugs to children almost doubled between 1992 and 2005 – with the greatest increase among children aged seven to 12 .
Figures provided for the IoS from the NHS Prescription Cost Analysis ( PCA ) system prove that the trend has continued to rise dramatically .
The increase in costs can be partly explained by the move towards prescribing newer or atypical drugs , which are more expensive but generally have fewer and less severe side effects .
But mental health campaigners are outraged by the number of older , typical drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol still being prescribed .
There were more than 7,000 prescriptions for these two drugs , widely known as a " chemical cosh " , in 2006 , which means nearly 20 prescriptions every day .
According to Rethink , there is no excuse for prescribing these powerful drugs and they should have been phased out .
Mr Corry said : " The use of these older drugs is just wrong .
There is no excuse at all .
They may be cheaper but they are associated with some of the most debilitating and stigmatising mental healthcare from the 20th century , which led to people behaving like zombies . "
Guidelines from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence ( Nice ) state that atypical anti-psychotics should be the first choice for treatment for young people , who should be given all necessary information to make an informed choice about treatment .
Many young people complain they are not warned about the side effects .
When Elaine Hewis 's teenage daughter was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 2004 , she assumed the treatment would be far removed from that she herself had received .
But Mrs Hewis , 43 , was wrong .
She said : " The doctors had prescribed her anti-psychotics within days .
But despite my pleas they refused to tell her about the side effects because they were worried she would n't take them if she knew .
" When she came to me distressed because her breasts were leaking milk , I told her this had happened to me and again tried to get the doctors to be honest with her .
They then tried to remove me as her nearest relative because they felt I was a bad influence . "
New teams have been brought in to catch cases early .
Psychiatrists and nurses would work closely with teachers , youth workers , school nurses , family therapists , social workers and psychologists .
While progress has been made , the reality is that many of these teams have few resources and the emphasis is often on drug treatments .
Mr Corry said : " It is a crying shame because early intervention is one of the rare parts of mental health with an evidence base .
If we get to people early and treat them with a combination of psychological , social and medical intervention , then their chances of a full recovery increase dramatically .
But you need to do all of these things , not just the medication . "
Clinical psychologist Rufus May was treated with anti-psychotics as a teenager .
He believes the drugs stop a young person from understanding their symptoms and from learning skills to manage difficult experiences by trying to block them out .
He said : " The early intervention movement has turned into the early drugging movement .
These very powerful drugs can affect the emotional and cognitive development of a young person as well as sapping them of their confidence and motivation . "
But psychiatrists argue the rise in prescribing to children represents a success .
Young people are being treated earlier .
Professor Sue Bailey from the Royal College of Psychiatrists said : " This increase reflects the development of better adolescent mental health services , which means ill children are being identified earlier , and we are going in more assertively with a treatment package that includes medication .
" Early identification and treatment lead to better outcomes .
The real difficulty we face is convincing young people to take the medication and stay compliant . "
' No one ever talked about side effects with me , not once '
Lucy Bennett , 19 , from Exeter , lives with her seven - month - old son Harvey .
For a year she lived in psychiatric hospitals with medication the only option .
" By the time I was 15 I had every problem you can imagine .
I was into drugs , alcohol , boys , and had stopped going to school .
After years of growing up with my mum 's mental illness and alcohol problems , I was on a road to self - destruction .
I finally told a psychiatrist in A&E I was hearing voices after which I was admitted to hospital straight away .
" I felt terrible .
I was all over the place , so when the doctors and nurses told me the medication would make me feel better , I took them .
In some ways I did feel a bit better .
I was a complete zombie and sleeping all the time which meant I did n't care about the voices any more , but they were still there .
" Within days I had started leaking milk from my breast .
It was awful .
I swapped medication and within three months I had put on three stone .
I was so depressed at being a size 16 I started making myself sick .
I ended up with bulimia as well .
" As soon as I decided I did n't want to take the drugs I was sectioned and forcibly injected .
I ended pretending the voices had gone just so I could get out .
Drugs were the only option .
I had a psychology session for an hour a week and a few family therapy sessions but that was it .
No one ever talked about side effects with me , not once .
I ended up having to get information from my mum and other patients .
" Three years later I am medication free and learning new ways to cope with my voices .
I have a great community psychiatric nurse , who lets me keep some medication for emergencies , but I 'm in control now .
There is no way I could look after my son if I was still on the medication .
I know they can help some people but they did n't help me .
I should have been given the choice . "

KOLKATA : When it comes to iPhone hackers , techies at Sunil Mittal���s Bharti Airtel expect to have the last laugh .
They claim even the most deadly hackers on the planet won���t be able to crack the codes that support the iPhone���s Airtel applications with rival company SIMs .
So , even if a hacker manages to make voice calls from an Airtel iPhone using the SIM of a rival GSM operator , he would be denied access to both exclusive icons ��� �� �Airtel Live��� and �� �Airtel Apps��� -- which are gateways to the full spectrum of Airtel applications built into the iconic gizmo .
This means a potential hacker of an Apple iPhones procured from Airtel won���t get to access to either content or entertainment features on Airtel Live -- a customised portal designed purely for Airtel subscribers .
With no access to Airtel Live , he can ���t access any text , audio , video , static images , music or gaming options available on the preloaded Airtel Live portal application .
Neither does he get to use the powerful Google search engine .
Worse , the hacker also draws a blank if he tries activating any super secure applications like mobile payment ( m - Check ) that can otherwise be accessed by Airtel users by clicking the �� �Airtel Apps��� icon on the iPhone .
m- Check , would typically enable a user to manage his Airtel account or even do money transfers from his iPhone .
Confirming this , Bharti Airtel���s IT director Jai Menon , who is also chief information officer ( CIO ) of Bharti Enterprises told , �� �Even if a hacker figures out a way to make voice calls from an iPhone procured from our stores using a non-Airtel SIM , he will not be able to access any of the �� �Airtel Live��� or �� �Airtel Apps��� features built into all the iPhones sold by Airtel .
We���ve built in suitable levels of security to ensure both applications remain out of bounds for hackers .
All iPhones distributed by Airtel will run on OSX ( Version 2 ) OS which also powers Apple notebooks worldwide .��
�He adds , �� �Airtel���s IT group has worked with Apple for over a year to uniquely evolve a bunch of operator - specific applications on the iPhone .
In fact , Airtel is perhaps the only mobile operator besides Australia���s Optus that has evolved operator - specific applications on Apple���s iconic phone .��
�Incidentally , ���developing operator - specific iPhone applications was pretty much a stealth exercise that transpired by leveraging Airtel���s service delivery platform , which is a $ 100 million tech initiative , ��� said Menon .

Abstract :
The garage innovator creates new web applications which may rocket to popular success - or sink when the flash crowd that arrives melts the web server .
In the web context , utility computing provides a path by which the innovator can , with minimal capital , prepare for overwhelming popularity .
Many components required for web computing have recently become available as utilities .
We analyze the design space of building a load - balanced system in the context of garage innovation .
We present six experiments that inform this analysis by highlighting limitations of each approach .
We report our experience with three services we deployed in ``garage '' style , and with the flash crowds that each drew .
For years , developers and researchers have refined ways of scaling Internet services to larger and larger capacities .
Many well - known techniques are now available [ 33,17,4,19,6,36,15,13 ] .
But capacity is expensive : racks full of web servers , database replicas , and load balancing switches require a significant up - front investment .
For popular sites , where load is consistently high , it is easy to justify this investment ; the resources will not be idle .
Less popular sites can not justify the expense of large idle capacity .
But how can an unpopular site make the transition to popular -- when ``flash crowds '' often make that transition almost instantaneous and without warning ?
In this paper , we consider the question of scaling through the eyes of a character we call the garage innovator .
The garage innovator is creative , technically savvy , and ambitious .
She has a great idea for the Next Big Thing on the web and implements it using some spare servers sitting out in the garage .
The service is up and running , draws new visitors from time to time , and makes some meager income from advertising and subscriptions .
Someday , perhaps , her site will hit the jackpot .
Maybe it will reach the front page of Slashdot or Digg ; maybe Valleywag or the New York Times will mention it .
Our innovator may get only one shot at widespread publicity .
If and when that happens , tens of thousands of people will visit her site .
Since her idea is so novel , many will become revenue - generating customers and refer friends .
But a flash crowd is notoriously fickle ; the outcome wo n't be nearly as idyllic if the site crashes under its load .
Many people wo n't bother to return if the site does n't work the first time .
Still , it is hard to justify paying tens of thousands of dollars for resources just in case the site experiences a sudden load spike .
Flash crowds are both the garage innovator 's bane and her goal .
One way out of this conundrum has been enabled by contemporary utility computing .
More and more of the basic building blocks of scalability -- network bandwidth , large - scale storage , and compute servers -- are now available in forms analogous to traditional utilities like electricity and water .
That is , a contract with a utility has very little overhead , gives you access to vast resources almost instantly , and only bills you for the resources you use .
Over the past year , our research group created three web sites that experienced sudden surges in popularity , including one that was ( literally ) Slashdotted .
Each was implemented using publicly available computing utilities and was able to withstand its flash crowd at low cost .
In this paper , we contribute a detailed analysis of the issues and tradeoffs a typical garage innovator will encounter when building low - cost , scalable Internet services .
We explain these tradeoffs in Section 3 .
Our analysis draws heavily from both a series of controlled micro- benchmark experiments , which we describe in Section 4 , and wisdom gleaned from our own deployment of three ``garage - scalable ' ' services , all of which were subject to real flash crowds .
These case studies , found in Section 5 , report our design and implementation decisions , how each service responded to a flash crowd , and lessons learned from each experience .
Before diving into our analysis , however , we first lay groundwork in Section 2 , which describes the current state of utility computing and briefly reviews the most common strategies for building scalable Internet services .
2 Contemporary Utility Computing
The past two years have seen a surge of tools that are wonderfully useful for garage innovators .
We describe several of them in this section .
First , we offer a list of what we think are the properties essential for garage use :
Low overhead during the lean times .
Cost should be proportional to use , not to capacity .
During long periods of unpopularity , a garage budget can't pay for the huge capacity that might someday be needed .
Highly scalable .
The garage - based service may only need one server today , but when the flash crowd comes , it might need 20 or 200 .
Worst - case flash crowd resources have to be available : if a service is underprovisioned , there is no point in using it .
Quickly scalable .
It 's not enough that large - scale resources are available ; they have to be available quickly .
There 's no time to call customer service , ask for an upgraded account , and start configuring machines .
Flash crowds are notoriously fickle .
If a service can't scale in near - immediate response to a surge of interest , there is no point in using it .
Services that meet these criteria are often referred to as utility computing , a term coined by John McCarthy in 1961 .
Utility computing services rely on statistical multiplexing : providing service to a large number of customers whose load spikes are likely to be de-correlated .
An early shift towards utility computing , and a good illustrative example , can be found in the way large colocation centers sell bandwidth to customers .
It is common today to see it billed as a utility : a customer gets a fast ( say , 100 Mbps ) connection to her servers .
The entire 100 M bps is usable , and actual usage is metered .
Using very little bandwidth costs very little ; a sudden usage surge is billed accordingly .
This contrasts with circuits installed to an individual customer 's site , virtually all of which are billed according to peak capacity regardless of actual usage .
1 Building Blocks
In this section , we lay the foundation for the rest of the paper , describing some of the utility computing services that have arisen in the past few years .
Then , in Section 2.2 , we describe a few well - known scaling architectures and describe how a garage innovator can implement them using the utility building blocks that are available today .
1 Storage Delivery Networks
One great boon to the garage innovator has been the rise of Storage Delivery Networks ( SDNs ) , such as Amazon 's S3 [ 26 ] and the Nirvanix platform [ 25 ] .
SDNs have interfaces that resemble a simple managed web server .
Developers can upload static files such as web pages and images that the SDN will store and serve to clients using standard HTTP .
Unlike traditional managed web hosting , often implemented using a single machine , SDNs are large clusters of tightly coupled machines .
The implementation details of data replication , distributed consensus , and load distribution are all hidden behind the simple static - content interface .
A single customer 's flash crowd can potentially use the full power of the entire cluster .
This strategy should sound familiar : SDNs are similar to Content Distribution Networks ( CDNs ) such as Akamai [ 1 ] and Limelight Networks [ 21 ] .
CDNs and SDNs have a number of technical differences ; for example , SDNs are typically located in a single datacenter , while CDNs minimize latency using thousands of Internet points of presence .
CDNs are far less attractive to garage innovators than SDNs , however - - not for technical reasons , but economic ones .
The cost of entry into a CDNs is typically high , as well as frustratingly opaque [ 29 ] ( ``contact a sales representative for more information ! '' ) .
Large start - up costs and minimum bandwidth commitments place most CDNs out of the reach of garage innovators who do n't yet have the budget associated with a wide audience .
S3 and Nirvanix have no start - up or recurring costs ; they are strictly fee - for - service utilities .
A customer who serves one gigabyte of data in a month will literally be billed 20 cents for the month .
There may be no fundamental technical or economic reason why CDNs cannot adopt a similar billing model ; perhaps some day they will .
SDNs thus fill a useful niche today for the garage innovator .
They are more quickly scalable than typical managed hosting servers ; they do not carry the significant expense of geo-distribution that is inherent to CDNs ; and their pricing models allow flash crowd - capable content distribution without any significant investment until the flash crowd arrives .
We mentioned in the introduction of Section 2 that colocation centers now charge for bandwidth in a utility - computing , garage - friendly way .
However , up until recently , the only way to exploit utility bandwidth was to buy or rent a server and pay a monthly fee ( typically a few hundred dollars ) to host it .
For the garage innovator on a truly shoe - string budget , this can be prohibitive .
Dozens of hosting companies now offer virtual machines for rent , typically starting at around 20 dollars a month .
There are dozens of examples ( search the Internet for ``virtual private servers ' ' ) .
Setup usually takes about a day .
Developers can use these virtual machines to exploit the pay - per-use bandwidth of a colo facility without the overhead of using an entire physical machine .
Garage innovators can also exploit the fact that virtual servers are so widely available around the globe - - offered by hosting providers in dozens of locations around the United States , Europe , Asia , and the Pacific Rim .
By renting several of them , a developer on a limited budget can achieve a level of geographic diversity that was formerly only possible for large - scale Internet services with large - scale budgets .
3 Compute Clouds
While the widespread availability of virtual servers has been a boon , it did have an important limitation .
The flexibility of a virtual server was typically only in burstable bandwidth .
If an application is CPU or disk intensive , a flash crowd does n't just need more bandwidth , it needs more servers .
Consequently , in the past year , companies have begun to follow the utility computing model for entire virtual machines , not just the bandwidth they consume .
Amazon's EC2 ``elastic compute cloud ' ' [ 2 ] and FlexiScale [ 35 ] stand out in this area .
They allow developers to configure and save a virtual machine image , then create multiple running instances of that image .
Images can be instantiated in about one minute .
Usage is billed by the hour , rather than by the month .
Virtual machines can be started and stopped using a simple programmatic API .
This makes it possible for a garage innovator to create an image of a machine running her Internet service , monitor the load , and almost instantly increase the number of running instances if needed .
As we will see in Section 2.2 , there are several ways of scalably distributing the load of an Internet service over multiple servers , each with different advantages .
4 DNS Outsourcing
Another useful computing utility is outsource Domain Name System ( DNS ) hosting .
DNS traffic is usually a small part of a site 's resource budget , but outsourced managed DNS is useful because of the reliability it provides .
As we will see in later sections ( particularly , Section 3.5 ) , managed DNS can prevent failure of a DNS machine from becoming a single point of failure for garage - based services .
Typical services in this space are the highly redundant and low - cost UltraDNS [ 24 ] and Granite Canyon 's free Public DNS Service [ 14 ] .
Their DNS servers replicate and serve the DNS for customer domains .
They automatically copy the authoritative DNS configuration every time they receive a change notification .
5 A missing piece : relational databases
Dynamic web services are often implemented as a collection of stateless front - end servers that paint a user interface over data stored in a relational database back end .
Relational databases ' powerful transactional model provides idiot - proof concurrency management , and their automatic indexing and query planning relieve programmers from the burden of designing efficient persistent data structures [ 8 ] .
However , implementing highly - scalable databases that retain the full generality of the relational model has proven elusive .
Scalable databases typically abandon full transactionality , arbitrary queries , or both .
Utility access to a scalable database is therefore even further in the future .
There exist lightweight scalable utility databases , such as S3 and Amazon 's SimpleDB [ 3 ] .
Later in the paper ( Sections 5.1.2 and 5.2.2 ) , we describe experiences substituting the conventional relational database , sometimes with a lightweight database , and other times with alternate workarounds .
Every approach incurs a higher development cost over using a powerful relational database , a cost of scalability we do not know how to eliminate today .
2 Scaling Architectures
Before proceeding to our analysis ( Section 3 ) , we will briefly review some of the common scaling architectures used today for Internet services .
This discussion focuses purely on the Internet - facing part of the system : that is , methods for rendezvous of a large number of Internet clients to the large number of Internet - facing servers that handle their sessions .
We do not consider scalability of back - end elements such as databases , though we do touch briefly on this issue in Sections 5.1.2 and 5.2.2 .
This section will describe each design , and briefly touch on its main advantages and disadvantages .
1 Using the bare SDN
Most of the design alternatives we will consider assume that an innovator 's web site has dynamic content , and therefore requires a compute cluster that can run garage code .
However , some web sites consist primarily of static content .
Others , such as those for video and photo sharing , often serve a small amount of dynamic content coupled with a much larger load serving static content .
For example , video sharing sites typically show dynamic web pages that display the latest comments and ratings , but the contained video is a much larger static object .
In these cases , simply storing the static parts of a web site on an SDN is near ideal for the garage innovator .
Using the SDN costs our innovator virtually nothing up - front beyond the small fee for storage .
Because of the statistical multiplexing we described in Section 2.1.1 , the SDN is likely to be highly available even during the arrival of a flash crowd .
The main disadvantage of using an SDN , of course , is that it serves only static content .
2 DNS load - balanced cluster
We now turn our attention to clusters running custom code designed by our garage innovator .
One simple approach is to use the DNS protocol to balance load :
A collection of servers implement the custom web service , and a DNS server maps a single name to the complete list of IP addresses of the servers [ 5 ] .
Standard DNS servers will permute this list in round - robin fashion ; if clients try the addresses in order , then various clients will be randomly spread across the servers .
Clients should also fail over to a second address if the first one does not reply , affording fault tolerance .
( In sections 4.3 and 4.4 , we will show how these properties can fail . )
When a flash crowd arrives , new servers are brought online , and the DNS record is updated to include their addresses .
Clients of ISPs that have cached the previous record wo n't see the new servers until the old record expires .
Fortunately , the nature of a flash crowd means that most of the traffic is new .
On the other hand , record expiration does reduce the responsiveness of DNS load balancing to server failure .
A startup called RightScale offers a DNS load - balancing management layer in front of EC2 [ 31 ] .
Another way to rendezvous clients with servers is to use a front - end server whose only function is HTTP redirection [ 11 ] .
Microsoft 's ``Live Mail '' ( formerly Hotmail ) exemplifies this strategy .
Users access the server at mail.live.com .
If they have a login cookie , they are immediately given an HTTP redirect to a specific host in the Live Mail farm , such as by120w.bay120.mail.live.com .
( Users who are not logged in are redirected to a login page . )
All interactions beyond the first redirection happen directly with that machine .
The HTTP redirector , of course , can base its redirection decisions on instantaneous load and availability information about the servers in its farm .
This solution is attractive for two reasons .
First , it introduces very little overhead : the redirector is not involved in the session other than providing the initial redirect .
Second , redirection does n't take much time ; a single redirection server can supply redirections to a large number of clients very quickly .
( URL forwarding services such as tinyurl.com and snipurl.com demonstrate of this : individual redirections take very little time , so they can easily provide redirection service at Internet scales . )
4 L4 or L7 Load Balancing
In both L4 and L7 load balancing , a machine answers all requests on a single IP address , and spreads the request streams out to back - end servers to balance load .
The client appears to communicate with a single logical host , so there is no dependency on client behavior .
Faults can be quickly mitigated because the load - balancing machine can route new requests away from a failed server as soon as the failure is known .
L4 ( layer 4 ) load balancing is also known as ``reverse network address translation ( NAT ) ' ' .
An L4 balancer inspects only the source IP address and TCP port of each incoming packet , forwarding each TCP stream to one of the back - end servers .
L4 balancing can run at ``router speeds '' , since the computational requirements are so modest .
L7 ( layer 7 ) load balancing is also known as ``reverse proxying ' ' .
An HTTP L7 load balancer acts as a TCP endpoint , collects an entire HTTP request , parses and examines the headers , and then forwards the entire request to one of the back - end servers .
L7 balancing requires deeper processing than L4 , but provides the balancer the opportunity to make mapping decisions based on HTTP - level variables ( such as a session cookie ) , or even application - specific variables .
One important disadvantage of load balancers is that high - performance load balancing switches can be very expensive ( tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars ) , difficult to fit into a garage budget .
However , there are lower - cost options .
First , there is free software , such as Linux Virtual Server [ 22 ] , and commodity software , such as Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server [ 32 ] , that implement L4 and L7 load balancing , though they are less performant than dedicated hardware .
The second option is a service introduced in October of 2007 by FlexiScale [ 35 ] .
They combine on - demand virtual machines with fractional ( utility ) access to a high - performance L4/L7 load balancing switch .
To our knowledge , this is the only current offering of a load balancing switch billed as a utility .
The techniques described above can be combined to offset their various limitations .
One example above ( Section 2.2.1 ) splits a service , such as a video sharing site , into a low - bandwidth active component managed by a load - balanced cluster , and a high - bandwidth static component served out of the SDN .
Alternatively , consider a DNS cluster of L4/L7 load balancers : Each L4/L7 cluster is fault - tolerant mitigating DNS ' sluggishness to recover from back - end faults ; and the entire configuration can scale beyond the limits of a single L4/L7 cluster .

3 Analysis of the Design Space
In this section , we analyze the tradeoffs a garage innovator is likely to encounter when building a scalable service , using one of the design templates we reviewed in Section 2.2 , and implemented on top of the building blocks we reviewed in Section 2.1 .
Our analysis is drawn from both a series of micro- benchmark experiments , fleshed out in Section 4 , and lessons learned from our own implementations , described in Section 5 .
The important design criteria are :
Application scope .
Does this design work only for the web , or for every kind of Internet service ?
Scale limitations .
What is the crucial scale - limiting factor of the design ?
Client affinity .
Different load distribution strategies have different effects on how consistently a client binds to a particular server .
What behavior must the garage innovator expect ?
Scale - up and Scale - down time .
How long does it take to expand and contract the server farm ?
Response to failures .
How many users do typical failures affect ?
What 's the worst - case effect of a single failure ?
Table 1 has a concise summary of the discussion in this section .
Roughly speaking , the rows of Table 1 correspond to paper sections 3.1 - 3.6 ; the columns of Table 1 correspond to 2.1.1- 2.2.4 .
1 Application Scope
The first and most basic question of any scalability strategy is : will it work with my application ?
The Bare SDN has the most restrictive application model .
Services like S3 have a specific , narrow interface : they serve static content via HTTP .
Of course , many sites contain large repositories of static content ; we describe examples in Sections 5 and 5.1.2 .
However , most are not exclusively static , so the bare SDN is rarely the complete story .
The HTTP Redirector is slightly wider in scope .
Redirection only works with HTTP ( and , perhaps , a very small number of other protocols with a redirection primitive ) .
However , unlike with an SDN , clients can be redirected to servers that can run user code , facilitating dynamic web services .
However , this technique does not work for protocols that have no redirection primitive , such as FTP , SSH , SMTP and IRC .
L7 load balancers understand a specific application - layer protocols such as HTTP and FTP , and thus are constrained by their vocabulary .
DNS load balancing and L4 load balancers work with all applications .
DNS works broadly because most applications use a common resolver library that iterates through DNS A - records until it finds one that works .
L4 load balancers work broadly because they operate at the IP layer , thus working with any application protocol running over IP without cooperation from the client .
2 Scale Limitation
A crucial consideration is scaling limits : what bottleneck are we likely to encounter first as the system gets larger ?
SDNs have implementation bottlenecks that are , to put it simply , not our problem .
The two main SDNs today have service level agreements that make scaling their responsibility .
A garage innovator can pretend the capacity is infinite .
HTTP redirection is involved only at the beginning of each client 's session , and thus its scaling limit depends on the typical duration of client sessions .
Longer sessions amortize the cost of doing the redirection during session setup .
Our experience is that redirection is so cheap that , for typical applications , it scales to thousands or more clients .
To evaluate this hypothesis , we built and measured a load - balancing , server - allocating HTTP redirector , described in Section 4.1 .
L4/L7 load balancing is limited by the forwarder 's ability to process the entire volume of client traffic .
How this limit affects a web service depends on the service 's ratio of bandwidth to computation .
Sites that do very little computation per unit of communication , such as video sharing sites , are likely to be quickly bottlenecked at the load balancer -- especially a load balancer that is built from commodity hardware .
Conversely , sites that compute - intensive and communication - light , such as a search engine , will be able to use an L4 load balancer to support far more users and back - end servers .
DNS load balancing has virtually no scaling limit for garage innovators .
Our experiment described in Section 4.5 suggests that thousands of back - end servers can be named in a DNS record .
A service that requires more than several thousand servers is safely out of the garage regime .
One tangle is that the success of DNS - based load balancing depends on sane client behavior .
Most clients behave well , selecting a random server from a DNS record with multiple IP addresses .
Unfortunately , some client resolvers defeat load balancing by apparently sorting the list of IP addresses returned , and using the first !
See Section 4.4 .
3 Client Affinity
Consider a single client that issues a long series of related requests to a web service .
For example , a user might log into a web - based email service and send dozens of separate requests as he reads and writes mail .
The implementation of many such applications is easier and more efficient if related requests are handled by the same server .
Some load balancing techniques can enforce this property ; others do not .
SDNs provide a simple contract : the client requests an object by URI , and the SDN delivers the entire object in a single transaction .
The SDN is responsible for fulfilling the request , regardless of where it arrives .
HTTP redirection provides strong client affinity because a user is sent to a specific machine at the beginning of each session .
The client will continue using that server until the user explicitly navigates to a new URL .
L4 balancers , in principle , could map each client by its source IP address .
In practice , however , NAT may hide a large population of clients behind a single IP address , confounding the balancer 's ability to spread load .
Conversely , a user behind multiple proxies may send a series of requests that appear to be from different IP addresses .
Absent source address mapping , the L4 balancer can provide no affinity , and thus the back - end service accepts the responsibility to bring the data to the server ( Section 5.2.2 ) or vice versa ( Section 5.1.2 ) .
L7 balancing works transparently for any client that implements HTTP cookies or a service - specific session protocol well enough to maintain the session when interacting with a single server .
Because it can identify individual sessions , the L7 balancer can enforce client affinity .
In the case of DNS load balancing , however , clients and proxies misbehave in interesting ways that confound client affinity .
DNS resolvers seem to cluster around a particular address when we would rather they did n't ( Section 4.4 ) ; and many browsers implement ``DNS pinning '' to mitigate cross - site scripting attacks [ 18 ] .
Despite these properties , client browsers cannot be relied upon to show affinity for a particular server , as we describe in Section 4.6 .
In summary , HTTP redirection and L7 balancing can enforce client affinity .
For L4 balancing and DNS balancing , we recommend that the service assume the front end offers no client affinity .
4 Scale - Up and Scale - Down Time
Scale - up time of the server farm is a crucial concern : can a farm grow quickly enough to meet the offered load of a flash crowd ?
Scale - down time , on the other hand , does not usually affect the user experience ; it is important only for efficiency 's sake .
If the system can not quickly scale back down after a period of high load , the service is needlessly expensive : our innovator is paying for resources she does n't need .
Bare SDNs have essentially instantaneous scale - up and scale - down time .
Services like S3 always have enormous capacity to handle the aggregate load of all their customers .
The magic of statistical multiplexing hides our garage innovator 's peak loads in the noise .
HTTP Redirectors and L4/L7 Load Balancers have identical scale - up and scale - down behavior .
Once the decision to increase capacity has been made , these systems must first wait for a new virtual machine instance to be created .
Anecdotally , our experience with Amazon EC2 has shown this usually happens in about one minute .
The moment the VM has been created , the load balancers can start directing traffic to them .
Scale - down time is a bit more difficult to pin down precisely .
Once a scaling - down decision has been made , the load balancers can immediately stop directing new ( incoming ) sessions to the machines that are slated for termination .
However , existing sessions , such as slow HTTP transfers or mail transactions , will likely be in progress .
To avoid user - visible disruption , these long - lived sessions must be allowed to complete before shutting down the machine .
In many cases , transport - level session terminations are hidden from the user by well - written clients that re-establish new connections automatically .
A pedant might insist that the scale - down time is really the worst - case session length .
Chen et al . [ 7 ] explore how to minimize the number of disrupted long - lived sessions by biasing the allocation of new sessions to servers even before the scale - down decision has been made .
DNS load balancing is the most problematic in its control over load balancing .
Recall that in this scheme , back - end server selection is performed by the client -- it selects a host from the multiplicity of DNS A - records it receives .
These records are cached in many places along the path from the garage 's DNS server to the client application .
Unlike the situation with HTTP redirectors and L4/L7 load balancers , the entity making the load balancing decision does not have a fresh view of the servers that are available .
This has a negative effect on scale - up time .
While the new DNS record can be published immediately , many clients will still continue using the cached record until after the DNS TTL expires .
Fortunately , the nature of a flash crowd means that most of the traffic is new .
New users are more likely to have cold caches and thus see the new servers .
Scale - down time for DNS load balancing is even more problematic .
As the disheartening study by Pang et al. showed [ 28 ] , nearly half of clients inappropriately cache DNS entries far beyond their TTL , sometimes for as long as a day .
Anecdotally , we have seen this effect in our deployments -- servers continue to receive a smattering of requests for several days after they 're removed from DNS .
Therefore , to ensure no clients see failed servers , we must wait not just for the worst - case session time , but also the worst case DNS cache time .
5 Effects of Front - End Failure
Many distributed systems are vulnerable to major disruption if the nodes responsible for load balancing fail .
We call the first - encountered node in the load balancing system the ``front end . ''
What happens when front - end nodes fail ?
The SDN , being a large - scale and well - capitalized resource , typically has multiple , redundant , hot - spare load balancers as its front end .
Failure is unlikely .
L4 and L7 load balancers are highly susceptible to failure ; they forward every packet of every session .
If a single node provides load - balancing and fails , the system experiences total failure -- all new and existing sessions stop .
If there are load balancers , the effect of a failure depends on how the front - ends are , themselves , load balanced .
If they are fully redundant hot spares ( common with expensive dedicated hardware ) , there will be no effect .
Companies like FlexiScale do offer this service , at utility pricing , as we mentioned in Section 2.2.4 .
More commonly , redundant L4/L7 front - ends are DNS load - balanced .
In this case , th of sessions experience up to a three minute delay ( see our experiment in Section 4.3 ) until they fail over to another front - end .
is often large because is often small ; is small because front - end redundancy is typically used for failure resilience , not scaling .
HTTP
Redirectors fail in almost exactly the same way as L4/ L7 load balancers , with one exception : existing sessions are not affected .
The redirector is no longer in the critical path after a session begins .
New sessions have the same failure characteristics as in the L4/ L7 balancer case .
DNS load balancing is also highly susceptible to failure if there is only one authoritative nameserver .
Nameserver caches will be useful only in rare cases because the TTLs must be kept low ( so as to handle scale - up , scale - down , and back - end node failures ) .
Few new sessions are likely to succeed .
Existing TCP streams will continue to work , however , since DNS is no longer involved after session setup .
This gloomy - sounding scenario for DNS can , however , be easily overcome .
As we mentioned in Section 2.1.4 , DNS replication services are plentiful and cheap .
Widespread replication of DNS is easy to achieve , even on a garage budget .
Furthermore , as we demonstrated in one of our microbenchmarks ( Section 4.2 ) , most DNS clients recover from DNS server failures extremely quickly -- in our experiment , 100 % of DNS clients tested failed over to a secondary DNS server within 2.5 seconds .
This means that a front - end failure has virtually no observable effect .
This scenario is the most compelling argument for DNS load balancing :
At very low cost , there is no single point of complete failure .
6 Effects of Back - End Failure
We next consider how the load - balancing scheme affects the nature of user - visible disruptions to the service when a back - end node fails .
Recall that by ``back - end '' node , we mean a member of the - sized pool of machines that can accept connections from clients .
( Distinguish this from the ``front end '' of the load balancing scheme , which is the load balancer itself . )
The SDN is managed entirely by the service provider , so its back - end failures are not a concern to the garage innovator .
The architecture of S3 is said to be highly redundant at every layer .
Our experience is that occasional writes do fail ( perhaps 1 % of the time ) but nearly always work on the first retry .
HTTP redirector and L4/L7 load balancers offer the best performance for garage - written services in the case of back - end node failure .
Newly arriving sessions see no degradation at all : the redirector or load balancer knows within moments that a back - end node has failed , and immediately stops routing new requests to it .
Existing sessions see only transient failures .
Users of an HTTP - redirected service who are stuck on a dead node might need to intervene manually ( that is , go back to the dispatching URL , such as mail.live.com ) .
Load - balanced services potentially see only a transient failure .
If the client tries to re-establish the failed TCP connection to what it thinks is the same host , it will be transparently forwarded to an operational server .
DNS load balancing suffers the worst performance in the case of back - end failure .
Unlike load balancers and HTTP redirectors , which stop requests to a failed server immediately , DNS load balancing can continue to feed requests to a failed server for more than a day , as we saw in the previous section .
If servers are deployed , th of sessions will be unlucky enough to pick the failed server .
Unfortunately , when this happens , our experiments have shown that some combinations of client and proxy take up to three minutes to give up and try a different IP address ; see Section 4.3 .
4 Experimental Micro-Benchmarks
In this section , we flesh out the details of some of the more complex experiments we performed in support of our analysis in the previous section .
To better understand HTTP redirection performance limits , we built and evaluated the performance of a load - balancing HTTP redirector .
It monitors the load on each running service instance , automatically allocates and deallocates EC2 nodes in response to load , and routes new sessions probabilistically to lightly loaded servers .
Servers send periodic heartbeats with load statistics to the redirector .
The redirector uses both the presence of these heartbeats and the load information they carry to evaluate the liveness of each server .
Its redirections are probabilistic : the redirector is twice as likely to send a new session to one server whose run queue is half as long as another's .
When the total CPU capacity available on servers with short run queues is less than 50 % , the redirector launches a new server ; when the total CPU capacity is more than 150 % , the redirector terminates a server whose sessions are most stale .
The servers in the experiment run our Inkblot web service ( see Section 5.2.2 ) .
The client load is presented from a separate machine .
Each client simulates a user session with a state machine :
It logs into the service , accesses random features for a random duration , and then logs out .
Each such client session first accesses the service by the redirector 's URL .
Each session is recorded as having completed successfully or having been interrupted by a failure such as an HTTP timeout .
Figure : HTTP redirect experiment ( 4.1 ) .
As client load spikes , the redirector launches new servers and directs new sessions to them .
The top line in Figure 1a shows how we varied the number of simulated clients as the experiment evolved , and the dotted line shows the number of servers allocated by the redirector to handle the demand .
Figure 1 b shows the 5th , 50th , and 95th percentiles of client latency ; the server run queues ( not shown ) track these curves closely as Little 's result predicts [ 20 ] .
Our simplistic redirector allocates one server at a time , bounding its response rate to a slope of one server every 90 - 120 seconds .
Around 2000 seconds , the load grows quite rapidly , and client response time suffers badly , with many sessions aborting ( bottom curve in Figure 1a ) .
During these experiments , the redirector consumed around 2 % of its CPU when serving 150 clients .
Therefore , for this application 's ratio of client session arrival rate to per-session server resource requirements , we expect to be able to serve some 7500 client sessions with one redirector node .
The measured ratio is also affected by our choice of client workload simulation parameters .
In an application where sessions are long and require only a single redirection during initialization , the overhead of the redirector will shrink further .
The important observation is that the redirector is simple , cheap , and applies to many web - based applications .
2 DNS server failover behavior
To determine the delay associated with a DNS nameserver failing , we configured a DNS subdomain with two NS records , one legitimate and the other pointing at an IP address with no operating DNS server .
As a control , we repeated the same experiment with a fresh subdomain containing only the NS record for the functioning server .
In each case , we sent recursive queries to 26 geographically - distributed public DNS servers at seven ISPs .
Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution of response times .
The worst - case response time was less than 2.5s , and of course this cost is incurred only on a DNS cache miss .
Figure : DNS servers fail over very quickly when an upstream server fails ( 4.2 ) .
3 Web client DNS failover behavior
Often , the browser is lucky and tries the operational IP address first .
When it does n't , the user experiences delays from 3 to n seconds , as shown in Table 2 .
The delay appears to be coupled to the OS resolver library rather than the browser .
We repeated the experiments with the browser behind a Squid 2.6.16 proxy running on Linux 2.6.17 , where the delay seemed to be defined by the proxy .
Table 2 : DNS timeout test for web sites that have multiple A records .
The table reports timeouts observed with various browser and OS combinations before the client attempts to use a second IP address if no reply is received from the first .
OS Browser no -proxy delay ( s ) proxied delay ( s ) Windows XP Firefox 2.0.0.6 21 9-18 Windows XP IE 6.0 21 9 -12 Linux 2.6.17 Firefox 2.0.0.3 3 9 Linux 2.6.17 Epiphany 2.16 3 not measured MacOS X 10.4.10 Firefox 2.0.0.11 15-75 9-17 MacOS
X 10.4.10 Safari 2.0.4 12-75 9-18
The initial experiment used fresh names and IP addresses to ensure the client DNS resolvers always had cold cache behavior :
If resolvers cache knowledge of failure , then the experiment would show no delay .
Surprisingly , in some configurations ( both the unproxied browsers on Linux and any browser using a Linux Squid cache ) the resolver behaved worse with a warm cache than with a cold one .
Queries that were slow in the first run showed no change .
However , on queries that were fast in the first run exhibited delays of 20 -190s .
We are unsure why these configurations exhibit different timeout behavior for a cold request than for a warm one .
To summarize : Depending on operating system and proxy cache configuration , using DNS to failover from a non-responsive server causes clients experience delays from 3 to 190 seconds .
4 Badly - behaved resolvers defeat load balancing
This same experiment also revealed that in every configuration except the two browsers running uncached on Windows XP , the browser ( or proxy ) always tried the lower - numbered IP address before the higher - numbered one , regardless of the order they were returned by the DNS server .
This behavior has important implications for using DNS as a load - balancing mechanism .
A conventional DNS server always returns the same complete list of machines .
With this approach , many machines will flock to the lowest - numbered IP address in the list .
Ignoring proxies , the 8 % of the desktop market running MacOS X will cause significant problems once the clients present 12 server 's worth ( that is , 1/0.08 ) of load .
Alternately , a custom DNS server might return only a single IP address to each query , exchanging fault tolerance for load balancing .
A further refinement returns servers of the available .
This provides fault - tolerance against failures , but ensures that even the badly - behaved resolvers spread themselves across the first machines .
5 The maximum size of DNS replies
The scalability of DNS load balancing is potentially limited by the number of ``A '' ( Address ) records that can be put into a single DNS reply .
The DNS RFC only guarantees transmission of a 512 - byte reply when in UDP mode [ 23 ] [ 2.3.4 ] , and some past work has reported that DNS clients do not always fall back to using TCP to retrieve larger responses [ 16 ] .
At 16 bytes per A - record , and counting other overhead , a 512 byte DNS reply would limit us to about 25 back - end servers -- potentially a bottleneck .
To test this limit in practice , we populated a single name with over 2200 A records , and then probed it via 26 public DNS servers in seven ISPs .
Every server correctly returned the entire list , indicating its client had used TCP DNS transfers to fetch the complete reply from our nameserver .
We have not explored whether some clients ( e.g. , web browsers ) will fail to fetch large replies .
This result suggests that DNS implementations pose no limit to the number of back - end servers served by a DNS load balancing solution ; indeed , other limits of DNS behavior obviate including the entire server list in DNS replies ( Section 4.4 ) .
6 Client affinity observations
One of our real services ( Section 5.1.2 ) is equipped to tolerate client non-affinity , even though we expected affinity to be the common case .
We instrumented the service to measure client affinity , and sampled for a period of two months in a 2 - server configuration .
About 5 % of the requests received by our web service arrive at the ``wrong '' server .
From this , we infer that 10 % of clients exhibited no affinity , and half of the requests such clients generate arrived at the ``right '' server by chance .
5 Application Design and Flash Crowd Experiences
In this section , we report three case studies demonstrating the design , implementation , and flash - crowd response of ``garage - scalable ' ' web services .
Over the past year , our research group created three web sites that experienced sudden surges in popularity , including one that was ( literally ) Slashdotted .
For each web site , we describe our design and implementation decisions , report how they responded to a flash crowd , and extract lessons learned from the experience .
The output of this tool is a set of static content ( ordinary .png , .html and .js files ) that require no special server - side support .
Serving an interactive map generated by MapCruncher requires nothing more from an HTTP server than its most basic function : reading a file off disk and returning it to a client in response to an HTTP GET .
All of the dynamic behavior of the application is implemented in the client browser .
To show off MapCruncher 's functionality , we created a gallery of sample maps : about 25 gigabytes of image data spread across several hundred thousand files .
We put this archive on reasonably powerful web server : a 2005 - vintage Dell PowerEdge 2650 with 1GB of RAM , a 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon processor , and several SCSI disks , running IIS 6.0 .
We did not anticipate performance problems since IIS is performant and the content we were serving was all static .
After MapCruncher was released , Microsoft published a press release describing it , which was picked up by various bloggers and Internet publications .
Crowds soon arrived .
Nearly all visitors viewed our map gallery , which became unusably slow .
Our server logs showed that , at peak , we were serving about 100 files per second .
( Far more images were probably requested . )
We were surprised that our web server had failed to keep up with the request stream until we realized the dataset was many times larger than the machine 's memory cache .
In addition , there was very little locality of reference .
Our sample maps were enormous , and each visitor zoomed into a different , random part of one .
The resulting image requests were almost entirely cache misses .
We could not serve files any faster than the disk could find them .
Perhaps not coincidentally , the sum of typical seek time , settling time , and rotational delay of modern disks is about 10 ms ( 100 requests per second ) .
The next day , we published our maps to Amazon S3 , and had no further performance problems .
The lesson we learned was the power of an SDN 's statistical multiplexing :
Rather than one disk seeking , the SDN spread files across huge numbers of disks , all of which can be seeking in parallel .
Rather than one buffer cache thrashing during peak load , the SDN dedicated gigabytes of buffer cache from dozens of machines to us .
S3 's utility - computing cost model was as compelling to us as to a garage innovator .
During a normal month , we pay virtually nothing ; the nominal cost of storing our 25 GB gallery is under $ 4 / month .
In the case of a flash crowd , we pay a one - time bandwidth charge of about $ 200 .
Statistical multiplexing makes it economically viable for Amazon to charge only for capacity used .
This is much more efficient than the traditional model of paying for a fixed reserve that remains idle before the flash crowd , and yet may still be insufficiently provisioned when a crowd finally arrives .
In April of 2007 , our research group designed a web service called Asirra , a CAPTCHA that authenticates users by asking them to identify photographs as being either cats or dogs [ 9 ] .
Our database has over 4 million images and grows by about 10,000 every day .
Each image classified as cat or dog manually by a human , thanks to our partnership with Petfinder.com , the world 's largest web site devoted to finding homes for homeless animals .
Petfinder provides the Asirra project ongoing access to their database as a way to increase the number of adoptable pets seen by potential new owners .
Asirra 's metadata must remain secret to maintain the security of the CAPTCHA .
Consequently , Asirra is implemented as a web service rather than a distributable code library .
It has a simple API that allows webmasters to integrate our CAPTCHA into their own web pages .
Webmasters include Asirra 's JavaScript in their HTML forms , where it first creates the visual elements of the challenge in the user 's browser .
It then sends AJAX requests to our web service to create a new Asirra session , retrieve one or more challenges , and submit user responses for scoring .
If the response is correct , the client earns a ``service ticket '' ( an unguessable string ) and presents it to the webmaster in a special field of the HTML form .
Because the client is not trusted , the webmaster 's back - end then verifies that the ticket presented is valid by checking it with a different interface of Asirra 's web service .
The web service is implemented in Python and currently deployed on two virtual machines at Amazon EC2 .
There were several issues we considered in deciding how to enable Asirra to scale .
The first was how to scalably store and serve the images themselves .
The CAPTCHA 's growing collection of 4 million JPEG images consumes about 100GB .
Based on our experience with MapCruncher , using Amazon 's S3 was an easy choice .
The second consideration was how to enable scalable access to all the metadata by every service instance .
The master copy of the metadata is stored in a SQL Server database at our offices at Microsoft .
However , as we discussed in Section 2.1.5 , it is difficult to make a fully relational database arbitrarily scalable .
We solved this in Asirra by observing that the web service treats the image metadata as read - only .
( The only database writes occur off - line , when a nightly process runs to import new images into the database . )
In addition , the web service does not need complex SELECT statements ; when a CAPTCHA request arrives , Asirra simply picks 12 image records at random .
We therefore decided to keep our fully relational ( and relatively slow ) SQL Server database in - house .
Every time our off - line database update process runs , it also produces a reduced BerkeleyDB [ 27 ] database , keyed only by record number , that contains the relevant information about each image .
( BerkeleyDB is essentially an efficient B - tree implementation of a simple key - value store . )
The BerkeleyDB file is then pushed out to each running web service instance , which does local database queries when it needs to generate a CAPTCHA .
The third and most interesting design question was how to maintain session state .
In between the time a user requests a CAPTCHA and the time the CAPTCHA is scored , Asirra must keep state in order to recognize if the answer was correct , and do other accounting .
One possibility was to keep each session 's state in its own S3 object , but we found that S3's write performance was somewhat slow ; requests could take up to several seconds to complete .
We next considered storing session state locally - - on individual servers ' disks .
This led to an interesting question : how does session state storage interact with load balancing ?
Client load is distributed across Asirra 's server farm using the DNS load balancing technique described in Section 2.2.2 .
The first action performed by a client is session creation .
Whichever machine is randomly selected by the client to execute this action becomes the permanent custodian of that session 's state .
The custodian stores the session state locally and returns a session ID to the client .
The session ID has the custodian server 's ID embedded in it .
As we discussed in Section 4.6 , one of the disadvantages of DNS load balancing is that clients are not guaranteed to have affinity for back - end servers .
Any session operation after the first one may arrive at a server other than the session 's custodian .
We address this by forwarding requests from their arrival server to the custodian server , if the two servers are different .
That is , the arrival server finds the custodian server 's ID embedded in the session ID , reissues the request it received to the custodian , and forwards the response back to the client .
The client is not trusted ; a forged session ID will simply fail to find any expected state on the incorrectly indicated custodian server .
( As further protection , Asirra only forwards requests to servers that appear in a list of valid custodians . )
Our forwarding scheme ensures that at most two machines are ever involved in servicing a single request : the machine which receives the request from the client , and the machine that owns the session state and receives the sub-request .
Asirra service is therefore readily scalable ; the overhead of parallelization will never be more than 2x regardless of the total size of the farm .
In practice , we have observed lower overhead for two reasons .
First , compared to satisfying a request , forwarding one takes very little time and requires no disk seeks .
Even if every request required forwarding , the total overhead might not be more than 1.1x .
Second , we have found that request forwarding is not the common case ; as we described in Section 4.6 , the rate of client affinity ``failures '' is about 10 % .
Shortly after its release , Asirra was shown publicly at an annual Microsoft Research technology showcase called TechFest .
It received significant coverage in the popular press which resulted in a load surge lasting about 24 hours .
During this time we served about 75,000 real challenges , plus about 30,000 requests that were part of a denial - of - service attack .
Over the next few months , we saw a gradual increase in the traffic rate as sites began to use the CAPTCHA .
We learned several interesting lessons from this deployment .
The first , as discussed in the previous section , was that poor client - to - server affinity was not as much of a problem for DNS - load - balanced services as we had initially feared .
Second , there were some pitfalls in using EC2 as a utility for providing web services .
Most problematic is that when EC2 nodes failed , as happens from time to time , they also gave up their IP address reservations .
( This weakness of EC2's service was later corrected , in April 2008 . )
This is a problem when using DNS load balancing .
As we saw in Section 3.4 , a failed node can produce user - visible service degradation until all DNS caches -- even the badly behaved ones -- are updated .
Also , recall that local storage on EC2 nodes is fast , but not durable .
Though data can be cached locally , it is vital to keep anything valuable ( e.g. , durable user data , log files , etc. ) backed up elsewhere .
The denial - of - service attack provided what was , perhaps , the most interesting lesson .
In the short term , before a filtering strategy could be devised , the easiest defense was simply to start more servers .
The solution required no development time beyond the scalability work we 'd already done , and only cost us a few extra dollars for the duration of the denial - of - service attack .
Before we had a chance to implement a denial - of - service filter , the attacker became bored ( and , perhaps , frustrated that his attack was no longer working ) and stopped his attack .
We never actually got around to implementing a denial - of - service filter - - a fascinating success of ``lazy development . ''
( The Perl community has been preaching laziness as a virtue for years ! )
As we will see shortly , this lesson had a surprising influence on the design of our next service .
In November 2007 , our research group deployed InkblotPassword.com [ 34 ] , a website that helps users generate and remember high - entropy passwords , using Rorschach - like images as a memory cue .
The site lets users create accounts and associate passwords with inkblot images .
Our site is an OpenID [ 30 ] authentication provider ; users can use their inkblot passwords to log in to any web site that accepts OpenID credentials .
Note that Inkblot must store dynamically generated information ( the user accounts ) durably .
This requirement sets it apart from our previous two applications , which had static ( pre-computed ) databases and ephemeral state .
Like Asirra , we implemented Inkblot in Python .
However , unlike Asirra , we spent virtually no time optimizing its performance .
The denial - of - service attack we suffered taught us a valuable lesson :
Now that it 's so cheap and easy to run lots of servers for a day or two , there is no need to spend time on problems that can be solved that way .
We reasoned that if our goal was simply to handle a single unexpected flash crowd , the best strategy was to forgo careful code optimization and simply plan to start plenty of extra servers for the duration of the load spike .
If ongoing popularity and high nominal load followed , careful code optimization would then be economical .
Another difference between Asirra and Inkblot was our decision to store both the persistent user database and the ephemeral session state in S3 ; nothing was stored on the local disk .
We chose S3 for the user database , despite its slowness we observed in Asirra , because of the requirement for database persistence .
Fortunately , the particular write requirements of our application permit write - behind without exposing security - sensitive race conditions , hiding most of the write delay from users .
We stored ephemeral session state in S3 entirely because of our new laziness philosophy : although less efficient than using the local disk , reusing the user - state storage code led to faster development .
Like Asirra , Inkblot was implemented and tested to run on multiple servers .
We deployed it with two servers , to ensure that we were exercising cross-server interaction as the common case .
DNS A - records provided load balancing among the servers .
Updating our institutional DNS service required interacting with a human operator , so no automatic scaling was in place .
Days after its release , Network World penned an article covering Inkblot [ 12 ] .
That coverage was propagated to other tech magazines and blogs .
We had the very good fortune to be in a boring meeting the next day , when one of us happened upon the article about Inkblot moments after it appeared on the front page of Slashdot .
We tried clicking through the link , and found our service unresponsive .
Unfortunately , this happened before we implemented the code described in Section 4.1 that automatically expands the farm in response to load .
The one responsive server reported a run queue length of 137 ; in a healthy system , it should be below 1 .
Within minutes , we spun up a dozen new servers .
We submitted a high - priority DNS change request to our institutional DNS provider which was fulfilled within half an hour .
The new servers saw load almost immediately after the DNS update , and the original servers recovered in another 20 minutes .
( The DNS TTL was one hour at the time of the Slashdotting . )
For several hours , all 14 servers ' one - minute - averaged run queue lengths hovered between 0.5 and 0.9 .
The site remained responsive .
By the end of the day , the Inkblot service had successfully registered about 10,000 new users .
We kept the extra servers up for two days ( just in case of an ``aftershock ' ' such as Digg or Reddit coverage ) .
We then removed 10 out of the 14 entries from the DNS , waited an extra day for rogue DNS caches to empty , and shut the 10 servers down .
The marginal cost of handling this Slashdotting was less than $ 150 .
We were fortunate to survive the flash crowd so well , considering that our load - detection algorithm was ``good luck . ''
Indeed , this experience prompted us to carefully examine the alternatives for filling in the missing piece in that implementation ; that examination led to the analysis and experiments that comprise this paper .
6 Conclusions
This paper surveys the contemporary state of utility computing as it applies to the low - capital garage innovator .
It describes existing , utility - priced services .
Our analysis characterizes four approaches to balancing load among back - end servers .
We exhibit six experiments that highlight benefits and limitations of each approach .
We report on our experiences deploying three innovations in garage style , and how those various deployments strategies fared the flash crowds that followed .
We conclude that all four load balancing strategies are available to the garage innovator using utility resources , and that no single strategy dominates .
Rather , the choice of strategy depends on the specific application and its load and fault - tolerance requirements .

Design and evaluation of a continuous consistency model for replicated services .
In International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems ( ICDCS ) ( Apr. 2001 ) .
The Mormon Church has to be among the most outgoing on Earth ; in recent years its leaders have reached out to , among others , Latinos , Koreans , Catholics and Jews .
One of the most enthusiastic responses , however , has come from what some might consider a surprising source : U.S. Muslims .
“ We are very aware of the history of Mormons as a group that was chastised in America , ” says Maher Hathout , a senior advisor to the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles .
“ They can be a good model for any group that feels alienated . ”
Which perhaps explains an open - mosque day held last fall at the Islamic Center of Irvine .
More than half the guests were Mormons .

“ A Mormon living in an Islamic society would be very comfortable , ” said Steve Young , a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints attending the event .
The sentiment is echoed by Muslims .
“ When I go to a Mormon church I feel at ease , ” said Haitham Bundakji , former chairman of the Islamic Society of Orange County .
“ When I heard the president [ of LDS ] speak a few years ago , if I ’d closed my eyes I ’d have thought he was an imam . ”
Though the relationship has raised eyebrows and provided ammunition for critics of both religions , Mormons and Muslims have deepening ties in the United States .
What binds them has little to do with theology : Mormons venerate Jesus as interpreted by founder Joseph Smith , while Muslims view Muhammad as God ’s prophet .
Based on shared values and a sense of isolation from mainstream America , the connection was intensified by 9/11 and cemented by the Southeast Asia tsunami .
It is especially evident in Southern California , with large Mormon and Muslim populations .

The Mormon Church has become the biggest contributor to Buena Park - based Islamic Relief , touted by its administrators as the West ’s largest Muslim - based charity .
Relief officials say the church has donated $ 20 million in goods and services since the 2004 tsunami , equal to about 20 % of the charity ’s annual budget .
Brigham Young University in Utah , the church ’s major institution of higher learning , features what is thought to be one of the world ’s best programs for translating classic Islamic works from Arabic to English .
Though created primarily for academic purposes , the results have impressed Muslims flattered by the close attention .
“ It shows they have a keen interest in the Muslim world , ” said Levent Akbarut , a member of the Islamic Congregation of La Canada Flintridge .
And Mormons and Muslims say they often are co-hosts of educational and social programs at which , though some may be angling for long - term doctrinal influence , very little open proselytizing of each other seems to take place .
“ We have a very close and friendly relationship , ” said Keith Atkinson , West Coast LDS spokesman .

Mormons “ explain our faith to anyone who will listen ” and “ treat Muslims like anybody else , ” said Elder Dallin H. Oaks , a member of the Quorum of the 12 Apostles , one of the church ’s top governing bodies in Salt Lake City .
But Oaks added that “ we do n’t preach to people who would be disenfranchised ” or likely offended .
Arnold H. Green , a history professor at BYU , has traced how early Mormons in the 19th century were hounded by accusations that church founder Smith was the American Muhammad .
The first Mormons angrily denied any connection to the Muslim prophet but gradually accepted some comparisons , particularly that both religions were founded by post - Christian prophets with strong sectarian views .
“ As the church grew into a global faith , ” Green wrote in a 2001 essay , “ its posture toward Islam became . . . more positive ” until , today , “ the two faiths have become associated in several ways , including Mormonism ’s being called the Islam of America . ”
Both religions strongly emphasize family .
They tend toward patriarchy , believing in feminine modesty , chastity and virtue .
And although Islam discourages dancing involving both sexes , Mormons report that church - sponsored “ modesty proms ” commonly draw Islamic youths .
Both faiths adhere to religion - based health codes , including prohibitions against alcohol , but Mormons and Muslims share something more : membership in quickly growing minority religions that many other Americans have sometimes viewed with suspicion and scorn .

“ We both come from traditions where there has been persecution in the past and continues to be prejudice , ” said Steve Gilliland , LDS director of Muslim relations for Southern California .
“ That helps us Mormons identify with Muslims . ”
A recent national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press and the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life found that although a thin majority of those polled expressed positive opinions of Muslims and Mormons , the number was significantly less than those favoring Roman Catholics or Jews .
More than half the respondents said they had little or no awareness of the precepts and practices of either faith .
But 45 % saw Islam as more likely than other religions to encourage violence , and 31 % said that Mormons were n’t Christian .
Armand L. Mauss , a Mormon and professor emeritus of sociology at Washington State University specializing in religious movements , said that unlike mainstream Christians and Jews , Muslims and Mormons “ tend to make fairly stringent demands for religious conformity on their members . ”
These practices , he said , include discouraging marriage outside the religion and observing dietary laws , such as the Mormon prohibition against tobacco , alcohol and caffeine .

But the clincher , according to Mauss , is that both communities “ have been stung in recent years by the recurrence of scandals over which they have no control . ”
For Muslims , the obvious example is 9/11 .
For Mormons , Mauss says , the problem is polygamy , which , though rejected by the mainstream church more than a century ago , is still the first thing that occurs to many Americans when they think about the religion .
The relationship between the two religions has sometimes drawn ire .
Scattered throughout the Internet are numerous tracts , many by evangelical Christians , comparing the two religions in less - than - complimentary terms .
“ Modern Mohammedanism has its Mecca in Salt Lake , ” reads one .
“ Clearly the Koran was Joseph Smith ’s model , so closely followed as to exclude even the poor pretension of originality in his foul ‘ revelations . ’ ”

In Southern California , the relationship between the two religions became closer after the Los Angeles riots in 1992 , when the Mormon Church , hoping to promote diversity , invited several ethnic and religious groups to attend the opening of its new temple in San Diego .
Muslims responded in higher numbers and with greater enthusiasm than most others .
The church later feted prominent Muslims in Salt Lake City .
“ We were treated as dignitaries , ” said Shabbir Mansuri , founding director of the Muslim - based Institute on Religion and Civic Values in Fountain Valley , which encourages tolerance through research and education .
“ I met with the president of LDS and the governor of Utah .
We were sitting in the front row of the Tabernacle .
Mormons would give their right arms to be there . ”
The relationship deepened on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The first call Mansuri received that day came from Elder Oaks .
“ He was concerned and wanted to send us a very clear message that we were in their prayers , ” Mansuri recalls .
“ It was like having someone who loves and cares for you ; not so much a Mormon reaching out to me as a fellow believer reaching out . ”
Oaks said he was primarily motivated by friendship .
“ I consider Shabbir Mansuri a brother , ” he said .
“ He ’s a good man who ’s doing good work .
We try to be friendly to all people , and in the days after 9/11 , lots of Muslims felt rejected . ”

In the months that followed , Mormons nationwide opened their churches to Islamic worshipers fearful of reprisals in their mosques .
When Muslims needed a cannery to process the Bosnia - bound beef slaughtered for the annual Eid al - Adha observance , the Mormons offered theirs in Utah .
Following the tsunami that devastated many Islamic communities , the Mormon church , which has a history of contributing to a wide range of charities , began working closely with Islamic Relief .
Though LDS had helped Muslims before -- providing 195 tons of powdered milk , hygiene kits , medical supplies and other provisions -- it had never previously worked with this major Islamic agency , or on such a scale .
And though the church continues to aid non-Muslim causes , only two of the six major disaster assistance efforts listed on its website since 2004 -- Hurricane Katrina and Africa measles vaccination campaigns -- did not primarily affect Islamic nations .
Locally , LDS helped the Islamic Society of Orange County ’s Al - Rahman Mosque in Garden Grove develop its library with a $ 15,000 donation .
“ Their beliefs are similar to ours , ” Robert Bremmer , a Mormon bishop , said at that facility ’s open - mosque day in 2005 .
“ They have modest dress , and so do we .
They believe in all the [ Old Testament ] prophets , as do we . ”

During Al - Rahman ’s most recent open house in August , attended by many Mormon elders and dignitaries , a tribute was paid to a deceased LDS official supportive of the mosque .
The effects of Muslim - Mormon interaction are showing in subtle ways too .
Spending time with Mormons , Bundakji says , has inspired him to stop drinking coffee .
“ I thought they had a good idea , ” he says .
“ Now I do n’t drink caffeine and I do n’t have headaches anymore . ”

ACL 2008で既に読めるようになった論文で面白かったやつ
" Learning Bilingual Lexicons from Monolingual Corpora " A. Haghighi , et. al. to appear ACL2008 pdf
タイトルは衝撃的な内容だが、内容も面白い。
従来統計的機械翻訳では、翻訳ペア、フレーズ抽出は対訳コーパス、つまりロゼッタストーンのように同じ内容が複数言語で書かれているようなデータを元にし学習するのが一般的だったが、この方法の欠点はもちろんそのような対訳コーパスが無い言語間ではこの手法が使えないということだった。顕著なのは日本語で、他の主要言語間は国連の公用語なら国連の議事録、EU加盟国ならEUの議事録とかから大量で高精度のコーパスが（しかも安価で)手に入るのだが日本語はそのようなペアがない。これも日本語の統計的機械翻訳の精度がいまいちな理由の一つ。
で、この手法はそのような対訳コーパスの存在を前提にせず、単一言語からなるコーパスが複数言語で与えられていれば（例えば、日本語wikipedia , 英語wikipedia、中国語wikipedia）、それらから自動的に対訳語を抽出する。
問題の定式化としては二部グラフのマッチング問題になり、日本語、英語の対訳後抽出を例として挙げると、日本語の各単語がノードでずらずらと並んでいて、英語の各単語がノードで並んでいて、対訳語抽出はこの二部グラフのマッチングした結果となる（例えば、 ” 犬 ” と” dog ” の間に枝が張られていることが期待される）。
で、そのマッチングの生成モデルは最初にマッチングが全て一様に生成される。このマッチングでは同じ頂点には二つ以上の枝がない、さらに枝が無い頂点があるという仮定をおいている
次にマッチングがあった単語対s_i , t_j ( s_iは日本語側の単語、t_jは英語側の単語）は次のように生成される。
最初に隠れ変数z_{i , j} をd次元の平均0 , 分散Iの正規分布に従って生成
次にs_iの素性ベクトルをz_{i,j}をW_sで線形変換したものを平均、ψ_sを共分散行列とする正規分布で生成
f( s_i ) = N( W_s z_{i , j} , ψ_s )
同様にt_jの素性ベクトルも生成
f( e_i ) = N( W_e z_{i , j} , ψ_e )
マッチに含まれない単語に関しては独立に生成される。
f( s_i ) = N( 0 , σ ^2 I_S )
f( t_j ) = N ( 0 , σ ^2 I_T )
もし単語ペアであれば独立に生成されるのではなく隠れ変数を通じて同時に生成され、逆にペアがなければ、独立に生成されマッチングには含まれない（ようにモデル化している）
単語の素性ベクトルf ( s_i ) は字種feature、3文字以下の全ての部分文字列、と、コンテキストfeature ; 周辺にどのような単語が出ているかを利用する。
で訓練データの素性集合の生成確率を最大にするようなパラメータ（Ws ,
Wt , ψs , ψt ) を求める（最尤推定）
これはcanonical correlation analysis ( CCA ) pdfといわれるものらしい（このへんから追いつけない）。これは翻訳のEMみたく行なわれて、現在のパラメータでの最大のマッチングを求め、またそこからパラメータを求め直すというのを繰り返す
直感的には、隠れ次元が小さく制限されているので、生成されている素性ベクトルをうまく生成するためには、隠れ変数をできるだけ共有するようにWs , Wtは調整されるということかな。（これがCCAらしい）
これで正解辞書と比べてみたら、90%の精度、30%の再現率ぐらい出るそうだ。すごい。（精度は抽出された中で実際にあっていた割合、再現率は辞書中抽出された割合）。こういうデータいくらでもとれる場合は、データはいくらでも増やせるので再現率はあまり重要ではない。
でやはり日本語が試されてなかったから、是非試してほしかったなぁ・・試すか
It appears techno - wastrel HP has been shamed not a jot by our previous report on its profligate packing practices - another sorry tale of conspicuous cardboard consumption has reached El Reg today .
" I wanted to share the attached picture of a package we received a while ago from HP , " says Reg reader Mike Cresswell .
" As you can see , it had been shipped on a wooden pallet , no doubt to support the immense weight involved .
We tore back the black plastic so that the awesome size of the package on the pallet could be seen .
" When we finally finished taking pictures and falling around laughing we found the package contained one vanilla flavour PS2 mouse .
We could only think that it was a much fatter mouse when it was shipped but had lost a lot of weight due to the amount of time it took to arrive . "
Can you top that ?
Send us your preposterous packaging pics .
The most spectacular example of flagrant cardboard - overload wins 5000 rolls of packing tape . ®

Hundreds of baby penguins swept from the icy shores of Antarctica and Patagonia are washing up dead on Rio de Janeiro ’s tropical beaches , rescuers and penguin experts said Friday .
More than 400 penguins , most of them young , have been found dead on the beaches of Rio de Janeiro state in the last two months , said Eduardo Pimenta , superintendent of the state coastal protection and environment agency in the resort city of Cabo Frio .
While it is common here to find some penguins -- dead and alive -- swept by strong ocean currents from the Strait of Magellan , Pimenta said there have been more this year than at any time in recent memory .
Scientists are uncertain of the cause .
If you ’re hoping to see beefier - looking models at Fashion Week next month , you can forget about it : According to an article in The Wall Street Journal , it sounds like that ’s not going to happen .
Hard to believe , we know .
Today ’s version of the story involves aspiring model Tatiana Stewart .
Stewart moved here a year ago to become a ballet dancer but modeling beckoned ; she was scouted and accepted a gig modeling clothes and helping customers at Abercrombie & Fitch .
Ford , Click , and Elite agents came calling , but the six - foot - two 18 - year - old ca n’t catch a break — even America ’s Next Top Model casting agents were interested but changed their minds .
So what ’s the problem ?
You guessed it : Tatiana is — wait for it — a size 4 .
Modeling scouts advise her to slim down to a “ loose size 2 , ” which would require losing ten to fourteen pounds .
Here ’s her account of her America ’s Next Top Model casting call :
“ They lined us up against the wall and asked our name , age , measurements , height and weight , ” she says .
“ Then they told us to lift our shirts up just below the — the chest — and they filmed us to see our body type …
That ’s when I was cut . ”
She says she was n’t given an explanation .
CW Network , which airs the show , says it does n’t have weight guidelines for the show but could n’t comment on the specifics of her rejection .
Innnteresting .
So what is she doing instead of modeling ?
Just like the casting agents , those savory characters known as nightclub promoters flocked to her , too , asking her to bring her pretty to their parties .
Like any naïve 18 - year - old , she accepted .
And now she ’s taken on jobs as a bottle girl at nightclubs , where undoubtedly very respectful and respectable patrons will collectively tip her around $ 600 to $ 1,500 a night .
Seeing as she ’s not even legally allowed to hang out in those places , her mother is pretty concerned about these new gigs .
We are too .
Slim Chance : An Aspiring Model ’s Challenge [ WSJ ]
The White House ’s reaction to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s embrace of Sen. Barack Obama ’s 16 - month withdrawal timetable is the like the five stages of grief .
When a guy you more or less install in power and keep there on a very short leash starts going off the reservation , you first claim there was some sort of translation error .
Then you claim that what he says is not what he means .
When he continues to reiterate the point , you assert that he knows not of what he speaks .
And when he becomes adamant on the point , you do what White House press secretary Dana Perino tried to do today , just pretend that nothing Maliki has said trumps the earlier joint statement issued by the U.S. and Iraqi governments last week : “ It is no small thing for two leaders to issue a statement ; it is one that was taken with care and with seriousness . ”
Fun times in the White House briefing room :
In a bid to wed the comprehensive , grassroots information factory of Wikipedia with the authority of the traditional encyclopedia , Encyclopaedia Britannica is opening the floodgates for online user submissions into its 240 - year - old publication – a move it long resisted and sniffed was akin to intellectual pollution .
What Britannica wants to do , on the other hand , is create " a welcoming community for scholars , experts , and lay contributors , " it said in an announcement last week .
Once a staple of many homes , the encyclopedia has become increasingly irrelevant in the internet age .
A shelf of leather - bound books may look fabulous but , almost by definition , it becomes obsolete the moment it is published ( you can look it up ) .
Oh yeah – and they are way expensive .
While it lacks the gravitas of gold leaf and feel of fine paper , the world has turned in droves to Google 's simple search box .
And now that Wikipedia has reached a point of relative maturity , there 's even less of a reason for people to look to printed encyclopedias for information .
But scholars , journalists and researchers have been loathe to use Wikipedia for official citations .
The same open - source culture that allows it to be current has also made it subject to vandalism and patently false entries .
Britannica is going halfway to where it's never gone before : it is opening up its site to the crowd , but keeping the gates up against the barbarians as far as the official version of the publication concerned .
By editing all changes to its core base of information before they are posted online , Britannica , which has been online since 1994 , hopes to create a trusted source that takes into account the input of the crowd .
Members of the company 's community of scholars and registered users will be able to post about new topics without intervention , but the company says all articles on new topics will be fact - checked and vetted before appearing in the main edition .
Tom Panelas , director of corporate communications , explained to Wired.com that the new site will include three main categories of content : content created by the site 's existing community of experts , content created by users and Encyclopaedia Britannica itself , which will incorporate aspects of the first two once they have achieved a " Checked by Britannica " designation .
The newly redesigned site will differ from Wikipedia in other key ways , according to Britannica 's blog .
Anyone will be able to publish articles under their own name , including the scholars and experts who have traditionally provided new content to the publication .
Imagine Wikipedia mashed with Linked In
( see image above ) .
To incent experts to contribute , Encyclopaedia Britannica will offers some sort of rewards system in addition to giving them a place to " showcase and publish their various works - in - progress , "
although Panelas would not disclose details about the incentive program .
" Encyclopaedia Britannica has long been written by a community of scholars from all over the world , and this distinguished group of people has always been one of our greatest assets , " reads a note in its blog .
" Today it is possible to increase the strength and size of this community online and to provide its members with incentives to become involved with Britannica on a more sustained and consistent basis . "
The new , interactive version of Encyclopaedia Britannica is already online in beta form .
Its features are scheduled to appear on the main site in the coming weeks and months , according to the company .
As much as the world might need something like this , one can see ardent Wikipedia supporters decrying Encyclopaedia Britannica 's move , since it attempts to make private what Wikipedia makes public ( information ownership ) .
If that 's the case , Britannica editors may have their hands full wading through bogus submissions .
Here , we see the new edit mode :
And here 's what the edit history looks like :
There is no word of the Britannica news in its extensive Wikipedia entry .
But there is an expression of great respect :
The articles in the Britannica are aimed at educated adult readers , and written by a staff of
19 full - time editors and over 4,000 expert contributors .
It is widely perceived as the most scholarly of encyclopaedias .
Wikipedia does n't have its facts straight in this instance , according to Panelas .
" That 's wrong , " he told Wired.com .
" The ( correct ) figure ( for full time editors ) is about 100 . "

BAGHDAD , July 28 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military said an investigation into an incident in which American troops killed three Iraqis near Baghdad airport last month showed the victims were not criminals but innocent civilians .
In a statement released at the time of the June 25 incident , the military said troops fired at a car near the airport after coming under attack .
It called the three people inside the vehicle " criminals " , adding a weapon had been found in the car .
" A thorough investigation determined that the driver and passengers were law abiding citizens of Iraq , " the military said in a statement released late on Sunday .
No weapon was found in the vehicle , it added .
The statement also said troops involved in the incident were not at fault .
A man and two women were killed in the shooting , local officials said at the time .
The result of the investigation comes at a sensitive time for Washington , which is negotiating a new security deal with Baghdad to govern the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq when a U.N. mandate expires at the end of the year .
The investigation also follows other recent shootings involving U.S. troops that have infuriated Iraqi officials .
" This was an extremely unfortunate and tragic incident , " said Colonel Allen Batschelet , chief of staff for U.S. troops in Baghdad .
" We are taking several corrective measures to amend and eliminate the possibility of such situations happening in the future . "
The military statement on the results of the probe said a convoy travelling near Baghdad airport pulled off to the side of the road when one vehicle experienced problems on June 25 .
While the vehicle was being checked , a civilian car approached at what soldiers believed was high speed , the statement said .
" Soldiers perceived the rapidly approaching vehicle as a threat and executed established escalation of force measures .
When the vehicle failed to respond to the soldiers ' warning measures , it was engaged with small arms fire , " the statement added .
It said the initial statement of a weapon being found resulted from a misunderstanding that the Iraqi Police arriving at the scene had collected a weapon .
In late June , U.S. troops on a raid near the holy Shi'ite city of Kerbala shot dead a man that some officials said was a distant relative of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
The military at the time said that incident was under investigation and expressed " deep regret " at the loss of life .
In mid-July , U.S. forces shot dead the 17 - year - old son and another relative of the governor of northern Salahuddin province in a raid , local officials said .
The U.S. military said it shot two armed men , adding it was later found they were both related to the governor .
So the weather tricked me into staying in , but I did get to view tonight ’s pyrotechnics from a friend ’s apartment with windows facing towards the Mall .
My camera sat on a tripod , set to do a time lapse video at one - second intervals .
Here is the result , consisting of 1,271 frames taken over a course of 21 minutes :

I 've posted previously about JavaScript 2 ( also known as ECMAScript 4 ) .
Since I last discussed this topic , the debate over whether to continue with ES4 , which extended JavaScript with type annotations and classes , got significantly less cooperative , and apparently came to a head at the meeting of TC99 , the committee responsible for the future of JavaScript .
In summary , it seems that the two groups agreed to focus cooperative effort of ECMAScript 3.1 , a modest improvement of the current JavaScript that includes some new features like the ability to mark properties as non-enumerable and freezing objects ( which can be used to implement classes ) .
After that is complete , the two groups have agreed to work on a new version of JavaScript dubbed " Harmony " , which will be a more modest evolution of the current JavaScript , minus some of the more ambitious features like namespaces and packages .
Other features , like classes , will likely be implemented in terms of new features in ES3.1 like freeze ( ) .
Which brings me to the title of my post .
Now that it seems as though ES3.1 will be embraced by all the browser vendors moving forward ( and will likely be the implemented iteration of JS for at least a little while ) , I wondered what sorts of features might still make it into ES3.1 before the spec was closed .
Specifically , I 've long been interested in trying to get method_missing into JavaScript , and in fact , it is already available in Firefox / Spidermonkey as noSuchMethod .
In fact , Johnson makes use of noSuchMethod in its Ruby proxy .
Half - wishing , half - hoping , I threw the idea of codifying noSuchMethod into the discussion on the ES discussion group .
As expected , Brendan Eich replied that it was probably too late to add a feature like this into ES3.1 at this time .
But then , to my surprise , Bill Edney and Scott Shattuck , who were responsible for getting noSuchMethod into Spidermonkey , jumped into the fray urging its inclusion into ES3.1 .
And Justin Meyer , of JavaScriptMVC , posted to their blog also urging its inclusion .
Anyone who 's messed with Ruby for more than just a simple Rails app understands the power of method_missing , and getting it into ES3.1 , which would mean it would make it into future versions of Firefox , Safari , and IE , would be sweet indeed .
New System Can Predict Electricity Output From Wind
August 11th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Renewable forms of energy such as solar and wind are notorious for being unpredictable .
That may change with the advent of the Previento System , a new type of software developed at Oldenburg University in Germany .
The software , which uses weather models from multiple weather reporting services , is able to predict both the amount of energy a specific German wind park can produce as well as the total amount of energy wind parks around the country can produce .
Predictions are available up to ten days in advance , and error rates are within 5 % in 70 % of the cases in Germany .
Oldenburg ’s software will be instrumental in helping German grid operators predict how much fossil - fuel power is necessary to supplement wind energy at any given time .
Additionally , it could play a large role in energy prices , since more wind power availability means lower prices .
While the Previento System is not yet available outside of Germany , it may be soon — Spain , the United States , Canada , Scandinavia , and Ireland have all expressed interest in it .
And why would n’t they ?
If wind power becomes predictable , it also becomes a much more attractive alternative to fossil fuels .

Well , well , well .
As Donald Rumsfeld once said , “ … there are known unknowns ; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know ” and coming from one as clearly clueless as he , today ’s post is dedicated to his spirit of bewildering cluelessness .
I venture to guess that the majority of what is in this post never aired in primetime or made its way to the print media ( ok , perhaps a snippet on the bottom of page 42 way below the fold ) .
Today we delve into war crimes , nukes , lies and information the Corporate Media ( CM ) wo n’t tell you .
Let ’s start with some questions .
Has the Bush Administration really been charged with war crimes ?
Do you know what your government does in your name ?
What ’s Depleted Uranium got to do with it ?
If you answered No , Maybe , or Huh ? to any of the above questions , read on and learn what has been roundly excluded from the Corporate Media .
BTW , this is a quite long post …so , grab a beer and keep reading !
Let ’s start by discussing whether the Bush Administration SHOULD be indicted and tried for war crimes .
Just what is a war crime ?
I will use information from the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
Crimes within the Court ’s Jurisdiction :
The crime of genocide Crimes against humanity
The crime of aggression Crimes against United Nations and associated personnel War crimes
Other categories of crimes
This is a summary of what the ICC defines as War Crimes :
The draft statute enumerates four different categories of war crimes .
The first two categories apply to international armed conflicts and are largely based on well - established principles of international law .
There is broad support for their inclusion :
A. Grave breaches of the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949
I ’ll come back to the rest of the Crimes in a moment , but first , let ’s take a look at the applicable Geneva Conventions .
You can read the full text of the Geneva Conventions here .
If you read the entire Geneva Conventions document , pay special attention to the following Articles :
Article 3
In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties , each party to the conflict shall be bound to apply , as a minimum , the following provisions :
1. Persons taking no active part in the hostilities … shall in all circumstances be treated humanely , without any adverse distinction founded on race , colour , religion or faith , sex , birth or wealth , or any other similar criteria .
To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above - mentioned persons : ( a) Violence to life and person , in particular murder of all kinds , mutilation , cruel treatment and torture ;
( b) Taking of hostages ;
( c) Outrages upon personal dignity , in particular , humiliating and degrading treatment ; Article 17
No physical or mental torture , nor any other form of coercion , may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever .
Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened , insulted , or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind .
Prisoners of war who , owing to their physical or mental condition , are unable to state their identity , shall be handed over to the medical service .
The identity of such prisoners shall be established by all possible means , subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph .
Article 87
Collective punishment for individual acts , corporal punishments , imprisonment in premises without daylight and , in general , any form of torture or cruelty , are forbidden .
Article 130
Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts , if committed against persons or property protected by the Convention : wilful killing , torture or inhuman treatment , including biological experiments , wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health , compelling a prisoner of war to serve in the forces of the hostile Power , or wilfully depriving a prisoner of war of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in this Convention .
Back to the ICC Crimes :
B. Other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflicts ( largely derived from the Hague law , limiting the methods of waging war ) .
The third and fourth categories of war crimes apply to armed conflicts not of an international character .
These categories are drawn from Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Second Additional Protocol to the four Geneva Conventions , respectively .
The inclusion of these two provisions is still being debated .
C. In case of an armed conflict not of an international character , serious violations of article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 ( which bars specified acts committed against persons taking no active part in the hostilities )
D. Other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in armed conflicts not of an international character , within the established framework of international law ( based largely on the Second Additional Protocol to the four Geneva Conventions ) .
As the above is a summary of the ICC Crimes , if you want detailed information , here .
So , what are these crimes defined by the ICC and how do they relate to the Geneva conventions ?
Regarding the crime of Genocide , depending on where you look , there are a lot of dead Iraqis :
Infoshout lists more than 135,000 dead Iraqis
Iraq Body Count lists between 84,000 and 91,000 dead Iraqi civilians
The World Health Organization lists more than 151,000 dead Iraqis
CNN says 655,000 Iraqi deaths
Lancet , the UK ’s top medical journal , has more than 600,000 deaths
One has to wonder how many dead people a genocide makes .
In Bosnia , the ethnic cleansing was estimated at around 200,000 .
Milosevic stood trial at The Hague for that .
Ok , crimes of genocide .
Check .
What about the crime of Aggression ?
Marjorie Cohn says :
Bush ’s new doctrine of “ preemptive war ” is a license to prosecute wars of aggression .
It runs directly counter to the United Nations Charter ’s prohibition on the use of armed force except in self - defense or when authorized by the Security Council .
A preemptive war is a war of aggression .
“ Operation Iraqi Freedom ” falls squarely into this category .
Kofi Annan also challenged the US doctrine of preemptive war saying that it “ posed a fundamental challenge to the United Nations and could lead to a global free - for - all . ”
So , crimes of aggression .
Check .
And then there ’s war crimes .
Since there are many areas of this , let ’s take them one at a time .
First up , grave breaches of the four Geneva Conventions .
The Washington Post reports here and here :
In August 2002 , the Justice Department advised the White House that torturing al Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad “ may be justified , ” and that international laws against torture “ may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations ” conducted in President Bush ’s war on terrorism , according to a newly obtained memo .
The legal reasoning in the 2002 memo , which covered treatment of al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody , was later used in a March 2003 report by Pentagon lawyers assessing interrogation rules governing the Defense Department ’s detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
At that time , Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked the lawyers to examine the logistical , policy and legal issues associated with interrogation techniques .
In the Justice Department ’s view — contained in a 50 - page document signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee and obtained by The Washington Post — inflicting moderate or fleeting pain does not necessarily constitute torture .
Torture , the memo says , “ must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or even death . ”
By contrast , the Army ’s Field Manual 34 - 52 , titled “ Intelligence Interrogations , ” sets more restrictive rules .
For example , the Army prohibits pain induced by chemicals or bondage ; forcing an individual to stand , sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time ; and food deprivation .
Under mental torture , the Army prohibits mock executions , sleep deprivation and chemically induced psychosis .
The Office of Legal Counsel is the federal government ’s ultimate legal adviser .
The most significant and sensitive topics that the federal government considers are often given to the OLC for review .
In this case , the memorandum was signed by Jay S. Bybee , the head of the office at the time .
Bybee ’s signature gives the document additional authority , making it akin to a binding legal opinion on government policy on interrogations .
Bybee has since become a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
Perhaps , I should let you decide .
To refresh the following is prohibited at any time and at any place whatsoever :
Murder , mutilation , cruel treatment and torture
Outrages upon personal dignity , in particular , humiliating and degrading treatment
No physical or mental torture , nor any other form of coercion to secure information of any kind
Collective punishment
Great suffering or serious injury to body or health
Let ’s look at what has been done in your name ; in the name of the United States of America ?
Photos from the Washington Post , the New Yorker , and Salon ( some taken from The Raw Story )
And then there are these drawings based on Al Jazeera cameraman ’s experiences at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The pictures were created by political cartoonist Lewis Peake ( Illustration Art by Lewis Peake : Illustration and Website Design ) , and came about after Mr. al - Haj ’s original drawings were censored by the Pentagon .
Mr. al - Haj had shown the drawings to his lawyer , Cori Crider , during a visit last month .
Fearing that they would be censored , Ms. Crider asked Mr. al - Haj to provide detailed descriptions of the drawings , which he duly did .
When the drawings were subsequently censored , as anticipated , Reprieve approached Lewis Peake and asked him to create original works based on Mr. al - Haj ’s descriptions .
The following drawings came from here and here .
Sami al - Haj who was held in captivity , by the United States , for five and a half years .
He was sent to Gitmo in 2001 and never saw an attorney until 2004 .
He was ultimately released without charges being filed against him .
Let me repeat ; he spent five and a half years in “ prison ” and no charges were ever filed against him .
Does anyone remember the Maus cartoons from a prisoner ’s time at a concentration camp in WWII ?
Stunningly familiar .
And just today it was reported that another detainee had all charges dropped against him .
This man , Mohammed al - Qahtani , was held at Guantanamo since 2002 , supposedly as the 20th hijacker on 9/11 .
In 2006 , Qahtani recanted a confession he said he made after he was tortured .
In fact , “ Qahtani never made a single statement that was not extracted through torture or the threat of torture , ” CCR notes .
Records of the interrogations of Qahtani , however , were “ mysteriously lost . ”
Cameras that “ run 24 hours a day at the prison were set to automatically record over their contents , ” the Guardian reported last month .
Imagine that .
Records disappearing – again .
Damn , that is one hungry dog they have there eating all records , emails and everything else .
And the Administration ’s take on it ?
Ooops .
My bad .
So sorry we tortured you .
And how about Section B , Other serious violations which include targeting civilians , rape , and intentional starvation .
Apparently , the bombs dropped on Iraq , as well as bullets used ( in both the first Gulf war and now ) , are made with depleted uranium ( DU ) .
Depleted uranium is the byproduct of enriching uranium ( enriched uranium is used to make nuclear weapons , the shit left over is depleted uranium ) and , while less potent than enriched uranium , depleted uranium has a half - life of 4.5 BILLION YEARS ( yes , that would be Billion with a B ) .
Let ’s think about that as we cavalierly discuss strategic nuclear attacks on ANY country ( how about it Senators “ bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Iran ” McCain and “ obliterate Iran ” Clinton ? ) .
While DU is less toxic than enriched uranium , there is no data concerning long - term health effects .
While any radiation exposure has risks , no conclusive epidemiological data have correlated DU exposure to specific human health effects such as cancer .
However , the UK government has attributed birth defect claims from a 1991 .
Gulf
War combat veteran to DU poisoning , and studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents continue to suggest the possibility of leukemogenic , genetic , reproductive , and neurological effects from chronic exposure
Let ’s see how this worked out during the first Gulf war .
I warn you , these videos are very graphic and not for the faint of heart .
Iraqi Birth Defects
[ Youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRIa0_ah8sI]
Effects on US Service Men and Women
Iraqi cancers and birth defects have been blamed on US depleted uranium .
And it looks like we ’re stocking more uranium - rich bombs .
Wonderful .
So , would you consider this a war crime ?
Major Douglas
Rokke , a military veteran specializing in nuclear , biological and chemical warfare , who was one of the Pentagon ’s foremost experts , and now an outspoken critic does .
Rokke labels the use of DU weapons as a war crime and a crime against humanity .
Internal documents show that the US Department of Defense ( DoD ) has known about the harmful environmental and health consequences of radioactive weapons since 1943 .
Despite this , the DoD has denied medical care to people exposed to DU , refused to clean up the environmental mess left behind by the weapons and has continued to lie about the adverse health effects for people exposed to depleted uranium .
The harmful effects of DU exposure include respiratory and neurological problems , rashes , cancers , kidney and lung damage , joint and muscle pain , fibromyalgia , cataracts , memory loss , changes in the RNA in DNA , causing genetic birth defects , and a host of other conditions associated with exposure to heavy metal toxicity and radiation .
Potentially , hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq , Afghanistan , the Balkans and other places are already sick or will become sick due to exposure to DU contamination .
Rokke was tasked to head a team to clean up the contamination left behind by depleted uranium during the 1991 Gulf War .
What he found was a toxicological and radiological mess beyond comprehension .
He discovered that doctors and nurses did n’t know how to handle the medical cases they were seeing , and there simply was no way to treat all the victims or to clean up the mess left behind .
Of the 700,000 US troops who were in the Gulf during 1991 war , more than 200,000 are disabled from effects of Gulf War Syndrome , a condition believed to be caused by exposure to DU radiation , as well as factors including exposure to chemical agents , biological agents , pesticides , immunisations against anthrax and other diseases , and exposure to pollutants from oil - well fires .
The US does not want to lose DU munitions from their arsenal , Rokke states .
A 1991 internal US Army memorandum recognised how effective these weapons were against Iraqi armour , but warned that if the health and environmental impact of these weapons become widely known , their use may become politically unacceptable and they could be removed from the arsenal .
Therefore , the memo concluded that this “ sensitive issue should be kept in mind when after action reports [ on DU ] are written ” .
Rokke ’s interpretation of this is that the Pentagon is directing its staff to lie .
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has categorised DU weapons , alongside nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , napalm and cluster bombs , as a “ weapon of indiscriminate effect ” .
Iraqis are already suffering a host of health problems due to DU , and these will only increase over the coming decade .
Being an outspoken critic , Rokke , as with everyone who has spoken out against this administration , is now being discredited – and has been the recipient of threats and intimidation .
Is Rokke alone ?
No .
In addition , Lawyers Against the War state that :
[ T ]he estimate of the tons of DU the US used in Iraq : 1000 - 2000 tons – more than three times the amount used in the first Gulf War…only this time it was primarily spread in Iraq ’s cities , not on the battlefield .
The uranium and its radioactive decay products will remain toxic for over 4 billion years … and will slowly destroy the genetic future of the Iraqi people .
But the death and destruction will not be contained within the borders of Iraq .
Winds will spread it throughout the Middle East and beyond .
The US has carried out its omnicidal plan now on Afghanistan and Iraq … what country is next ?
Israel , Palestine , Lebanon , Kuwait , the Gulf States , and Iran will breathe the invisible war too … and they will share the fate of the Iraqi people , the caretakers of the cradle of civilization .
Lawyers Against the War also reports that ALL soldiers from the UK , upon their return from the Gulf are being checked for uranium cancer .
( The Guardian Weekly 20 - 3- 0501 , page 4 ) .
And the US ?
In a word , no .
I suppose it does n’t help Bush that there is corroboration of US backed Afghan allies committing atrocities .
Ok , what do you think ?
Are these war crimes ?
Many lawyer groups , citizens , and countries around the world have chimed in , not just against the Bush Administration , but towards Tony Blair , former Prime Minister of England .
Mr. Blair is in a much more precarious position because , unlike George Bush , Blair did not pull out of the ICC , so he can be more readily held to its standards .
Alright , we now know what the whole ICC Crimes and Geneva Conventions are about .
Does the Bush Administration fall into any of these categories ?
Apparently , many think they do .
Based on a book written by two American Civil Liberties Union attorneys :
“ [ T ] he documents show unambiguously that the administration has adopted some of the methods of the most tyrannical regimes , ” write Jameel Jaffer and Amrit Singh .
“ Documents from Guantanamo describe prisoners shackled in excruciating ‘ stress positions , ’ held in freezing - cold cells , forcibly stripped , hooded , terrorized with military dogs , and deprived of human contact for months . ”
And Jonathan Turley , an attorney who has argued case law in front of the Supreme Court and Professor of Constitutional Law at George Washington University says :
“ It is really amazing because Congress — including the Democrats — have avoided any type of investigation into torture because they do not want to deal with the fact that the president ordered war crimes , ” Turley told MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann Thursday night .
“ But evidence keeps on coming out … .
What you get from this is this was a premeditated and carefully orchestrated torture program .
Not torture , but a torture program . ”
The president and his aides were very , very careful to go to the lawyers first so they could make a claim they were acting under some assumption of actual authority , ” he said .
“ There really is none . ”
Marjorie Cohn , president of the National Lawyers Guild , recognized as one of San Diego ’s top attorneys in academics , who lectures on international human rights and US foreign policy says :
Non-governmental organizations and individuals from sixty - six different countries have filed 499 “ communications ” – or complaints – with the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , between July 2002 and July 2003 .
Many of them urge the ICC to investigate the United States conduct in the war on Iraq .
The primary charge is that the U.S. committed an act of aggression against Iraq .
The ICC has jurisdiction to punish the crime of aggression .
Bush ’s new doctrine of “ preemptive war ” is a license to prosecute wars of aggression .
It runs directly counter to the United Nations Charter ’s prohibition on the use of armed force except in self - defense or when authorized by the Security Council .
A preemptive war is a war of aggression .
“ Operation Iraqi Freedom ” falls squarely into this category .
More than 50 years ago , Associate United States Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson , one of the prosecutors at the Nuremberg Tribunal , wrote : “ No political or economic situation can justify ” the crime of aggression .
He added : “ If certain acts in violation of treaties are crimes they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them , and we are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us . ”
An impartial international criminal tribunal is necessary to prevent “ victor ’s justice , ” where only the vanquished are subject to prosecution .
Under the treaty , the ICC can take jurisdiction over a national of even a non-party state if he or she commits a crime in a state party ’s territory .
The U.S. vehemently objects to this .
But it ’s nothing new .
Under well - established principles of international law , the core crimes prosecuted in the ICC – genocide , war crimes , crimes against humanity , and the crime of aggression – are crimes of universal jurisdiction .
That means that an alleged perpetrator can – and always could – be arrested anywhere .
And then there is a group of Canadian lawyers who have charged Bush with torture .
Today in Vancouver , Lawyers Against the War filed torture charges against George W. Bush under the Canadian Criminal Code .
The charges concern the well known abuses of prisoners held by US Armed Forces in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and the Guantánamo Bay prison in Cuba .
The charges were accepted by the Justice of the Peace and referred for a hearing to decide whether Bush should be required to appear for trial .

Of course , the Japanese attorneys also want in to this party .
Japanese lawyers have also filed a war crimes ‘ indictment ’ against Bush .
President Bush is being “ indicted ” for war crimes allegedly committed against the Afghan people since the U.S. - led coalition began its antiterrorism campaign in October 2001 , a group of Japanese lawyers announced .
“ We believe that attacks on Afghanistan led by the U.S. forces , such as aerial bombings and killings , were a violation of international law , ” said Haruhisa Takase , secretary general of the Tokyo - based International Criminal Tribunal for Afghanistan .
The lawyers are a nongovernmental private group and have neither official status nor authority , according to Takase .
The “ indictment ” was a device meant to signify the lawyers ’ condemnation of U.S. actions in Afghanistan , he said .
Takase contends
Bush also may be liable for bombing private facilities and slaying war prisoners .
And the citizens in Japan feel the same way .
A citizens ’ tribunal Saturday in Tokyo found U.S. President George W. Bush guilty of war crimes for attacking civilians with indiscriminate weapons and other arms during the U.S. - led antiterrorism operations in Afghanistan in 2001 .
The tribunal also issued recommendations for banning depleted uranium shells and other weapons that could indiscriminately harm people , compensating the victims in Afghanistan and reforming the United Nations in light of its failure to stop the U.S. - led operation there .
The tribunal participants spent two years examining Bush ’s role as the top commander in the war , making eight field trips to Afghanistan and holding nearly 20 public hearings .
“ Bush said that military presence in Afghanistan is self - defense , ” said Robert Akroyd , a British lawyer who served as one of the five judges .
“ But under international law , ” he said , “ a defendant must pay great care to discriminate ( between ) legitimate objects and civilians ” in claiming that one ’s act is self - defense , said Akroyd , former head of legal studies at Aston University in Britain .
Bush failed to do so with the U.S. military ’s use of “ indiscriminate weapons such as the Daisy Cutter ( a huge conventional bomb ) , cluster bombs and depleted uranium shells , ” he said .
In addition , a Tokyo War Crimes indictment was handed down against George W. Bush for his actions in
But let ’s not leave our own attorneys out in the cold .
Here is an open letter from the National Lawyers Guild to Senator Congressman John Conyers to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate war crimes :
We write to ask that you take the lead in efforts to appoint special counsel to investigate the top officials of the current US Government executive branch and their leading co-conspirators .
The targets of this proposed investigation include , but are not limited to George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , Karl Rove , Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , Condoleeza Rice , Colin Powell , Stephen Cambone , Douglas Feith , Lewis Libbey , Richard Perle , Elliott Abrams , Michael Ledeen , James Woolsey , Newt Gingrich , and John Ashcroft .
And students and the Civil Rights Defense Committee also joined the party announcing indictments for torture , illegal detention and murder as have many Citizen ’s Tribunals around the world .
But the most riveting indictment is this , which was drafted by a panel of jurists including law professors , physicians , and a US diplomat and retired US Army Colonel ( which is not the full indictment .
Go to the link to download the full indictment . ) :
The Commission will inquire into the following charges : Torture :
Count 1 : The Bush administration authorized the use of torture and abuse in violation of international humanitarian and human rights law and domestic constitutional and statutory law .
Rendition :
Count 2 : The Bush administration authorized the transfer ( “ rendition ” ) of persons held in U.S. custody to foreign countries where torture is known to be practiced .
Illegal Detention : Count 3 : The Bush administration authorized the indefinite detention of persons seized in foreign combat zones and in other countries far from any combat zone and denied them the protections of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war and the protections of the U.S. Constitution .
Count 4 : The Bush administration authorized the round - up and detention in the United States of tens of thousands of immigrants on pretextual grounds and held them without charge or trial in violation of international human rights law and domestic constitutional and civil rights law .
Count 5 : The Bush administration used military forces to seize and detain indefinitely without charges U.S. citizens , denying them the right to challenge their detention in U.S. courts .
Murder :
Count 6 : The Bush administration committed murder by authorizing the CIA to kill those that the president designates , either US citizens or non-citizens , anywhere in the world .
Attacks on Global Public Health
The Commission will inquire into the following charges : Count 1 : Imposition of Abstinence - Only HIV Prevention Programs–
The Bush administration is using its political influence , aid , and funding in the sphere of HIV / AIDS prevention and treatment to advance policies and programs that worsen the AIDS pandemic .
Guided by a Christian fundamentalist ideological agenda , the administration is promoting and forcing deadly abstinence - only HIV prevention and sex education programs instead of proven comprehensive programs that comprise consistent and correct use of condoms .
Count 2 : Imposition of “ Gag - Rule ” –
The Bush administration has re-instated the “ gag- rule ” policy which restricts foreign organizations that receive US funds from using their own , non-U.S. , funds to provide legal abortion services or even provide accurate medical counseling or referrals regarding abortion .
This policy has led to the closing of reproductive health clinics dependent on international funding in very poor parts of the world .
In many areas , these clinics have also been the only source of HIV / AIDS prevention and care programs , including the supply of much - needed and life - saving condoms .
Count 3 : Distortion of Science–
The Bush administration and its political operatives have distorted sound science and attempted to suppress medical research studies in HIV prevention when it conflicts with the ideology of the Christian Right .
Count 4 : Restriction of Generics–
The Bush administration has used its political and economic power to coerce other countries into agreements that severely restrict the manufacture and supply of generic drugs , the only affordable option for most HIV positive people in the Third World .
Which brings us to the meat of this post , the thing you are probably most curious about .
Was George W. Bush and people in his administration charged with war crimes ?
Yes …and no .
Several people in the Bush administration have received indictments for war crimes , including George Bush – but , there is a but .
Keep reading .
First , let ’s start with the only major publication in the United States , The New York Times , that I could find that reported this story on June 20 , 2003 .
Belgium said it had received lawsuits against President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain under a controversial war crimes law .
But it said it had transferred the cases to the United States and Britain , reducing their chances of reaching a court .
The Justice Ministry declined to say by whom the lawsuits were filed , but the law allows anyone to bring war crimes charges in Belgian courts .
It was recently amended to allow the government to dismiss politically motivated cases by transferring them to the defendants ’ home country , as was also done with a recent lawsuit brought by a group of Iraqis against Gen.
Tommy R. Franks , commander of allied forces in Iraq .
The United States has said it wants Belgium to strike the law altogether .
ONE LOUSY PARAGRAPH ?!?
The President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom have been charged with war crimes against humanity – and basically blown off by giving the countries involved jurisdiction – and we get one lousy paragraph ?
Give me a break !
HELLO , Corporate Media … do your jobs !
CommonDreams had more information ( originally reported by Reuters , but no longer available online ) :
Belgium ’s justice ministry said legal authorities had received lawsuits against Bush , Blair and a host of senior U.S. officials for crimes against humanity in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The ministry was able to send the lawsuits to Britain and the United States on Thursday under the recent change to the genocide law , ministry spokesman Joannes Thuy told Reuters .
“ The renewed law makes its possible to send a lawsuit to a country if it has a legal system which can deal with this kind of complaint , ” he said .
One lawsuit accused Bush , Blair , Secretary of State Colin Powell , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and U.S. General Tommy Franks of crimes against humanity in the recent Iraq war , a ministry statement said .
A second lawsuit was against Powell , also regarding the Iraq war .
A third was against Bush , Rumsfeld , U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft , U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz for crimes against humanity in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Well , that ’s just dandy .
Send the lawsuits back here .
I am sure the Justice Department will get some US Attorney right on that .
And then there is this formal complaint sent to the ICC by Health Now also leveling war crime charges against the US and UK .
And what of Donald Rumsfeld , he of known knowns , known unknowns , unknown unknowns or simply not knowing what the hell he ’s talking about , the Secretary of Defense at the time ?
Criminal charges were sought in 2004 by Wolfgang Kaleck as well as Michael Ratner and Peter Weiss of the U.S. - based Center for Constitutional Rights in German courts against Donald Rumsfeld for war crimes .
They were rejected by German Federal Public Prosecutor Kay Nehm with the explanation that criminal prosecution in the nations of the accused and the victims should be given priority .
And on a more current note , on October 27 , 2007 , Donald Rumsfeld fled France for fear of being arrested :
Former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld fled France today fearing arrest over charges of “ ordering and authorizing ” torture of detainees at both the American - run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and the US military ’s detainment facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , unconfirmed reports coming from Paris suggest .
US embassy officials whisked Rumsfeld away yesterday from a breakfast meeting in Paris organized by the Foreign Policy magazine after human rights groups filed a criminal complaint against the man who spearheaded President George W. Bush ’s “ war on terror ” for six years .
According to activists in France , who greeted Rumsfeld shouting “ murderer ” and “ war criminal ” at the breakfast meeting venue , US embassy officials remained tight - lipped about the former defense secretary ’s whereabouts citing “ security reasons ” .
“ Rumsfeld must be feeling how Saddam Hussein felt when US forces were hunting him down , ” activist Tanguy Richard said .
“ He may never end up being hanged like his old friend , but he must learn that in the civilized world , war crime does n’t pay . ”
And then , there is this :
When General Tommy Franks , who coordinated the recent U.S. - led military attack on Iraq , was asked about civilian casualties , he shot back : ” We do n’t do body counts . ”
Last week , a Belgian lawyer filed a lawsuit in Brussels charging Franks with war crimes .
The action was submitted on behalf of 19 Iraqis , allegedly victims of cluster bombs and U.S. bombings of civilians , under a law that permits Belgian courts to try foreigners for war crimes .
First , U.S. - led forces targeted and killed many civilians during massive bombing of facilities unrelated to military objectives , such as government ministries serving civilian needs , as well as hospitals , schools and homes .
Secondly , he told IPS , the military used disproportionate force with its so - called ” covering fire ” technique , which means indiscriminate shooting at shops , homes and mosques , killing many civilian non-combatants , including women and children .
The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and Amnesty International have both called for the establishment of a commission of experts to examine past and recent international war crimes and genocide committed in Iraq .
Listen to an interview with the attorney , Mr. Fermon , who filed the lawsuit here :
And let ’s not forget the American attacks on varied news media personnel and offices ; media outlets which were not friendly towards our “ cause . ”
This week , the Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) challenged a U.S. military accounting of the bombing last April of a hotel in Baghdad in which two journalists were killed .
After an investigation the CPJ concluded there is no evidence that U.S. forces were fired on from the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad , where nearly 100 journalists were holed up before the building was shelled by U.S. forces .
The family of a Spanish journalist killed in that attack has already filed a lawsuit against three U.S. soldiers for war crimes and murder .
The suit , based on a provision of the Rome Statute ( of the International Criminal Court or ICC ) , could be expanded to include other people , ” independent of their rank or nationality ” , said Pilar Hermoso , the attorney for Jose Couso ’s family .
But the high court ’s chief prosecutor , Eduardo Fungairiño , said this week he opposes the complaint , meaning a delay of 15 days before it is decided if the case will proceed .
” It is very clear that war crimes were committed in Iraq , ” says James Jennings , president of Conscience International .
More on that here , here , and here .
So , were they charged or indicted ?
This is where that Yeah … But comes in .
See , it ’s like this :
U.S. Threatened with Iraq War Crimes Trial Ten Iraqi civilians are planning to press war crimes charges against U.S. General Tommy Franks , the commander of the U.S. - led war in Iraq , the American newspaper the Washington Times reported .
Iraqis say the U.S. military committed war crimes , including the bombing of a Baghdad market .
The Iraqis , allegedly eyewitnesses and victims of U.S. atrocities , hold coalition forces responsible for numerous crimes , including failing to prevent looting , firing on an ambulance , shooting and injuring Iraqi civilians , causing the deaths of scores of people by bombing a Baghdad marketplace and killing at least ten passengers driving in a civilian bus near the town of Hillah .
“ U.S. military officials had the authority but did nothing to stop these war crimes from occurring , ” Fermon told the newspaper .
“ A military commander is responsible for war crimes even if he did not commit or order them , but also if he fails to take all the necessary steps to prevent the atrocities from happening . ”
Belgium ’s 1993 law of universal jurisdiction allows its courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were Belgian .
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell recently warned that Belgium was putting its international reputation at stake because of the law .
Powell in March was named in a lawsuit filed by the families of Iraqi victims of a U.S. attack on a shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 Gulf War.
Former U.S. President George Bush senior , and other members of his administration , including then defense secretary and now Vice President Dick Cheney , were also held responsible in the suit .
Really .
And then what happened ?
War crimes going ahead A Belgian lawyer is planning to press ahead with a war crimes lawsuit against US General Tommy Franks , despite American anger .
The suit , brought by 19 Iraqis , accuses General Franks of war crimes during the Iraq conflict .
Lawyer Jan Fermon , who is acting on behalf of the Iraqis , described the plaintiffs as victims of cluster bombs and of US attacks on ambulances and civilians .
“ We have a very specific case , with specific evidence , ” Mr Fermon said .
“ I do not see how they can reject it . ”
Mr Fermon said there were 17 “ specific incidents ” in which US soldiers and commanders had violated the law .
The BBC ’s Justin Webb in Washington says Bush administration officials are making it plain they would regard a prosecution of General Franks as a major diplomatic incident – an example of political harassment .
A senior administration official warned that even the issuing of indictments would result in what he called “ diplomatic consequences ” for Belgium .
But Mr Fermon hit back at Washington .
“ I think either the US State Department has nothing to hide , in which case it ’s very important for them to have an independent inquiry – and why ca n’t it be a Belgian magistrate – or they have something to hide and that ’s why they are threatening Belgium , ” the lawyer said .
But it ’s not just Belgium which risks the wrath of the Bush Administration :
US threatens German relations
The Pentagon made thinly veiled threats on Monday , suggesting US - German relations could be at risk if a criminal complaint filed in German courts over Abu Ghraib proceeds .
The Pentagon expressed concern Monday over a criminal complaint filed in Germany against US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other officials over the Abu Ghraib prison scandal , warning that “ frivolous lawsuits ” could affect the broader US - German relationship .
The complaint was filed in Berlin on Nov. 30 by the New York - based Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) and Berlin ’s Republican Lawyers ’
Association on behalf of four Iraqis who were alleged to have been mistreated by US soldiers .
Besides Rumsfeld , former CIA director George Tenet , Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Steven Cambone , Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez , Brigadier General Janis Karpinski and five other military officers who served in Iraq were named in the complaint , which seeks an investigation into their role in the prisoner abuses at Abu Ghraib .
Indicating the US planned to play a similar game of hardball with Germany , Rumsfeld has informed the German government via the US embassy that he will not take part in the annual Munich security conference in February should the investigation proceed .
Also reported here and more here .
Yeah , yeah , yeah , but what happened ?
Bush ( et al ) has a typical hissy fit , hold their collective breaths until they turn blue , stomp their feet , and threates whomever they damned well choose :
US anger at war crimes threat The Bush administration has reacted angrily to suggestions that General Tommy Franks , the commander of the US - led war in Iraq , might be charged with war crimes .
If this prosecution goes ahead , Bush administration officials are making it plain they will regard it as a major diplomatic incident – an example of political harassment .
A senior administration official warned that even the issuing of indictments would result in what he called “ diplomatic consequences ” for Belgium .
What kind of threat , you ask ?
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld threatened to block funding for a new NATO headquarters in Belgium over the law , and said the United States was considering whether it would continue to send officials to meetings in Brussels as long as the law was in place .
Let ’s see if I have this straight .
We threaten Belgium and Germany over war crimes which were demonstrated to have taken place .
What does Belgium do ?
Well , Belgium dropped the war crimes cases ( See this and this . )
Yes , there was controversy surrounding the law , which I will cover in just a moment .
The US pressured Belgium to repeal the War Crimes Law and at first , they resisted .
Eventually , they caved .
While they did n’t repeal the law , they changed it significantly .
Oh , and by the by … Bush Sr. and Ariel Sharon were also to have appeared for war crimes in Belgium under this same law .
So , what ’s the deal with this law ?
The law dates back to 1993 and is controversial because it gives anyone , anywhere in the world , the ability to file war crime charges against foreign leaders , anywhere in the world .
It ’s contentious in that politicians say the law can be abused and politicized ( and coming from our government , that is definitely something they know quite a lot about ) .
The law flooded Belgium with many lawsuits .
When the law was changed , cases were dismissed against Ariel Sharon , ( former President ) Bush and Israeli Gen .
Amos Yaron on grounds that Belgium courts did not have the jurisdiction to bring them to trial because none of the accused were citizens of Belgium at the time the alleged atrocities were committed .
( Take note that this was not dropped due to lack of evidence , but due to jurisdiction . )
The decision to drop these cases high - profile cases will likely make our administration happy as string of lawsuits being brought by independent parties against current President George W. Bush , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Colin Powell and the U.S. commander of Operation Iraqi Freedom , Gen. Tommy Franks can now go away quietly .
For now .
What ’s the saddest part about this ?
The Belgian government appeared relieved at the court ’s decision .
“ As long as complaints based on the universal jurisdiction law were not thrown out , we cannot resume ( high level ) official contacts with the United States , ” Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel said Wednesday .
“ We are satisfied with the decision , ” Israeli embassy spokesman Laurent Reichman told AP .
“ Now , both Belgium and Israel are going to work hard again to have the same friendly relations we had before . ”
Swell , we get great friendly relations and governments getting away with murder – literally .
What ’s wrong with this picture ?
Someone remind me what the point of government is again , please .
For it is certainly not to protect anyone – well , anyone not in power .
Their role ?
Oh right , they take our tax dollars and give them to people they know .
I forgot , sorry .
Let ’s recap this , shall we
The following are a compilation of the best bits ( excerpts ) from the last three links :
Belgium ’s government reacted angrily today to mounting American pressure to rescind controversial war crimes legislation , arguing that the country had already addressed Washington ’s concerns .
Belgian government officials said Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had only made the issue more difficult to deal with by threatening Thursday to find another venue for NATO meetings if Brussels failed to act on United States demands .
” I ’d like to once again repeat to Mr. Rumsfeld that Belgium has amended the genocide law , ” the country ’s foreign minister , Louis Michel , told the country ’s state radio on Friday .
” We have changed it precisely to meet the fears of our American friends . ”
The law , which allows anyone to bring war crimes charges in Belgian courts , regardless of where the crimes are said to have taken place , was recently amended to allow the government to dismiss politically motivated cases by transferring them to the defendants ’ home country .
This was done with a recent lawsuit brought by a group of Iraqis against Gen.
Tommy R. Franks , the commander of allied forces in Iraq .
But the United States has said it is not satisfied with case - by - case resolutions and wants Belgium to strike the law altogether .
During a meeting of NATO defense ministers here on Thursday , Mr. Rumsfeld said that the United States would have to ” seriously consider ” whether it would continue to allow senior American officials to visit Brussels and added that the United States would withhold financing for a new $ 350 million NATO headquarters in Belgium as long as the law remained on the books .
The United States is expected to finance about a quarter of that project .
” This is n’t the way to get them to rescind the law , ” one NATO diplomat said late Thursday , referring to Mr. Rumsfeld ’s approach .
” People will turn this into plucky little Belgium standing up to the bully , America , disguising the issue that this is a bad law that best be disposed of . ”
About 30 such cases have been filed so far , including cases against former President George Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf for their roles in an incident during the 1991 Persian lf war in which civilians were killed in an attack on a bunker .
So , just what does this new law , which the US so forcefully demanded be changed , say ?
Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said the latest change would make it harder for foreigners to initiate proceedings under the legislation , which permits Belgian courts to try war and human rights crimes no matter where they were committed .
Reform to the 1993 law would oblige the defendant or victim to have Belgian residency if not citizenship , he said .
Under intense international pressure , Belgian legislators drastically amended it last month .
The changes stipulated that human - rights complaints can be filed only if the victim or suspect was a Belgian citizen or long - term resident at the time of the alleged crime .
In addition , the Belgian parliament also guaranteed diplomatic immunity for world leaders and other high - level officials visiting the country .

If this administration can intimidate and threaten Brussels ( and Germany ) in to caving on war crimes , how do the Dems in congress stand a chance ?
By the way , Tony Blair , and several others in his administration , Jack Straw and Geoff Hoon , are also in deep doo - doo for being Bush ’s poodle .
War crimes cases were launched against them .
( Details here and here . )
Blair also faces a war crimes suit from Greece .
What happens to Mr. Blair and his cohorts will be interesting to follow because they are subject to the ICC – so , while we may not see Bush or Cheney ’s ugly mugs at The Hague in the immediate future , it is likely we will see Mr. Blair and his buddies … and one must wonder , when push comes to shove , what he ’ll have to say about the entire matter at that time .
On a positive note , we must remember that all of the people tried for war crimes thus far have been charged and tried after they left office .
There remains hope that justice will be served .

Police wielding batons clashed with protesters last night when a demonstration against George Bush 's farewell visit to Britain turned violent a few hundred metres from where the US President was dining with Gordon Brown .
Within the shadow of the Houses of Parliament , officers dressed in riot gear skirmished with several hundred demonstrators who had been attending a rally organised by the Stop the War Coalition .
The Metropolitan Police said 25 protesters were arrested .
In some cases , squads of police in riot gear had swooped upon individual demonstrators , picking out their target then barging through the crowd to detain them .

Police drew batons and truncheons in an attempt to push back a crowd which at 6.20 pm moved from the rally on Parliament Square to try to gain entry to Whitehall .
A squad of riot officers and horses were later sent to reinforce the barricade as protesters chanting " George Bush , terrorist " and " Bush go home " repeatedly tried to break through the reinforced crowd barriers and concrete blocks .
The decision to close Whitehall while Mr Bush and his wife , Laura , dined with Mr Brown and his wife , Sarah , was condemned by campaigners and the Liberal Democrats as an example of civil liberties being curtailed at the request of a foreign government .
The clashes were in stark contrast to Mr Bush 's arrival in London at the end of a week - long tour expected to be his last in Europe before he leaves office .
A grand total of 28 protesters from the Stop the War Coalition gathered at Windsor , where Mr Bush had tea with the Queen .
Iqbal Siddiq , 26 , a student at the Windsor protest , said : " The message is good riddance .
He 's still the mass murderer - in - chief .
But ... he 's yesterday 's man .
Everything he did to engineer the war in Iraq still makes me angry but it is fast becoming history .
We 've got to concentrate on the next guy and the mess Bush has left behind . "
Mr Bush became the first US president to be hosted at Windsor since Ronald Reagan in 1982 .
Buckingham Palace confirmed the couple had shown particular interest in a suit of armour worn by Henry VIII .
Whether this aside sparked a conversation about the perils of foreign invasions or armed combat will go unrecorded by history but more serious matters awaited Mr Bush as some of the 1,000 police deployed at a cost of £ 1 m to ensure his security took up positions among the trees and on turrets with rifles and sub-machine guns .
But it was the closure of Whitehall by Scotland Yard and its implications for civil liberties that provoked the strongest feelings .
A Stop the War spokesman , Andrew Burgin , said : " What would the Americans think if Gordon Brown turned up with a 700 - strong entourage who told them to close down central Washington ?
It is the sort of high - handed attitude that has been shown by Bush all along . "
Those who saw him hushed .

— Colum McCann , Let The Great World Spin
Despite having lived in New York City for most of the 2010s and worked in Lower Manhattan for a few of them , I still did n’t know where these streets were when I was reading Colum McCann ’s novel at the end of 2019 .
Knowing the names of a city ’s streets has always been meaningful to me , despite its waning utility .
But aside from being useful if the internet happens to be down or if one ’s GPS is on the fritz , streets somehow make me feel connected to a city in a way that I find important .
The denizens of a place have so little in common with one another aside from their shared geography , and it sometimes disappoints me that the simple act of asking for directions is a dwindling reason to have a conversation in the age of the smartphone .
But at least it ’s still a valid one .

The University of Maryland , College Park is proceeding cautiously , giving the iPhone or iPod Touch to 150 students , said Jeffrey C. Huskamp , vice president and chief information officer at the university .
“ We do n’t think we have all the answers , ” Mr. Huskamp said .
By observing how students use the gadgets , he said , “ We ’re trying to get answers from students . ”
At each college , the students who choose to get an iPhone must pay for mobile phone service .
Those service contracts include unlimited data use .
Both the iPhones and the iPod Touch devices can connect to the Internet through campus wireless networks .
With the iPhone , those networks may provide faster connections and longer battery life than AT&T ’s data network .
Many cellphones allow users to surf the Web , but only some newer ones have Wi-Fi capability .

University officials say they have no plans to track their students ( and Apple said it would not be possible unless students give their permission ) .
They say they are drawn to the prospect of learning applications outside the classroom , though such lesson plans have yet to surface .
“ My colleagues and I are studying something called augmented reality , ” said Christopher J. Dede , professor in learning technologies at Harvard University .
“ Alien Contact , ” for example , is an exercise developed for middle - school students who use hand - held devices that can determine their location .
As they walk around a playground or other area , text , video or audio pops up at various points to help them try to figure out why aliens were in the schoolyard .
“ You can imagine similar kinds of interactive activities along historical lines , ” like following the Freedom Trail in Boston , Professor Dede said .
“ It ’s important that we do research so that we know how well something like this works . ”
The rush to distribute the devices worries some professors , who say that students are less likely to participate in class if they are multitasking .
“ I ’m not someone who ’s anti-technology , but I ’m always worried that technology becomes an end in and of itself , and it replaces teaching or it replaces analysis , ” said Ellen G. Millender , associate professor of classics at Reed College in Portland , Ore .
( She added that she hoped to buy an iPhone for herself once prices fall . )
The Nation :
Protesters are storming Barack Obama 's website .
But they all support Obama .
A grassroots group of activists has been organizing on MyBo , Obama 's official social networking portal , to protest the Senator 's recent decision to back controversial legislation granting the President more spying powers .
The effort hit a big milestone on Tuesday afternoon :
It is now the largest self - organized group on Obama 's website , topping networks that were launched over a year ago .
The spying protest , " Senator Obama - Please Vote NO on Telecom Immunity - Get FISA Right , " launched last week .
( See Obama Network Organizes and Revolts Over Spying , The Nation . )
Membership spiked to about 8,900 people on Tuesday , edging out a student group with roughly 8,600 members , and one organizer estimated that the growth rate reached a rapid four percent during the daytime .
The group initially spread through the Obama network , since the site 's platform instantly connects members through a dedicated email listserve .
On Monday , for example , over 200 emails shot across the wire , reaching the roughly 2,300 members who opted to receive individual messages .
The exchanges ranged from policy debates , like whether immunity was acceptable if the telephone companies acted in good faith , to organizing strategies , such as promoting the group on sharing sites like Digg .
Then some activists open - sourced the project , creating a wiki - hub for additional actions -- from calling Obama 's office to urging Keith Olbermann to promote the group -- and launched partner groups on other sites like Facebook .
" To reach number one , we 're going to need all of us to start talking to - and emailing - their family and friends , " wrote blogger Mike Stark in a missive to the group at 3:46 am on Monday .
" [ Obama ] said he'd open up government and respond to the people instead of the special interests , " he added , " so let 's force him to respond . "
BEIJING  Angelo Taylor is the Olympic 400 - meter hurdles champion again — eight years after his first gold in Sydney , four years after injuries kept him from the final in Athens , three years after legal problems and a year after he worked as an apprentice electrician .
" To go through what I did and be back on top again , I 'm so blessed , " Taylor said .
" I feel like I 'm on top of the world . "

THE COUNT : View the medal race by country
Taylor , 29 , led a U.S. sweep , finishing in a personal - best 47.25 , followed by 2007 world champion Kerron Clement ( 47.98 ) and 2005 world champion Bershawn Jackson ( 48.06 ) .
" The USA ( track team ) has n't really had a great showing so far , " Taylor said .
" We wanted to uplift the track team to go out there and bring home the sweep . "
The sweep was the fifth in event history for the USA and first since 1960 .
Taylor joins Edwin Moses , the Olympic champion in 1976 and 1984 , as the only man to win the event eight years apart .
Taylor , Moses and Glenn Davis , the winner in 1956 and 1960 , are the event 's only two - time champs .
It has n't all been smooth for Taylor .
In 2004 , he failed to make the Olympic final , hampered by what was discovered to be stress fractures in both shins on the eve of competition .
He ran anyway and chose rest and recovery rather than surgery to have steel rods implanted .
In 2006 , he pleaded guilty to charges of contributing to the delinquency of underage girls in two incidents , in 2004 and 2005 , receiving three years ' probation .
" To see my son 's life highlighted , exploited in a negative way around the world , that was the low point , " said his mother , Subrena Glenn - Everett .
" But I vowed then we'd get through it because we 're strong believers . "
Taylor was out of the sport in 2005 and virtually out of it in 2006 before reviving his career when he started working with Innocent Egbunike , a world championships medalist in the 400 who had settled in Atlanta .
For a time , Taylor worked an electrician 's job from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. and then would go to practice .
The 2007 turnaround was highlighted by winning the U.S. title in the 400 and taking third in the world championships , recording a personal - best 44.05 .
" I knew my speed was there , " said Taylor , who scored a shoe contract that enabled him to quit the electrician 's job .
" I knew if I could get the rhythm down and take it over the hurdles , I 'd have a great chance of winning . "
When Taylor won in Sydney , he was in Lane 1 , the inside lane that makes running the turns most difficult , and ran 47.50 , his winning margin of .03 of a second the narrowest in event history .
Monday , he ran faster than ever .
" There 's more where that came from , " said Egbunike , mentioning Kevin Young 's world record of 46.78 .
" He 's capable of the world record . "
Spain 's Olympic basketball teams have risked upsetting their Chinese hosts by posing for a pre-Games advert making slit - eyed gestures .
The advert for a courier company , which is an official sponsor of the Spanish Basketball Federation , occupied a full page in the sports daily Marca , the country 's best - selling newspaper .
The advert features two large photographs , one of the men's basketball team , above , and one of the women 's team .
Both squads pose in full Olympic kit on a basketball court decorated with a picture of a Chinese dragon .
Every single player appears pulling back the skin on either side of their eyes .
The advert carries the symbol of the sport 's governing body .
No one involved in the advert appears to have considered it inappropriate nor contemplated the manner in which it could be interpreted in China and elsewhere .
No offence was intended by the advert , but whether the Chinese see it that way is a different matter and it is likely to provoke more criticism at a delicate time for Spanish sport .
The failure to recognise the potential consequences is striking in the light of the problems Spain has had with issues of race and the Spanish Olympic committee 's continued desire to host the Games in Madrid in 2016 or 2020 .
In the past the Spanish have been left in no doubt as to the sensitivity of racial issues internationally , especially since Spain 's football manager , Luis Aragonés , made his infamous remark about Thierry Henry , monkey chants greeted England 's football players in a friendly game in Madrid and the formula one driver Lewis Hamilton was subjected to abuse in Barcelona .
No game , no gain .
A Manhattan gym is charging customers $ 110 an hour for a personal training session – with a Nintendo Wii .
Super Mario ’s rotund physique may not be what most gym members are shooting for , but personal trainer Dorothy Evans says the video - game system not only gets the heart pumping but might even help her clients lose a few pixels in the process .
“ You ’d be surprised .
It may have little to do with the real sports , but we get people ’s heart rates up to 140 to 150 beats per minute – although some of that may just be the excitement of the game , ” said Evans , who gives Wii workouts on a 20 - foot screen in what otherwise is used as a racquetball court at Gravity Fitness at Le Parker Meridien hotel .
It may sound crazy , but between treadmills and elliptical trainers , gym members already are accustomed to working out with machines while staring at TV screens , said Mark Natale , Gravity ’s executive director .
“ We think of this as just another tool at the gym , ” he said .
Evans combines Wii Sport games , like boxing , tennis , golf and dodge ball , with the real thing .
For instance , in her boxing class , her clients first put on real gloves and learn to throw jabs , crosses and hooks .
And in between these real punches and cardio drills , they get to play the game .
“ I use it in what we call ‘ active recovery time , ’ during which normally I would have them do a wall sit , ” she said .
“ But this is like a reward . ”
Video games may normally provide only physical training fit for a thumb fight , but the Wii , if used properly , can be a full body workout , Evans said .
Clients at the gym were skeptical at first .
“ When you envision someone playing video games , you get a vision of some kid zoned out .
Or you get the picture of that slacker in his mom ’s basement , ” said Robyn Angrick , 29 , who has had two Wii boxing workouts .
“ I decided to give it a try to break up the monotony – I just felt like I was in a rut , ” she said .
“ But I was not really prepared – it kicked my ass . ”
A study by the American Council on Exercise found that although playing the Wii is no substitute for the real - life sports , it is possible to burn almost as many calories .
For instance , Wii Boxing burns an average of 7.2 calories per minute , compared to 10.2 calories in actual sparring .

Bjarne Stroustrup , inventor of the C++ programming language , is a computer scientist and the College of Engineering Chair Professor of Computer Science at Texas A&M University .
He has always been highly involved in the standardization of C++.
Since 2004 , Bjarne and the standards committee have been busy hammering out the details of a new standard , temporarily titled C++0 x .
Bjarne was gracious enough to take time out of his busy schedule to speak with DevX C++
Pro , Danny Kalev , about new C++0 x features and the state of the C++ language .
The C++0 x standard will be finalized during 2009 .
Can you outline its major features and its overall importance to the C++ community ?
We hope to vote out a draft standard for public review in October 2008 so that we 'll be able to hand in a final draft for international vote in 2009 .
Because of this heavy ISO process , it 's touch and go whether C++0 x will be C++09 , but there is still hope and the major features are now known ( barring disasters ) .
We can classify the extensions like this
Concurrency :
memory model supporting modern machine architectures
Threading ABI
atomic types
mutexes and locks
thread local storage
asynchronous message exchange
Libraries :
regex : regular expressions
: regular expressions unordered_map , etc. ( hash tables )
, etc. ( hash tables ) smart pointers
array : fixed - sized array
: fixed - sized array improvements to containers based on new C++0 x features
tuples
date and time ( maybe )
various library components to held library builders
Language :
rvalue references ( move semantics )
static_assert : static assertions
: static assertions variadic templates
strongly typed enumerations with scoped enumerators
constexpr : generalized constant expressions
: generalized constant expressions control of alignment
delegating and inheriting constructors
auto : deducing a type from an initializer
: deducing a type from an initializer decltype : a way of using the type of an expression in a declaration
: a way of using the type of an expression in a declaration control of defaults
nullptr : a name for the null pointer
: a name for the null pointer a range - based for loop
lambda functions
raw string literals
UTF8 literals
concepts ( a type system for template arguments )
initializer lists and uniform initializations syntax and semantics
in -class member initializers
Lists are , by themselves , not very interesting , but you can read up on a description of my general philosophy for language evolution and some of the individual decisions in my HOPL - iii paper " Evolving a language in and for the real world : C++ 1991 -2006 . "
You can also find more information than you could possibly want on the committee 's web site .
Basically , the " concurrency " features will standardize the basic layers needed to do systems programming in a multi-core world .
Obviously , facilities for doing that already exist in C++ implementations , but they are not standardized .
I 'd have liked to see library support for some high - level concurrency models , but the committee did n't have the time or consensus for that .
" I 'd have liked to see library support for some high - level concurrency models , but the committee did n't have the time or consensus for that . "
The library facilities provide a set of new library components and some improvements to the existing ones .
I would have liked to see many more , but the committee is a volunteer effort and we just did n't have the resources for a massive extension of what was offered .
Fortunately , there are many libraries available " out there , " possibly already on your machine .
For example , many of the C++0 x libraries ( e.g. , regex and unordered_map ) are now shipped by major vendors and boost.
orgoffers many components ( for instance , file system and networking ) that we 'll probably soon see in the standard .
There is also much talk of a technical report on the libraries we most wanted but had to postpone .
The language extensions are a varied lot .
Fortunately most are small and fit together with each other and with existing facilities to make a better integrated language .
Consider a few examples :
// using C++0 x features : vector < string > v = { " Gorm " , " Harald " , " Sven " , " Harald " , " Knud " } ; for ( auto p = v.begin ( ) ; p!=v.end ( ) ; ++p ) cout << * p <<'
' ; for ( auto x : v ) cout << x <<'
';
I suspect most is pretty obvious .
You can provide an initializer list directly for a vector , you can deduce the type of an iterator from its initializer , and iterate through a sequence without explicitly mentioning the iterator .
More examples :
enum class Season { winter , spring , summer , fall } ; int summer ; // does n’t clash with Season :: summer Season s = Season : : spring ; // note qualification summer = s ; // error : no Season to int conversion Season += Season : : fall ; // error : ca n’t add Seasons for_each ( v.begin( ) , v.end ( ) , [ ] ( const string& s ) { cout << s <<'
' ; } ) ;
You can have enumeration types ( class enums ) that behaves more like types than glorified integers and the “ lambda ” notation ( [ ] , etc. ) is a simplified notation for defining a function object .
Each of these simple examples can without heroic effort be written today .
However , in C++98 that code would be twice the size and in every case open opportunities for making errors and / or for introducing overhead .
Note that all " primitive " features are meant to be used in combination and in combination with existing features to solve problems .
For example , there is no " magic " for initializing vectors in particular or even any new " magic " for constructors .
Instead , the initialization of vector was achieved simply by a rule that state that an initializer_list < T > can be initialized by a list of any numbers of Ts {t1 , t2 , t3} for any type T. Given that rule , we simply give vector < T > a constructor that accepts an initializer_list < T >.
Incidentally , this mechanism can also be used to eliminate about 80 percent of the uses of the type - unsafe stdargsmacros .
Halima Bashir , a young Sudanese woman who has been a victim of and witness to numerous barbaric acts in Darfur , has spoken out against the government in Khartoum with a hard - hitting account of the tragedy .
A member of the Zaghawa tribe , Bashir puts a human face on a situation where the number of casualties is so large as to be incomprehensible .
The conflict between the Arab - dominated government in Khartoum and black Africans in Darfur , in western Sudan , has left about 300,000 dead and created as many as 2.5 million refugees , according to the UN .
Bashir , 29 , said Tears of the Desert , written with the journalist Damien Lewis , who won an award for his reporting from Darfur last year , was her chance to speak out about the atrocities perpetrated by the Sudanese government against black Africans in Darfur .
" My story is not the only one , " she said in London , where she lives with her husband and young son after a long battle to win asylum .
" There are hundreds of thousands of other stories more painful than mine .
With this book it is as if I 'm telling this story for Darfuri women .
I will keep on talking – it is the only thing I can give my people . "
In Bashir , the victims of what the international criminal court has described as a policy of genocide by Sudan 's leaders have found a soft - spoken but iron - willed representative .
Bashir arrived for our interview at a hotel in central London with her round , youthful face uncovered .
But she was firm about not revealing her face to the world , particularly to the Sudanese authorities .
While she remains safe in Britain , she fears for the safety of her mother , sister and two brothers , who joined the rebels in Darfur .
She still does not know what happened to her family after they fled their village when government troops and the notorious Janjaweed militia attacked .
The men of the village stood and fought to buy time for the women and children to flee to the forest .
Her father died in the attack .
Bashir does not want the Khartoum government to use the knowledge of what she looks like to track down her family – if they are still alive .
Because of fears for her family , Bashir talked to us with her face covered by headgear , hastily purchased around the corner from John Lewis .
Only her eyes were visible during the interview .
Tears of the Desert is not just an account of the atrocities committed by the government - backed Janjaweed – or devils on horseback – against black Africans .
The first half of the book describes a happy childhood in a close - knit Darfur village , although it does not gloss over Bashir 's hideous circumcision at the age of eight .
For the most part , however , growing up was a happy time for Bashir .
Family scenes that feature her much - loved grandmother and her best friend , Kadiga , are vividly brought to life .
Like little girls anywhere , Bashir played with dolls , although these were rag dolls made from old clothes stuffed with straw .
Her father had big plans for Bashir and she was the first girl from her village to go away to school .
Eventually she became a doctor , but she ran into trouble with the authorities for telling a reporter that the government should help all Darfuri people regardless of their tribe .
As punishment she was transferred to Mazkhabad , a village in the remote north of Darfur , and put in charge of a clinic .
This is where she saw and experienced at first hand the atrocities of the Darfur conflict .
Not even in her darkest nightmare had she imagined she would witness such horror , she wrote , as she treated girls as young as eight who had been repeatedly raped .
Bashir had to care for more than 40 girls who were sexually assaulted at their school while government soldiers cordoned off the premises .
Parents were kept standing outside the school as their daughters ' screaming pierced the air .
A rape victim who was a teacher told Bashir : " They were shouting and screaming at us .
You know what they were saying ?
' We have come here to kill you !
To finish you all !
You are black slaves !
You are worse than dogs .
The worst was that they were laughing and yelping with joy as they did those terrible things . "
The Janjaweed eventually came for Bashir herself .
Three men in khaki uniforms took her from the clinic to a military camp , where she was beaten and repeatedly raped .
The ordeal went on into a second day with Bashir retreating in her head " to a faraway place where my God had taken me , a place where they could n't reach me " .
One of her captors told her : " We 're going to let you live because we know you 'd prefer to die .
Is n't that clever of us ?
Are n't we clever , doctor ?
We may not have your education , but we 're damn smart , would n't you agree ? "
Hard as it was for her to go over such painful memories , Bashir said the process of writing her memoir help her come to terms with her terrible ordeal .
More importantly , she wanted to tell the whole world about what was going on , especially the atrocities committed against young girls .
" These men were not normal , " she said .
" No normal people would do such a thing to children .
I wanted to tell the whole world what was happening . "
She could only explain the actions of the aggressors as an extremely virulent form of racism .
" It is because of the colour of our skin , it is because we are black , " she said .
" Even at school they give us nicknames and make jokes about us .
It is something that has gone on a long time . "
Bashir cited her experience at medical school where she had a reputation as a swot .
The corpses students worked on were exclusively black .
One of her friends said : " Arabs do not give a damn about us when we 're alive , and even less when we 're dead " .
Some foreign policy commentators have criticised the international criminal court 's decision to charge Omar al - Bashir , the Sudanese president , with genocide and crimes against humanity .
They say it will make a peace deal between the Sudanese government and the rebels harder to achieve and warn it could jeopardise the already troubled deployment of a joint UN - African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur .
Bashir , however , has no reservations about the court 's decision .
She told an audience at the Royal Festival Hall : " I can't explain how happy I am for the ICC case , " she said .
" It is now more than five years this has been going on and very little has been done .
It 's as if we 've been talking to deaf people .
For me this is a step for justice . "

My apologies to Catholics among us ( and I promise , Mannion , I ’m not trying to make a pope joke ! ) , but I swear I thought this was a picture of Emperor Palpatine in a Santa hat :
It is , however , Pope Benedict XVI , wearing a camauro , a hat which has been part of the papal wardrobe since the 12th century .
I would not be keen to sit on his lap .
A 21 year old black man in Winnfield , Louisiana , named Baron “ Scooter ” Pikes , was tasered 9 times in 14 minutes by a white police officer in January after he was arrested and handcuffed .
He died .
Seems a tad excessive to me .
However , here ’s the story of his arrest and subsequent death according to the police report by the arresting officers :
[ Police Officer ]
Nugent spotted Pikes walking along the street and attempted to arrest him on an outstanding warrant for drug possession , according to Police Chief Johnny Ray Carpenter .
Pikes took off running , but another officer cornered him outside a nearby grocery store .
Pikes resisted arrest and Nugent subdued him with a shock from a Taser .
Then on the way to the police station , Carpenter told the newspaper , Pikes fell ill and told the officers he suffered from asthma and was high on crack cocaine and PCP .
The officers called for an ambulance , but Pikes later died at the hospital .
So Mr. Pikes was high on PCP , crack cocaine and had a serious asthma condition ?
That poor man was seriously messed up if he smoked crack and took PCP with an existing asthma condition .
The again , perhaps we should take a look at what the subsequent autopsy report by the Parish Coroner found :
An autopsy determined there were no drugs in Pikes ’ system and that he did not have asthma , according to Dr. Randolph Williams , the Winn Parish coroner .
Gee , that does n’t exactly corroborate the police account of what happened to poor Mr. Pikes , now does it .
But what about the resisting arrest part ?
Are n’t police entitled to use appropriate force when someone is violently resisting arrest ?
What horrible acts did that allegedly drug crazed Mr. Pikes do to require these multiple taser shocks ?
Well , here ’s what Officer Nugent , the individual who administered the multiple taserings of Mr Pikes , said about that :
Moreover , Pikes did not resist arrest , and he was handcuffed while lying on the ground , according to Nugent ’s police report of the incident .
It was only after Pikes refused Nugent ’s command to stand up that the officer applied the first Taser shock in the middle of his back , Nugent wrote .
Several more
Taser shocks followed quickly , Nugent stated , because Pikes kept falling down and refusing to get back up .
Grocery shoppers who witnessed the incident later told Pikes ’ family that he had pleaded with Nugent : “ Please , you all got me .
Please do n’t Tase me again . ”
So he deserved multiple taserings because he did n’t stand up fast enough , and then after each taser shock he was unable to get up off the ground fast enough to please this Officer Nugent ?
Wow .
That ’s one dangerous man , lying on the ground writhing in pain , literally begging Officer Nugent to stop tasering him .
I can certainly see why Officer Nugent was forced to taser Mr. Pikes , again and again , in order to subdue him .
What else could he have done ?
I mean , it ’s not like Officer Nugent likes to use his taser on criminal suspects .
I ’m sure he only uses it when he absolutely has to according to proper police protocols .
Or does he ?
[ Coroner ]
Williams said police records showed Nugent administered nine Taser shocks to Pikes over a 14 - minute period .
The last two jolts , delivered as police pulled Pikes from a patrol car at the police station , elicited no reaction because the suspect was unconscious , Williams said . [… ]
In less than two years on Winnfield ’s 20 - officer police force , police records show , Nugent ranked as the department ’s most aggressive Taser user .
Among the recipients were a 15 - year - old African - American runaway who was not charged with any crime and Pikes ’ father , currently serving a prison sentence for a drug offense , who was Tasered by Nugent last year , according to Kayshon Collins .
Okay , so Officer Nugent might be a little trigger happy overenthusiastic in his use of the taser on criminal suspects or black teenage runaways .
But that does n’t necessarily mean he meant any harm to come to Mr. Pikes .
Oh wait , maybe we should reserve judgment on that point . . .
After consulting about the case with Dr. Michael Baden , a nationally prominent forensic pathologist , Williams ruled last month that Pikes ’ death was a homicide .
On the death certificate , he listed the cause of death as “ cardiac arrest following nine 50,000 - volt electroshock applications from a conductive electrical weapon . ”
“ God did not just call this young man home , ” said Williams , who has served as parish coroner for the past 33 years .
“ If somebody can tell me anything else that killed this otherwise perfectly healthy young man … I ’d like to know it . ” [… ]
“ This case may be the most unnecessary death I have ever had to investigate , ” Williams said .
“ [ Pikes ] put up no fuss , no fighting , no physical aggression . …
He just did n’t respond quickly enough to the officer ’s commands . ”
As we all know , African American men are well known as dangerous , crack smoking criminal degenerates ( and always have been ) and Mr. Pikes was undoubtedly a very evil , evil man .
Even so , I think Officer Nugent just may have gone above and beyond the call of duty when he electrocuted Mr. Spikes to death for the crime of not responding quickly enough to the good Officer ’s commands .
Indeed , one can only wonder if Officer Nugent , under similar circumstances , would have tasered a white suspect who was handcuffed and in his custody 9 fucking times in 14 goddamn minutes .
I suspect Officer Nugent would have acted differently toward a white man under his control , but we ’ll never know , especially since Officer Nugent is n’t talking to the press , and depending on what the Grand Jury decides , may never be called to account for his actions in tasering Mr. Pikes 9 fucking times in 14 goddamn minutes while Pikes groveled at his feet begging for mercy .
Jesus wept , it says in the Bible .
I do n’t know if Jesus wept again after Baron Pikes died , but I ’ll bet his family did .
I ’ll bet they cried for days on end .
On the other hand , I ’ll bet that Officer Nugent did not cry after he killed Mr. Pikes by tasering him 9 fucking times in 14 goddamn minutes .
Not part of his job description , after all .
WEDNESDAY July 2 , 2008 ( foodconsumer.org ) --
A new study by researchers at Saint Louis University found some evidence to support the hypothesis that calorie restriction may be able to extend a person 's lifespan .
Calorie restriction works well in some animals such as rats and mice to elongate their lifespan .
But it remains unknown how calorie restriction affects the aging process in rodents .
One theory is that calorie restriction slows aging by decreasing the level of a thyroid hormone called triiodothyronine ( T3 ) in the body , which in turn slows metabolism and tissue aging .
“ Over recent years , there has been a huge amount of debate about whether calorie restriction slows the aging process in humans , ” said Edward Weiss , Ph.D. , associate professor of nutrition and dietetics .
The current study published in the June 2008 issue of Rejuvenation Research was meant to see how calorie restriction would affect the same hormone in humans .
For the study , one group of volunteers followed a diet with its total energy cut by 300 to 500 calories , one group followed a regular diet , but did exercise regularly and a control group did not cut calories nor did much of physical exercise .
The volunteers were sedentary , non-smoking men and post - menopausal women aged 50 to 60 with average or slightly above average body mass indexes .
They were free of cardiovascular disease , diabetes , lung disease , uncontrolled hypertension and evidence of malignancy when entering the study .
During the one - year follow - up , volunteers in both the calorie restriction and exercise groups experienced similar change in body fat mass .
But the volunteers in the calories restriction group , not other two groups experienced lower levels of the thyroid hormone .
A long term study is needed to determine whether reducing T3 levels through calorie restriction slows the aging process , according to the researchers .
But the current study resulted in some evidence to suggest a possibility that T3 may be involved .
It is logically possible when intake of calories is low , human bodies would slow down their metabolism and other biochemical processes , and conserve the energy for more adverse condition the body may have to deal with in the future .
As a result , calorie restriction leads to slower aging process .
PLoS Biology has a cozy essay entitled “ Is Sleep Essential ? ” that addresses the mystery of the purpose of sleep .
The article looks at sleep across the whole of the animal kingdom to examine how different species sleep and whether there are any animals that do n’t sleep at all .
There are no convincing cases of sleepless animals it seems , and the authors , neuroscientists Chiara Cirelli and Giulio Tononi , argue that sleep is therefore likely to be an essential function of living creatures .
The three corollaries of the null hypothesis [ ‘ sleep is not required ’ ] do not seem to square well with the available evidence : there is no convincing case of a species that does not sleep , no clear instance of an animal that forgoes sleep without some compensatory mechanism , and no indication that one can truly go without sleep without paying a high price .
What many concluded long ago still seems to hold : the case is strong for sleep serving one or more essential functions .
But which ones ?
The article goes on to examine the hypotheses that sleep is important for regulating the body ’s core functions , the brain , individual cells and that it is common to all species and must involve something that cannot be provided by quiet wakefulness .
More interesting is the question of whether all animals dream – and perhaps most intriguing , if so , how they might dream .
Indeed , it would be interesting to discover whether dreaming is a necessary function of sleep , or whether it is specifically linked to certain neurocognitive processes or even particular creatures .

08/26/2008
California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced that he has reached a settlement with Citibank after a three - year investigation into the companys use of an illegal account sweeping program .
Nationally , the company took more than $ 14 million from its customers , including $ 1.6 million from California residents , through the use of a computer program that wrongfully swept positive account balances from credit - card customer accounts into Citibanks general fund , Brown said .
The company knowingly stole from its customers , mostly poor people and the recently deceased , when it designed and implemented the sweeps , Brown said .
When a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his superiors , they buried the information and continued the illegal practice .
Between 1992 and 2003 , Citibank employed a computerized credit sweep process to automatically remove positive or credit balances from credit - card customer accounts .
An account could show a credit balance if a customer double - paid a bill or returned a purchase for credit .
The credit sweeps were done without notifying the customer and without regard for whether the customer had any unpaid balances or other charges owed to Citibank .
The credit sweeps targeted more than 53,000 customers nationwide .
All of the affected accounts were in a recovery status , which includes accounts of customers who have died , sought bankruptcy protection , or been the target of litigation or other collection efforts by Citibank .
In July of 2001 , a Citibank employee uncovered the practice and brought it to the attention of his superiors .
The employee was later fired for discussing the credit sweeps with an internal audit team .
In the words of a Citibank executive , Stealing from our customers is a business decision , not a legal decision .
The same executive later said that the sweep program could not be stopped because it would reduce the executive bonus pool , Brown charged .
The attorney general 's office launched its investigation of Citibank in 2005 to determine whether the company violated the California False Claims
Act by filing false holder reports with the California State Controller that omitted any reference to the swept funds .
The 3 - year investigation led to todays settlement .
The settlement includes :
• Permanent injunction Citibank will be permanently prevented from re-initiating the credit sweeps .
• Refunds to victims Citibank will refund all improperly swept funds to customers who were victimized by the sweeps .
Citibank will also pay California customers 10 % interest on the amount taken .
• Penalties Citibank will pay $ 3.5 million in damages and civil penalties to the State of California .
• Compliance audit After Citibanks refund process is complete , an independent auditor will review Citibanks work to ensure that it has lived up to its obligations .
Citibank has affirmed that it can identify most of the victims of the credit sweeps and has begun the process of reviewing archived account data and refunding the improperly swept funds going back to 1992 .
New York Charges
Earlier this month , Citigroup Global Markets , Inc. and Citi Smith Barney have agreed to settle allegations stemming from its marketing and sales of auction rate securities .
The firm marketed and sold auction rate securities as safe , cash - equivalent products , when in fact they faced increasing liquidity risk , a number of states alleged .
New York Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo hailed the agreement as a turning point for investors nationwide seeking relief from the collapse of the auction rate securities market .
" The settlement sends a resounding message to the entire auction rate securities industry : this type of deceptive behavior will not be tolerated and we will actively seek justice on behalf of investors in auction rate securities , " said Cuomo .
" Our goal is simple : to get investors back their money , and that 's exactly what this deal does . "
Under the settlement , Citigroup has agreed to buy back , no later than November 5 , 2008 , all illiquid auction rate securities from all Citigroup retail customers , charities , and small to mid-sized businesses .
These customers , who number approximately 40,000 nationwide , have been unable to sell their securities since February 12 , 2008 .
Their securities are worth more than $ 7 billion .
Citigroup will also :
• fully reimburse all retail investors who sold their auction rate securities at a discount after the market failed ;
• consent to a special , public arbitration process to resolve claims of consequential damages suffered by retail investors as a result of not being able to access their funds ;
• undertake to expeditiously provide liquidity solutions to all other institutional investors ; and
• reimburse all refinancing fees to any New York State municipal issuer who issued auction rate securities through Citigroup since August 1 , 2007 .
In addition , Citigroup will pay a $ 50 million civil penalty to the State of New York .
The penalty embraces both Citigroup 's substantive conduct and its failure to properly comply with its obligations under the Attorney General 's Martin Act subpoena .
Citigroup also will pay a separate civil penalty of $ 50 million to the North American Securities Administrators Association , whose ARS Task Force has been conducting its own series of investigations into the marketing and sale of auction rate securities by broker - dealer firms .
A Look at President Bush 's Private Army The Bush administration has its own private army operating inside Iraq that is not accountable to Congress or the American people ..
By Pat Shannan
One of the most frightening developments in the occupation of Iraq and the so - called “ War on Terror ” is actually something most of the American people have never heard of .
In addition to the 150,000 troops on the ground in Iraq , the Bush administration has deployed a shadow army of some 100,000 contractors .
Of these tens of thousands of heavily armed mercenaries that roam Iraq with impunity , among the most powerful of the companies involved is Blackwater USA , a secretive company headquartered in the wilderness woods of North Carolina .
It is headed by a bankroller of President Bush and his allies , Erik Prince .
Blackwater considers itself the “ Fed Ex ” of the national security apparatus , but the reality is that Blackwater has become a prime player in the War on Terror and is nothing short of the Bush administration ’s Praetorian Guard .
Prince , 39 , became an instant billionaire when his father , Edgar , passed away in 1995 .
He had developed Prince Manufacturing , a leader in automotive innovation over the years , and became best known for his invention and development of the lighted vanity mirror now found behind nearly every sun visor in every American car .
Blackwater USA largely operated in the shadows of the U.S. war machine , until the morning of March 31 , 2004 , when four Blackwater contractors were ambushed and killed in the city of Fallujah , Iraq .
Their bodies were burned and dragged through the streets .
Two of the mercenaries were hung from a bridge over the Euphrates River .
For most people , it was the first that they ever heard of private military contractors operating in Iraq .
That was the day the war turned .
Unlike Somalia , when the Clinton administration pulled out , the Bush Administration initiated a massive revenge attack .
The American army laid siege to the city of Fallujah , killed hundreds of people , displaced tens of thousands of others and in the process enflamed the Iraqi resistance that haunts the American occupation forces to this day .
Unofficial estimates now claim over one million Iraqi civilians have died since the U.S. occupation in 2003 .
The Bush administration came to power with a radical privatization agenda .
“ We see it in our schools , prisons , healthcare systems and law enforcement in the United States , ” says investigative reporter Jeremy Scahill , who has taken on exposing the Blackwater secrets with a vendetta .
“ The occupation of Iraq and the War on Terror have brought the greatest privatization of warfare in modern history . ”
Blackwater USA has become one of the most powerful private actors in the so - called war on terror , and it provides the Bush administration with an extraordinary amount of political cover .
The deaths of Blackwater contractors and other mercenaries are not included in the total death count , even though estimates place it at around 1,000 killed In Iraq .
Their injuries do not get calculated either , and their crimes do not get punished .
“ What we have here is a revolving door ” reports Scahill .
“ Blackwater and other companies benefit the Bush administration , and in turn the Bush administration and its allies in congress protect the shielded military contractors from any effective oversight , any effective accountability , and effective legal system .
The operations are shrouded in secrecy , and people in Congress find it almost impossible to get any information about Blackwater and other companies in operation . ”
Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - Ill . ) expressed her frustration : “ We know virtually nothing about this .
We think that about 40 cents of every dollar goes to private military contractors .
We think about 800 of them have been killed in Iraq , but we do n’t know that , they ’re not even counted .
We think that about 25,000 to 40,000 have been engaged in military activities and combat related activities , but we do n’t know , and we ca n’t find out . ”
Blackwater USA has 2,300 men actively deployed in nine countries around the world .
They have another 20,000 “ contractors ” at the ready .
Scahill says that while Blackwater is operated in Iraq and Afghanistan , it increasingly has its sights set on deployments inside the United States .
It is setting up a new facility in Illinois and another one in California .
BEIJING
To put a smiley face on its image during the Olympics , the Chinese government set aside three “ protest zones ” in Beijing .
Officials explained that so long as protesters obtained approval in advance , demonstrations would be allowed .
So I decided to test the system .
Following government instructions , I showed up at an office of the Beijing Public Security Bureau , found Window 12 and declared to the officer , “ I ’m here to apply to hold a protest . ”
What I did n’t realize is that Public Security has arrested at least a half - dozen people who have shown up to apply for protest permits .
Public Security is pretty shrewd .
In the old days it had to go out and catch protesters in the act .
Now it saves itself the bother : would - be protesters show up at Public Security offices to apply for permits and are promptly detained .
That ’s cost - effective law enforcement for you .
Fortunately , the official at Window 12 did n’t peg me as a counterrevolutionary .
He looked at me worriedly and asked for my passport and other ID papers .
Discovering that I was a journalist , he asked hopefully , “ Would n’t you rather conduct an interview about demonstrations ? ”
In order that applications and operating system shall not drive users insane thou shall :
1. Allow immediate termination
I hit the wrong button .
I changed my mind .
I did n’t know it would take this long .
Either way , the operation needs a cancel button that should take immediate effect and quickly clean up what it can .
If it was copying or uploading a file delete what was done , for database operations rollback the transaction or for formatting a disk leave it half formatted and un -format the first sector but do it FAST .
If you think the consequences are too great ask what effect forceful termination or switching off the power is going to be .
2. Leave start - up alone
I ’ll do that right now , just let me log in … Zzz… Sorry .
It should be done in a minute .
Sigh .
Your app might be the center of your world developing day and night – it ’s not the center of mine .
I might use it for a 7 - 8 hours a day if you ’re lucky .
That does n’t mean I want it starting automatically unasked .
It also does n’t mean you can install services , background tasks or other junk that will prevent me from doing what I need when I ’m in a hurry and running with a low battery .
If you need to check for updates do it silently in background when I launch the app or add something to the Windows scheduler and do n’t create an entire service .
3 . Not modify existing file associations
I tried that last time and it screwed up my associations .
I ’m not going to try the new version no matter what .
I might want all video files to go through your app .
I might not .
Let me make that choice and reverse it .
If I uninstall your program reverse it automatically .
Associating every media file on my system with your app is n’t going to make think wow .
It is n’t going to make the sale or make me believe my system can’t live without your software .
There will be incompatibilities , features you do n’t support or perhaps a clunky UI and and I ’ll uninstall your app to go back to my old favorite .
When all my associations are broken you ca n’t bet I wo n’t be coming back to see what you ’ve done in version 2 .
4 . Not ask inappropriate questions
Do you want to move or copy files from this zone ?
Yes or No .
Zone ?
What ?
Err , copy please .
What do you mean Yes or No ?
I just performed a non-destructive operation and you want me to confirm it ?
Do you want to remember your password ?
An insanely stupid question that appears after a login box does n’t have a password stored , either because :
I do n’t use the feature but ca n’t switch it off ( never ask me again )
I ’m not on my own computer ( shut up for 30 minutes )
I have a new machine and have n’t typed it for months ( ask me in 10 seconds when I find out if it ’s right )
You rarely get useful options but at least Firefox 3 realizes it should ask quietly at the top of the page after you can see if it worked .
5 . Keep noise to a minimum
Windows has installed updates !
AVG Anti-Virus updated successfully .
This is business - as - normal – I DON ’T CARE .
If there is a problem updating let me know – unless it ’s something simple that will go away without my involvement in a day or so like a missing network connection .
People do n’t call or message me day in and out to tell me nothing , neither should my computer .
This also goes for audio notification of trivial activities .
Do n’t annoy people in their offices and homes with stupid noises just because somebody the other side of the world has logged in .
6 . Stay focused on the goal
The instant messaging crown was taken from ICQ because they overloaded the client with games and junk .
People wanted simple messaging but by the time they figured this out with ICQ Lite it was too late .
Real repeated the same blunder where a good video player expanded to consume all available files , starting messaging me and breaking every commandment there is .
Adobe think Acrobat should n’t be a quick useful PDF viewer for pixel - perfect page reproduction but rather a piggyback mechanism for a whole document management system and that nobody minds their web browser locking up for 20 seconds while they load plug - in ’s you wo n’t use .
7 . Make actions obvious and reversible
I do n’t want a dialog box with some sob story about why your app ca n’t do what I just asked or three paragraphs of text I have to scan for negatives , digest and mentally figure out what Yes and No will actually do .
Even worse is prompting a slightly different message with the same Yes and No options sending the user to the button they normally hit for a totally different message with potentially disastrous results .
If Yes is doing to delete the file label the button Delete .
Dialogs in OS X do this and you can answer them lightning fast with accurate results .
Better yet just do it , put some text in the status bar , update the UI and learn how to write an undo mechanism .
8. Avoid restarts
If your application absolutely has to install a service start it yourself .
If common files you are installing might be in use , check them or better yet put them in your own application folder .
9 . Make configurations count
Adding options to your application is only extra choice to a certain point , then it works in reverse as people can’t find the option they are looking for and become bewildered at the choices available before quickly heading to the close button instead .
If you absolutely must have extra options that only a small percentage of the population care about just store it in the configuration system and forget about giving it presence on the user interface .
10 .
Adhere to the platform
Read the user interface guidelines and only deviate when you know better than the expert team behind them .
If you have to explain it then you did n’t know better after all .
If the operating system has conventions for files , configuration and help use them .
Do n’t claim being the same across platforms is more important – people who use more than one platform know and expect them to be different already .
If you want to use an update , notification or other commodity service find what is already popular and a good fit and use that , do n’t develop something different .

If you work in the technology industry it pays to be familiar with the ideas from Geoffrey Moore 's insightful book Crossing the Chasm .
In the book he takes a look at the classic marketing bell curve that segments customers into Early Adopters , Pragmatists , Conservatives and Laggards then points out that there is a large chasm to cross when it comes to becoming popular beyond an initial set of early adopters .
There is a good review of his ideas in Eric Sink 's blog post entitled Act Your Age which is excerpted below
The people in your market segment are divided into four groups : Early Adopters are risk takers who actually like to try new things .
Pragmatists might be willing to use new technology , if it 's the only way to get their problem solved .
Conservatives dislike new technology and try to avoid it .
Laggards pride themselves on the fact that they are the last to try anything new .
This drawing reflects the fact that there is no smooth or logical transition between the Early Adopters and the Pragmatists .
In between the Early Adopters and the Pragmatists there is a chasm .
To successfully sell your product to the Pragmatists , you must " cross the chasm " .
The knowledge that the needs of early adopters and those of the majority of your potential user base differ significantly is extremely important when building and marketing any technology product .
A lot of companies have ended up either building the wrong product or focusing their product too narrowly because they listened too intently to their initial customer base without realizing that they were talking to early adopters .
The fact is that early adopters have different problems and needs from regular users .
This is especially true when you compare the demographics of the Silicon Valley early adopter crowd which " Web 2.0 " startups often try to court with the typical users of social software on the Web .
In the few years I 've been working on building Web applications , I 've seen a number of technology trends and products that have been heralded as the next big thing by technology pundits which actually never broke into the mainstream because they do n't solve the problems of regular Internet users .
Here are some examples
These are just the first three that came to mind .
I 'm sure readers can come up with more examples of their own .
This is n't to say that all hyped " Web 2.0 " sites have n't lived up to their promise .
Flickr is an example of an early adopter hyped site that showed up sprinkled with " Web 2.0 " goodness that has become a major part of the daily lives of tens of millions of people across the Web .
When you look at the list of top 50 sites in the U.S. by unique visitors it is interesting to note what common theme unites the recent " Web 2.0 " entrants into that list .
There are the social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook which harness the natural need of young people to express their individuality yet be part of social cliques .
Then there are the sites which provide lots of flexible options that enable people to share their media with their friends , family or the general public such as Flickr and YouTube .
Both sites also have figured out how to harness the work of the few to entertain and benefit the many as have Wikipedia and Digg as well .
Then there are sites like Fling and AdultFriend Finder which seem to now get more traffic than the personal sites you see advertised on TV for obvious reasons .
However the one overriding theme is that all of these recent entrants is that they solve problems that everyone [ or at least a large section of the populace ] has .
Everyone likes to communicate with their social circle .
Everyone likes watching funny videos and looking at couple pics .
Everyone wants to find information about topics they interested in or find out what 's going on around them .
Everybody wants to get laid .
If you are a Web 2.0 company in today 's Web you really need to ask yourselves , " Are we solving a problem that everybody has or are we building a product for Robert Scoble ? "
Now Playing : Three 6 Mafia - I 'd Rather ( feat .
DJ Unk )
By Imogen Foulkes
BBC News , Bern
The SVP campaign has provoked accusations of racism The Swiss are poised to vote on whether to revive secret ballots to decide on citizenship - an issue that has stirred passions on both sides .
Switzerland 's Supreme Court outlawed the secret ballots five years ago , ruling that they were discriminatory .
But many Swiss say not allowing voters to have the final say violates Switzerland 's system of direct democracy .
Switzerland already has some of the toughest naturalisation laws in the world .
Candidates for citizenship must have lived in the country for at least 12 years - they must prove that they can speak the local language , and that they understand Swiss laws and culture .
What is more , being born in Switzerland does not bring an automatic right to citizenship .
Secret votes
In Switzerland , people wanting to be Swiss must apply through their local community .
In many towns and villages , the final hurdle to citizenship is often the approval of local residents at a town hall meeting , or , in the past , by secret ballot .
I can't understand why I can't be Swiss - Switzerland is my home , I 've lived here all my life
Manuel Dogdu
Failed applicant
Two ethnic Turkish men , Elias Ego and Manuel Dogdu , have long experience of this process .
They have lived all their lives in the central Swiss town of Schwyz , but they have Turkish nationality .
Schwyz , with a population of 14,000 , was one of the towns which used secret ballots to approve new citizens .
" They distributed brochures with our pictures to all the voters , " remembers Elias .
" There was a little CV with information about us , and our nationality . "
" We had passed all the language tests with flying colours , " adds Manuel .
" The authorities recommended us for citizenship . "
Humiliating rejection Manuel and Elias , together with their parents , brothers and sisters , had hoped the ballot would be a formality .
Instead it turned out to be a humiliating public rejection .
" We 've been rejected four times now , " says Manuel .
" I 'm very , very disappointed .
I can't understand why I can't be Swiss - Switzerland is my home , I 've lived here all my life . "
Manuel 's fate is in the hands of the people of Schwyz " We were rejected three times , " adds Elias , who is now 20 .
" I remember , every time , I had to go to school the next day , and everybody knew exactly what had happened .
Some people pointed and laughed .
It was very tough . "
The cases of Elias and Manuel are not unique .
In towns which used the ballot system , candidates from Turkey , the former Yugoslavia and Africa were regularly rejected , despite having satisfied all the requirements for naturalisation , while those from Western Europe were approved .
Court ruling
Five years ago , the Swiss Supreme Court outlawed secret ballots , ruling that they could be discriminatory .
At the same time , the court ruled that those turned down for citizenship had the right to be given reasons for their rejection , and the right to appeal against the decision .
I cannot accept that judges have the right to decide who gets to be a citizen
Luzi Stamm
MP for Swiss People 's Party
The ruling brought a storm of protest .
Switzerland 's tradition of direct democracy generally means the people , the voters , have the final say .
Many see the Supreme Court 's action as an attack on the very foundations of the Swiss democratic system .
" I cannot accept that judges have the right to decide who gets to be a citizen , " says Luzi Stamm , member of parliament for the right - wing Swiss People 's Party ( SVP ) .
" Citizenship is a political question .
The Swiss population , Swiss society should decide - not lawyers and judges . "
The SVP , now the largest party in Switzerland 's parliament , has forced the issue to a nationwide referendum .
On Sunday voters will decide whether to revive secret ballots and remove the right of appeal , thus giving the final say on naturalisation back to the Swiss people .
Ugly campaign
The campaign has been heated .
Normally tranquil Swiss political talk shows have descended into bitter shouting matches .
They just look at our pictures , and our nationality , and for them that 's enough to decide our future
Elias Ego
The SVP 's campaign poster , showing black and brown hands grabbing at Swiss passports , has led many to suspect that the real issue is not who decides on citizenship , but how best to keep certain groups out of Switzerland .
In fact , many in the SVP make no secret of this .
For member of parliament Peter Foehn , discrimination is not a problem , as long as people have the right to vote .
" If our people , our voters , have the feeling we 've had enough from former Yugoslavia , or wherever , the rest will just have to accept it .
The people 's decision is final . "
Still waiting But for Switzerland 's large foreign community - currently 21 % of the total population - it may be hard to accept .
Many , like Elias and Manuel , know no other home .
" I feel Swiss , I was born here , all my friends are here .
For me , this is like my country , my identity , " says Elias .
Elias finally got his Swiss citizenship at the fourth attempt , after 10 years of trying , once secret ballots had been outlawed .
If they were still being used , he believes he would still be waiting - like Manuel .
" I 'm hoping my fifth application will be approved in the spring , " Manuel says .
" But if they say yes to bringing back ballots , I 'll have to go through all that again . "
And for Elias , the whole experience has made him question what Switzerland really means by direct democracy .
" How can they do it ? " he asks .
" They just look at our pictures , and our nationality , and for them that 's enough to decide our future ?
It 's not fair .
We 're living in a democracy , something like that should n't be possible . "

For clues about who might be next to get a show on MSNBC , viewers need not have looked further than “ Countdown ” earlier this month .
For eight nights beginning just before the Fourth of July , Rachel Maddow , the host of a program on Air America , the liberal talk - radio network , served as a substitute for the vacationing Keith Olbermann .
“ At some point , I do n’t know when , she should have a show , ” said Phil Griffin , hours before he was promoted on Wednesday to president of MSNBC .
“ She ’s on the short list .
It ’s a very short list .
She ’s at the top . ”
At the moment every slot at night on MSNBC is taken , with David Gregory at 6 handing off to Chris Matthews at 7 , and with Dan Abrams at 9 following Mr. Olbermann at 8 .
But some shuffling could be in the offing ; Mr. Matthews ’s contract , for example , is up next year .
For her part , Ms. Maddow , who has been a ubiquitous presence as a political analyst on MSNBC this campaign season , said she is ready whenever the call should come .
To hasten that process , she recently hired Mr. Olbermann ’s agent , Jean Sage .
The Qataris also back their diplomacy with some eclectic investments .
Many Americans know about the emir ’s gift of $ 100 million to help Hurricane Katrina victims , but Qatar is also building a $ 1.5 billion oil refinery in Zimbabwe , a huge residential complex in Sudan and a $ 350 million tourist project in Syria .
Some call Qatar ’s policy deranged .
The Qataris prefer to think of it as useful .
Blessed with enormous oil and natural gas reserves , Qatar is surrounded by large and ambitious neighbors : Iran , Iraq and Saudi Arabia .
Diplomacy has become a way for Qatar to protect itself and its riches , by forming alliances and by trying to stabilize the region .
“ The idea is to try to keep everybody happy — or if we can ’t , to keep everybody reasonably unhappy , ” said one former Qatari official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss foreign policy .
“ If that makes the Americans or the Russians a little cross , well , tough luck . ”
It does make them cross .
American officials have been quietly furious about Qatar ’s assistance to Iran and Syria , which includes substantial financial investments as well as votes against sanctions on Iran during Qatar ’s tenure on the United Nations Security Council .
The Americans are also angry about Qatar ’s hefty financial aid to the militant Palestinian group Hamas after it won elections in 2006 .
“ Their relationship with us has been complex , bordering on one of animosity , ” said a high - level State Department official , speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to give offense , adding that Qatar ’s support for Hamas had been a “ very vexatious problem . ”
The Russians have complaints too .
Qatar provided sanctuary to the Chechen rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev until two Russian secret agents killed him in 2004 , detonating a bomb in his car as he left a mosque in Doha .
The agents were captured by Qatari authorities and convicted of murder , but later extradited at Russia ’s request .

The House Judiciary Committee has voted 20 - 14 to approve a contempt of Congress resolution against former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove for his failure to appear after a Congressional subpoena .
Excerpts from the markup memo of the resolution sent to reporters follows .
Rove was overseas at the time of the hearing and alleged that the trip had been planned in advance .

Brendon sez , " With the tabling of Bill C - 61 in the Canadian Parliament , there has been a lack of a concise set of ' talking points ' that summarizes the ramifications of the bill in plain language .
This document attempts to capture such a set of talking points for review by the copyfighter community at large .
Keep in mind that this document must provide a rational argument against C - 61 , as a fact - based , non-emotional debate is key to our success in defeating C - 61 . "
This bill is bad for Canadians for a number of reasons :
1 . It reduces your rights : Consumers will continue to be able to use copyrighted materials for research , private study , criticism , review or news reporting , but will no longer have the means to exercise those rights when the copyrighted materials are protected by DRM .
2 . It reduces reduces the usefulness of your media : Consumers will no longer have the right to take commonly purchased physical media , such as DVDs , or downloaded DRM - protected files , such as digital music , and make copies for their personal use .
3 . It forces you to buy media you 've already purchased : Consumers will be unable to unlock media they 've legally purchased in the past for use on new devices , and hence will be forced to buy the same content again and again .
4 . It makes your devices less useful : Consumers will be able to do less , not more , with new devices they purchase , as many of these devices may , at any time , limit the user 's access to media they have a legal right to view , modify , or redistribute .
5 . It reduces competition and innovation : Consumers will be unable to influence the market by finding new uses for their existing media and copyrighted materials , limiting the application of ingenuity that can lead to the creation of new applications and markets for Canadians and the world .
6 . It makes public domain works inaccessible : Consumers will have the right to re-use works in the public domain , but in cases where those public domain works are protected by DRM , consumers will not have the means to exercise those rights and hence will lose access to their own heritage .
( Newser ) – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lashed out at President Bush in unusually personal terms today , calling him a " total failure " as president .
" You know , God bless him , bless his heart , president of the United States , a total failure , losing all credibility with the American people on the economy , on the war , on energy , you name the subject , " the California Democrat said on CNN .
Pelosi's outburst came in response to Bush 's criticism of Congress for heading into its final 26 days without having passed one government spending bill .
Said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino :
" What the president said is a fact — this is the longest a Congress has gone in 20 years without passing a single spending bill , so it 's clear that the speaker is feeling some frustration at their inability to do so . "

Video shows police punching teen 13 times in face , then tasering him
GREENVILLE COUNTY , S.C. --
An 18 - year - old was punched in the face 13 times by a deputy police officer , whose dashboard video camera caught the incident on tape , WYFF Channel 4 News reported .
The video shows undercover Deputy Brian Tollison pulling over a truck driven by a drug suspect and beating the teenage driver while what appears to be a back - up deputy held down him down .
Once back - up deputies arrived , 18 - year - old Jeremy Rucker was pulled out of the truck and tasered and kicked while lying prone on the ground .
Sheriff Steve Loftis fired Tollison , who also faces criminal charges for the incident , which took place May 15 .
" The fact that Deputy Tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive , " Loftis said .
The other deputies involved have not been charged .
The Greenville County Sheriff 's Department said that Rucker had fled from police and resisted arrest , but had " calmed down " when Tollison started hitting him .
Rucker 's attorney , Karl Allen , said his client was sitting in his truck talking on his phone when the undercover deputies approached him .
" Then they have the audacity , to treat this man as if he 's a piece of meat and Taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then , that 's not enough , " Allen said .
" They kick three times to the torso . "
Police charged Rucker with drug possession and resisting arrest , though drugs were not found on him until he was taken into custody .
Rucker 's beating is one of several recent examples of police brutality .
Police tasered an injured teen from Ozark , Missouri up to 19 times after he fell from a highway overpass in late July .
The 16 - year - old had broken his back and heel when the officers began tasering him .
In another bizarre instance of police violence , a 66 - year - old minister was tasered and beaten by hospital security guards for what he claims was a joke .
In that incident , hospital security cameras caught five officers kicking Rev. Al Poisson on the ground for at least five minutes .

( Natural News ) The American Association for Cancer Research ( AACR ) has announced the launch of the world 's first peer - reviewed scientific journal dedicated solely to the topic of cancer prevention .
is already accepting submissions for online publication starting in March , with regular monthly print issues to begin circulating in June .
The AACR is both the oldest and largest cancer research organization in the world .
In addition to the new , the association also publishes five other peer - reviewed journals : ; and .
The association also publishes , a magazine where cancer patients , survivors , and their physicians , families and friends can share information on cancer research and advocacy .
In addition to disseminating research through its journal , the AACR also hosts an annual conference on Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research .
At the most recent conference in Philadelphia , researchers prevented groundbreaking studies into the cancer - preventive effects of green tea , berry and olive leaf extracts .
With the new journal , the AACR hopes to unify many different kinds of cancer prevention research into one publication .
"
In the past , scientists and interested readers have had to parse cancer prevention articles from many other journals , unable to find the full range of prevention research and opinion in one resource , " said Scott M. Lippman , editor in chief of the new journal .
" The richness and scope of our field now parallel those of mainstream oncology and require this new , centralized home for the wide - ranging literature that supports prevention discovery .
" The journal will publish articles in four main categories .
Oncogenesis studies will examine the development of cancer on a cellular level ; intervention studies will examine both natural and pharmaceutical methods of preventing the development of cancer ; while risk assessment and early detection articles will report on research to help in identifying at - risk populations for targeted cancer prevention
NanoViricides , Inc. said that additional biological tests and data analysis have shown that animals treated with its lead anti-HIV drug candidate , HIVCide - I , demonstrated a substantially greater reduction in viral load -- number of infectious virus particles per milliliter of blood -- when compared to the animals given the anti-HIV " combo cocktail " in a preliminary animal study .
An important objective of anti-HIV treatment is to minimize the viral load .
These new data expand on the findings previously reported and are consistent with earlier results .
The Company has previously reported that HIVCide - I was substantially superior to the combo therapy in improvement of survival time , as well as in reducing the body weight loss , in this preliminary animal study .
" We now know that HIVCide - I was clearly superior to the triple drug combo cocktail in all parameters we observed , " said Anil R. Diwan , PhD , President of the Company , adding , " The novel mechanism of action of HIVCide - I defines a new class of anti-HIV drugs .
This enables that it can be combined with the existing cocktail .
In such a combination , a much greater level of effectiveness could be achieved compared to what is possible today . "
" If our preliminary results can be duplicated in humans , it is quite possible that HIVCide - I , either alone or in combination with the current combo cocktail , may provide a ' functional cure ' for HIV / AIDS , " said Eugene Seymour , MD , MPH , CEO of the Company .
Anthony S. Fauci , MD , Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , NIH , recently described " functional cure " as a state short of true HIV cure that allows a patient to live a life practically free of HIV following prolonged treatment , although the infection may still be present in a latent fashion .
True cure ( complete freedom from HIV ) may be much more difficult to achieve than functional cure because the virus hides in immune cells that make up " latent reservoirs " ( http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/08/05/ fauci.hiv.column/index.html ) .
The Company is now in discussions with renowned HIV scientists as to the nature of the additional experiments needed to develop the nanoviricide drug candidate for FDA approval .
These Bio-Safety Level 3 studies employing the well known SCID - hu Thy / Liv HIV mouse model were supervised by Dr. Krishna Menon , PhD , VMD , MRCS , a world - renowned authority in preclinical and toxicological studies of innovative therapeutics .
Mood of panic as eyewitnesses say ceasefire being broken by Russian military and ' irregulars '
This article is more than 12 years old
This article is more than 12 years old
Villages in Georgia were being burned and looted as Russian tanks and soldiers followed by " irregulars " advanced from the breakaway province of South Ossetia , eyewitnesses said today .
" People are fleeing , there is a mood of absolute panic .
The idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous , " Luke Harding , the Guardian 's correspondent , said .
Earlier , witnesses reported a military convoy heading towards the Georgian capital Tbilisi , but it later turned off the road and headed back towards South Ossetia .
Russia denied any advance .
Harding , watching villages near Gori burn , said witnesses had told him Russian military , including at least 25 tanks , had moved from the Russian - controlled South Ossetia into the villages .
" They asked villagers to hang white flags or handkerchiefs outside their houses if they did not want to be shot , they say . "
The tanks had passed through the village of Rekha at about 11.20 am local time .
" Behind them ( say eyewitnesses ) is a whole column of irregulars who locals say are Chechens , Cossacks and Ossetians .
" Eyewitnesses say they are looting , killing and burning .
These irregulars have killed three people and set fire to villages .
They have been taking away young boys and girls , " said Harding , watching smoke rise from another village , Karaleti .
He said he had witnessed people fleeing in the direction of Tbilisi .
" For three hours there were people fleeing in cars , I saw one with 11 people and a Lada with eight people in it . "
He had also seen people fleeing on a horse and cart and a tractor .
Eyewitness claims could not be immediately verified .
It appeared that Russian tanks had entered Gori , targeting military installations , some built with Nato money .
The ministry of foreign affairs in Georgia claimed four civilian cars with murdered passengers " were reported to have been seen in the village of Tedotsminda near Gori . "
US President George Bush today announced he was sending the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , to Tbilisi to convey Washington 's " unwavering support for Georgia 's democratically elected government " .
He called on Russia to end all military activities and withdraw from Georgia .
Bush said he was also sending US military aircraft to the region with humanitarian and medical supplies and hoped Russia would allow supplies to reach those who needed them .
" Russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , " he added .
Russia 's deputy chief of general staff , Colonel - General Anatoly Nogovitisyn , said earlier today that no tanks were in Gori .
He claimed Russians went into the town to implement the truce with local officials but could find none .
A reporter from the Associated Press also said fighters from the other separatist region of Abkhazia had moved into Georgian territory , planting their flag on a bridge over the Inguri river and saying they were laying claim to what had historically been Abkhazian territory .
Earlier , Georgia said its troops had pulled out of Abkhazia after the Kremlin had laid down humiliating peace terms as the price for halting the Russian invasion and its four - day rout of Georgian forces .
The ceasefire required both sides to return to positions they held before the conflict started in South Ossetia last week .
The key demands are that the Georgian leader pledges to abjure all use of force to resolve Georgia 's territorial disputes with the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia ; and that Georgian forces withdraw entirely from South Ossetia and are no longer part of the joint " peacekeeping " contingent there with Russian and local forces .
The Russian president , Dimitry Medvedev , also insisted the populations of the two regions had to be allowed to vote on whether they wanted to join Russia , prefiguring a possible annexation that would enfeeble Georgia and leave its leader , Mikheil Saakashvili , looking crushed .
Russian leaders claimed Georgian forces perpetrated atrocities against civilians when Saakashvili gave the go - ahead last week for the bungled attempt to recapture South Ossetia .
The gamble triggered the onslaught which the US state department yesterday described as " plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of Russia " .
Georgian forces have been part of the peacekeeping force in South Ossetia for the past 15 years .
But Russian leaders declared yesterday the Georgians would not return , and South Ossetia would be under Russian control .
" They shot their brother Russian peacekeepers , then they finished them off with bayonets , so we are not going to see them there any more , " said Dmitri Rogozin , the Russian ambassador to Nato in Brussels .
While Nato leaders in Brussels stressed that South Ossetia and Abkhazia were part of Georgia , Medvedev encouraged the secession of the two breakaway regions .
" Ossetians and Abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account , including what happened in the past few days , " he said .
Western officials at Nato , in the EU , in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , and in Washington , while calling for an immediate ceasefire , also demanded that Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity be upheld .
Following a meeting of Nato states yesterday , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , Nato 's secretary general , accused Russia of not respecting Georgia 's territorial integrity .
" Abkhazia and Ossetia , if I mention territorial integrity , are to the best of my knowledge part of Georgia . "
He added that " Nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict " .

The cleanliness of most NHS hospitals in England is threatened by frequent invasions of rats , fleas , bedbugs , flies and cockroaches , a report claims .
Figures released by the Conservatives show that 70 % of NHS Trusts brought in pest controllers at least 50 times between January 2006 and March 2008 .
Vermin were found in wards , clinics and even operating theatres .
A patients ' group said the situation was revolting .
But health chiefs played down fears the infestations could lead to disease .
The figures were obtained by the Conservatives under the Freedom of Information Act , with every hospital asked to reveal how often pest controllers had visited over the two - year period in question .
If these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business
Patients Association
Of those that replied , Nottingham University Hospitals NHS
Trust topped the table , with more than 1,000 incidents , and five other trusts passed the 800 mark .
All the respondents had reported some pest problem in the two - year period .
Nottingham University Hospitals NHS
Trust said that , as the fourth largest in England , it was likely to encounter more pest control problems , and might be recording incidents differently to other trusts .
While most infestations involved non-clinical areas , some trusts reported problems nearer to patients .
VERMIN IN HOSPITALS
Maggots in a patient 's slippers Fleas in a neo-natal unit Sterile store infested with mice Mouse droppings in a clinic Wasps ' nest in A&E
Your stories
One had wasps in a neo-natal unit , and flying ants on the main wards , while another reported rats in their maternity unit , and wasps in operating theatres .
A children 's A&E was infested with flies , and main wards were also home to mice , silverfish , biting insects and beetles .
Other common problems included bedbugs , fleas and cockroaches .
Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said : " Labour have said over and over that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals , but these figures clearly show that they are failing . "
Both the Department of Health and the Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) were sceptical of suggestions by the Conservatives that the presence of insect infestations could help spread infections among patients .
MOST PEST CONTROL VISITS Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust : 1,070 Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust : 898 Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust : 857 Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust : 855 Guy 's and St Thomas ' NHS Foundation Trust : 813 Barts and the London NHS Trust : 801 York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust : 690 Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust : 658 Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust : 450 East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust : 416 Source : Figures obtained by the Conservatives for January 2006 to March 2008
Full list of hospitals with problems A spokesman for the HPA said : " In countries with good standards of healthcare , the possibility for insects or pests to transmit infections in hospitals would be very remote .
" In the UK , wounds are treated appropriately and dressings applied to ensure good hygiene and prevent infection . "
Ivan Lewis , the health minister , said the Conservatives had exaggerated the problem , and " talked down " the NHS in order to score a political point .
However , a spokesman from the Patients Association was unconvinced , saying : " Such findings are truly revolting .
" How can patients be safe amid bedbugs , fleas and rats ?
These findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent .
" If these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business . "
The responsibility for monitoring hygiene in the NHS falls to the Healthcare Commission , and the expert leading its healthcare infection programme , Christine Braithwaite , said that it had received " negligible " numbers of reports about the threat posed by vermin .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme " Clearly , it may be necessary to take action against pests in these large public buildings from time to time .
" However , it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems . "
The Commission also said it would use the information to inform its hospital hygiene inspection programme .
Health Minister Ivan Lewis said that hospitals were responsible for ensuring their buildings were clean and that patient safety was not compromised .
" The Hygiene Code requires NHS bodies to have a pest control policy that anticipates and manages this issue .
" Trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards .
" Use of pest control is a sign of good proactive management . "
Bromley Hospitals NHS
Trust , one of the trusts which brought in pest controllers more than 50 times , accused the Conservatives of producing a misleading report .
A spokesperson said routine visits by pest controllers to prevent infestations was good practice .

The FDA has approved a new pseudoephedrine - containing product , Zyrtec D , for over - the - counter sale to people over the age of 11 .
" The approval of this widely used drug for nonprescription use will enable many people to have access to another effective treatment for their allergy symptoms , " said Dr. Andrea Leonard - Segal , director of the agency 's Division of Nonprescription Clinical Evaluation .
Zyrtec -D consists of 5 milligrams of cetirizine HCl , an antihistamine , and 120 milligrams of the decongestant pseudoephedrine .
It is indicated for the treatment of upper respiratory allergies such as watery eyes , runny nose , sneezing , nasal congestion , or itching of the eyes , nose or throat .
It reduces nasal swelling and relieves sinus congestion and pressure .
The drug was first approved for prescription use in 2001 .
Common side - effects include drowsiness , dry mouth and fatigue .
Pseudoephedrine is one of the two active ingredients , along with ephedrine ( in the plant Ephedra sinica and other plants in the Ephedra genus ) .
E. sinica has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for 5,000 years to relieve and treat allergies , asthma and colds .
Citing safety concerns and a high rate of serious side effects including death , however , the FDA banned the use of ephedra in dietary supplements in 2004 .
" These products pose unacceptable health risks , and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately , " then - Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson said .
Due to the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic
Act , a new law meant to regulate the manufacture of illegal methamphetamines using pseudoephedrine as a base , Zyrtec - D will be kept behind drug - store counters .
While no prescription is required , customers wishing to purchase the drug will have to show identification before a store employee hands them the medication .
The same rules apply to other products containing pseudoephedrine .
" This double standard in chemical safety is typical of the pro-pharma FDA , " explained consumer health advocate Mike Adams .
" According to the FDA , all drugs are assumed safe until proven dangerous , but all herbs are assumed dangerous unless proven safe .
This approach to consumer safety is backwards , " Adams said .
" It is the highly - concentrated drugs that pose the real danger to consumers .
The plant compounds used in Chinese Medicine are remarkably safe and have been used for literally thousands of years in the safe and effective treatment of numerous health conditions .
" Zyrtec - D is distributed by McNeil Consumer Healthcare , which also markets Tylenol and Motrin IB .
U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) has introduced a Bill to the Senate that would help homeowners to slash the cost of installing solar panels .
The 10 Million Solar Roofs
Act of 2008 will offer rebates for up to half the cost of installing solar photovoltaic systems , and run for ten years .
A wide range of people and organizations , including homeowners , businesses , non-profit organizations , state and local governments will be eligible to apply .
The Bill will be formally introduced when the Senate reconvenes on Monday following the 4th July recess .
Co-sponsors come from across the political spectrum , including Senators John Kerry ( D - MA ) , Ben Cardon ( D - MD ) , Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , John Warner ( R - VA ) , and Robert Menendez ( D - NJ ) .
The proposal looks very similar to an initiative launched in San Francisco late last month that will provide rebates of $ 3,000 to $ 6,000 in the largest city - wide solar promotion scheme in the U.S .
>>
Want cheap solar ?
Join the most effective community solar purchasing program in the US .
The past few weeks have been quite tumultuous for the solar energy industry .
Firstly , the Senate voted to block progress on a bill designed to introduce $ 17.7 billion of tax breaks for the renewables industry .
Shortly afterwards , to howls of protest from solar energy industry , the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) introduced a twenty two month moratorium on new solar projects on public land , in order to properly assess their environmental credentials .
A few days later , they decided to reverse the decision .
Last week also brought news of the introduction of a Democrat - backed Bill to introduce a national feed - in tariff for renewable energy projects .
Phew !
things are moving on rapidly in the world of solar – I wonder what next week will bring ?

Too big to fail : the Bagehot rule
It has long been a poorly hidden secret that large banks cannot be left to go bankrupt .
Walter Bagehot , a 19th century economist and editor of The Economist , designed the solution that remains as relevant today as it was then .
The Bagehot rule is that the central bank ought to lend freely to a failing bank , against high - quality collateral and at a punitive rate ( see Xavier Vives ’ Vox column ) .
The modern version of the rule adds that shareholders ought to bear serious costs and the managers ought to be promptly replaced .
This is exactly what happened with Bear Stearns last March , where another bank , JP Morgan , was used as the conduit for the operation .
The cost to the taxpayers was a $ 1 billion guarantee and a $ 29 billion loan to JP Morgan guaranteed by Bear Stearns assets .
We do n’t yet know if this was a taxpayer - financed bailout .
If JP Morgan redresses the situation within ten years , the taxpayers will make a profit .
If not , US taxpayers will have borne the burden .
Bear Stearns shareholders were almost completely expropriated .
As the US economy keeps limping and the housing market deteriorates , most observers believe that there will be many more bank failures .
Indeed , in early July , a large Californian mortgage lender , IndyMac , went belly up and was also subjected to Bagehot ’s recipe .
The possibility that some very large financial institutions , and many smaller ones , will follow provides urgency for the current debate .
The Larry Summers school of thought :
Do n’t scare off the investors
One school of thought – let ’s call it , fairly I think , the Larry Summers School – is that the Fed has been far too tough with Bear Stearns .
It has scared investors and managers alike .
The result is that investors are now unwilling to provide much needed cash to banks that must rebuild their badly depleted balance sheets while bank managers strenuously resist acknowledging their losses and continue selling their toxic assets .
As a result , the whole banking system is in a state of virtual paralysis , which means that borrowing is both difficult and costly .
Lowering the interest rate , as the Fed vigorously did , does not even begin to redress the situation .
This all leads to a vicious circle where insufficient credit drags the economy down , which leads to more loan delinquencies , which further impair banks ability to lend .
Memories of 1929 immediately come to mind , when the Fed made matters considerably worse by clinging to financial orthodoxy .
This school of thought fears that the same fascination with high - minded principles turns a bad crisis into another nightmare of historical proportions .
The Larry Summers School wants the Fed to lend freely and more generously with the goal being to reassure potential investors .
If that is done , so goes the argument , banks will be able to rebuild their balance sheets and resume their normal activities .
This would signal the end of the now 1one - year old financial crisis as a virtuous circle unfolds – more loans , a resumption of growth and the end of the housing market decline , healthier banks , and more loans .
The Willem Buiter school of thought :
They ran into a wall with eyes wide - open
The other school of thought – let ’s call it , a bit unfairly , the Willem Buiter School – sees things in the exact opposite way .
The crisis is the result of financial follies by financial institutions that bought huge amounts of products that they did not understand – the infamous mortgage - backed securities and their derivatives – parked them off - balance - sheet to avoid regulation , and made huge profits in doing so .
In short , they ran into a wall with wide - open eyes .
Once the all - too - well foreseen crisis erupted , these institutions kept hiding the extent of their losses as long as they could – they are still playing that game – and started to lobby for a bailout from their governments .
The classic credit cycle : Look who ’s crying now
This school notes that the crisis is part of a classic credit cycle that involves excessive risk - taking in good times and ends up in tears .
The question is : whose tears ?
The challenge is to ensure that these are not the taxpayers ’ tears .
Indeed banks are in a unique position .
They used to call for a bailout to protect their depositors , but deposits are now insured in all developed countries .
Still , because bank credit is the bloodline of the economy , we can not let our banking system sink .
But once banks know that they can play the high - risk , high - return game , pocket the profits , and let taxpayers face the risks , bailouts provide a temporary relief but set the ground for the next crisis .
Wilder and wilder parties
Bank of England Governor Mervyn King nicely sums up the situation : “ ' If banks feel they must keep on dancing while the music is playing and that at the end of the party the central bank will make sure everyone gets home safely , then over time , the parties will become wilder and wilder . ”
Bagehot principles can be applied when one or two banks fail , but when the whole system is under threat , this is no longer an option .
Which school is winning with policy makers ?
Both schools have developed consistent views .
The dismaying part of the story is that they lead to radically different policy implications .
So far , the monetary authorities have been closer to the Willem Buiter School view , but things may be changing .
The most recent bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is clearly a soft rescue operation , with no set limits and , so far at least , no penalty on shareholders and managers .
Even though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are very special institutions with a federal mandate , the Larry Summers School is right to see some glimmers of hope and therefore must be taken seriously .
In most respects , we have gone through a very classic credit boom - and bust cycle .
Two cases from the 1990s are worth pondering .
Following years of fast bank credit growth accompanied , as should be , by housing price bubbles , bank crises started in 1990 in both Japan and Sweden .
The Swedish authorities reacted swiftly , bailing out most banks at a cost to taxpayers estimated at some 4 % of GDP , but shareholders were essentially expropriated .
The Japanese authorities protected their banks with generous loans , even as some banks were serving dividend payments to their shareholders .
Sweden recovered in three years and , nowadays , Swedish banks are not found among those that indulged in mortgage - backed securities .
Japan has still not recovered from a nearly twenty - year long “ lost decade ” and , nowadays , several Japanese banks have already failed under the weight of the toxic assets that they acquired , once again .

Conclusions
Of course , there is more to it than this simple comparison , including the accompanying macroeconomic policies .
But three unmistakable messages emerge .
1 ) Be merciless with shareholders and gentle to bank customers .
2 ) Either way , taxpayers are always the losers .
3 ) Bagehot had it all right .

A team of experts from Korea and Italy came together to perform a new type of transplant surgery on a young girl with a hearing impairments .
The method they used involves a computer chip and an artificial network .
Lee Jeewon explains .
This five - year - old has been unable to hear sounds since she was born .
Her brain functions normally but what 's been damaged is the nerve that transmits sound signals from her ear to a part of her brain called the aural centrum .
Now a team of Korean and Italian researchers have come to her rescue to restore that link .
The Yonsei University College of Medicine and Italian experts have transplanted a computer chip and an artificial neural network into the girl 's brain .
The electronic nerve transforms sound into digital signals , which are transmitted to the brain stem and processed by the aural centrum .
Following the transplant doctors say they 've begun detecting in the child , the signature brainwaves of sound perception .
The Yonsei medical team is hopeful that the girl 's condition will improve allowing her not only to hear but to speak as well .
The doctor who led the operation says : [ INTERVIEW : ]
'' About half of what she hears has been transmitted to the brain .
We anticipate the transmission to improve further .
'' The treatment is applicable to most hearing - impaired people with the exception of those who 've suffered brain damage .

Petit bilan d'activité avec les triodes fabriquées
L'auteur
Claude Paillard commence comme beaucoup dans les années 50 , par la télécommande de modèles réduits .
La mécanique étant l'un de ses violons d'Ingres favoris , il met un point d'honneur à construire le moteur qui équipera le bateau .
En 1959 il devient F2FO et passe l'examen sur un émetteur - récepteur AM 5 bandes de sa fabrication .
Le DXCC est vite bouclé bien que le trafic ne soit pas sa " tasse de thé " et ne serve la plupart du temps qu'à valider une réalisation personnelle .
Il s'en donne donc à coeur joie avec la BLU qui s'installe petit à petit sur les bandes amateurs .
Puis vient une période RTTY , sur des machines reconditionnées .
Son premier article pour Radio - REF ( en 1959 ) est un BFO pour les " command set " BC453 qui retiennent l'attention pour leur remarquable sélectivité .
Il devient le rédacteur des " Analyses de revues " , chronique qu'il tiendra plusieurs années .
Il sera également membre du conseil d'administration du REF durant 3 ans .
Il publie , entre autres , un amplificateur linéaire équipé de 811 , un dispositif oscillographique permettant le contrôle permanent de la qualité de modulation mais aussi de la pureté du signal émis , une caméra TV équipée de circuits intégrés et plusieurs équipements BLU dont un transceiver transistorisé qui sera largement utilisé en mobile .
C'est ensuite la réalisation d'une station 2300 MHz puis d'un équipement 10 GHz dont les descriptions paraissent dans Radio - REF .
Ces deux réalisations sont couronnées sur le terrain par des " premières France - Angleterre " en 1968 et 1969 .
Un superbe QSO " cross- band " 2,3 - 10 GHz sur une distance de 40 km reste encore dans le souvenir des sacrés bons moments des signataires !
Amoureux et respectueux des vieux et vénérables composants , il fait revivre des tubes de réception des années 20 en les faisant émettre 3 watts dans la bande 80 m en télégraphie .
Des QSO dans toute l'Europe seront réalisés ...
Voir chapitre Emetteur QRP .
Sa vénération pour les équipements de Monsieur Arthur Collins , le conduit à restaurer un certain nombre d'émetteurs - récepteurs Collins , et en particulier le 618 - T .
Et puis , est-ce pour participer à sa façon au centenaire de l'invention de la triode par Lee De Forest en 1906 , il se lance dans la fabrication de la mythique TM mise au point par le Général Ferrié en 1915 .
Faire une lampe , ce n'est pas si facile , mais pour corser un peu la difficulté , F2FO va construire tout le nécessaire à ce projet , et en particulier diverses pompes , dont une moléculaire , afin d'obtenir un vide permettant l'emploi en émission des tubes réalisés .
Une dizaine de lampes vont ainsi voir le jour ...
Pour vérifier les mesures , un QSO sera réalisé le 1er janvier 2005 sur 80 m en CW entre Montrouge / 92 et Camaret / 29 .
Les tubes sont robustes et feront d'autres contacts ...
Le but initial , qui était de traverser l'Atlantique , a été atteint par F6BWO qui a réalisé de nombreux QSO sur 4 continents .

Bush classifies $ 200 million cybersecurity program , redacts questions about contractors John Byrne
Published : Friday August 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Redacts answers to Congress ' questions about contractors As Americans focus on the Olympics and the 2008 presidential campaign , the Bush Administration is finalizing plans to establish yet another massive surveillance program -- and has classified almost every single detail .
The Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative , established by National Security Presidential Directive 54 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 in January , is intended to improve the government 's ability to defend against cybersecurity attacks .
But the Bush Administration has refused to release details on the program 's budget , how contracts will be administered , or what contractors might be involved .
A whopping $ 115 million was allocated for the program this year , without any disclosure of progress or accomplishment .
Earlier this week , the Senate Homeland Security Committee released vague details about the program , after receiving some documentation from the Administration following a hearing in March .
But the Administration 's response redacted information regarding the contractors involved -- despite a history of giving away massive no -bid Iraq reconstruction contractors to companies such as Halliburton , Vice President Cheney 's former firm .
 The response includes information on the National Cyber Security Center , how privacy will be protected under the CNCI , how success of the initiative will be measured , and how the Department views the private sectors role in the initiative ,  wrote the committee 's Sen.
Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) and Sen. Susan Collins ( R - ME ) .
 The Department chose to redact information relating to contracting at the National Cyber Security Division .
The senators have asked DHS explain their reasons for the redactions .
Among the redacted questions : " Why was the determination made that the contract will be for a 10 - month period ? " and " How will the DHS provide appropriate oversight to ensure that the contractors support efforts do not intrude on inherently governmental functions ? "
According to CNET 's Stephanie Condon , the Administration wo n't even related how the program 's " mission relates to Internet surveillance . "
In one of the few details actually known about the program , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff announced that it would be led by Internet entrepreneur Rod Beckström in March .
According to The Washington Post , however , Beckström is not a cybersecurity expert .
His background is in open source wikis and in risk management software .
The announcement was dubbed a faux pas by Sen.
Collins , who said in a letter that she was under the impression that the entire National Cyber Security Center was classified .
" Prior to this announcement , committee staff had been instructed that the existence of the NCSC was itself classified , " Collins wrote .
" Their letter to DHS in May asked for a detailed account of the department 's role in the Comprehensive National Cyber Security Initiative , noting a lack of information from the department , in spite of the fact that the administration had claimed that cybersecurity was one of Chertoff 's ' top four priorities for ' 08 , ' " Condon notes .
Chertoff has requested $ 83 million for the center for 2009 on top of the $ 115 awarded for 2008 , pushing the entire budget for cybersecurity over $ 200 million .
Even the Wall Street Journal , generally a fan of privatized government , has questioned the program .
" Rod Beckstrom , the director of the national cyber security center in DHS , continued the pattern [ of providing few details ] during his keynote at the Black Hat security conference Thursday in Las Vegas , " the Journal 's Ben Worthen wrote Thursday .
" Instead of getting into specifics both examples of real threats and what the government is trying to do about it he mainly talked in general terms about how businesses need to understand better the economics of security and the need to improve collaboration between people and governments throughout the world .
He also talked at length about Abraham Lincoln and George Washington , and how those two would have approached tech security . "
" Beckstrom started in March , so hes still pretty new .
Plus , this administration has gone through cyber chiefs like Spinal Tap goes through drummers , " Worthen added .
" So we should cut him a little slack .
Still , we couldnt help but feel disappointed by what we consider another missed opportunity . "
According to reports , the cybersecurity initiative is aimed at securing the government 's cybernetworks across multiple federal agencies .

Jukebox John changes his tune every few minutes
Update :
This post has been updated and expanded .
Atrios mentioned yesterday , “ … I do n’t think the ‘ Obama is a flip - flopper ’ will be an especially useful line of attack for the McCain campaign , but it makes sense that they ’re using it .
The script is already written , making it easier for the barely literate cable newsers to run with it . ”
Quite right .
At first blush , the line of attack against Obama seems utterly ridiculous , but the McCain campaign seems to have settled on it anyway , in part because it ’s the closest available , already - written Republican narrative , and in part because McCain staffers have n’t been able to think of anything else .
The irony , of course , is that the McCain campaign could n’t have picked a more hypocritical line of attack .
For John McCain to accuse anyone of excessively changing policy positions is a bit like George W. Bush attacking someone ’s grammar .
Or Dick Cheney whining about a political figure being overly secretive .
But if this is the game the McCain campaign wants to play , so be it .
Let ’s play .
As the self - designated keeper of the Official List of McCain Flip - Flops , I ’m pleased to report , thanks to reader contributions , we now have a whopping 61 policy reversals from the Republican nominee .
If McCain wants to argue that flip - flops are an example of a political leader who ca n’t be trusted to keep his word or honor his commitments , McCain might as well drop out of the race now .
Based on some reader suggestions , we ’re going to do things a little differently this time .
Now , I ’ve numbered the list and organized it by category for easier reference .
Remember , just two weeks ago , John McCain said , “ This election is about trust and trusting people ’s word . ”
Just a few days prior , the McCain campaign admonished Barack Obama for trying to “ have it both ways ” on issues .
And with that in mind …
National Security Policy
1. McCain thought Bush ’s warrantless - wiretap program circumvented the law ; now he believes the opposite .
2. McCain insisted that everyone , even “ terrible killers , ” “ the worst kind of scum of humanity , ” and detainees at Guantanamo Bay , “ deserve to have some adjudication of their cases , ” even if that means “ releasing some of them . ”
McCain now believes the opposite .
3 . He opposed indefinite detention of terrorist suspects .
When the Supreme Court reached the same conclusion , he called it “ one of the worst decisions in the history of this country . ”
4 . In February 2008 , McCain reversed course on prohibiting waterboarding .
5. McCain was for closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay before he was against it .
6 . When Barack Obama talked about going after terrorists in Pakistani mountains with predators , McCain criticized him for it .
He ’s since come to the opposite conclusion .
Foreign Policy
7. McCain was for kicking Russia out of the G8 before he was against it .
8. McCain supported moving “ towards normalization of relations ” with Cuba .
Now he believes the opposite .
9. McCain believed the U.S. should engage in diplomacy with Hamas .
Now he believes the opposite .
10 . McCain believed the U.S. should engage in diplomacy with Syria .
Now he believes the opposite .
11 . McCain is both for and against a “ rogue state rollback ” as a focus of his foreign policy vision .
12 . McCain used to champion the Law of the Sea convention , even volunteering to testify on the treaty ’s behalf before a Senate committee .
Now he opposes it .
13 . McCain was against divestment from South Africa before he was for it .
Military Policy
14 . McCain recently claimed that he was the “ greatest critic ” of Rumsfeld ’s failed Iraq policy .
In December 2003 , McCain praised the same strategy as “ a mission accomplished . ”
In March 2004 , he said , “ I ’m confident we ’re on the right course . ”
In December 2005 , he said , “ Overall , I think a year from now , we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course . ”
15 . McCain has changed his mind about a long - term U.S. military presence in Iraq on multiple occasions , concluding , on multiple occasions , that a Korea - like presence is both a good and a bad idea .
16 . McCain said before the war in Iraq , “ We will win this conflict .
We will win it easily . ”
Four years later , McCain said he knew all along that the war in Iraq war was “ probably going to be long and hard and tough . ”
17 . McCain has repeatedly said it ’s a dangerous mistake to tell the “ enemy ” when U.S. troops would be out of Iraq .
In May , McCain announced that most American troops would be home from Iraq by 2013 .
18 . McCain was against expanding the GI Bill before he was for it .
Domestic Policy
19 . McCain defended “ privatizing ” Social Security .
Now he says he ’s against privatization ( though he actually still supports it . )
20 . McCain wanted to change the Republican Party platform to protect abortion rights in cases of rape and incest .
Now he does n’t .
21 . McCain supported storing spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada .
Now he believes the opposite .
22 . He argued the NRA should not have a role in the Republican Party ’s policy making .
Now he believes the opposite .
23 .
In 1998 , he championed raising cigarette taxes to fund programs to cut underage smoking , insisting that it would prevent illnesses and provide resources for public health programs .
Now , McCain opposes a $ 0.61 - per - pack tax increase , wo n’t commit to supporting a regulation bill he ’s co-sponsoring , and has hired Philip Morris ’ former lobbyist as his senior campaign adviser .
24 . McCain is both for and against earmarks for Arizona .
25 . McCain ’s first mortgage plan was premised on the notion that homeowners facing foreclosure should n’t be “ rewarded ” for acting “ irresponsibly . ”
His second mortgage plan took largely the opposite position .
26 . McCain went from saying gay marriage should be allowed , to saying gay marriage should n’t be allowed .
27 . McCain opposed a holiday to honor Martin Luther King , Jr. , before he supported it .
28 . McCain was anti-ethanol .
Now he ’s pro-ethanol .
29 . McCain was both for and against state promotion of the Confederate flag .
30 .
In 2005 , McCain endorsed intelligent design creationism , a year later he said the opposite , and a few months after that , he was both for and against creationism at the same time .
Economic Policy
31 . McCain was against Bush ’s tax cuts for the very wealthy before he was for them .
32 . John McCain initially argued that economics is not an area of expertise for him , saying , “ I ’m going to be honest : I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues ; I still need to be educated , ” and “ The issue of economics is not something I ’ve understood as well as I should . ”
He now falsely denies ever having made these remarks and insists that he has a “ very strong ” understanding of economics .
33 . McCain vowed , if elected , to balance the federal budget by the end of his first term .
Soon after , he decided he would no longer even try to reach that goal .
And soon after that , McCain abandoned his second position and went back to his first .
34 . McCain said in 2005 that he opposed the tax cuts because they were “ too tilted to the wealthy . ”
By 2007 , he denied ever having said this , and falsely argued that he opposed the cuts because of increased government spending .
35 . McCain thought the estate tax was perfectly fair .
Now he believes the opposite .
36 . McCain pledged in February 2008 that he would not , under any circumstances , raise taxes .
Specifically , McCain was asked if he is a “ ‘ read my lips ’ candidate , no new taxes , no matter what ? ” referring to George H.W. Bush ’s 1988 pledge .
“ No new taxes , ” McCain responded .
Two weeks later , McCain said , “ I ’m not making a ‘ read my lips ’ statement , in that I will not raise taxes . ”
37 . McCain has changed his entire economic worldview on multiple occasions .
38 . McCain believes Americans are both better and worse off economically than they were before Bush took office .
Energy Policy
39 . McCain supported the moratorium on coastal drilling ; now he ’s against it .
40 . McCain recently announced his strong opposition to a windfall - tax on oil company profits .
Three weeks earlier , he was perfectly comfortable with the idea .
41 . McCain endorsed a cap - and - trade policy with a mandatory emissions cap .
In mid-June , McCain announced he wants the caps to voluntary .
42 . McCain explained his belief that a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax would provide an immediate economic stimulus .
Shortly thereafter , he argued the exact opposite .
43 . McCain supported the Lieberman / Warner legislation to combat global warming .
Now he does n’t .
Immigration Policy
44 . McCain was a co-sponsor of the DREAM Act , which would grant legal status to illegal immigrants ’ kids who graduate from high school .
Now he ’s against it .
45 .
On immigration policy in general , McCain announced in February 2008 that he would vote against his own bill .
46 . In April , McCain promised voters that he would secure the borders “ before proceeding to other reform measures . ”
Two months later , he abandoned his public pledge , pretended that he ’d never made the promise in the first place , and vowed that a comprehensive immigration reform policy has always been , and would always be , his “ top priority . ”
Judicial Policy and the Rule of Law
47 . McCain said he would “ not impose a litmus test on any nominee . ”
He used to promise the opposite .
48 . McCain believes the telecoms should be forced to explain their role in the administration ’s warrantless surveillance program as a condition for retroactive immunity .
He used to believe the opposite .
49 . McCain went from saying he would not support repeal of Roe v. Wade to saying the exact opposite .
Campaign , Ethics , and Lobbying Reform
50 . McCain supported his own lobbying - reform legislation from 1997 .
Now he does n’t .
51 . In 2006 , McCain sponsored legislation to require grassroots lobbying coalitions to reveal their financial donors .
In 2007 , after receiving “ feedback ” on the proposal , McCain told far - right activist groups that he opposes his own measure .
52 . McCain supported a campaign - finance bill , which bore his name , on strengthening the public - financing system .
In June 2007 , he abandoned his own legislation .
Politics and Associations
53 . McCain wanted political support from radical televangelist John Hagee .
Now he does n’t .
( He also believes his endorsement from Hagee was both a good and bad idea . )
54 . McCain wanted political support from radical televangelist Rod Parsley .
Now he does n’t .
55 . McCain says he considered and did not consider joining John Kerry ’s Democratic ticket in 2004 .
56 . McCain is both for and against attacking Barack Obama over his former pastor at his former church .
57 . McCain criticized TV preacher Jerry Falwell as “ an agent of intolerance ” in 2002 , but then decided to cozy up to the man who said Americans “ deserved ” the 9/11 attacks .
58 . In 2000 , McCain accused Texas businessmen Sam and Charles Wyly of being corrupt , spending “ dirty money ” to help finance Bush ’s presidential campaign .
McCain not only filed a complaint against the Wylys for allegedly violating campaign finance law , he also lashed out at them publicly .
In April , McCain reached out to the Wylys for support .
59 . McCain was against presidential candidates campaigning at Bob Jones University before he was for it .
60 . McCain decided in 2000 that he did n’t want anything to do with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , believing he “ would taint the image of the ‘ Straight Talk Express . ' ”
Kissinger is now the Honorary Co-Chair for his presidential campaign in New York .
61 . McCain believed powerful right - wing activist / lobbyist Grover Norquist was “ corrupt , a shill for dictators , and ( with just a dose of sarcasm ) Jack Abramoff ’s gay lover . ”
McCain now considers Norquist a key political ally .
And while I realize there are some who believe these constant flip - flops are irrelevant , I respectfully disagree .
Digg it !
Two other things I like about the Eclipse development environment are the ability to jump to a function definition and the ability to open any resource in the workspace .
Fortunately , these shortcuts are easy to duplicate in Emacs .
Exuberant Ctags is a utility that builds an index of the function definitions in your source code .
You can use this index to jump to any function definition using editors such as vi or emacs .
To index your Drupal source code , for example , go to the root of your source directory and use a command like this :
find .
- name \*. module -o - name \*. php -o - name \*.inc -o - name \*. install -o - name \*. engine -o - name \*. profile | etags -l php -
To use this index in Emacs , add the following code to your ~/.emacs , changing drupal - project - path as necessary :
( defvar drupal - project - path " ~/ proj / example " " * Base path for your project " ) ( require ' etags ) ( setq tags - file - name ( expand - file - name " TAGS " drupal - project - path ) )
Evaluate the code .
You can then use M-. ( find - tag ) to jump to the declaration of a function in your project .
To open any resource in your source tree with a few keystrokes , index the files with filecache and use ido to open the file .
Ido is well worth learning how to use .
Here ’s the code I use , taken almost directly from the filecache documentation :
( require ' filecache ) ( require ' ido ) ( defun file - cache - ido - find - file ( file ) " Using ido , interactively open file from file cache ' .
First select a file , matched using ido - switch - buffer against the contents in ` file - cache - alist ' .
If the file exist in more than one directory , select directory .
Lastly the file is opened . " ( interactive ( list ( file - cache - ido - read " File : " ( mapcar ( lambda ( x ) ( car x ) ) file - cache - alist ) ) ) ) ( let* ( ( record ( assoc file file - cache - alist ) ) ) ( find - file ( expand - file - name file ( if (= ( length record ) 2 ) ( car ( cdr record ) ) ( file - cache - ido - read ( format " Find %s in dir : " file ) ( cdr record ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defun file - cache - ido - read ( prompt choices ) ( let ( ( ido - make - buffer - list - hook ( lambda ( ) ( setq ido - temp - list choices ) ) ) ) ( ido - read - buffer prompt ) ) ) ( ido - mode t ) ;;
Change this to filter out your version control files ( add - to - list ' file-cache-filter - regexps " \\.svn-base$ " ) ( if drupal - project - path ( file- cache - add - directory - using - find drupal - project - path ) ) ( global - set - key ( kbd " ESC ESC f " ) ' file - cache-ido- find - file )
This turns ESC ESC f into a handy shortcut for finding files anywhere in your project tree .
Read the source code ( ido.el ) for more information on ido shortcuts .
Good luck and have fun !
( UPDATE : Added “. ” to the find command – two people suggested it ! =) )
( UPDATE : Forced etags to detect files as php and added .engine and . profile to the list of extensions )
( UPDATE : Added version control filter for file - cache )

The Best Return on your Cash .
Sure , stocks are much cheaper now than they were at the first of the year .
So are houses .
But if you ’re carrying a lot of credit card or other debt , your best investment is to pay down that debt .
What is the best investment you can make ?
Here ’s a hint :
It will earn you a guaranteed return that will beat just about any stock on Wall Street .
This investment does n’t require more than two minutes of research and you have everything you need to begin right now .
I ’m not talking about a stock , bond or mutual fund , but an investment in lowering your personal debt .
Too much high - interest credit card debt is never a good idea and considering the economy remains unstable , now is a good time to reduce those balances .
Start with your highest interest debt ( probably a credit card ) .
If you have been a good customer and your interest rate is more than 12 percent , ask the issuer to lower it .
If the issuer wo n’t give you a break , consider switching the balance to an existing card with a lower interest rate ( do n’t get a new card just to get a new rate ) .
Make up your mind to pay off all the high interest debt as soon as possible .
This may mean giving up some luxury or skipping expensive presents until the job is done .
Read
Try to avoid adding to any balances and pay as much as you can ( at least three times the minimum payment ) .
Investment Program ;
If you have to slow your investment program ( not your retirement account , such as a ) , do so as long as the money goes to pay down your debt .
What about the guaranteed return ?
How is paying off debt going to earn you a return ?
Consider it interest avoidance .
If you are paying 12 percent ( or more ) on your credit cards or other debt , you are unlikely to earn that level of return on a consistent basis .
So , for every dollar you do n’t pay in interest on personal debt , you are effectively paying yourself .

WHAT does Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , really think of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , his bellicose , populist president ?
After Mr Ahmadinejad was elected in 2005 , to the surprise of almost all the pundits , it was widely assumed he would be a meek figurehead .
Yet he has been given much leeway , and his reckless economic and risky foreign policies have dragged Iran into a state of near - constant crisis .
But even Iranians close to the government find it hard to tell whether the president is the supreme leader 's trusted lieutenant or whether he is an out - of - control maverick with grander ambitions that may be giving Mr Khamenei sleepless nights .
In terms of constitutional authority , the ascetic Mr Khamenei is plainly the most powerful man in the Islamic Republic ; no big decision can be taken without his consent .
Some Western experts think he is more powerful now than at any time in his 19 years as leader .
The most influential institutions in Iran 's elaborate power - structure , including the Revolutionary Guards , the Guardian Council , the presidency and parliament , are all still run by direct appointees of the supreme leader or by people unfailingly obsequious to him .
Yet Mr Khamenei wields his power lightly , to the extent that he often seems aloof .
He is thought not to have left Iran since 1989 .
He rarely meets journalists or visiting Western officials .
Whether intentionally or not , he has been overshadowed by Iran 's presidents , even before Mr Ahmadinejad .
The reform - minded Muhammad Khatami , who presided from 1997 - 2005 , upstaged him from the left with hopeful calls for a “ dialogue of civilisations ” , while Mr Ahmadinejad seems to outflank him from the right with diatribes against Israel and denials of the Holocaust .
Moreover , Mr Ahmadinejad gives the impression across the world that he is Iran 's main man .
For instance , the Republican presidential candidate , John McCain , has argued that Mr Ahmadinejad , not Mr Khamenei , has ultimate authority in Iran .
But Mr Ahmadinejad may have overreached himself .
Last month , weeks after he publicly threatened to expose officials involved in corruption , one of his ideological allies , a former staff member of Iran 's parliament called Abbas Palizdar , said that dozens of top clerical leaders , including several close to Mr Khamenei , had used their connections to swindle hundreds of millions of dollars from the state and even to kill their opponents .
Iranians have long accepted that the leading clergy have deep pockets , but it is rare for insiders such as Mr Palizdar to name names .
Some Western experts on Iran , such as Gary Sick , of Columbia University in New York , who served in the National Security Council under Presidents Ford , Carter and Reagan , interpreted it as an extraordinary display of ambition by Mr Ahmadinejad .
“ At a minimum , [ he ] is carrying out a direct challenge to Khamenei and the old - guard leadership , ” he wrote .
“ At a maximum , [ it is ] a slow - motion coup in which he gradually accumulates more and more power to himself and to the presidency . ”
Accuser accused
But before Mr Palizdar 's allegations could gather momentum , he and several of his friends were arrested on charges of “ propagating lies ” and “ confusing public opinion ” .
When it became clear that Mr Khamenei was incensed by this public display of alleged dirty laundry , Mr Ahmadinejad and his allies quickly dumped Mr Palizdar , calling him a “ corrupt impostor ” .
A counter - attack against Mr Ahmadinejad then continued .
An influential former foreign minister and confidant of Mr Khamenei , Ali Akbar Velayati , called the president 's policies “ illogical ” and took the unusual step of writing an editorial in a French newspaper , Libération , reportedly with Mr Khamenei 's blessing , to state explicitly that the supreme leader was Iran 's ultimate decision - maker .
The usually combative Mr Ahmadinejad stayed silent .
According to a former senior Iranian official who is related to Mr Khamenei and occasionally meets him : “ If the leader were to withdraw his support , Ahmadinejad 's political future would be finished …
He is scared of [ Khamenei ] , like a dog ” .
But just as Mr Ahmadinejad seemed to have fallen out of favour with the leader , Mr Khamenei came to his defence .
“ The responsible party for advancing the nuclear issue is the Supreme National Security Council headed by the honourable president , ” he declared .
“ What is said by the president and authorities is shared by all authorities of the country … ”
Mr Khamenei may feel obliged to display national unity , especially on nuclear issues .
He may also like to let the occasional hostile feelings of ordinary Iranians for the government be deflected towards the president .
So it is unclear how the two top men really feel about each other — or whether , for instance , Mr Khamenei will back Mr Ahmadinejad next summer if he seeks re-election as president .
No matter who wins the presidency , a big shift in Iran 's domestic and foreign policy seems unlikely while the 69 - year - old Mr Khamenei remains the supreme leader .
At a time when Americans are being forced to pay a growing share of their medical bills and when access to medical care has become a major political issue for states , Congress and the presidential candidates , health care experts say it will be far harder to hold down premiums and expand insurance coverage unless money is spent more wisely .
The problem is not that newer treatments never work .
It is that once they become available , they are often used indiscriminately , in the absence of studies to determine which patients they will benefit .
Some new treatments , like the cancer drug Gleevec and implantable heart defibrillators , undoubtedly save lives , contributing to the United States ’ reputation for medical breakthroughs .
But others  like artificial spinal disks , which can cost tens of thousands of dollars to implant but have not been shown to reduce back pain in many patients , and Vytorin , a new cholesterol drug that costs 20 times as much as older medicines but has not been proved superior  have been criticized for not justifying their costs .
And sometimes , the new technologies prove harmful .
Physicians were stunned , for example , when clinical trials showed last year that expensive anemia medicines might actually hasten death in kidney and cancer patients .
Such drugs are used more widely in the United States than elsewhere .
“ We have too many situations where we thought we knew what the answer was and it did n’t turn out like everyone thought , ” said Dr. Mark Hlatky , a cardiologist and professor of health research and policy at Stanford University .
A Tool of Dubious Value
The problem of inadequate study is especially serious for medical devices and imaging equipment like scanners , which typically are not as strictly regulated as prescription drugs .
Under Food and Drug Administration regulations , the makers of CT scanners  CT is short for computed tomography  do not have to conduct studies to prove that their products benefit patients , as drug makers do .
The manufacturers must certify only that the scanners are safe and provide accurate images .
Once the F.D.A. approves a test or device , Medicare rarely demands evidence that it benefits patients before agreeing to pay for it .
But last year , Medicare officials raised questions about the benefits of CT heart scans and said it would demand more studies before paying for them .
But after heavy lobbying by cardiologists , Medicare backed down .
Private insurers , while initially reluctant to pay for the tests , are also covering them .

The recent dramatic market movements with a rising U.S. dollar and falling commodity prices teaches us quite a bit about how financial markets function , some of which I hinted in my recent analysis of these movements
One is the seemingly odd fact that in financial markets , lower prices can actually increase supply and decrease demand , and so further lower prices in a price - lowering spiral .
The reason is that first of all , this decline could make people believe that the particular asset is in a downward trend .
Whether this downward trend is because of a perceived shift in fundamentals or a change in market psychology makes little difference .
At any rate , it will cause people to sell ( or abstain from buying ) .
Similarly on the upside , rising prices can attract new buyers and discourage people from selling if these price increases convince people of the existence of a new upward trend , a bull market in that particular asset class .
Further contributing to this phenomenon is the existence of " stop - loss " investment rules for fund managers and other investors .
These rules compel investors who follow them to sell a particular asset if it falls to a pre-determined level .
While these rules may perhaps from a risk - minimizing point of view for fund managers have some justification , it creates the seemingly perverse effect that lower prices will cause people to sell .
Of course , anyone who after all have decided to sell or buy will at any point prefer to sell to the highest currently available bidder and buy from the seller who offers the lowest price , so the normal market clearing mechanism still exists .
Instead , the implication of this is that market prices will swing more than what will be justified based on information of fundamental factors , which in turn implies that under - and overvaluations will appear .
The second lesson relates to the existence of quant traders , as well as others , that trade on the basis of various historical relationships .
Case in point is the relationship between the dollar and oil .
On a fundamental basis , for reasons explained here , an " autonomous " increase in the dollar should lower the dollar oil price , but by less than the increase in the dollar .
However , I 've noticed that quite often , oil prices increase or decrease more than the change in the value of the dollar in response to sudden swings in the dollar 's value .
Case in point was the 4 % drop in oil last Friday ( August 8 ) when oil fell 4 % in just one day .
As there was no other market affecting news that day ( There was of course the start of the war between Russia and Georgia , but to the extent that would affect the price it would be to increase , not decrease , it ) it would seem that the entire decline can be attributed to the dollar rally .
Thus , the opinion I criticized here is likely in fact true in a short - term technical perspective .
The reason for this is most likely that many traders react to exchange rate movements by buying ( if the dollar falls ) or selling ( if the dollar rise ) , something which is done to such a large extent that oil change by a factor of more than one , even though it should rise by a factor of less than one .
As was explained here , such mispricing will not hold unless by chance the fundamentals change in a way which justifies the price change .
The result of a too high or too low oil price will be increases or declines in inventory levels , which is ultimately unsustainable and result in a return to price levels motivated by fundamentals , including the effect on fundamentals caused by exchange rate movements ( which again is a change in the dollar price of oil in the opposite direction of the dollar 's value , but by a factor of less than one ) .
The implication of this is also to create temporary under - and overvaluations because of technical factors .
What we are seeing here are examples of why markets are n't efficient .
That in turn implies both a role for technical analysis to analyze these behavioral patterns ( which methods of technical analysis is a separate issue ) and fundamental analysis to identify which asset values are temporarily depressed ( or inflated ) because of these behavioral patterns and are therefore likely to eventually soar ( or plummet ) in value .
Tom Coburn has been fighting with the Ethics Committee for years over whether he can continue to practice medicine .
Coburn 's violation : Working as a doc
The Senate Ethics Committee has told Republican Sen .
Tom Coburn that he ’ll be engaged in a “ serious violation of Senate rules ” if he continues delivering babies back home in Oklahoma .
Coburn ’s response : So what ?
Advertisement
“ On my own time , I ’m taking care of women who have a need , and I ’m going to continue to deliver babies , ” Coburn , an obstetrician , told Politico .
“ I ’m not going to stop . ”
Coburn would not say specifically whether he has actually delivered a baby since the June 22 deadline set by the Ethics Committee , but he made it clear that he could deliver one any day now — and thereby force the Ethics Committee to put up or shut up .
Coburn — an irascible Republican known as Dr. No — has been fighting with the Ethics Committee for years over whether he can continue to practice medicine .
As a member of the House , Coburn delivered approximately 400 babies under an arrangement with the House ethics committee that allowed him to provide medical services as long as the fees he collected allowed him to only break even on his costs .
When Coburn was elected to the Senate — and was told that his existing arrangement violated Senate rules on outside income — he stopped collecting money altogether , delivering babies for free so that he could keep up his medical skills and return to private practice after leaving elected office .
All of Coburn ’s work is pro bono , and he pays malpractice premiums and administrative fees out of his own pocket .
But in recent correspondence , the Senate Ethics Committee told Coburn that because his local facility — the Muskogee Regional Medical Center — is now owned by a for - profit entity , it ’s a conflict of interest for him to provide services there for free .
Coburn says that ’s nonsense .
“ The hospital gets nothing from my services , ” he said .
“ I do n’t bill anything . ”
The Ethics Committee does its work in secret , and its members are not allowed to comment on ongoing proceedings .
Thus , neither the chairwoman , Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) , nor the ranking member , Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , would discuss the Coburn situation .
But according to a series of letters obtained by Politico , the panel has repeatedly told Coburn that delivering babies — even pro bono — at a for - profit medical facility violates ethics rules .
The panel gave Coburn the same advice when Republicans controlled the Senate , and both Boxer and Cornyn have signed letters telling him to stop delivering babies .
Coburn , known for tying up the Senate in procedural knots , thinks he has the upper hand .
If the Ethics Committee actually gets to the point where it calls for a public reprimand , Coburn can appeal to the full Senate for a vote , and he ’s betting that he ’d win a vote if 100 senators were asked whether he should be allowed to deliver babies for free — especially since most of his patients are “ at risk , ” meaning they could be drug users , uninsured or poor patients , or women with high - risk pregnancies .
Coburn also insists that , with all the high - profile ethics scandals facing Congress — leading off with Alaska Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens ’ federal criminal trial this fall — the Senate would look petty by going after someone who is donating his money and medical services to help pregnant women .
Senate aides would not comment on the record , but ethics experts on and off Capitol Hill say the Senate Ethics Committee needs to be consistent in applying its conflict of interest rules , even if Coburn presents a sympathetic case .
Aides also point out that many senators have given up their professional lives when they were elected .
Sen .
John Ensign gave up his Nevada veterinary practice , Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia stopped selling real estate and former Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee stopped performing heart and lung transplant work .
All three are Republicans .
The committee ’s case against Coburn is based on Senate rules that prohibit senators from being involved in professional affiliations that would create a conflict of interest .
Stanley Brand , a congressional ethics expert who has represented several legally troubled members of Congress , including Sen.
Larry Craig ( R - Idaho ) , says the Ethics Committee is wasting its time .
“ If he wants to deliver babies , and there ’s no direct pecuniary conflict , why make this into a cause célèbre ? ”
Brand said .
“ It ’s so absurd to be squeezing this guy .
It ’s another example of leadership run amok . ”
Predator operators prone to psychological trauma as battlefield comrades
Aircraft ’s cameras enable them to see people getting killed in high - resolution detail
MSNBC | Aug 7 , 2008
MARCH AIR RESERVE BASE , Calif . – The Air National Guardsmen who operate Predator drones over Iraq via remote control , launching deadly missile attacks from the safety of Southern California 7,000 miles away , are suffering some of the same psychological stresses as their comrades on the battlefield .
Working in air - conditioned trailers , Predator pilots observe the field of battle through a bank of video screens and kill enemy fighters with a few computer keystrokes .
Then , after their shifts are over , they get to drive home and sleep in their own beds .
But that whiplash transition is taking a toll on some of them mentally , and so is the way the unmanned aircraft ’s cameras enable them to see people getting killed in high - resolution detail , some officers say .
In a fighter jet , “ when you come in at 500 - 600 mph , drop a 500 - pound bomb and then fly away , you do n’t see what happens , ” said Col. Albert K. Aimar , who is commander of the 163rd Reconnaissance Wing here and has a bachelor ’s degree in psychology .
But when a Predator fires a missile , “ you watch it all the way to impact , and I mean it ’s very vivid , it ’s right there and personal .
So it does stay in people ’s minds for a long time . ”
He said the stresses are “ causing some family issues , some relationship issues . ”
He and other Predator officers would not elaborate .
Personalizing the fight
But the 163rd has called in a full - time chaplain and enlisted the services of psychologists and psychiatrists to help ease the mental strain on these remote - control warriors , Aimar said .
Similarly , chaplains have been brought in at Predator bases in Texas , Arizona and Nevada .
In interviews with five of the dozens of pilots and sensor operators at the various bases , none said they had been particularly troubled by their mission , but they acknowledged it comes with unique challenges , and sometimes makes for a strange existence .
“ It ’s bizarre , I guess , ” said Lt. Col.
Michael Lenahan , a Predator pilot and operations director for the 196th Reconnaissance Squadron here .
“ It is quite different , going from potentially shooting a missile , then going to your kid ’s soccer game . ”
Among the stresses cited by the operators and their commanders : the exhaustion that comes with the shift work of this 24 - 7 assignment ; the classified nature of the job that demands silence at the breakfast table ; and the images transmitted via video .
A Predator ’s cameras are powerful enough to allow an operator to distinguish between a man and a woman , and between different weapons on the ground .
While the resolution is generally not high enough to make out faces , it is sharp , commanders say .
Often , the military also directs Predators to linger over a target after an attack so that the damage can be assessed .
“ You do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did , and that does personalize the fight , ” said Col.
Chris Chambliss , commander of the active - duty 432nd Wing at Creech Air Force Base , Nev . “ You have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground .
The images can be pretty graphic , pretty vivid , and those are the things we try to offset .
We know that some folks have , in some cases , problems . ”
Chambliss said his experience flying F - 16 fighter jets on bombing runs in Iraq during the 1990s prepared him for his current job as a Predator pilot .
But Chambliss and several other wing leaders said they were concerned about the sensor operators , who sit next to pilots in the ground control station .
Often , the sensor operators are on their first assignment and just 18 or 19 years old , officers said .
While the pilot actually fires the missile , the sensor operator uses laser instruments to guide it all the way to its target .
‘ No one ’s walking into it blind ’
On four or five occasions , sensor operators have sought out a chaplain or supervisor after an attack , Chambliss said .
He emphasized that the number of such cases is very small compared to the number of people involved in Predator operations .
Col .
Rodney Horn , vice commander of the 147th Reconnaissance Wing at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base near Houston , said his unit went out of it way to impress upon sensor operators the sometimes lethal nature of the job .
“ No one ’s walking into it blind , ” he said .
Master Sgt. Keith LeQuire , a 48 - year - old sensor operator here , said the 163rd asks prospective sensor operators whether they are prepared for the deadly serious mission .
“ No one ’s been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job , ” he said .
