Benazir Bhutto ’s husband unravels mystery of her death
The husband of the former Prime Minister of Pakistan , Benazir Bhutto , who was killed in a terrorist attack on December 27 , accused the nation ’s authorities of their incompetence and attempts to avoid responsibility for the tragedy .
Benazir Bhutto ’s husband unravels mystery of her death
Speaking about his wife ’s death , Asif Ali Zardari stated that there was an explosion but it occurred after Bhutto had been shot .
“ I have my eyewitnesses , but the Pakistani authorities did not interrogate them , ” he said .
Benazir Bhutto ’s husband had thus denied statements from officials of the Pakistani Interior Ministry .
The officials said that a suicide terrorist fired his gun at Bhutto three times but missed .
He blew himself up afterwards .
Doctors of the hospital where Bhutto was hospitalized did not find any gunshot wounds on her body either .
Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said she was killed when she tried to duck back into the armored vehicle during the attack , and the shock waves from the blast smashed her head into a lever attached to the sunroof , fracturing her skull , he said .
However , a video footage made by one of Bhutto ’s supports shows the terrorist shooting at Bhutto three times .
“ I believe that the Pakistani government is a group of incompetent people , who cannot distinguish between the back and the front .
They should not be doing such turns in history .
Instead of claiming responsibility for the tragedy they laid the blame on others .
They are playing dirty games , ” Asif Ali Zardari said .
It has recently been reported that Osama bin Laden ’s terrorist network al - Qaeda claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack to assassinate Benazir Bhutto .
However , Islamic militants said Saturday that they had no link to Bhutto ’s death .
They dismissed government ’s claims that a leader of pro-Taliban forces in Pakistan carried out the suicide attack on the opposition leader , the AP reports .
The dispute and conflicting reports about Bhutto's exact cause of death was expected to further enflame the violence wracking this nuclear - armed nation two days after the popular former prime minister was killed in a suicide attack .

Russia 's President Vladimir Putin has drawn a parallel between US plans for a missile shield in Europe and the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 , widely regarded as the closest the world came to nuclear war .
But the Kremlin leader added that his personal friendship with US President George W Bush has helped to prevent the latest US initiative from turning into a new global disaster .
" I would remind you how relations were developing in an analogous situation in the middle of the 1960s , " he told a news conference after the Russia - EU summit in Portugal .
" Analogous actions by the Soviet Union when it deployed rockets on Cuba provoked the Cuban missile crisis , " Mr Putin added .
" For us , technologically , the situation is very similar .
On our borders such threats to our country are being created . "
" Thank God , there is no Caribbean crisis [ Cuban crisis ] now , mainly because Russia 's relations with the European Union and the United States have changed a lot . "
A decision by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to send nuclear missiles to Communist ally Cuba put the world on the brink of nuclear war in 1962 .
After days of dramatic negotiations , Mr Khrushchev agreed to pull out the missiles .
Russia has been outraged by the US decision to deploy a radar in the Czech Republic and interceptor missiles in Poland to avert potential missile strikes from countries like Iran .
It sees the plan as an outright threat to its security .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack strongly rejected Mr Putin 's comparison between the US missile shield proposal and the Cuban crisis .
" There are some very clear historical differences between our plans to deploy a defensive missile system designed to protect against launch of missiles from rogue states such as Iran , and the offensive nuclear capability of the missiles that were being installed in Cuba back in the 1960s , " Mr McCormack said .
" They are not historically analogous in any way , shape or form , " he added .
Arms race
In a demonstration of potential consequences , a top Russian military commander said Moscow could resume the production of short and medium - range nuclear missiles , similar to those which threatened Western Europe in the mid-1980s .
" If there is a political decision to make such a class of missile , then it is obvious that they will be made in Russia in the near future because we have everything we need , " Colonel - General Nikolai Solovtsov said in Moscow .
In an attempt to stop the US plan , Mr Putin has promised to allow Washington use a radar it rents in Azerbaijan , built in the Soviet days to monitor the Indian Ocean zone , or a new radar with even wider range located in Southern Russia .
He has also proposed setting up a joint missile defence system , which would include European countries .

Like many of his generation , my father owes his education and , indeed his entire career to the GI Bill offered to returning veterans after WWII .
He came from working class immigrant stock and would never have been able to afford college during the 40s without the sort of assistance provided by the bill .
As it was , he was able to attend a small ( tiny , really ) private college in Ohio , go on to graduate school at Cornell and eventually to a successful career in Food Technology with General Foods .
He and my mother , a librarian , provided my sister and I with a comfortable middle - class life and solid educational opportunities in our time .
The result of the WWII GI Bill was n’t just that people like my dad got a college education , but that education and those of his fellow veterans fueled the economic and social boom years of the 50s and 60s , for the entire country .
As Wesley Clark and Jon Soltz write in today ’s LA Times :
The original GI Bill transformed American history , providing education for returning soldiers .
The GI Bill not only recognized our nation ’s moral duty for the enormous sacrifices of our World War II veterans , but it helped create America ’s middle class and spurred decades of economic growth for our country .
Economists estimate that the original bill returned anywhere between $ 5 and $ 13 for every dollar we spent on it .
And as noted in a NPR Morning Edition article today :
Those days are long gone .
The current version of the GI Bill picks up 70 percent of the tab at a public college and about 30 percent of the costs at most private colleges .
That means that while veterans of WWII could attend Harvard University courtesy of the government , veterans of the Iraq war have to cover nearly three years of tuition at such a school themselves .
The NPR story relates the experience of Todd Bowers , now director of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association ( IAVA ) .
He had managed to finish one semester at prestigious George Washington University prior to being called up for a second tour in Iraq , where he narrowly survived a sniper ’s bullet .
After Bowers came home , he says , he was determined to finish his studies at George Washington , with the GI Bill ’s help .
But , “ I started to fall into a tremendous amount of debt .
I was taking out incredible student loans trying to keep up with the tuition costs , and the GI Bill was n’t picking up much more than a few of my books . ”
Senator Jim Webb ’s proposed bill , which currently has 52 supporters in the Senate , would offer a reasonable and modest update to the GI Bill .
It would n’t offer veterans a free ride to private colleges like my father got , but it would pay for them to attend the best State colleges and offer incentives to private schools .
It would also honor returning veterans for their service and sacrifice in a meaningful and tangible fashion .
The bill would also decrease the disparity between benefits offered to active duty soldiers and those offered to members of the National Guard .
“ If I serve 12 months , one single tour in Iraq , I will get 12 months worth of benefits of what the active duty receives , ” Bowers explains .
“ If I serve three tours of 12 months for a total of 36 months , I still only receive 12 months of benefits . ”
52 votes is not a veto - proof margin in the Senate but why would anyone veto such a wonderful bill ?
Or why would someone like John McCain , who has made himself out to be the great defender and supporter of our military , fail to adamantly support and battle for this bill ?
Kudos to NPR for at least mentioning McCain ’s pusilanimous reluctance to step up :
His office did not respond to calls for this report .
Several weeks ago , while on the road , McCain said , “ It seems to me that it ’s a good thing to do , but I have n’t examined the bill with the care … that it needs .
…
But we obviously need to do something along those lines . ”
Like , oh , maybe later .
After he gets elected .
Maybe .
It turns out that the White House and the Pentagon are opposed to the GI Bill .
Why ?
The answer is not only creepy beyond belief , but it ’s incredibly insulting to the very military that Republicans are always claiming to support :
The Pentagon , however , says it is concerned that it will damage retention — that the extensive benefits would encourage people to leave the military to go to college .
Sen .
Webb disagrees .
“ If you have a meaningful GI Bill , you ’re going to expand the potential pool of people who will come into the military . …
We want all elements of our society to be involved in the military when we have situations like Iraq , ” he says .
“ And it ’s only when the mothers of Harvard wake up and worry about their son or daughter that we are going to have a hedge against adventurism . ”
Clark and Soltz agree :
First , it is morally reprehensible to fix the system so that civilian life is unappealing to service members , in an attempt to force them to re-up .
Education assistance is not a handout , it is a sacred promise that we have made for generations in return for service .
Second , falling military recruitment numbers are just as serious as retention problems .
To send the message that this nation will not help you make the most of your life will dissuade a large number of our best and brightest from choosing military service over other career options .
Obama and Clinton are both supporters of the bill .
I hope they both take time off from slapping one another and demand accountability from John McCain .
No more weaseling .
No more “ I have n’t had time to look at the bill ” .
That ’s why you have a staff , McCain .
If you ’re too busy trying to convince us that you support the troops at the same time you refuse to support such a reasonable and far - reaching opportunity , you ’re just a fraud .

Cocaine Jet That Crashed in Mexico Part of Cowboy Government Operation , DEA Sources Claim
Mexican Officials Fear the Case , if Exposed , Could Jeopardize US Funding for “ Plan Mexico ”
By Bill Conroy
Special to The Narco News Bulletin
The Gulfstream II jet that crash landed in the Mexican Yucatan in late September carrying close to four tons of cocaine was part of an operation being carried out by a Department of Homeland Security agency , DEA sources have revealed to Narco News .
The operation , codenamed “ Mayan Express , ” is an ongoing effort spearheaded by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , the sources claim .
The information surfaced during a high - level meeting at DEA headquarters in mid-December , DEA sources familiar with the meeting assert .
Those sources have requested anonymity out of fear they will be retaliated against by the government for revealing the information .
The operation also appears to be badly flawed , the sources say , because it is being carried out unilaterally , ( Rambo - style ) , by ICE and without the knowledge of the Mexican government — at least it was up until the point of the coke - packed Gulfstream jet ’s abrupt impact with the Earth .
“ This is a case of ICE running amok , ” one DEA source told Narco News .
“ If this [ operation ] was being run by the book , they would not be doing it unilaterally ” – without the participation of DEA – “ and without the knowledge of the Mexican government . ”
The fact that the Gulfstream was forced to ditch over the Yucatan after being refused landing clearance at two Mexican airports is strong evidence that this operation , if ICE operated as alleged , does not have the proper controls in place , law enforcement sources told Narco News .
If the operation was being adequately monitored and controlled by U.S. law enforcement , in coordination with Mexican authorities , the jet would have been directed to a safe landing zone , they add .
Mexican law enforcers subsequently apprehended the two pilots of the downed jet .
Neither one of them appears to be a U.S. citizen , according to Mexican press accounts .
Narco News has previously reported that the bill of sale for the Gulfstream jet — which was sold only weeks before its crash landing — lists an individual named Greg Smith , whose name also shows up in public documents that indicate he worked as a pilot in the past for an operation involving the FBI , DEA and CIA that targeted narco - traffickers in Colombia .
[ See link here . ]
Mexican authorities interrogated the pilots of the ill - fated cocaine jet prior to turning them over to DEA agents for questioning .
DEA confirmed that it is now handling the investigation into the jet crash and subsequent seizure of the cocaine .
It appears that the pilots spilled the beans on the ICE operation during their interrogation by Mexican authorities , DEA sources tell Narco News .
The meeting held at DEA headquarters was focused , in part , on assessing the implications of that information .
The Mexican government has chosen not to raised a stink over the matter , the DEA sources claim , for fear of jeopardizing the pending $ 1.4 billion U.S. aid package promised as part of the proposed “ Mérida Iinitiative ” — commonly known as “ Plan Mexico , ” which will provide a Christmas list of training and equipment to the Mexican government to battle “ drug cartels . ”
Mexican law enforcement authorities recently arrested an alleged money launder , Pedro Alfonso Alatorre Damy , who they contend is linked to the Sinaloa narco - trafficking organization .
They claim the narco - trafficking organization financed the purchases of the Gulfstream II as well as a DC - 9 jet that was busted by Mexican authorities last April with a payload of some 5.5 tons of cocaine .
Both jets were sold while parked at the St. Petersburg - Clearwater International Airport , according to a recent report by Howard Altman of the Tampa Tribune .
So , there is clearly a connection between the two jets .
The thread that ties the Sinaloa organization , Greg Smith and the U.S. federal agencies that appear to have been involved together , however , remains very unclear .
Did the cartel hire Smith and Clyde O’Connor ( the other individual listed on the Gulfstream ’s bill of sale ) to handle the plane ’s purchase , unaware that it was falling into a sting ?
Was the Sinaloa organization ’s connection to the planes simply invented by authorities as part of a cover - up of the operation ?
Or is there another explanation yet to be found ?
The alleged involvement of ICE in a unilateral counter - narcotics operation in a foreign nation is unusual ( though not unprecedented ) because DEA is supposed to be the lead U.S. agency in such efforts .
ICE , however , generated a major controversy when it ran an operation several years ago targeting the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes ( VCF ) narco - trafficking organization in Juarez , Mexico .
As part of that operation , ICE placed an informant ( a former Mexican cop ) inside a VCF cell in Juarez and continued the operation even after ICE agents became aware of their informant ’s participation in murder .
That case , since dubbed the House of Death resulted in some 12 people being tortured , murdered and buried in the back yard of a house in Juarez – all in an effort to make a drug case against a VCF lieutenant .
As is alleged with the current Mayan Express operation , ICE officials were accused of running the House of Death case unilaterally and going to great lengths to conceal information about their informant and the murders from the Mexican government .
ICE public affairs officials in Washington , D.C. , failed to reply to several inquiries ( by phone and e-mail ) from Narco News seeking comment on the alleged Mayan Express operation .
Narco News also contacted Steve Robertson , a special agent assigned to DEA public affairs in Washington , D.C. , for comment about the allegation that the Gulfstream II jet that crashed in Mexico in late September with some four tons of coke onboard was , in fact , part of an ICE operation .
Robertson ’s response :
I can’t confirm or deny that it was an ICE operation — even if I knew it was the case , and I ’m not saying it ’s true .
Our Mexico
City office is working an investigation on it now .
It started after the seizure [ the jet crash ] .
It ’s an ongoing investigation .
… It was not a DEA operation .
The briefings I ’ve gotten is that our investigation started after the seizure .
Out of Control
The structure of the Mayan Express operation , as outlined by the DEA sources , puzzles law enforcement officials contacted by Narco News .
The operation appears to be playing out in Mexico and Colombia ( where the cocaine was picked up ) absent any tight law enforcement controls .
As a result , the law enforcers agree , any criminal cases that might result from the effort likely could only be pursued once the cocaine entered the United States via an ICE - controlled delivery point , given the laws governing complex international narcotics investigations .
The apparent lack of control of the operation south of the U.S. border also raises questions as to how much of the cocaine made its way into the United States unchecked due to the mechanizations of crafty informants and assets involved in the operation or the indifference of federal agents looking to advance a career - boosting case .
In the case of the House of Death , the informant actually smuggled a 100 pounds of marijuana across the U.S. border behind the backs of his ICE handlers , yet ICE continued to use the informant .
The bottom line , though , according to the DEA sources who leaked the information to Narco News , is that the real purpose of the Mayan Express operation remains unclear , as does the volume of drugs involved in the operation to date .
Spooks at the Levers
One proposition that all of the law enforcers who spoke with Narco News agreed on with respect to the Mayan Express is that even if DEA was precluded from participating in the effort , the CIA almost certainly was involved on some level .
They say no law enforcement operation is carried out overseas without the CIA lurking in the background .
Some U.S. media have reported that the Gulfstream II jet that crashed in Mexico in September is suspected of possible links to the CIA ’s terrorist rendition program and that the aircraft made several trips to Guantanamo Bay in years past — prior to being enlisted as a cocaine transport plane .

CIA
Confirming that information independently has proven difficult , but Narco News did find a report from a British government agency that lists the Gulfstream II ’s registration number ( N987SA ) among the aircraft registration numbers European investigators were interested in obtaining more information about in relation to a probe intorendition flights .
Information on N987SA — along with a number of other jets — was released to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in June 2006 by Britain ’s Department of Transport .
From the British agency ’s Web site :
On 7 April the Government published flight plan data received from Eurocontrol , the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation , concerning the movement of certain US aircraft into or out of UK aerodromes since 1 January 2001 .
This data had previously been released by Eurocontrol to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to assist with its enquiry into allegations of “ extraordinary rendition ” flights operating within Europe .
It provided information on the aircraft ’s type , registration number , date and time of flight , point of origin and destination and recorded user ’s name .
It did not however contain information about any passengers on board or the purpose of the flight .
Since the disclosure of that initial flight plan data , the Council of Europe ’s enquiry broadened to include investigations into a number of additional US registered aircraft .
Further flight plan information was therefore sought from Eurocontrol concerning the movement of these newly identified aircraft to and from European aerodromes … .
Attorney Mark Conrad , a former high - level supervisory Customs agent who has an extensive background in the intelligence world , has no problem entertaining a CIA scenario in the Gulfstream II narco - world saga .
Though he stresses that he has no knowledge of the Mayan Express operation , Conrad says based on its description , he suspects the CIA could even be running the show .
Conrad says in recent years , ICE ’s investigative talent has defected in droves from the agency due to Homeland Security ’s obsessive focus on what he describes as a “ snatch and grab ” mission targeting undocumented immigrants .
As a result , he told Narco News :
It [ the Mayan Express ] makes no sense and it makes perfect sense .
There probably are n’t six people left at ICE who could put an operation like this together .
It could well be a CIA operation working under ICE cover .
Conrad says such a “ cover ” approach is not a crazy conspiracy theory .
He adds that when he was with U.S. Customs — which has since become part of ICE — the CIA placed one of its agents in Japan with Customs credentials as a cover .
Though speculation , such a structure could provide the Agency with the clearance it needed to carry out the operation stateside and a convenient scapegoat if the operation imploded — along with plenty of plausible deniability .
It would n’t be the first time that the CIA has been accused of running rough shod over law enforcement priorities .
In the early 1990s , the CIA ran a spook mission designed to infiltrate Colombian narco - trafficking groups that resulted in at least a ton of cocaine — some estimates put the figure much higher — entering the United States unchecked .
The former head of the DEA , Robert Bonner , incensed at the Agency ’s actions , which were carried out over DEA ’s objections , went on national TV at the time and essentially accused the CIA of engaging in drug trafficking .
The CIA operation , which was carried out with the assistance of the Venezuelan National Guard , unraveled after U.S. Customs seized a load of the dope in Miami .
So , one way to avoid a repeat of that mistake in an operation like the alleged Mayan Express , assuming it is a CIA - run effort , is to use Customs ( ICE ) as a cover for the operation , one law enforcer suggests .
Whatever the Mayan Express is designed to accomplish , the DEA sources who came forward with this information did so because they are convinced that the operation could jeopardize future legitimate law enforcement efforts overseas , but that official Washington will do whatever it can to cover - up the mess .
Congress could get to the bottom of these allegations , if it chose to , but the DEA sources contend that the Mayan Express has delivered a can of worms to their doorstep that no one wants to open during this election season .

There have been several Free Tibet protests happening around town this month ; one of them even featured city council member Tony Avella .
While Tibetan protesters are routinely beaten , imprisoned and even killed by police in China , police brutality is something you might be surprised to see in New York City , unless of course you 've attended demonstrations over the years and experienced it first hand .
During a Free Tibet protest near the UN on March 14th , some NYPD officers were documented threatening , arresting and clubbing activists seemingly without provocation .
In the below video it appears the protesters do nothing more than carry flags , walk on the sidewalk and chant .
Yet officers identified as Leroy , Delgado and Serano , and others are depicted clubbing them even when they 're down .
The cameraman stridently narrates while filming , saying , " Look at these cops , clubbing people in front of the UN , unbelievable , protesting to free Tibet , cops clubbing people in their legs on the sidewalk , in front of the UN in America , unbelievable , this is not China . "
He also notes that Officer Serano had threatened to kill two protesters , something the officer later admits to on tape .
Do n't cops learn about YouTube at the Police Academy these days ?
When we contacted the NYPD , asking if they had a statement about the beatings caught on tape that day , we were told that they " would n't call what happened a beating . "
We 're currently waiting for an emailed statement which we 'll update this post with when received .
As the April 1 deadline to file H - 1B visa applications nears , the debate is heating up among IT industry watchers and skilled workers over whether the often maligned program adequately serves U.S. companies or American workers as it was originally intended .
MORE ON THE H -1B VISA DEBATE
Gates Repeats Request for More H - 1B Visas
The Great H - 1B Debate : Where Are All the CIOs ?
H=1B Visa Issue Has Wider Impact
Senator Questions U.S. Government Agencies Hiring H - 1B Workers
For IT industry watchers , the H - 1B Specialty Occupation Visa originated as a means for U.S. companies to hire non-citizens with skills that seemed in short supply in America , fostering innovation within the country and keeping jobs from being sent overseas .
The program applies to industries other than IT , such as education , science and medicine , but seems to have earned the worst reputation for displacing U.S. tech workers .
Now industry watchers say the bad reputation the program engenders hinders the system from working to its full potential as American firms and foreign applicants scramble to receive one of 65,000 slots available for 2009 .
" H - 1B dominates in the tech industry by far , for engineering , architects and other technical skills , and there are many false theories out there that people from India are qualifying under fraudulent pretenses .
It has hurt the public perception of the program , " says Sonia Munoz , president of Immigration Legal Counsel , a law firm specializing in immigration law .
" U.S. companies need to be competitive in a global economy , and it is most definitely detrimental to the U.S. economy to limit the number of H - 1Bs and have fewer specialists hired by this program . "
Yet for IT workers , many of whom say there are currently many challenges they face in getting hired by a U.S. company , the program can only been seen as having a negative impact on the American economy as firms look to hire less expensive , foreign workers for jobs that could be filled by U.S. citizens .
" Executives are being told by their hiring managers that there are not skilled workers in the U.S. and they must seek H - 1Bs to fill positions , " says Terri Morgan , a principal at Wudang Research Association who says she has encountered issues when seeking IT employment from U.S. companies , such as IBM .
" There are a whole host of us out here that have really good skills and know the culture , but maybe we do n't have one item on the check list HR is seeking .
H - 1B applicants know how to manipulate the system and companies know how to make it appear as though they exhausted their options here . "
One company that reportedly has more than 4,000 jobs to fill is Microsoft , and Chairman Bill Gates , adding fuel to the fire , is expected to speak to Congress this week to encourage lawmakers to increase the cap of H - 1B visas available .
Companies such as Microsoft argue they need to be able to draw from a broad pool of specialized skill sets to be able to innovate and compete in a global economy .
And while an additional 20,000 visas are available to applicants with U.S. graduate degrees , last year the number of available visas expired within a day of the filing start and industry watchers expect the same this year .
" We expect to see the slots be overbooked almost instantly .
The backlog is so huge , and there is no doubt there is a problem with this system that has been continued and serious for years but could only be greater this year than it was last , " says Roger Cochetti , group director of U.S. public policy at the Computer Trade Industry Association , or CompTIA .
For Cochetti and other H - 1B advocates , the problem is an unreasonable cap based on U.S. fear within the IT community that the program is designed to let American firms hire inexpensive labor elsewhere .
But immigration experts argue there is effort and expense companies must absorb when filing for H - 1B visas that does n't support the cost - saving argument of program detractors .
And companies that use H - 1Bs cannot pay foreign workers less than they would pay an American citizen for the same position or they will endure penalties .
" H - 1B involves people with really special skills that needs to be documented in the application .
The program is not about hiring baseline technicians when you are referring to the IT industry , " says Bo Cooper , a specialist in business immigration law in Paul Hastings ' national immigration practice .
" Anything that raises concerns about jobs for U.S. workers is destined to be a sensitive issue , as it should be , but H - 1B fuels the American economy more than it takes away from U.S. workers . "
For instance , companies could opt to locate facilities overseas through offshore providers and staff entire locations with non-U.S. workers , feeding money into another country 's economy .
H - 1B advocates argue that while the cap was temporarily raised during the tech industry boom earlier this decade , not all applications were filled .
In fact , when the cap was 195,000 in 2002 and 2003 , fewer than 80,000 visas were issued against the cap in each of those years , according to research released this week by the National Foundation for American Policy .
NFAP argues in the report that the current cap is similar to that of 1990 and places a stranglehold on U.S. firms in need of skills not currently available to them from American workers .
" An additional indicator of the need for skilled labor in the economy is the regular lack of availability of H - 1B temporary visas for skilled foreign nationals , " the report reads .
" The supply of H - 1B visas has been exhausted before the start of each of the past four fiscal years .
This can often leave employers with no choice but to hire foreign nationals they have recruited outside of the U.S. or see individuals lost to competitors overseas . "
Yet IT workers remain unconvinced that an increase in the number of visas provisioned would help anyone .
Even those not firmly opposed to hiring foreign workers suspect the program suffers from what many IT workers say is abuse and manipulation .
" Unfortunately , the program often seems to be abused and results in American workers being sacrificed for cheaper resources and facilitates the transfer of jobs abroad , " says James Kritcher , vice president of IT at White Electronic Designs in Phoenix .
Reports of Indian outsourcing firms snagging many temporary visas concern Kritcher , who says if the program worked as it was intended , he would support it fully .
" Where there is genuine need , the increasing number of visas going to foreign companies means fewer are available for U.S. companies , " he adds .
" I 'm not in favor of increasing the cap at this time .
I would leave it as - is for now , until more light is shed on the actual use and impact of the program . "
Others say the program is designed to fail by setting a limit not based on the actual need in the economy .
" I am in favor of the H - 1B visa program in general .
I understand there is some abuse of the system , some sponsor companies talking up to 50 % of the salary mainly in small consulting firms , " says Albert Porco , CIO at Kings County Medical Center in New York .
" I think that any number is the wrong way to look at the situation , what the market will bear is a better way to handle it .
One year it could be 150,000 and the next it could be 30,000 . "
And some in IT even think the cap is too low , which hurts the program 's effectiveness for finding specialized skills .
" It 's most likely too low , but any arbitrary number is just that : arbitrary , " says Kamal Jain , Director of Operations and Customer Service at Auraria Networks in Boxborough , Mass .
Regardless of the actual figure , Kritcher says the current debate over H - 1B visas will have long - term and potentially detrimental effects to the U.S. tech economy .
" Long term , I think that the program may create market interference that drives down wages , displaces qualified candidates , encourages companies to outsource offshore and removes incentive for college students to enter IT — as evidenced by recent drops in computer science enrollment .
No one wants to enter a profession where they may become " disposable , ' " he says .
" The U.S. is known for creativity and innovation .
If core use of technology is sent offshore it could result in less innovation and a reduced comparative advantage . "

FOR VIKTOR BOUT , meeting clients in person — looking them in the eye , shaking their hands — was his preferred way of doing business , though it was not strictly necessary .
As the fugitive leader of the world ’s largest and most lucrative illicit - arms - trafficking network , he had plenty of capable lieutenants to manage his affairs .
But Bout , by all accounts , enjoyed his work and liked to be on location when deals were closed .
So it was that on Thursday , March 6 , he landed in Bangkok , Thailand , having flown all night from his home in Moscow .
He had come to meet representatives of what he hoped would be his newest customer , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , and to finalize an arrangement to deliver millions of dollars of military - grade weapons from Eastern European warehouses to the FARC ’s jungle outposts .
It was a welcome new line of business for the 41 - year - old Russian , who had chafed lately under U.S. , European , and UN sanctions that had frozen his assets and severely curtailed his ability to travel .
Thailand had remained one of the few countries in the world where Bout felt secure .
It was known to have lenient immigration controls and no shortage of corrupt bureaucrats who could easily be bought off .
Moreover , it was popular with Western tourists among whom the arms dealer could conceal himself without raising suspicion .
It was not a country where Bout enjoyed the tacit security that came with knowing well - placed government officials , as he did throughout much of Eastern Europe and Africa , but it was many time zones removed from where his pursuers were likely to be hunting for him and , he must have thought , as good a place as any to conduct his latest transaction .
Bout arrived shortly before noon at Bangkok ’s five - star Sofitel Silom Hotel , a modern 38 - story glass structure that towers above a traffic - congested , tree - lined street in the city ’s commercial district .
He checked in at the front desk and made a 3 p.m. reservation for a conference room before retiring to his suite on the 14th floor .
He remained there for several hours , perhaps taking the opportunity to catch up on sleep before rising at the appointed time to meet his FARC contacts .
He took the elevator to the conference room on the 27th floor , where he and several other Russians , presumably the bodyguards
Bout always kept close , watched hotel workers prepare food for the meeting and waited for their Colombian clients to appear .
As is now well known , the FARC was nowhere to be found .
Instead , as many as 50 Thai police , joined by special agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , had been staking out the Sofitel since 5 a.m. in anticipation of Bout ’s arrival .
What he believed to be members of the FARC , a Marxist rebel army involved with drug trafficking that appears on the U.S. State Department ’s list of foreign terrorist organizations , were actually undercover DEA informants .
They had been stringing Bout along for several months with the false promise of buying sophisticated weapons systems from him .
Police entered the conference room with weapons ready , but Bout and his men were unarmed and did not resist .
Authorities handcuffed Bout and ushered him out the hotel ’s back entrance to a waiting vehicle .
A
Thai police officer who was there later told reporters that , upon being arrested , the Russian arms dealer said only , “ The game is over . ”
THE CHAIN OF EVENTS that brought Viktor Bout to Bangkok that morning had played out like moves in a high - stakes poker game , albeit one rigged in favor of Bout ’s opponents .
What follows is the story of how the “ Merchant of Death , ” so named for his role in fueling Third World conflicts with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of weapons and ammunition , was brought down by a months - long international DEA sting operation .
Drawing on information from a newly unsealed U.S. federal indictment against Bout , interviews with experts in and out of government , and journalistic accounts of Bout ’s activities , this portrayal offers a glimpse not only of the inner workings of Bout ’s organization , but of how other transnational criminal enterprises — such as the mafia , drug cartels , and terrorist groups — do business in the global free market .
“ Victor Bout is a symbol of the modern world [ and ] a product of this post - Cold War era , ” says Mark Galeotti , a historian who has advised the British government on Russian organized crime .
“ He engages himself in all kinds of activities that wander backward and forward across the boundaries of legality . ”
Willing to work for anyone , Bout ’s business divorced itself from any political , philosophical , or moral constraint .
It delivered military cargo with equal enthusiasm to terrorists , guerrilla insurgents , rebel warlords , embattled dictatorships , legitimate businesses , humanitarian aid groups , and sovereign governments , including the United States .
Indeed , to the U.S. military ’s subsequent embarrassment , Bout - controlled airlines , working on subcontract for firms like KBR and Federal Express , were found to have ferried personnel and supplies into Iraq in the years immediately following the 2003 invasion — a detail sure to figure prominently in Bout ’s defense if , as U.S. prosecutors have requested , he is extradited to stand trial in an American court .
“ That ’s one reason he was so elusive and difficult to catch , ” says Galeotti , “ because he was so useful to so many people . ”
The DEA unit that finally got the better of Viktor Bout is a relatively new creation .
The agency had been chasing the FARC and other international narco - traffickers for years , but after 9/11 , changes to federal law provided the drug warriors with greater latitude to run overseas operations against non-American targets .
“ We crossed over post - 9/11 and actually formed a group ” to pursue these types of investigations , says DEA spokesman Michael Sanders .
( He declined to provide further information about the group for security reasons , but described the Bout sting operation as “ guarded ” and the number of people involved as “ very small . ” )
“ We can reach out and get hold of somebody as far as drugs go , and they do n’t have to be present or have done something inside the domestic United States to be convicted for these drug crimes . ”
Bout was known to transport small amounts of drugs between weapons transfers ( he hated nothing so much as an empty cargo bay ) , and in that the DEA found a pretense to go after him .
“ We were presented with an opportunity , and we did n’t pass it off , ” says Sanders .
“ We took it and ran with it . ”
The decision to use the FARC to target Bout ’s operation was not without precedent .
In 2006 , the same DEA unit nabbed Syrian arms dealer Monzer al - Kassar , the so - called “ Prince of Marbella , ” at Madrid ’s international airport after ensnaring him in a bogus multimillion - dollar deal to supply weapons and explosives to the FARC .
Al - Kassar remains in a Spanish jail , awaiting extradition to the United States .
The sting that put him there was almost identical to the one that would later snag Bout .
How could the Russian , renowned for the care he took in ensuring his own security , have fallen for the same trick ?
“ If you were to do a movie script , you would see the similarities [ because ] they played out the same way , ” says Sanders , adding , “ If something works , you might as well do it again ! ”
In Bout ’s case , another factor may have come into play , namely that the FARC really was trying to acquire the types of weapons and equipment he was known to provide .
“ What ’s fascinating about [ the unsealed federal indictment ] is how close it is , even though it ’s pure coincidence , to what FARC was actually looking for , ” says Jonathan Winer , a former deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement during the Clinton administration , who was “ present at the creation ” of early U.S. efforts to capture the Russian .
“ They were seeking surface - to - air missiles , ” he said , citing documents seized in a cross - border raid by the Colombian military against a FARC hideout in Ecuador earlier this month .
Even before the sting began , Bout may already have been reaching out to the Colombian guerrillas .
“ I ’ve been hearing reports for the last six months that Bout was in fact trying to sell armored all - terrain vehicles to the FARC so the leadership could drive around , ” says Douglas Farah , coauthor with Los Angeles Times reporter Stephen Braun of a recent book about Bout ’s network .
In all likelihood , agreed Winer , the DEA was simply capitalizing on actual developments in the black market .
“ My guess here is that there is a real FARC outreach to get weapons somewhere , ” he says .
“ It was not just a sting operation manufactured out of thin air . ”
Beyond that , the DEA “ believed the FARC was an entirely credible option for him , ” Farah says , because Bout had already made at least one delivery to the group .
Sometime in the late 1990s , he is alleged to have air dropped as many as 10,000 AK - 47s into the jungle along Colombia ’s southern border with Peru .
The experience may have given
Bout confidence in his ability to operate there , but for one important detail :
His customer at the time was Peruvian intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos , who had arranged the weapons deal as a favor to the FARC .
“ He did n’t deal with the FARC directly , ” Farah notes .
“ He knew how to drop stuff there because he had done it , but he had never dealt with the FARC , so he would n’t have known particular commanders ” — including the men he later arranged to meet in Bangkok .
FOR SOMEONE SO POLITICALLY connected in so many places , Bout ’s personal history , all the little pieces that make up the man , has remained the stuff of urban legend .
He is variously described as having been born in the Soviet republics of Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , or Ukraine .
He is married and has a daughter who lives in Spain , as well as a brother named Sergei in Moscow , also believed to be active in the arms - smuggling business .
He is known to hold as many as five passports in various aliases and speaks at least six languages , including Russian , Uzbek , Portuguese , French , English , and perhaps several African dialects .
As a young man , his language talents were developed at the Soviet Military Institute of Foreign Languages in Moscow , a primary recruiting vehicle for the GRU , the Soviet military intelligence service .
Whether Bout became a GRU officer remains unknown ( there is speculation he joined the KGB ) , but his post - Soviet career bears a striking similarity to one of the GRU ’s primary Cold War tasks : the provision of weapons to communist movements around the world .
Bout , for his part , was unimpressed by Marxist politics , but the basic mechanics of moving large quantities of military equipment to remote locations he might easily have mastered while in the GRU ’s employ .
After the Soviet Union ’s implosion , Bout went into business for himself , using his connections to gain access to mountains of former Warsaw Pact weapons and ammunition and buying up the old military cargo aircraft required to move them .
There were plenty of paying customers to be served , and in the years that followed , Bout served them all , often working for both sides of a conflict to double his profit .
He armed the Taliban and the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan , the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone , Charles Taylor ’s regime in Liberia , UNITA in Angola , various Congolese factions , and Abu Sayyaf , a militant Islamic group in the Philippines .
As recently as 2006 , says Farah , the arms dealer was believed to be making shipments to the Islamic Courts Union in Somalia and Hezbollah in Lebanon , among many others .
Despite his success on the black market , Bout escaped notice for many years .
“ For a long time , nobody cared , ” says Winer .
“ He had a decade - long period before there was a real understanding of what he was doing , and then we lacked the tools because it was all cross- border . ”
For Bout , the walls began to close in only in March 2001 , when the UN included his name on a “ travel ban ” list for his dealings with Charles Taylor ’s Liberia .
In subsequent years , the Belgian government issued an Interpol “ red notice ” for his arrest , and the U.S. government , through the Treasury Department ’s Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) , incrementally tightened economic sanctions against Bout , ultimately placing him on its list of “ Specially Designated Nationals , ” freezing the assets of any companies or individuals found to have dealings with him .
Prior to Bout ’s arrival in Thailand , there had been several failed attempts to apprehend him .
In February 2002 , British and Belgian police got word that the arms dealer was scheduled to fly into Athens , Greece , but Bout was tipped off at the last minute .
Authorities picked up his trail again in March 2004 , having learned that Bout planned to attend his daughter ’s birthday party in Spain , but the Madrid train bombings caused him to cancel the trip .
“ Sometimes he ’s been lucky , ” says Galeotti .
“ Sometimes he ’s been wily and thought , ‘ Hang on , this does n’t quite pan out right . ’
Other times it may well be that he was tipped off .
He ’s got contacts in all sorts of places .
The story is that he managed to get away with it for as long as he did . ”
IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHEN the DEA ’s investigation of Bout began , but “ it mushroomed and went operational in November , ” says Sanders , the DEA spokesman .
By that time , the agency was running a paid informant ( confidential source 1 , or “ CS - 1 , ” in the federal indictment ) , who was an old acquaintance of Bout associate Andrew Smulian — a contact the DEA would exploit to penetrate Bout ’s inner circle .
Little is known about Smulian , aside from that he is a British citizen who once served as an advisor to one of Bout ’s airlines and had risen to become one of the arms dealer ’s trusted lieutenants .
At the DEA ’s request , CS - 1 emailed Smulian , explaining that he had a business proposition for Bout and requesting that Smulian meet him on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao , a resort haven better known for scuba diving than arms dealing , where he would introduce his old friend to the prospective buyers .
Smulian agreed but , making clear the financial and legal strains his boss was feeling , suggested taking precautions against surveillance .
“ Our man has been made persona non -G — for the world through the UN , ” he wrote back .
“ All assets cash and kind frozen , total value is around 6 Bn USD , and of course no ability to journey anywhere other than home territories .
Listed on US black list … .
All access and communications monitored , and therefore we should not make use of any form of contact , and all existing and past comms are electronically interogated [ sic ] , and copied .
My new phone is OK , since I never call him on that . ”
The meeting took place just after New Year ’s in a Curaçao hotel room .
CS - 1 introduced Smulian to two men , “ CS - 2 ” and “ CS - 3 ” , both undercover DEA informants , who passed themselves off as representatives of the FARC .
CS - 2 played a lower - level FARC operative , while CS - 3 adopted the title of “ El Commandante , ” indicating his supposed high rank within the organization .
Together , they explained their desire to acquire large quantities of heavy weapons , including surface - to - air missiles .
In demonstration of their “ good faith , ” they provided Smulian with $ 5,000 for his time and travel expenses , as well as a new cell phone , which they assured him was safe for his use .
It was not , of course , and immediately investigators began monitoring Smulian ’s communications .
In the days that followed , Smulian used his DEA - monitored phone to call another , apparently higher - ranking member of Bout ’s network , named in the federal indictment as coconspirator 1 ( “ CC - 1 ” ) .
Smulian explained that he needed to visit Bout in Moscow to discuss some business and requested assistance assembling the necessary visas and travel documents .
CC - 1 happily complied , even suggesting some of the city ’s better hotels .
After checking in with Bout , CC - 1 emailed Smulian , conveying their boss ’ request to “ confirm the list ” of weapons before leaving for Moscow .
Smulian replied that the desired shipment was well within Bout ’s means .
“ Standard ground equipment , ” he wrote .
“ Must be good stuff … no rubbish . ”
DEA surveillance records based on remotely conducted phone and Internet traces indicate that Smulian met with Bout in Moscow on Monday , January 21 .
There , the arms dealer displayed a series of photographs of the FARC ’s senior leadership and asked Smulian to identity the buyers from the pictures .
According to Sanders , the informants were not members of the FARC and therefore did not appear in Bout ’s photo file , a detail that perhaps should have caused him to think twice before moving ahead with the deal .
How Smulian responded to Bout ’s effort at due diligence is among the questions left unanswered by the federal indictment .
“ Maybe he convinced Bout that he was dealing with a lower level group than would have been in the pictures , ” Farah speculates .
Certainly , there was a financial incentive for Smulian to get his boss to accept the Colombians as clients .
“ I think Smulian wanted this thing to go through ” and may have “ lied to Bout about who they were , ” says Sanders .
Whatever happened , Bout was convinced enough to proceed , even extending an offer to launder money for the FARC ( at 40 percent interest ) and assuring Smulian that “ any communists are our friends . ”
He instructed Smulian to arrange a meeting with CS - 1 , the informant posing as the lower - ranking FARC operative , and another unknown member of Bout ’s network to go over the details of the purchase .
Ever concerned with security , Bout directed Smulian before leaving Moscow to ditch his cell phones , SIM cards , receipts , and any other evidence that would “ indicate where he had been and with whom he had been meeting , ” according to Bout ’s indictment .
From Moscow , Smulian proceeded to Copenhagen , Denmark , where CS - 1 , his old friend and original hookup on the deal , and the junior FARC operative were waiting .
He relayed to them an offer from Bout .
The Russian had “ 100 pieces ” ( surface - to - air missiles ) available for sale , which he said could be “ air dropped with great accuracy . ”
In return , Bout ’s operation would accept payment , presumably in cash , to be picked up at a remote Colombian airstrip .
Allowing for time to consider the proposal , the men agreed to meet again in a few days in Bucharest , Romania , to continue the negotiations .
By now , with the deal nearing its conclusion , all three DEA informants insisted on a meeting with Bout before finalizing the transaction .
Bout , it seems , was also intrigued to meet his new clients .
Bucharest was selected for this purpose , as it was a country to which he had traveled safely in the past .
Still , Smulian was protective of his boss and urged the Colombians to agree to the deal without meeting Bout , explaining that the Russian was “ a very high profile figure and risked arrest if he traveled to Romania , ” according to the federal indictment .
When the Colombians refused , Smulian called Bout directly and handed the phone to “ El Commandante , ” the senior FARC commander .
The two men discussed possible meeting locations , considering Cuba , Nicaragua , and Armenia , but could not reach an agreement , probably out of the informant ’s concern that local enforcement in those countries might not cooperate with DEA ’s plans to arrest Bout .
Over the next several days , CS - 1 , the supposed FARC representatives , and Smulian continued to hold talks in Bucharest , during which Smulian further clarified the weapons to be included in the shipment .
Bout would provide 100 Igla surface - to - air missiles , Smulian said , showing the buyers pictures and weapon specifications on his laptop .
If desired , the deal could also include armor- piercing rockets and “ special helicopters that can wipe out their helicopters , ” he said , presumably referring to the Colombian military , as well as the training to use them .
The gunships would be equipped with sophisticated missiles and launchers that could fire three rounds at a time , far outmatching any opposition the FARC was likely to encounter .
The goods were currently in Bulgaria , Smulian said , and were ready for immediate delivery .
The shipping cost alone would be $ 5 million .
( The value of the weapons themselves has not been publicly released . )
Smulian provided his FARC customers with a thumb drive containing pictures of the weapons systems he had described , as well as an article about Viktor Bout that included the arms dealer ’s picture , presumably so they would recognize him at a future meeting .
Meanwhile , Bout was making arrangements to travel to Bucharest .
On January 28 , he called Smulian to say that it would be another five to ten days before he would have his Romanian visa .
Smulian said he understood and emphasized how difficult it would be for the buyers to travel to Moscow .
“ You know the one guy , the one you spoke to , he comes from the jungle , ” he told Bout .
“ You know , that ’s a problem , and then the documentation they got is not suitable . ”
“ I see , I see , ” Bout replied .
The next day , the men spoke again .
Smulian assured
Bout that everyone was willing to wait for him in Romania , as long as he really intended to come .
“ One hundred percent sure !
One hundred percent sure !
Wait for me max 10 days .
I am there , ” he said , adding , “ Make sure that [ the deal ] is real . ”
To speed up the processing of his visa , Bout reached out to an associate ( called “ CC - 2 ” in the indictment ) , the head of a Romanian airline who had had dealings with the Russian before .
He said he could help Bout with the visa , but then advised him not to come .
On Christmas Eve , a Romanian television news program had aired a segment linking the airline operator to Bout ’s network .
He told the arms dealer that Romania was now too dangerous to visit .
When after two weeks Bout had yet to appear in Bucharest , the DEA informants seem to have given up hope of luring him there .
On February 7 , CS - 2 , the informant posing as the junior FARC operative , called Bout on Smulian ’s cell phone to say he and his partner were leaving Romania .
“ Our organization always needs friends like you that want to help us out , ” he told Bout , and explained that he was leaving an email address with Smulian ( bogotazo32@yahoo.com ) , which could be used to contact him in the future .
Bout assured him he would be in touch in two to three weeks .
Bout ’s email arrived five days later .
It read , “ Buenos Dias !
This is e mail we can use for communication [ .]
Best regards [ , ] Friend of Andrew . ”
The DEA traced the message to a computer in Moscow .
Perhaps not wanting to appear overeager , the informants did not immediately respond , instead waiting for the next contact .
It came from Smulian , who wanted to confirm that Bout ’s message had been received .
“ These days there can be confusion with all the spam coming in , ” he wrote apologetically .
By now , Bout was growing impatient to close the deal and broke protocol by calling CS - 2 directly .
The informant explained that he and “ El Commandante ” would be traveling to Thailand in the near future .
Bout immediately agreed to meet them in Bangkok .
SITTING HANDCUFFED
IN the headquarters of the Royal Thai Police ’s Crime Suppression Division , Viktor Bout may have been remembering how his supposed FARC clients had not appeared in his collection of mug shots back in Moscow .
He sat quietly without expression in the same orange polo shirt and tan slacks he had worn to the ill - fated meeting in the hotel earlier that day .
A large man and overweight , his belly slopped over his belt as photographers gathered outside in the hall sneaked pictures whenever the door opened with the coming and going of excited police officers .
His fate now lies in the hands of the Thai legal system , where police can hold Bout for up to 84 days without charges while they determine whether he used Thailand as a negotiating site for deals with foreign terrorists .
If found guilty , he could face up to 10 years in Thai prison , most likely the one in which he already resides , Klong Prem , long the destination of foreign sex tourists and money launderers .
The United States is seeking Bout ’s extradition to stand trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of conspiring to provide weapons to a known terrorist organization .
He could serve up to 15 years if convicted .
( Smulian , who was reportedly with Bout in Bangok , is currently in U.S. custody , though it ’s unclear how he got there . )
Meanwhile , Stephen Rapp , the UN ’s chief prosecutor at the Special Court for Sierra Leone , has expressed interest in prosecuting Bout for fueling the violence in that country with illegal weapons shipments in the 1990s .
( Russia , which provided Bout with sanctuary and a secure base of operations for the last several years , decided against seeking his extradition .
According to the Washington Times , however , the Russian government has appealed to the State Department for assistance in getting Bout released from Thai custody . )
Whatever happens to Bout , the sophisticated arms - trafficking network he assembled seems unlikely to survive his incarceration .
“ It ’s hard to imagine his brother or any of his deputies having the wherewithal to manage the empire as adroitly and fully as he did , ” says Whitney Schneidman , a former deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs during the Clinton years and one of the first people to recognize the threat Bout posed to the region .
Even if he were released after only a few years , it ’s a virtual certainty that by then others will have risen to take his place .
“ There are more small - time operators , and I wonder how long it is before one or two of them fill the vacuum , ” says Galeotti , the Russian crime expert .
For the moment , however , a void has been opened in the black market for military weapons .
“ There ’s no one quite like Viktor , ” Galeotti continues .
“ There was n’t really room for two Viktor Bouts . ”
To be sure , weapons will still flow illegally across borders , but the service Bout provided , the “ one - stop shop , ” is not known to exist anywhere else .
“ With Bout you were buying real capacity , ” explains Winer , the former deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement .
“ That was the game he was in : ‘ You hire me , and I ’ll get you the critical stuff you need to change the correlation of forces . ' ”
It was a unique service and one that Bout used to corner the market .
“ Most operations , you have one guy do the weapons , another guy to find transport , [ and ] another person has to figure out where to land it , ” says Farah .
With Bout out of the picture , shipments will be “ more costly , less efficient , and more time consuming . ”
But do n’t expect the business of arms trafficking to suffer too much .
As Galeotti notes , “ Viktor Bout did not create the market .
He was able very effectively to capitalize on it , but he did n’t create it , and where there ’s a market , there will be other suppliers . ”

This is a gorgeous look at some of Disney ’s classic romantic moments .
Heartbreaking Eskimo Love | “ Love is an Arrow ” Music Video
Of course , true love does n’t always run smoothly .
I teared up watching the film clip for “ Love is an Arrow ” by Aberfeldy .
I thought the song referred to Cupid ’s arrow that pierced the hearts of these super -cute Eskimos .
But love is an arrow because it hurts !
Cool Body Art Cartoon | How We Met
This is one of the coolest animations I ’ve seen because it uses human bodies as a canvas .
Really , for a cartoon about love it makes perfect sense .
This is very cleverly done , and completely heartwarming .
We all needed that to get over the Eskimos right ?
Cynical Don Hertzfeldt Cartoon | Ah , L’Amour
This video ’s a bit cynical , but I ’m sure the guys out there will agree with me that it ’s also quite accurate !
I have to admire our hero who continues to politely proposition women no matter how much they crush him .
Will his persistence be rewarded with true love ?
Awesome Flip - Book Animation | Making Love
After the cynicism of the last video I figured I should end on something warm and fuzzy .
The French are some of the most romantic people in the world , so it seems fitting to end on a French cartoon .
While the animated characters in this video are falling in love , the people turning the pages are doing the same thing !
Published in : Gmail - GSuite
Gmail has certain email sending limits in place and you are only allowed to send a limited number of email messages per day .
If you exceed the daily quota , Google may temporarily disable your Gmail account without any warnings and you may have to wait for up to 24 hours before you can regain access to your Gmail mailbox .
Gmail has another restriction on the total number of recipients you can email per day so you cannot use CC or BCC to bypass the daily email sending limit .
Also , these limits are different for apps like Mail Merge for Gmail that send emails via the Gmail API .
Gmail Limits for Sending Email
Gmail is n’t designed for sending bulk email .
If you are planning to send an email message to a large group of friends using Gmail , do read the following rules to avoid temporary lockdown of your Gmail :
Rule 1 : You can send emails to a maximum of 500 recipients per day through the Gmail website .
If you are a Google Apps for Work user , your daily limit is 10000 email recipients per day .
If the limit is exceeded , Gmail account may get temporarily disabled with the error - “ Gmail Lockdown in Section 4 . ”
It is important to note that this limit is around recipients and not messages .
Thus you can send 10 emails with 50 recipients each or 1 email can be addressed to a maximum of 500 people .
Rule 2 : If you access Gmail via POP or IMAP clients , like Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail , you can send an email message to a maximum of 100 people at a time .
This also includes email sent through smtp-relay.gmail.com or smtp.gmail.com servers .
If you exceed the limit , your account may be disabled for a day with the error - “ 550 5.4.5 Daily sending quota exceeded . ”
Rule 3 : Always double check email addresses of recipients before hitting the Send button .
Google will temporarily disable your account if you send messages to more than 500 recipients or if you send a large number of undeliverable messages .
This often happens when people use mailing lists that contain non-existent or broken email addresses that bounce back on failed delivery .
See : How to Verify an Email Address

Zbigniew Brzezinski
The Grand Chessboard
American Primacy And It 's Geostrategic Imperatives
Key Quotes From Zbigniew Brzezinksi's Seminal 1998 Book
Note :
For highly revealing news articles on elite groups and secret societies in which Zbigniew Brzezinski is involved , click here .
" Ever since the continents started interacting politically , some five hundred years ago , Eurasia has been the center of world power . " - ( p. xiii )
" It is imperative that no Eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating Eurasia and thus of also challenging America .
The formulation of a comprehensive and integrated Eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book . " ( p. xiv )
" How America ' manages ' Eurasia is critical .
A power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world 's three most advanced and economically productive regions .
A mere glance at the map also suggests that control over Eurasia would almost automatically entail Africa 's subordination , rendering the Western Hemisphere and Oceania geopolitically peripheral to the world 's central continent .
About 75 per cent of the world 's people live in Eurasia , and most of the world 's physical wealth is there as well , both in its enterprises and underneath its soil .
Eurasia accounts for about three - fourths of the world 's known energy resources . " ( p.31 )
" Never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy .
But the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion , except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the public 's sense of domestic well - being .
The economic self - denial ( that is , defense spending ) and the human sacrifice ( casualties , even among professional soldiers ) required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts .
Democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization . " ( p.35 )
" The momentum of Asia 's economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the Central Asian region and the Caspian Sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of Kuwait , the Gulf of Mexico , or the North Sea . " ( p.125 )
" In the long run , global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state .
Hence , America is not only the first , as well as the only , truly global superpower , but it is also likely to be the very last . " ( p.209 )
" Moreover , as America becomes an increasingly multi-cultural society , it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues , except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat . " ( p. 211 )

The Grand Chessboard by Zbigniew Brzezinski – More Quotes
" The last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed a tectonic shift in world affairs .
For the first time ever , a non-Eurasian power has emerged not only as a key arbiter of Eurasian power relations but also as the world 's paramount power .
The defeat and collapse of the Soviet Union was the final step in the rapid ascendance of a Western Hemisphere power , the United States , as the sole and , indeed , the first truly global power . " ( p. xiii )
" The attitude of the American public toward the external projection of American power has been much more ambivalent .
The public supported America 's engagement in World War II largely because of the shock effect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . " ( pp 24 -5 )
" For America , the chief geopolitical prize is Eurasia ...
Now a non-Eurasian power is preeminent in Eurasia - and America 's global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the Eurasian continent is sustained . " ( p.30 )
" America 's withdrawal from the world or because of the sudden emergence of a successful rival - would produce massive international instability .
It would prompt global anarchy . " ( p. 30 )
" Two basic steps are thus required : first , to identify the geostrategically dynamic Eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them ; ... second , to formulate specific U.S. policies to offset , co-opt , and / or control the above ... " ( p. 40 )
" To put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires , the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals , to keep tributaries pliant and protected , and to keep the barbarians from coming together . " ( p.40 )
" Henceforth , the United States may have to determine how to cope with regional coalitions that seek to push America out of Eurasia , thereby threatening America 's status as a global power . " ( p.55 )
" Uzbekistan , nationally the most vital and the most populous of the central Asian states , represents the major obstacle to any renewed Russian control over the region .
Its independence is critical to the survival of the other Central Asian states , and it is the least vulnerable to Russian pressures . " ( p. 121 )
[ Referring to an area he calls the " Eurasian Balkans " and a 1997 map in which he has circled the exact location of the current conflict - describing it as the central region of pending conflict for world dominance ]
" Moreover , they [ the Central Asian Republics ] are of importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors , namely Russia , Turkey and Iran , with China also signaling an increasing political interest in the region .
But the Eurasian Balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize : an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region , in addition to important minerals , including gold . " ( p.124 )
" The world 's energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades .
Estimates by the U.S. Department of energy anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015 , with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the Far East .
The momentum of Asia 's economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the Central Asian region and the Caspian Sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of Kuwait , the Gulf of Mexico , or the North Sea . " ( p.125 )
" Uzbekistan is , in fact , the prime candidate for regional leadership in Central Asia . " ( p.130 )
" Once pipelines to the area have been developed , Turkmenistan 's truly vast natural gas reserves augur a prosperous future for the country 's people . " ( p.132 )
" In fact , an Islamic revival - already abetted from the outside not only by Iran but also by Saudi Arabia - is likely to become the mobilizing impulse for the increasingly pervasive new nationalisms , determined to oppose any reintegration under Russian - and hence infidel - control . " ( p. 133 ) .
" For Pakistan , the primary interest is to gain Geostrategic depth through political influence in Afghanistan - and to deny to Iran the exercise of such influence in Afghanistan and Tajikistan - and to benefit eventually from any pipeline construction linking Central Asia with the Arabian Sea . " ( p.139 )
" Turkmenistan ... has been actively exploring the construction of a new pipeline through Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Arabian Sea ... " ( p.145 )
" It follows that America 's primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it . " ( p148 )
" China 's growing economic presence in the region and its political stake in the area 's independence are also congruent with America 's interests . " ( p.149 )
" America is now the only global superpower , and Eurasia is the globe 's central arena .
Hence , what happens to the distribution of power on the Eurasian continent will be of decisive importance to America 's global primacy and to America 's historical legacy . " ( p.194 )
" Without sustained and directed American involvement , before long the forces of global disorder could come to dominate the world scene .
And the possibility of such a fragmentation is inherent in the geopolitical tensions not only of today 's Eurasia but of the world more generally . " ( p.194 )
" With warning signs on the horizon across Europe and Asia , any successful American policy must focus on Eurasia as a whole and be guided by a Geostrategic design . " ( p.197 )
" That puts a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order to prevent the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge America 's primacy . " ( p. 198 )
" The most immediate task is to make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacity to expel the United States from Eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role . " ( p. 198 )
" Moreover , as America becomes an increasingly multi-cultural society , it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues , except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat . " ( p. 211 )

Suicide bombings at highest numbers in history since Iraq invasion RAW STORY
Published : Friday April 18 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Surge : 2007 saw double number of bombings of any year ever recorded Suicide bombings have risen to their highest levels in recorded history since the invasion of Iraq , according to a new report buried on page A18 of Friday 's Washington Post .
Of the 1840 suicide bombings since 1983 , the year a suicide bomber attacked the US Embassy in Lebanon , 920 -- or 50 percent -- of suicide bombings have occurred since the United States invaded Iraq in 2003 .
More than 82 % of the suicide bombings last year were in Iraq .
The number of bombings last year , 658 , was more than twice the number of attacks at any point in the last 25 years .
The unpublished research was compiled by US government experts and leaked on condition of anonymity .
Suicide bombers engaged in 658 strikes across the globe in 2007 ; 542 were in U.S. - occupied Afghanistan and Iraq .
More than four - fifths of the suicide bombings over that period have occurred in the past seven years , the data show .
The bombings have spread to dozens of countries on five continents , killed more than 21,350 people and injured about 50,000 since 1983 , when a landmark attack blew up the U.S. Embassy in Beirut .
Today is the 25 - year anniversary of that attack , the first of a series of large suicide bombings targeting Americans overseas .
" Increasingly , we are seeing the globalization of suicide bombs , no longer confined to conflict zones but happening anywhere , " said Mohammed Hafez of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , Calif. , and author of the book " Suicide Bombers in Iraq . "
He calls the contemporary perpetrators " martyrs without borders . "
The unpublished data show that since 1983 , bombers in more than 50 groups from Argentina to Algeria , Croatia to China , and India to Indonesia have adapted car bombs to make explosive belts , vests , toys , motorcycles , bikes , boats , backpacks and false - pregnancy stomachs .
Of 1,840 incidents in the past 25 years , more than 86 percent have occurred since 2001 , and the highest annual numbers have occurred in the past four years .
The sources who provided the data to The Washington Post asked that they not be identified because of the sensitivity of the tallies .
The data show more than 920 suicide bombings in Iraq and more than 260 in Afghanistan , including some that killed scores of U.S. troops .
All occurred after the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 .
The exact number of U.S. casualties from the bombs in Iraq is classified " because it might show the effectiveness of the enemy 's weapon , " said Maj .
Brad Leighton , a U.S. spokesman in Iraq .
" They wo n't even give the number to me . "

House to investigate defense contract to firm that shipped Chinese - made ammo to Afghanistan Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday March 27 , 2008

This A lengthy investigation published Thursday reveals that the Pentagon gave an inexperienced 22 - year - old a $ 300 million contract to provide ammunition to Afghanistan .
The shady deal resulted in decades old , substandard munitions being delivered to US and Afghan troops fighting on the front lines of the war on terror .
Following publication of a lengthy New York Times article , the House Oversight Committee announced it would investigate AEY Inc. , a fledgling company that thrived after 2003 as the US government began handing out billions of dollars to private defense contractors .
Chairman Henry Waxman invited company officials as well as representatives of the State and Defense departments to testify at a hearing next month , according to a news release .
The results of that investigation , which sent seven reporters across three continents , were published Thursday .
But to arm the Afghan forces that it hopes will lead this fight , the American military has relied since early last year on a fledgling company led by a 22 - year - old man whose vice president was a licensed masseur .
With the award last January of a federal contract worth as much as nearly $ 300 million , the company , AEY Inc. , which operates out of an unmarked office in Miami Beach , became the main supplier of munitions to Afghanistans army and police forces .
Since then , the company has provided ammunition that is more than 40 years old and in decomposing packaging , according to an examination of the munitions by The New York Times and interviews with American and Afghan officials .
Much of the ammunition comes from the aging stockpiles of the old Communist bloc , including stockpiles that the State Department and NATO have determined to be unreliable and obsolete , and have spent millions of dollars to have destroyed .
In purchasing munitions , the contractor has also worked with middlemen and a shell company on a federal list of entities suspected of illegal arms trafficking .
The company 's president was 22 - year - old Efraim E. Diveroli , who ran the company with a 25 - year - old from Miami Beach , Florida .
Waxman has requested that Diveroli testify , along with company vice president David M. Packouz and Levi Meyer its general manager .
On his MySpace page , Diveroli claims that " problems in high school " forced him to work through most of his teenage years , but that " of course im ( sic ) a super nice guy !!! "
" I finally got a decent apartment and im ( sic ) content for the moment , " he writes on the page , " however i ( sic ) definately ( sic ) have the desire to be very successful in my business and this does take up alot ( sic ) of my time .
After the Times began asking questions about the suspicious contract , the Army suspended the company from future contract efforts .
The Associated Press confirms that the company 's contracts have been suspended because it shipped Chinese - made ammunition " in violation of its contract and US law . "
AEY is apparently still in business , and it is hiring , according to this Craigslist ad .
When asked about the report , a woman who answered the phone at the number listed told RAW STORY , " I 'm sorry , I 'm not at liberty to comment on that .
Have a nice day . "
She immediately hung up .
Ammo provided by AEY included some manufactured in China more than 40 years ago , and other munitions provided by the company were in such bad shape , the Army decided not to use it , according to the Times .
Diveroli apparently had little experience in arms procurement , and the Times article suggests his dealings with the Albanian government were corrupt .
An audio recording of Diveroli , mentioned in the article , was discovered on this YouTube site apparently based in Hong Kong .
A transcript is available here .
The company and the Army would not divulge where the ammunition AEY provided came from , but the Times reports that interviews and records from several sources show the company " shopped from stocks in the old Eastern bloc , including Albania , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Kazakhstan , Montenegro , Romania and Slovakia . "
In the audio recording , Diveroli is speaking to Kosta Trebicka , an Albanian businessman , about Ylli Pinari , director of an Albanian agency in charge of arms exports .
Diveroli says he " ca n't play monkey business with the mafia ... and all those fucking guys in Albania " because his contract is with the US government and " everyone is watching me . "
Trebicka , who was acting as a middle man for the deal , said " Pinari and his mafia guys ... will create lots of problems , " but he tried to calm the young AEY president .
" Probably I will be invited in Washington DC from the CIA guys and from my friends over there , " Trebicka tells Diveroli in the conversation recorded June 11 , 2007 .
" Two weeks from now I will come to Florida to shake hands with you and discuss future deals . "
Diveroli stresses to Trebicka the need to push a Pinari to go through with a a sale of material , according to the recording .
" Call him up , beg him , kiss him , whatever ... "
Diveroli tells his Albanian contact .
" Send one of your girls to fuck him ...
Let 's get him happy .
Maybe he gives you one more chance to do the job .
No ? "
The Times says Diveroli was entering a shady and lightly regulated world .
The international arms business operates partly in the light and partly in shadows , and is littered with short - lived shell companies , middlemen and official corruption .
Governments have tried to regulate it more closely for years , with limited success .
As Mr. Diveroli began to fill the Armys huge orders , he was entering a shadowy world , and in his brief interview he suggested that he was aware that corruption could intrude on his dealings in Albania .
 What goes on in the Albanian Ministry of Defense ?  he said .
 Whos clean ?
Whos dirty ?
Dont want to know about it .
The way AEYs business was structured , Mr. Diveroli , at least officially , did not deal directly with Albanian officials .
Instead , a middleman company registered in Cyprus , Evdin Ltd. , bought the ammunition and sold it to his company .
The local packager involved in the deal , Mr. Trebicka , said that he suspected that Evdins purpose was to divert money to Albanian officials .
Albanian political observers say the Times story just begins to scratch the surface of corruption there .
" There is more to this story , " writes Gary Q. Kokalari , a political analyst , reacting to the Times article .
" Stay tuned . "
UPDATE : 22 - year - old 's civilian ammo business revealed
" Let me just describe to you the way our system works , " she said in response to a question during a news conference at Pittsburgh International Airport .
" Policy is set by the civilian leadership .
The president of the United States sets the policy .
Our military , and thankfully so , carries out the policy that is set . "
House committee asks Rove to testify about Alabama governor Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday April 17 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The House Judiciary Committee is taking Karl Rove up on an offer to testify about claims that he influenced a federal corruption case against former Democratic Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama .
Calling
Rove the " missing link " in its investigation into politicization of the justice department , the committee on Thursday asked the former White House adviser to appear under oath soon .
The panel also wants the Justice Department 's inspector general to investigate allegations that political motivations drove the Siegelman case and several other federal prosecutions during the Bush administration .
" There continue to be numerous complaints of selective or politically motivated prosecution since our investigation began last year .
The actions we are taking today , including calling Karl Rove to testify , are an effort to get to the bottom of this matter , " Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers said .
" The Justice Department has simply not been forthcoming , " he continued , " and I feel the only way to move this investigation forward is to seek further independent investigation and testimony from Karl Rove , who appears to be the missing link in a chain from the White House to the Justice Department . "
Rove has denied any involvement in the Siegelman prosecution .
His attorney told MSNBC earlier this month that Rove would testify on the matter .
The Judiciary Committee also released a 40 - page report ( .pdf ) on selective , politically motivated prosecutions within the Justice Department .
Because the Department of Justice has largely refused to cooperate with the Committees investigation , key facts remain unknown and reliable final judgments cannot be made .
However , given the troublesome facts identified to date , it is clear at a minimum that current and former Department leadership has been derelict in failing to review these matters and reassure the American people that federal law enforcement is impartial and fair .
In a letter to Rove , Conyers says the report offers " evidence suggesting that you or other high - level Washington officials may have been involved in the Siegelman matter and describes several other disturbing and potentially political aspects of the prosecution . "
RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna has covered the Siegelman case extensively in her the Permanent Republican Majority series .
It can be read here : Part I , Part II , Part III .
She also has documented allegations that Rove is trying to smear a whistleblower in the case .

On Tuesday , Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson waited .
Around noon , he was driven from his home outside Albany to the Capitol , raising expectations that Gov. Eliot Spitzer would soon resign and that Mr. Paterson was about to become the state ’s 55th governor  and the first African - American to hold the post .
Neither happened .
Mr. Paterson returned home and waited some more .
With Mr. Spitzer ’s political future in grave doubt , Mr. Paterson , 53 , a Brooklyn - born and Harlem - bred politician , has become Albany ’s man of the moment .
Widely considered smart , amiable and disarmingly candid , he is also largely untested .
In 2006 , Mr. Paterson surprised the Democratic establishment by giving up the possibility of becoming majority leader if the Democrats captured the State Senate  one of Albany ’s muscular three men in the room  to run for lieutenant governor , a largely ceremonial post .
But this week , Mr. Paterson ’s political gamble suddenly appeared to be on the brink of paying off , if in an unexpected and unintended way .
If Mr. Spitzer resigns , Mr. Paterson would become only the third black governor of any state since Reconstruction .
* Illustration : Harry Campbell * I have the most awesome mobile phone .
You would n't believe the sick stuff it can do .
There 's a webcam for videoconferencing , email , a full browser , and instant messaging .
I can install whatever apps I want —
Rhapsody 's music service , SSH clients , document and spreadsheet editors , even software to access my desktop machine remotely .
Oh yeah :
It also makes free voice - over - IP calls .
It cost $ 400 .
It incinerates the iPhone .
The only catch : I had to build it myself .
My " phone " is actually a pimped - out Nokia N800 , a pocket - sized tablet computer .
Technically , it 's not a phone at all , but because it 's Linux - based and has built - in Wi -Fi , it can run tons of great software .
I loaded Skype , and presto — voice - call functionality whenever I 'm near a wireless network , which nowadays is basically always .
So why can't your handset work this way , too ?
If the hardware and software are all available to make these incredible do - it - all phones — how come the wireless carriers are n't rolling them out ?
Because the wireless mobile industry is the laziest and least innovative sector of the entire high tech world , full stop .
It 's more interested in preserving its old - school profit mechanisms than in breaking new ground .
Cellular - industry critics have been complaining about this for years .
As they point out , phone companies rake in millions by overcharging for things that cost little to provide — a buck or two for a ringtone or TV - show snippet here ; a few cents for extra text messages there .
Much like the record labels with CDs , they 're wringing all the money they can from these old economics .
Only a few high - end smartphones can be customized with software you select .
With virtually every other phone , you 're stuck with those apps the wireless companies will permit you to download via their network — for a tidy fee , of course .
Why would they let you download freeware games when they can ding you $ 7 to play a Tetris rehash ?
This is also why so few phones have Wi-Fi .
If they did , you 'd simply tap into free nodes instead of suffering through your mobile carrier 's glacially slow data network .
It was a minor miracle that AT&T let Apple put Wi-Fi into the iPhone — though notice they 're certainly not letting anyone install Skype on it .
AT&T 's creaking , 1980s - era business model must be protected at all costs , no matter how much it makes your phone suck .
Wireless executives have many excuses for their paternalistic behavior .
They need to keep phones locked down , they claim , because if customers downloaded all sorts of freeware , it could wreak havoc with their network .
I do n't buy it .
Indeed , I could disprove it with a simple hack .
Verizon offers a laptop card for $ 60 that lets you access unlimited high - speed data anywhere Verizon covers .
I could rebroadcast that signal via Wi -Fi or Bluetooth to my N800 — and then use Skype to make phone calls on Verizon 's wireless network .
The only thing I 'd be hurting is the bottom line .
It 's a kludge , but such a setup shows that the various components for killer phones — fast networks , free software , cheap hardware — all exist .
The sole obstacle to their being assembled is the wireless carriers ' desire to protect an antediluvian business that its consumers loathe .
So , is there hope ?
The OpenMoko project is working on an open source , Wi-Fi-enabled phone that works on any GSM network .
That 's pretty cool .
In my more feverish dreams , the government actually grows a pair and realizes that we , the public , own the airwaves that the wireless companies so mightily abuse — and the FCC simply forces the carriers to open up their services to true smartphones .
( Google 's lobbying for this , with no success yet . )
Or here 's an even more delirious vision :
A venture capitalist funds a next - generation mobile - phone carrier that blankets the nation in Wi-Fi , then uses that as a backbone for truly PC - like handsets .
I can dream , I guess .
Until then , if you want a phone of the future like mine , you 'll have to build it yourself .

98 % of men say they do it ; the other 2 % are lying .
But far from it being something to be embarrassed about , researchers have strong indications that this very common activity could have uncommon effects in reducing the risk of prostate cancer .
I ’m talking about , dare I say it , masturbation folks .
I took a lot of flak recently for suggesting that good hydration can reduce the risk of getting certain cancers .
So , I decided to do a little digging around on natural , cheap and effective ways to reduce the risk of cancer .
BBC news , a place I rely upon for much of my world news , came to my rescue .
And while I know the topic will probably cause even more controversy , I think it ’s worth the discussion .
We ’re all adults here folks .
The masturbation study was conducted by the Cancer Council Victoria , in Melbourne Australia .
It was actually a study in response to research that suggested high levels of sexual activity with numerous partners increased a man ’s risk of prostate cancer by up to 40 % .
However , the study did n’t take into account the fact that ejaculation may in fact be a way to help flush out carcinogens from the prostate .
While safety concerns are raised when having a lot of sex , there is nothing at all unsafe about masturbation ( well , I guess that depends on how you do it .
The Michael Hutchence case springs to mind ) .
There are various prostate health drugs and vitamins on the market , including Saw Palmetto , which cost varying amounts .
Some Protate Health combinations can cost $ 30 - $ 40 a month .
And yet , science is saying the simplest way to prevent prostate cancer , gents , is to take matters into your own hands … literally .
And not only does it feel a lot better than taking a vitamin , it ’s also free .
So , how many times should you " do it ? "
The magic number seems to be almost daily .
From the article …
Men who ejaculated more than five times a week were a third less likely to develop prostate cancer later in life .
Australian researchers questioned over 1,000 men who had developed prostate cancer and 1,250 who had not about their sexual habits .
They found those who had ejaculated the most between the ages of 20 and 50 were the least likely to develop the cancer .
The protective effect was greatest while the men were in their 20s .
Researchers also have a theory that regular ejaculation helps the prostate gland mature , which makes it less susceptible to carcinogens .
Dr Chris Hiley , head of policy and research at the UK's Prostate Cancer Charity , told BBC News Online : " This is a plausible theory . "
She added : " In the same way the human papillomavirus has been linked to cervical cancer , there is a suggestion that bits of prostate cancer may be related to a sexually transmitted infection earlier in life . "
So forget the ridiculous tales of hairy palms and blindness .
Not only is there nothing wrong with masturbation , it ’s considered to be a healthy and cancer - preventing part of your daily routine .
Go for it .

Charlton Heston was a pioneer in using celebrity status to advocate on single - issue politics .
Guns and Moses
Last December , Bob Dylan literally stopped the music on his " Theme Time Radio Hour " show to honor Charlton Heston .
Following the soulful tune “ Eve ’s Ten Commandments , ” Dylan mentioned Heston ’s iconic role as Moses in the well - known biblical epic and added , “ Charlton gets a bad rap for his strong conservative beliefs and involvement with the NRA , but truth to tell , he was a strong advocate for civil rights , many years before it became fashionable …. ”

Dylan ticked off Heston ’s accolades , including the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement Award , and then added , admiringly , “ Never mind the fact that he ’s in a couple of our favorite movies , including ‘ Touch of Evil , ’ ‘ The Big Country , ’ ‘ Planet of the Apes ’ and of course ‘ Soylent Green . ’ ”
It could stand as a fitting eulogy for Heston , who died Saturday at the age of 84 , except for one thing :
He did n’t seem to mind that “ bad rap ” he got in liberal Hollywood for his political beliefs .
Indeed , he embraced his political conservatism unlike any other actor in the business .
Using his image and celebrity to champion the Second Amendment and gun-rights legislation for more than two decades , Heston ’s advocacy of a single political issue is matched by few modern actors .
Certainly George Clooney , Michael J. Fox and Leonardo DiCaprio have all been closely identified with such issues as Darfur , stem cell research and environmentalism — but none is so contentious as that of gun control .
And Heston has never shied away from controversy .
In 1992 , he condemned the infamous Ice - T rap song “ Cop Killer , ” then released by a Time Warner - distributed music label .
Biting the hand that had fed him , Heston showed up at a Time Warner shareholders ’ meeting at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel covered by this reporter .
He lashed out against the giant corporation whose studio had cast him in so many movies .
He harshly admonished its top executives for releasing the song , then simply , eloquently read the lyrics .
Few there had ever heard the actual words before , and as Heston recited the homicidal , anti-police rant inspired by the Rodney King assault , the room filled with his booming baritone .
When he finished , the place was so stunned you could hear a pin drop .
More recently , Heston ’s presidency of the National Rifle Association of America from 1998 to 2003 defined him for a new generation .
He made history at the first NRA convention of the new millennium by holding a handmade Brooks flintlock musket above his head and declaring that the then - presidential Democratic candidate Al Gore would have to pry his Second Amendment rights “ from my cold , dead hands . ”
Vilified by the left , he was condemned by Michael Moore in the Oscar - winning 2002 documentary “ Bowling for Columbine , ” with Moore haranguing him for supporting a pro-gun rally in Denver immediately following the Columbine High School massacre .
In a now - famous scene from the film , Heston starts to answer Moore ’s questions but then just walks away in the middle of the interview , leaving the filmmaker alone at his L.A. home .
On Sunday , Moore ’s website featured a black - bordered photo of Heston , along with a caption noting the Heston family requested donations to the Motion Picture and Television Fund in lieu of flowers .
“ Heston understood the power of image and celebrity to draw attention to issues ” long before others did , says Howard Bragman of the Hollywood public relations firm Fifteen Minutes .
“ He played larger than life characters including Ben Hur and Moses , and realized the power that went along with those images . ”
Even though his most famous characters lived in ancient times , “ they stood for leadership and standing strong against people who did n’t agree with them , ” says Bragman , adding that Heston ’s “ authenticity ” gave him credibility to speak out for those issues he deemed important .
Of course , Ben Hur was a slave , and Heston ’s first efforts in political activism came about in the early 1960s , when he protested segregationist policies .
In May 1961 , Heston walked a picket line in front of a whites - only restaurant in Oklahoma City , part of a long campaign involving thousands of demonstrators who fought against downtown businesses discriminating against black patrons .
In his 1995 autobiography , “ In the Arena , ” he explained how civil rights “ was also part of my expanded persona , riding the tiger . ”
In later years , he would recall his early activism and tie it directly into his stance on gun owners ’ rights , explaining that both struggles were bound into his support for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
“ Jesse Jackson and Louie Farrakhan know I fought in their cultural war , ” Heston told the Free Congress Foundation ’s 20th anniversary gala in 1997 .
“ I was one of the first white soldiers in the civil rights movement in 1961 , long before it was fashionable in Hollywood — believe me — or in Washington for that matter .
In 1963 I marched on Washington with Dr. Martin Luther King to uphold the Bill of Rights .
I 'm very proud of that .
As [ then -] vice president of the NRA I am doing the same thing . ”
Heston would often talk about how he hunted as a child “ only to put food on the table ” during the Depression , and later spoke fondly of his Army Colt .45 pistol he brought back from duty as a bomber gunner during WWII , confessing that he always slept with the .45 beside his bed .
After opposing the Vietnam War and supporting liberal measures such as LBJ ’s Gun Control Act of 1968 ( “ I was young and foolish , ” he told Time Magazine ) , he voted for Richard Nixon in 1972 .
During the 1980s as the Reagan Revolution took hold , Heston became more vocal in the pro-gun movement and joined the conservative wing of the Republican Party , opposing affirmative action , decrying political correctness and speaking out against abortion .
But to many Americans , Heston ’s legacy will rest on two touchstones : his iconic performance as Moses in “ The Ten Commandments ” and his emphatic support for the National Rifle Association .
He even got into a war of words with George Clooney back in 2003 , when Clooney lamely joked that Heston ’s ultra -conservative stance came from Alzheimer ’s .
Asked if he went too far with his remarks , Clooney said he did n’t care and that , because Heston was the head of the NRA , he deserved “ whatever anyone says about him . ”
But , indeed , Heston did suffer from Alzheimer ’s disease and Clooney later wrote him a letter of apology .

Jets flew over the parade
Iran has been displaying its military power at a ceremony to mark the country 's annual army day .
Speaking at the parade , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran was the most powerful nation in the world .
The country 's strength was such that no major power would dare to challenge its security , he said .
Official media claimed the ceremony included the largest ever show of aerial strength , with a fly past by almost 200 aircraft .
There was also a huge military parade , with missiles displayed on trucks .
Confidence
Top officials have made much of Iran 's achievements in being able to maintain and manufacture sophisticated military aircraft or other equipment despite US sanctions against it .
President Ahmadinejad expressed his confidence in the strength of the country 's armed forces .
He said Iran was now so powerful that " none of the current world powers are capable of , and have the courage to , threaten the Iranian nation and its interests and security " .
The president stressed that Iran 's armed forces were purely defensive , but warned that they would respond strongly to any act of aggression .
The parade comes amid continuing tension between Iran and the West over Tehran 's controversial nuclear programme .
It also follows a recent war of words between Iran and Israel , in which an Iranian deputy army commander said that if Israel attacked Iran , it would be eliminated from the global arena .

ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) - Turkey ’s armed forces killed 15 members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) in northern Iraq on Thursday using long - range land weapons , and then followed up with air strikes , they said on Saturday .
It was the first time Turkish forces had killed a group of Kurdish rebels inside northern Iraq since the end of a large - scale ground incursion into the neighboring country last month , according to information given by the armed forces .
The General Staff said on its website that the militants were trying to cross into Turkey , where they planned an attack .
The army fired on the separatists with long - range weapons , killing 15 , and then launched air strikes in the same area of northern Iraq on Friday .
It was unclear how many had been killed in the air strikes .
On the other side of the border on Saturday , troops pursued rebels in the mountainous province of Sirnak , backed up by attack helicopters , security sources said .
Turkish warplanes and artillery have periodically bombed and shelled PKK positions in northern Iraq over several months , helped by intelligence provided by U.S. forces in Iraq .
On February 21 , the military launched a major ground incursion against the PKK , sending thousands of troops into Iraq .
The General Staff says 240 rebels were killed in the week - long campaign , along with 27 of its own men .
The cross - border operation prompted concern in Washington about further regional instability and was watched closely in Turkey ’s financial markets .
Turkey blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people , mostly Kurds , since the group began its armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984 .
Turkey , like the European Union and United States , considers the PKK a terrorist organization .
LAWTON , N.D.  Whatever Dennis Miller decides to plant this year on his 2,760 - acre farm , the world needs .
Wheat prices have doubled in the last six months .
Corn is on a tear .
Barley , sunflower seeds , canola and soybeans are all up sharply .
“ For once , there ’s great reason to be optimistic , ” Mr. Miller said .
But the prices that have renewed Mr. Miller ’s faith in farming are causing pain far and wide .
A tailor in Lagos , Nigeria , named Abel Ojuku said recently that he had been forced to cut back on the bread he and his family love .
“ If you wanted to buy three loaves , now you buy one , ” Mr. Ojuku said .
Everywhere , the cost of food is rising sharply .
Whether the world is in for a long period of continued increases has become one of the most urgent issues in economics .
Many factors are contributing to the rise , but the biggest is runaway demand .
In recent years , the world ’s developing countries have been growing about 7 percent a year , an unusually rapid rate by historical standards .
Update : The Visa IPO begins trading under the ticker symbol V tomorrow and is expected to price between 37 – 42 tonight .
Do n’t forget to sign up for the all new IPO Community above and discuss how to trade it in the forum !
The Visa IPO took another step towards success today after the SEC gave its restructuring plan the go ahead .
Now the company will seek approval from member financial institutions which would pave the way for an IPO early next year .
The restructuring involves Visa International , Visa USA and Visa Canada becoming subsidiaries of a single company .
Visa Europe will remain a membership association and will become a licensee of , and own a minority interest in , Visa Inc .
If the success of the Mastercard ( MA ) IPO is any indication , the IPO of Visa which is the world ’s largest credit card company ( they have 60 % share of the market ) will be tremendously successful as well .
Going public will allow the company to streamline operations , invest in new payment technologies and help insulate member banks from legal damages brought about by antitrust litigation from merchants .
The biggest beneficiaries when Visa goes public will be the dozens of banks that make up its membership , including major U.S. financial institutions like Bank of America ( BAC ) Wells Fargo ( WFC ) and JPMorgan ( JPM ) .
They stand to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in capital gains if they sell part of their stakes .
After MasterCard ( MA ) completed its initial public offering , Citigroup ( C ) and JPMorgan ( JPM ) cashed out of their holdings and walked way with one - time gains worth more than $ 100 million .
This will no doubt be one of the biggest IPO ’s in history so it will be interesting to watch it move when it does go public .

It ’s like everyone took a look at the high oil prices , and the high gas prices and remembered that looking at a couple of wind turbines is n’t that bad !
Support for the Cape Wind turbine farm project in Nantucket Sound has climbed to its highest level ever statewide ( 86 percent ) and on the Cape / Islands ( 74 percent ) .
Duh !
Once the latest Draft Environmental Impact Statement ( DEIS ) was released that showed that Cape Wind would be good for EVERYONE , it seems like a no brainer .
This new scientific survey of more than 1,200 state residents was conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation ( ORC ) for the independent Civil Society Institute , a nonprofit and nonpartisan think tank located in Newton , MA .
Key survey findings include the following :
— 87 percent of state residents — including 77 percent of Cape Cod / Islands residents — are now “ more likely to support Cape Wind ” in the wake of the draft MMS environmental impact statement finding “ no major harms to the environment resulting from the Cape Wind project for Nantucket Sound . ”
Nearly half ( 46 percent ) of those still opposed to Cape Wind say that the MMS report now makes them more likely to support the clean energy project .
— Support for Cape Wind in Massachusetts statewide has grown to 86 percent — compared to 84 percent in August 2007 and 81 percent in June 2006 surveys posing the same question .
— The growth in support for the Cape Wind project in Cape Cod / the Islands is even more striking — rising to 74 percent in the new recent survey , compared to 61 percent in October 2007 ( in a survey limited to Cape Cod / Islands residents ) and 58 percent in August 2007 .
— More than nine out of 10 state residents ( 94 percent ) — including 82 percent of Cape Cod / Islands residents — think the Bay State should be “ a national leader in using cleaner and renewable energy on a large scale by moving ahead with offshore wind power , and other alternative - energy initiatives . ”
— Nearly all state residents ( 95 percent ) say that Massachusetts should seek to spark another “ Massachusetts Miracle ” in the vein of the Route 128 tech boom by “ seeking to create new jobs and industries by becoming a national hub for new energy technology development . ”
— Nearly all state residents ( 95 percent ) think it is “ important ” that “ Massachusetts take the steps needed now to ‘ unplug ’ itself from coal - and oil - based power and ‘ plug in ’ to solar , wind and other clean energy sources . ”
Civil Society Institute President and Founder Pam Solo said : “ This new survey makes it clear that the widely publicized draft report issuing a clean bill of health to Cape Wind has further improved how the public looks at the project .
That is true both statewide and among Cape / Islands residents .
In the process , the survey debunks the notion that there is any sizable public opposition to Cape Wind .
Instead , what we see is that Massachusetts residents are way ahead of the politicians today in recognizing the serious threat posed by global warming and the need for immediate and comprehensive energy policy changes , including moving ahead on Cape Wind . ”
Or to put it simply , hey Kerry and Kennedy and Delahunt get off your fat asses and follow the will of the people .
No one cares if thats where you sail your yacht , no one cares if you might see these things from your giant beach front compound , what they want is clean renewable energy and they want it 3 years ago .
Opinion Research Corporation Senior Researcher Graham Hueber said : “ It is clear from these numbers that an overwhelming majority of Massachusetts residents — regardless of where they live — want to see more clean energy used in the state .
And they want to see state policies and practices changed in a way that the state can become a true national hub for energy - related innovation and leadership , with all that would mean in terms of high - paying jobs and other benefits .
It is striking that you can see throughout these numbers a consistent 80 - 90 percent of state residents agreeing on the path that Massachusetts should take to redefine itself going forward . ”
The federal Minerals Management Service will hold four public hearings on its draft Environment Impact Statement ( EIS ) on Cape Wind :
Monday , March 10 , 2008 – Cape Cod , 6:00 PM -12:00 AM , Mattacheese Middle School Auditorium , West Yarmouth , MA ;
Tuesday , March 11 , 2008 – Nantucket , 5:00 PM - 10:00 PM , Nantucket High School Auditorium , Nantucket , MA ;
Wednesday , March 12 , 2008 – Martha ’s Vineyard , 5:00 PM - 10:00 PM , Martha ’s Vineyard Regional High School Auditorium , Oak Bluffs , MA ;
Thursday , March 13 , 2008 – Boston , 6:00 PM - 12:00 AM , Campus Center Ballroom , University of Massachusetts , Boston .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Al Qaeda in Iraq is planning suicide attacks against Iraqis in Baghdad " in the near future , " the U.S. military warned Friday .
An Iraqi boy peers from behind the bullet - riddled door of his home in Baghdad 's Sadr City on April 18 .
Information collected by coalition forces indicated that " numerous terrorists " had entered the Baghdad area to carry out attacks using vehicle - borne improvised explosive devices or suicide vests , according to a statement from the Multi-National Corps - Iraq .
No details were provided .
One or more of the attacks were expected to target the Karkh district of Baghdad , where a car bomb exploded in March 2005 near the Sunni mosque Ibn Tamiya .
The mosque is on the dangerous road leading to the Baghdad airport .
There were no reports of casualties .
Iraqis were being warned to be vigilant for signs of terrorist activity and asked to report any unusual signs through tip lines or troops in their area .
Iraqi Security Forces and Coalition Forces were distributing pamphlets describing signs that may indicate terrorist activity .
Brig .
Gen. Qassim Atta , the spokesman for the Baghdad security plan , warned listeners Friday during the main newscast on al - Iraqia state TV .
Reiterating what the U.S. military said about credible intelligence indicating that suicide , vehicle and IED attacks are being planned by " terrorist groups , " Atta asked people to be cautious and wary .
He asked them to call the Iraqi Security Forces and the hot lines for the ministries of Defense and Interior and the Baghdad security plan hot lines to report anything suspicious .
Indications of a possible suicide - vest attack include people displaying abnormal behavior such as an agitated demeanor and wearing inappropriate clothing for the weather .
Signs of a possible vehicle - borne improvised explosive attack are unfamiliar vehicles driving repeatedly around crowded areas , people taking videos or photos of these areas , cars without license plates or multiple fuel cans in the seat or trunk of a vehicle .
Attackers also might use a stolen ambulance .
The Multi-National Corps - Iraq statement said that historically , al Qaeda in Iraq attacked large gatherings of people : funerals , markets and checkpoints .
" Wall barriers emplaced by the government of Iraq and Coalition Forces have been largely successful in protecting neighborhoods , markets and roadways .
However , AQI are constantly seeking opportunities to harm innocent Iraqi civilians , " it said .
Recently , al Qaeda in Iraq began targeting Sons of Iraq and Awakening groups , because those organizations have taken away their support zones and havens .
Awakening Councils , or Sons of Iraq , are Sunni groups that have turned against al Qaeda in Iraq .
" Make no mistake , Al Qaeda in Iraq is still present , " said Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond , commanding general of Multi-National Division - Baghdad .
" We have disrupted their organization , but they still seek to subjugate and intimidate the Iraqi people , " he said in the statement .
" The Sons of Iraq and ISF are heroically standing against such attacks directed against them and their families . "
The U.S. warning came on the same day an Interior Ministry official said at least seven people were killed in intense fighting between Iraqi Security Forces and Mehdi Army militiamen loyal to cleric Muqtada al - Sadr in the Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City .
The interior official said 62 people -- including women and children -- were wounded , while hospital officials in Sadr City put the number at 72 .
In another incident , two children were killed by a roadside bomb while collecting firewood in Tarmiya , about 25 miles ( 40 km ) north of Baghdad , about noon Friday , the U.S. military said .
U.S. officials said the attack was probably targeting Awakening Councils , or Sons of Iraq -- Sunni groups who have turned against al Qaeda in Iraq .
Also , a roadside bomb in the Diyala town of Khalis struck a minibus , killing six members of an extended family -- two of them brothers -- Friday afternoon , a medical source in the province confirmed .
In the Sadr City violence , the militia used rockets and mortars , in addition to small arms fire , the official said .
A fire broke out in Jamila Market , where dozens of shops were destroyed last month during an indirect attack .
However , a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad said he would n't describe the situation as intense fighting .
" There has been sporadic gunfire , harassment fire , taking place all day , " said Lt. Col.
Steve Stover .
He confirmed the death of a " criminal " who was killed while planting an explosive .
" Other than that , nothing spectacular and nothing the ISF could n't handle . "
Clashes also broke out Friday evening in the Shiite enclave of Abu Dsheer in the predominantly Sunni district of Dora in southern Baghdad , where Mehdi fighters clashed with Iraqi security forces backed by U.S. troops .
At least three people were wounded , and an infirmary was set ablaze during the fighting , according to the official .
According to Sadr City residents , the Mehdi Army used loudspeakers at mosques Thursday to warn Iraqi security forces to avoid the area , saying the Mehdi Army was unbeatable .

Rubber bullets are not safe for use in controlling crowds , concludes a new Israeli medical report – and some of the bullets are much worse than others .
The report catalogues a frightening list of rubber - bullet injuries of 152 people brought to hospital after Israeli Arab riots in October 2000 .
That includes everything from bruising to blindness and three deaths – one from a hit to the sinuses , one from a strike to the eye that caused brain damage , and a third from complications during knee surgery .
All of the serious injuries were caused by a rubber bullet called RCC - 95 – a blunt cylinder made up of three metal cores coated in hard rubber that splits after firing .
The parts wobble in flight , sometimes striking victims sideways .
“ This type of inaccurate ammunition and the resulting ricochets evidently make it difficult or impossible to avoid severe injuries , ” says Michael Krausz , lead author of the study and a surgeon from the Rambam Medical Center in Haifa .

Rubber balls
Another type of bullet used to control crowds during the riots , the MA / RA 88 , caused mild to moderate injuries .
These bullets are made of 15 metal - cored rubber balls that have the same impact area as the RCC - 95 but are only a third as heavy .
These bullets spray out in a metres - wide circle from the gun , making them useful for dispersing a crowd but not for targeting individuals .
Since even these bullets caused injuries requiring a trip to the hospital , Krausz does not consider them safe .
“ New types of ammunition with higher accuracy and less force of impact are urgently needed for control of civil demonstrations , ” he says .
Rubber and plastic bullets have been controversial ever since their first use in Northern Ireland in the 1970s .
Police in the province switched to plastic bullets in 1975 , and to a new model last June , in an attempt to find the safest ammunition .
The new bullets fly straighter and are more accurate , but also cause more serious damage if they do hit the head or neck .
“ They ’ve killed 17 people , including nine schoolchildren , ” says Clara Reilly , of the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets in Belfast .
“ Hundreds have been injured , including paralysis , brain damage , loss of both eyes – the list is endless . ”
Gel bullets
In the UK , plastic bullets are not used for crowd control .
“ They are only to be used when there is a very high level of violence involving serious risk of loss of life or serious injury , ” according to the Home Office .
But Reilly counters that those conditions leave room for wide interpretation .
Research continues to make a better , less lethal weapon .
This includes using gel instead of plastic bullets , or modifying the speed at which a gun fires depending on the range of the target .
Others are investigating using water cannon that deliver electric shocks , or noise - generating weapons that stun victims .
In the meantime , Krausz says , police officers must comply with regulations to only fire rubber bullets at lower limbs , and he suggests it should always be from a distance of more than 40 metres .

An Iraqi member of parliament has revealed that the US forces have used forbidden weapons against Iraqi civilians in Baghdad ’s Sadr City .
DPA quoted Leqa Yasin , a Sadrist lawmaker in the Iraqi parliament , as saying that technical and medical examination on the bodies of the victims and wounded of the recent clashes show that US occupation forces have used cluster bombs against civilians in Sadr City .
She said cluster bombs have caused many civilian deaths , with shrapnel left in the bodies of the victims .
Since March 25 , the densely populated slum area has come under frequent attacks by US aircraft and artillery , killing hundreds of civilians and wounding many more .

Democracies Do Not Make War on One Another .
... or Do They ?
by Matthew White
I 've witnessed this debate on Usenet several times , and it always follows the same pattern :
Somebody casually brings up the old factoid about how no two democracies have ever gone to war with one another .
Somebody jumps in and lists a dozen or so wars which have been fought between democracies .
Somebody else points out that those countries were n't democratic , not really .
Everybody gets into arguments over who was or was not democratic .
The argument fizzles out except for two guys continuing to argue over whether the American Civil War was about slavery .
In any case , here is the traditional list of wars which may or may not have been fought between democracies :
Greek Wars , 5th and 4th Centuries BCE Democracies : City - states such as Athens , Syracuse et. al .
City - states such as Athens , Syracuse et. al. Rebuttal : Citizenship was limited to an elite minority which excluded women , slaves , foreigners , etc .
Citizenship was limited to an elite minority which excluded women , slaves , foreigners , etc. Counter - rebuttal : Among the citizenry , all voices were equal .
Among the citizenry , all voices were equal .
Quote : From The Wars of the Ancient Greeks by V. D. Hanson : " [ D]emocratic practices abroad meant nothing at home when it was a question of Athenian self - interest -- the Assembly might ... readily fight to exterminate democracies like Syracuse ( 415-413 ) ....
Athenians ... fought for two years against [ Syracuse , ] the only other large democracy in the Greek World . "
Punic Wars , 2nd and 3rd Centuries BCE Democracies : Rome vs. Carthage .
Rome vs. Carthage .
Rebuttal , Counter - rebuttal : Same as for the Greek democracies .
American Revolution , 1775 - 1783 Democracies : United States vs. Great Britain
United States vs. Great Britain Rebuttal :
On the one hand , Great Britain was more liberal than most monarchies and it had a reasonably independent parliament , but on the the other hand , the franchise was quite restricted until the Reform Bill of 1832 .
Also , the United States was run by a provisional coalition during the war , and the country did not become a working democracy until after independence .

Counter - rebuttal : One of the most frequently stated goals of the American rebels was that they were entitled to enjoy all the civil rights quaranteed to native - born Englishmen ( e.g. parliamentary representation , due process of law ) , but denied to the colonists .
This certainly sounds like the Americans themselves recognized England as a model for their own democratic hopes .
American Indian Wars , 1776 - 1890 Democracies : United States vs. various Native American Indian tribes .

Rebuttal :
The tribes did not have enough formal structure to be considered real democracies .

Counter - rebuttal : Well , just for starters , the Iroqouian Confederation was rather complex .
French Revolutionary Wars , 1793 - 1799 Democracies : France vs. Great Britain , Switzerland , the Netherlands Rebuttal : For Britain , see the comments for 1775 .
Also , France at this time was lurching left and right , with bloody purges each time , so it hardly qualifies as a stable democracy .

Counter - rebuttal : Under the Directory , 1795 - 99 , France was a relatively stable republic .
Franco - American Naval War , 1797 - 1799 Democracies : United States vs. France
United States vs. France Rebuttal :
It was a Quasi War , for God 's sake ; even historians call it that .
It was little more than a trade war with sporadic ritualized broadsides .

It was little more than a trade war with sporadic ritualized broadsides .
Counter - rebuttal : According to official Navy statistics ( http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq56-1.htm ) , the US lost 20 sailors and marines in the Quasi War .
Relative to the numbers involved , it was bloodier than the Gulf War. Anglo - American War , 1812 - 1815 Democracies : United States vs. Great Britain
United States vs. Great Britain Rebuttal : For Britain , use the same two hands as with the 1st Anglo - American War of 1775 .
Franco - Roman War , 1849 Democracies : France vs. the Roman Republic .
France vs. the Roman Republic .
Rebuttal : Both democratic regimes were less than a year old , and therefore do n't count as stable democracies .

Counter - rebuttal : C'mon , that 's just cheating .
You 're redefining your terms in order to exclude an awkward exception .
American Civil War , 1861 - 65 Democracies : United States vs. Confederate States
United States vs. Confederate States Rebuttal : The Confederacy was a slave - holding nation and therefore definitely not a democracy -- and while we 're at it , the same could be said for the Union as well .
Also , " [t ] he South was not a sovereign democracy at that time ...
President Jefferson Davis was not elected , but appointed by representatives selected by confederate states .
There was an election in 1861 , but it was not competitive . "
[ Rummel ]

There was an election in 1861 , but it was not competitive . "
[ Rummel ]
Counterrebuttal : Both nations used almost identical Constitutions , which were easily the most democratic in the world at the time .
Both nations conducted state and congressional elections on schedule , despite the difficulties of wartime .
They both allowed substantial dissent within their Congresses , even if the opposition in the South never quite formalized into a two party sytem .
Every major policy decision in both nations was enacted and approved by elected officials .
( And since when is being " appointed by representatives selected by [ individual ] states " undemocratic ?
Technically , that 's how every American president has been chosen . )
Occupation of Veracruz , 1861 - 62 Democracies : Great Britain vs. Mexico
Great Britain vs. Mexico Rebuttal : Yes , democratic Britain assisted France and Spain in seizing Veracruz from democratic Mexico ( Juarez had been properly elected . ) , but this was achieved without fighting .
As soon as their French allies geared up for military conquest of the whole country , the British pulled out .

Counterrebuttal :
An invasion is war , even if the defenders do n't fight back .
Spanish - American War , 1898 Democracies : United States vs. Spain
United States vs. Spain Rebuttal : In Spain , " the two major political parties alternated in power , not by election but by arrangement preceding elections . "
[ Rummel ]
In Spain , " the two major political parties alternated in power , not by election but by arrangement preceding elections . "
[ Rummel ]
Counterrebuttal :
It 's hardly unknown for rival parties in a democracy to make a time - sharing agreement or grand coalition .
In one form or another , it has happened in Austria ( 1955 - 66 ) , Columbia ( 1958 - 74 ) , Switzerland ( from 1959 ) , UK ( 1931 - 45 ) .
More importantly , when Spain lost the war , prime minister Sagasta resigned , and national leadership passed to his parliamentary opponents , exactly the same as we would expect in any other constitutional monarchy .
Anglo - Boer War , 1899 - 1901 Democracies : Great Britain vs. Transvaal and the Orange Free State
Great Britain vs. Transvaal and the Orange Free State Rebuttal : The franchise in the Boer Republics was limited to the white male elite .
First World War , 1914 - 18 Democracies : France , Belgium , Great Britain , the USA , et. al. vs. Germany .
France , Belgium , Great Britain , the USA , et. al. vs. Germany .
Rebuttal : Well , yes , the Imperial Reichtag was democratically elected by universal manhood suffrage , but it was a largely powerless body , like the UN .
The real power in the German federation was in the hands of the Emperor who appointed the Chancellor and commanded the Army , and in the hands of the Junkers running the undemocratic parliament of the Kingdom of Prussia , which made up around half the federation .

Counterrebuttal : Sure , there were aristocratic privileges and traditions that were inconsistent with one - man - one - vote and full equality under the law , but Germany was every bit as democratic as the United Kingdom ( cf. the House of Lords and English dominance over the indigenous peoples of Scotland , Ireland and Wales . )
And the Reichtag controlled the budget , which is not exactly " powerless " .

Counterrebuttal : Well , the British bombed Finland ; that sounds like being at war .
And 69 Finnish merchants ships were sunk outside of the Baltic Sea . [ n.9 ]
Also , every Finnish soldier fighting the USSR meant that one German soldier could be sent west to fight the Allies .
Every Russian soldier killed by the Finns weakened the Allied war effort .

Rebuttals :
It 's not certain how deeply the CIA was involved in overthrowing these democratically elected governments , but even if it was in up to its neck , these were coups and not wars .
Covert operations by shadowy , bureaucratic elites are not democratic .
They are not publicly debated and approved beforehand by the citizenry .

If using the CIA is undemocratic , then so is using the Army ; and if using the Army is undemocratic , then democracies can't fight wars , period .

Border War , 1995 Democracies : Ecuador vs. Peru .
Ecuador vs. Peru. Rebuttal : President Fujimori of Peru had suspended the constitution in 1992 , making himself a virtual dictator .
President Fujimori of Peru had suspended the constitution in 1992 , making himself a virtual dictator .
Counter - rebuttal : Just as virtual reality is n't reality , so a virtual dictator is n't a dictator .
It is usually considered legal for a democratic leader to exercise emergency powers in an emergency , is n't it ?
Also , when Fujimori lost parliamentary support in 2000 , he quit / was fired .
Is n't the peaceful surrender of power one of the major tests of true democracy ?

Kosovo War , 1999 Democracies :

Rebuttal : Milosovic was a dictator .
Milosovic was a dictator .
Counter - rebuttal :
In the legislative elections of Nov. 1996 , Milosovic 's supporters won a mere 64 out of 138 seats in parliament , and control of government probably would have gone to the opposition had not infighting and internal divisions prevented them from claiming their place at the helm .
In 1997 , Milosovic was re-elected president by a plausible margin of 59 % to 38 % [ n.1 ] which suggests that these elections were not entirely rigged either .
In October 2000 , a soundly beaten Milosovic actually conceded defeat after an apparently free presidential election .
Sure it took a week or so of prodding to get him to vacate the presidential palace , but a concession is a concession nonetheless .

Basically It Depends on the Definition
If you define democracy as a system of government in which policy is set by unpunished , unrestricted debate among the citizens of a nation and put into action by their elected representatives , then all of the above nations are democratic .
On the other hand , if you start narrowing the definitions , then obviously you 'll get fewer democracies to work with , so of course you 're going to have fewer wars between democracies .
If you consider slavery and democracy to be mutually exclusive , then no major power was a democracy until the French Revolution , and the United States passed nearly its entire first century without being a proper democracy .
If you insist that a democracy must be free from all corruption , bribery , vote fraud , cronyism , intimidation and ballot box stuffing , then even a fine old democracy like the United States fails the test more often than we like to admit .
The 1960 and 1972 presidential elections , for example , had enough irregularites and questionable activities to make honest civil libertarians wring their hands and worry whether any country can meet the high standards set by political theorists . [ n.3 ]
If you consider women 's sufferage to be an essential component of democracy , then no nation was a democracy until the 20th Century .
Switzerland , the poster boy of peaceful democracies , did n't pass this threshhold until 1971 ( and at the local level until 1990 ) .
France fought two World Wars without being a proper democracy .
With this proviso ( " women have to count . " ) in place , you can easily weed out the first 11 controversies in our list .
If you insist on that tired old bromide that the US ( for example ) is a republic , not a democracy , then obviously , there 's no such thing as an existing democracy , so -- big surprise -- there has n't been a war between democracies in , like , 2300 years .
, not a democracy , then obviously , there 's no such thing as an existing democracy , so -- big surprise -- there has n't been a war between democracies in , like , 2300 years .
Some democraticians would avoid labelling a nation democratic until after the first peaceful , orderly transfer of power to the opposition following an electoral defeat .
I 'll admit this makes a certain amount of sense -- until the ruling elite actually steps down , you can't be sure whether the elections are real or just for show -- however , it does significantly trim the number of democracies in the world at any given time .
For example , under this rule , the USA did n't become a democracy until 1801 , a quarter century after the Declaration of Independence .
West Germany did n't become a democracy until 1969 , 20 years after the Allied occupation ended ( and only 20 years before the emergence of democracy in its East German rival ) .
Mexico has been having regularly scheduled and hotly contested elections for decades , and yet did n't pass this threshold of democracy until a few months ago .
Despite the joyous ends to oppressive regimes almost a decade ago -- and a string of regular , contested elections since then -- Russia and South Africa still are not democratic by these standards . [ n.8 ]
However , rather than wait years or decades for a visible transfer of power , some democraticians prefer to set a temporal milestone at which " unstable " democracies transform into " stable " ones .
If constitutional rule of law survives its first awkward years and passes ( for example ) its third birthday , then how about we just declare it a full adult ?
This way , we can dismiss any wars it fought in its infancy as growing pains and youthful mistakes made before they learned that democracies are not supposed to do that sort of thing .
I suppose that all these limits and conditions are fine in theory , except for four problems :
Everyone forgets the fine print .
When a politician declares in his stump speech that democracies do n't fight democracies , he usually omits the parenthetical remark that we 're only counting " states in which fair competative elections have led to a peaceful handover of power from one head of government to his or her rival " ( to quote the small print in Dan Smith 's The State of the World Atlas , 6th ed . )
The old double standard : Slobodon Milosovic was frequently denounced in his nation 's press and challenged in elections by opposition leaders , but he maintained an iron grip on power through vote fraud , private security forces and the judicious application of unregistered cash .
His armies fought secret wars .
When the voices against him grew too loud , he scurried away like a thief in the night .
Dictator , right ?
The same , however , could be said about Richard Nixon .
Why do the irregularities of Milosovic 's regime prove that Yugoslavia was a dictatorship , but the irregularities of Nixon 's regime prove that in America , " the system works " ?
( Of course , on the other hand , if we accept that Nixon was dictator rather than a democratic leader , it becomes easier to explain that the 1973 unpleasantness between Chile and the US was not an example of two democracies at war . )
Shifting the definitions to fit the theory : Right now , believers in the Democratic Peace Theory count Russia and Ukraine as two of the world many democracies at peace with each other , but if these two countries went to war with each other , the DPTists would suddenly find all the anti-democratic features of these regimes to be extremely significant .
In fact , I suspect that even if the United States invaded Canada tomorrow , the DPTists would be able to find some reason to call one or both non-democratic , such as the Guantanamo Bay prison and the irregularities of the 2000 Election .
Statistically insignificant sample :
As we trim more and more dubious democracies from our list , we certainly make the statement that " democracies do n't fight each other " truer , but we also make it a lot less impressive .
If there are only 2 functioning democracies in the world ( think , for example , the United States and Switzerland , ca. 1855 ) , then peace between them is no big surprise .
After all , how many times have two Mormon countries gone to war with one another ?
Or two nations led by people named Leslie ?
" War "
On any given day , as you flip page - by - page through a big city newspaper , you 'll see stories from a half dozen wars going on worldwide -- and these are just the wars that produced something newsworthy the day before .
Taking into account the wars which have entered a hiatus as one side plans and the other side licks its wounds ( along with unofficial cease - fires , disruptive weather , and concealed massacres ) we can easily assume another dozen distant wars smoldering out of sight of newspaper 's understaffed foreign bureaus .
In fact , to pull some numbers into this discussion , the Center for Defense Information listed 21 armed conflicts under way as of 1 January 1998 .
The New State of War and Peace by Kidron and Smith has a table listing 82 unique wars fought between January 1980 and September 1990 .
And yet , in this violent world , how many wars were being fought between democracies ?
A handful at most -- and arguably none at all .
Eighty - two wars and not a single one pitting undisputed democracies against each other ?
Should n't this tell us something ?
Well , it tells me that we need to clarify what we mean by war .
Most of the conflicts raging across the world at any given time are civil wars .
Rather than being well - organized , distinct affairs in which massed armies blitzkrieg across the border and formally annex foreign territory , your average civil war sputters along indistinctly , year after year .
In these wars , loosely constituted rebel armies launch sporadic raids from secret bases against government targets and then melt back unrecognizably into the population .
The government retaliates by torturing information out of any citizen who may have made contact with the rebels , and by depopulating the war zone with massacres and deportations in order to dry up the rebels ' pool of supporters and potential recruits .
In civil wars , the opposing sides are generally refered to as the rebels and the government -- that 's " government " in the singular -- but when we talk of the likelihood of two democratic governments going to war , we are talking about " governments " in the plural .
So , let 's forget the 82 armed conflicts of the 1980s .
If were going to get a handle on the probability of two democracies coming into conflict , we have to limit ourselves to international wars , a much rarer phenomenon .
How many international wars have there been in the 55 years since WW2 ?
How many times have regular troops from sovereign nations openly exchanged fire with each other , with intent to kill , under orders , during a continuous period of armed clashes ?
The list thins out quite a bit :

Please keep in mind that our definition of " international war " only includes wars in which governments fight each other , not where several governments band together to fight rebels .
Thus the war which Americans generally call " The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan " is not an international war because the two governments involved were allies , not foes .
Naturally , we can quibble over specific wars .
Was the Biafran War of 1967 - 70 international or not ?
( The answer : It depends on whether Biafra was a nation . )
Similarly , maybe we should exclude the Israeli War of Independence considering that Israel did n't actually become a nation until it won the war .
Should we count the American bombing of Libya in April 1986 ?
Is one air raid a proper war ?
Did any of the various intervening armies in Lebanon or Congo actually come to blows with each other , or just with various rebel factions ?
Was the Chinese seizure of Tibet a foreign invasion , or the reclamation of a rebellious province ?
However , even shuffling the dubious cases ( adding some , subtracting some ) , the pattern holds up .
Between 1945 and 2000 , there were fewer international wars than there were years .
Also , keep in mind that some of these conflicts are rather small -- often mere blips on the world radar -- so if we impose a minimum death toll we could lose several of them .
( And remember -- as we reduce the number of valid wars under consideration , it becomes less surprising that few , if any , were between democracies . )
In the context at hand , we can trim the list even more .
If the believers in Democratic Peace want to weed out wars between democratic regimes that are less than 3 years old , then the believers in Democratic
War get to ignore wars involving any regime that 's less than three years old .
If the Franco - Roman War of 1848 is cut because the governments involved were too young , then we have to cut Korea , Tibet , the Iran - Iraq War and at least a couple of the Arab - Israeli or Indo - Pak Wars because they too involve the impetuous youth of immature regimes -- in this case , however , the immature bullies of the world .
( It can easily be argued that even the most brutal totalitarian regimes mellow with age .
Notice that Red China 's wars get smaller and fewer as time goes by . )
So just taking a quick look at the raw numbers here , what do we see ?
Of the 39 international wars between WW2 and Y2 K , 6 might have been between democracies .
That 's 15 % -- one out of six and a half .
That 's not much , is it ?
In an era where somewhere between a quarter and a half of all the world 's countries are democracies , it does n't seem like a lot , right ?
Mathematical Probability :
( Hey wait !
Do n't run off !
I 'll be mercifully brief .
I promise )
By pure mathematics , we would n't expect too many interdemocratic wars anyway .
The odds of an event happening ( flipping heads on a coin ; a democracy going to war ) are considerably higher than the odds of that same event happening twice ( flipping heads on a coin twice ; two democracies going to war ) .
In the case of flipping heads , the probability is 1 / 2 on one flip , 1 / 4 on two flips [ 1/2*1/2 ] , 1/8 on three flips [ 1/2*1/2*1/2 ] .
( We all remember our high school algebra , do n't we ? )
What then is the baseline probability for any two types of government going to war ?
That is , if we were to grab two random countries to fight a war , what would be the odds that we would grab two democracies ?
THE MATH : In 1967 ( just to pick a year ) there were 126 sovereign nations big enough to show up on a world map , among them 33 democracies of the same minimum size [ n.4 ] .
That 's 26 % .
Therefore if we were to stage random , one - on - one wars between all the world 's visible nations at that time , 6.8 % ( or 26 % * 26 % ) of these wars would pit democracies against democracies , 38.7 % ( or 74% * 26 % * 2 ) would see democracies fighting non-democracies and 54.5 % ( or 74% * 74 % ) would be exclusively between non-democracies .
Now , 1967 is just a single year , but I 've spent a good deal of this Atlas counting democracies .
I can state with reasonable certainty that 44.5 % of mapable sovereignties during the WW2 - Y2 K Era were full democracies .
This calculates out to ...
The odds of 2 random democracies going to war : 19.8 %
The odds of 2 random non-democracies going to war : 30.8 %
The odds of a random democracy going to war with a random non-democracy : 49.4 %
This means that among the 39 international wars during the WW2 - Y2 K Era , we would only expect to find 8 inter - democratic wars anyway .
And we 've found 6 instead -- maybe .
What does this tell us ?
It tells me that when you 're calculating the odds of a rare type of country ( democracy ) performing a rare act ( fighting an international war ) , the sample is too small to draw any valid conclusion .
The difference between 6 and 8 falls easily within any reasonable margin of error .
Why does it matter ?
Although there is no undisputed case of two democracies at war , the evidence certainly casts doubt on the thesis .
In fact , the thesis is not nearly as strong as the statement that no two countries with a McDonald 's Restaurant have ever gone to war with one another , so why do you never hear distinguished international diplomats expound on the need to sell more beef patties in the world ? [ n.5 ]
At first , this McDonald 's factoid seems enormously trivial ; however , when you stop and think about it , the McDonald 's Peace Formula can be quite interesting .
It seems to indicate that as countries are incorporated into the global economy by trans-national corporations , they stop waging war on one another ( although it might be vice versa ) .
Unfortunately , no one wants to go around saying that the best way to assure peace is to surrender your national economy to large heartless corporations .
It makes a much better campaign slogan to say that democracy is the best path to peace .
This is why we see so many people claiming that democracies never fight each other , and relatively few people outside of McDonald 's Corporate Headquarters claiming the geopolitical virtues of burger bars .
More to the point , it should remind us that McDonald 's ( like democracy ) is most common among rich countries , while war is most common among poor countries , so the apparent peace between democracies may stem independently from economic causes , rather than as direct cause and effect . [ n.7 ]
The Universal Democracy Peace Formula has been around a long time -- since the days of Immanuel Kant and his 1795 essay Perpetual Peace , in fact .
It dates back to an era when democracies were more often hypothetical rather than real , and political philosophers were trying to sell democracy as a path to peace by prophesying that no one really likes war , so if we granted our cannon fodder the chance to decide their fates for themselves , they 'd say no , thank you .
In fact , it almost sounds like that old adage spouted by monarchs , fascists and dictators for centuries -- Democracies do n't have the stomach for war -- and it seems to forget that it does n't take much to whip a mob into an angry frenzy .
Appendix 1
[ 15 July 2005 ]
More damn math .
Statistics from reputable sources .
( This is not really vital to the main essay , and it tends to be horribly mathematical , so I wo n't be at all offended if you just want to skip down to the hyperlinks and check out some related sites , or maybe even go out and enjoy this lovely day .
Class dismissed . )
You sometimes hear about precise , professional statistical studies that determine that none of the 2,000 or so wars fought over the past 200 years were between democracies .
These numbers are usually quite impressive and , if true , a strong argument in favor of the proposition .
If we 've really seen 2,000 wars in two hundred years , would n't it be reasonable to expect a few between democracies ?
How about 10 % ?
That 's reasonable , right ?
But where are those 200 interdemocratic wars ?
I mean , even if it 's only 2 % , we should still have seen 40 wars between democracies -- unless democracies simply will not go to war with each other .
Period .
However , on the Correlates of War website , they list three categories of war .
As I mentioned earlier , we can't count civil wars -- what they call intra-state wars -- because these do n't involve multiple , recognized governments fighting each other .
Nor can we count what they call extra-state wars , because one side in these wars is either a colony or tribe -- not a government .
In fact , the Correlates of War Project lists only 79 inter-state wars between functioning , identifiable governments between 1816 and 1997 .
( Personally , I think the American Civil War is a prime example of democracies at war , but the supporters of DPT would shoot down this example by demanding that only stable , sovereign democracies count , so let 's hold them to that standard for all governments at war , otherwise we 're not measuring the relative belligerence of democratic and non-democratic governments , but rather the relative belligerence of unstable and mature governments . )
Freedom
House lists exactly no democracies in the world in 1900 .
Now , assuming that the world did n't lose any democracies in the previous century , that means that it was simply , ontologically impossible for any of the 30 interstate wars from 1816 - 1899 to have been between strictly defined democracies .
We do n't need fancy political theories to explain this .
( Loosely defined democracies , as everyone points out , have fought plenty of wars . )
By 1950 , the number of countries fitting Freedom House 's definition of democracy had risen to 22 out of 80 sovereign nations .
As this represents the total after democracy had beaten fascism and was on the upswing , let 's average this 27.5 % with the 0 % from 1900 to represent democracy 's share of the world 's nations for the first half of the 20th Century .
Of the 28 interstate wars listed by the Correlates of War Project , we would only expect random matching to have produced 0.5 inter-democratic wars -- or to put it more realistically , you 'd probably need twice as many wars to produce one random inter-democratic war anyway .
[ The calculation goes : .275 + 0 / 2 ^ 2 * 28 = .53 ]
If we take Freedom House 's count of democracy in 2000 ( 120 Ds out of 190 nations , or 63 % ) and average it with 1950 , we can estimate that some 45 % of nations were democracies during the 2nd half of the 20th Century .
Of the 21 wars between governments during this period , random pairing would ideally produce only 4 inter- democratic wars .
[ The calculation goes : .275 + .63 / 2 ^ 2 * 21 = 4.3 ]
The upshot is that the critics of the Democratic Peace Theory do n't have to explain why there have n't been 200 interdemocratic wars .
They only have to explain why there have n't been 4 , and I 've offered a few candidates at the top of the page .
If you do n't like those , the gap between the number of interdemocratic wars we 'd expect ( 4 ) and the number we 've seen ( < 4 ) can perhaps be partially explained by , yes , the tendency of democracies to respect each other and negotiate , but it 's more likely that we 're seeing the results of double standards , slippery definitions , the bipolar nuclear standoff , the Pax Americana , international trade relations , random happenstance and the fact that rich countries have little to gain and a lot to lose by attacking each other .
So how do the DPTists get 2000 wars out of 79 ?
It 's simple .
They do n't count wars .
They count dyadic conflicts .
A dyad is just a fancy name for a pair of things that have a relationship to each other .
For example , the 1991 Gulf War saw 34 countries lined up against Iraq .
To you and me , that 's one war , but to political scientists , that 's 34 belligerent dyads -- the US against Iraq , the UK against Iraq , France against Iraq , Saudi Arabia against Iraq , etc. During World War One , all the countries followed the quaint diplomatic procedure of issuing formal declarations of war , and eventually 54 were issued -- that 's 54 dyads .
The Second World War , the biggest war in history , produced 189 declarations of war .
Note how three wars have expanded into 277 dyads .
If you prefer dyadic analysis , fine .
I see it mostly as a judgement call , like arguing about whether to abolish the Electoral College , but I also see a few problems :
Everyone thinks you 're counting wars .
As long as the difference between the two is kept clear , fine , but as soon as someone slips and calls a " dyadic conflict " an ( unmodified ) " conflict " , it misleads .
Again with the double standards .
One of our 2,000 dyads is very definitely between democracies -- Britain vs. Finland in WW2 -- but DPTists are quick to point out that this actually produced few direct casualties .
OK , but in fact , most of these 2,000 dyads involve few ( if any ) direct casualties ( Japan vs. Turkey and Liberia vs. Germany in WW1 , for example ) , so which are we counting ?
All dyads in bloody wars , or only extremely bloody dyads ?
The first criterion gives us one inarguable war between democracies , while the second gives us none , but far , far fewer dyads than the original 2,000 .

The first criterion gives us one inarguable war between democracies , while the second gives us none , but far , far fewer dyads than the original 2,000 .
Some wars are weighted more heavily than others .
For example , the 1991 Gulf War was 1 war and 34 dyads , while the 1980 Iran - Iraq War was 1 war and 1 dyad .
Is the 1991 war really 34 times more important to our analysis than the 1980 war ?
Dyadic analysis ignores the fact that some blocs of countries coordinate foreign policy and operate as one entity -- the British Commonwealth in WW2 , the Warsaw Pact in Czechoslovakia , and the UN in the Korean War , for example .
Since ultimately , the purpose of DPT is to understand how and why wars start , a proper analysis should weight each outbreak or casus belli equally .
The 1967 Arab - Israeli War had 4 participants , but only one outbreak .
The 1991 Gulf War resulted from 1 , not 34 , casus belli .
Admittedly , a big war like WW2 can have several individual casus belli as new countries are brought in ( the invasion of Poland , Pearl Harbor , Marco Polo Bridge Incident , Operation Barbarossa , etc. ) , but even that is closer to 1 than to 189 .
( Like my word is n't good enough for you . )

[ n.5 ] " ... beef patties in the world ? "
FAQ : Until the end of the 20th Century , the most commonly suggested exception to the rule was the Falklands War ( 2 April to 14 June , 1982 ) .
This , however , was flat out wrong .
The first McDonald 's did not open in Argentina until November 1986 .
Unfortunately for world peace , the Big Mac Attack Rule finally broke down in 1999 .
On 24 March 1999 , NATO began its air attack on Yugoslavia .
Faced with angry nationalism , vandalism and boycotts , all the McDonalds in Yugoslavia shut their doors on 26 March .
This means that for two full days , McDonaldland was wrenched asunder by its first intramural war ever .
When McD finally reopened on 17 April , it was an occassion of public celebration almost matching the end of the Kosovo War itself .
P.S. ( 20 April 2003 ) : I 've just been informed that McDonald 's opened in Panama in 1971 , so the 1989 war with the US would be another , earlier exception .
Another suggested exception would be the 1995 war between Ecuador and Peru , but the McD first opened in Lima in 16 Oct. 1996 , and in Ecuador ( I think , but ca n't confirm ) in 1997 , so this is wrong .
While poking around , confirming these suggestions , I discovered the Kargil Exception : Pakistan 's McD opened in Karachi on 19 Sept. 1998 , while India 's opened on 13 Oct 1996 .
Thus , yet again , the 1999 Kargil War is making a mockery out of all our truisms .
Anyway , as this means there are now three exceptions to the McDonald 's peace formula , let 's just forget I even brought this up , okay ?
PPS ( 20 March 2004 ) : I picked up this idea as a free - floating meme in Usenet ca. 1997 , but to give ( belated ) credit where credit is due , The Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention originated with Tom Friedman , NY Times , 1996 .

[ n.6 ] " ... less likely candidates . "
PS ( 14 April 2005 ) : I sometimes see suggested counterexamples that are less likely to count as proper democracies , so I do n't want to clutter my main list with them .
Some of these governments actually had cabinet ministers , rival factions , noisy opposition newspapers and parliaments of some form , but I 'm still going to leave these out .
Anglo - Dutch Wars ( 1652 -74 ) : Exactly when England shifted from absolute to constitutional monarchy can be heavily debated , but one of the earliest arguable milestones would be the the Glorious Revolution of 1688 .
This event largely ended the Anglo - Dutch Wars by putting both countries under the same ruler .
Mexican - American War ( 1845 -48 ) : During the crisis leading up to the war , General Paredes seized the Presidency of Mexico from General Herrera by coup d'etat .
Franco - Prussian War ( 1871 ) : This period of French history is called the Second Empire .
Napoleon III had suspended the constitution of the Second Republic in 1852 .
Napoleon fell from power because of the war , and Germany continued the invasion despite the new republican government , but that 's cutting it a bit close for our purposes .
Cod Wars ( Iceland vs. United Kingdom : 1958 - 61 , 1973 , 1975 - 6 ) :
No blood = no war .
Falklands War ( 1982 ) : Some people vaguely recall that Argentina became democratic around this time , but they get the timing wrong .
Democracy was restored after the war .
In fact , it was their defeat in the Falklands War that brought the military junta down .
Second Intifada ( 2000 - ) : The Palestinian National Authority is sort of democratic sometimes .
It had an election in 1996 , and then nothing until 2005 .
Another problem is that the PNA is not really sovereign ; it 's more of a semi-autonomous territory of Israel .
Also the fight against Israel is n't being directed by the PNA .

[ n.7 ] " ... from economic causes ... "
PS ( 11 August 2005 ) : Now that the Golden Arches Theory has been shot down ( see Footnote 5 ) , the paradigm has shifted to the Greens Peace Theory , which states that golf - playing countries never fight each other .
What no one seems to notice ( or at least , they do n't discuss it in front of the servants ) is that these three suggested agents of world peace ( democracy , McDonald's , golf ) are all characteristics of rich countries .
A simpler ( and far less silly ) theory might calculate a more basic measure of wealth and point out that no two countries with more than 160 cars per 1000 people have ever gone to war with each other either .
There are , at the last count , some 33 countries that fall into that category , and none have fought each other since they passed this vital milestone .
All of them , by the way , are clearly and inarguably democratic , with the exception of Saudi Arabia , # 33 , with 166 cars / 1000 .
But why do n't rich countries go to war with each other ?
I suspect it 's for purely practical reasons :
All wars are a challenge to the status quo , and the status quo obviously works very well for rich countries , so why bother starting a war ?
All wars are also a gamble , and why take the risk if you have a lot to lose and little to gain ?
Conspicuously standing as Number
One in the category of " a lot to lose " , rich countries have more foreign trade .
Number Two in the Lots - to - Lose Category : Rich countries value human life higher than poor countries .
I mean that economically , not morally .
For the same reasons that it 's cheaper to manufacture clothing in Malaysia than in North Carolina , it 's also cheaper to throw away the lives of a thousand South Asians than a thousand Americans .
Armies are mostly recruited from unemployed teenagers , and these cost less in a poor country .
Rich countries have modern , well - equipped armies , which makes fighting them riskier than fighting poor countries , with their armies of undisciplined bullies and obsolete weaponry .
For example , the 16 million people of the Netherlands face no immediate threats to their security and are not considered unusually aggressive , and yet they spend $ 6.5 billion on defense , ten times as much as the 84 million people of Vietnam , which has ongoing quarrels with all its neighbors .
I 'm not saying that these reasons make rich countries peaceful in all situations .
I 'm saying that when two rich countries get into a dispute ( for example , when Saudi terrorists attack the United States ) , these reasons push a military solution toward the bottom of the list of options and encourage both sides to negotiate , but when a rich country and a poor country have a dispute ( for example , if Afghanistan gives sanctuary to terrorists who have attacked the USA ) , there are fewer reasons not to fight it out .
These reasons count for even less in a dispute between poor countries like Senegal or Mauretania , who can easily fight a small border war without serious economic consequences .
The main problem that people have with this theory is that it sounds suspiciously Marxist .
I specifically drew the line at 160 cars per 1000 people to exclude some notable close calls of recent history : the 1981 Falklands War of Britain ( 267 cars / 1000 at the time ) against Argentina ( ca. 107 cars / 1000 according to the 1982 World Almanac ) , and the 1999 Kosovo War of NATO ( average ca. 300 cars / 1000 ) against Serbia ( 150 cars / 1000 ) .
This means that if you find an exception to my rule , I can easily raise the bar again -- just like the advocates of the Democratic Peace Theory .

Yes , the British air raid was against Germans in Finland , but the UK did n't attack Germans in other countries , like Portugal or Sweden , because attacking a country is an act of war , and they were n't at war with them , but they were at war with Finland and attacked it .
As for the Finnish shipping sunk outside the Baltic -- I can't definitely say that the UK / US sank them , but it was outside the Soviet operational zone and in the British operational zone , so it 's worth looking into .

President Bush says the military will be given time to assess the next step President George W Bush has declared a " major strategic shift " in Iraq following the US troop surge .
He said the US now held the initiative and was looking to deliver a " crippling blow " to al - Qaeda in the country .
US troop levels in Iraq are now due to be reduced by about 20,000 by July , but Mr Bush said after that , the " drawdown " process would be frozen .
Then , he said , senior commander General David Petraeus would have " all the time he needs " to assess the next step .
Gen Petraeus had called for a 45 - day " period of consolidation and evaluation " after July , before any more troops left .
Graph of US troops and military deaths Mr Bush said : " I strongly support that .
And therefore I wo n't commit beyond July . "
Signs of progress
The president said that since the launch of the US troop surge 15 months ago , there had been significant military , political and economic progress in Iraq , and that " today we have the initiative " .

He said sectarian violence had decreased , and Iraqis were increasingly turning against al - Qaeda .
Meanwhile businesses were reopening and national laws were being passed .
By July the US presence should be reduced from 20 brigades to 15 - leaving about 140,000 troops in Iraq , about the same number as were present before the surge began in early 2007 .
Mr Bush is portraying the withdrawal as a sign of the success of the surge , and is trying to make as much capital from it as possible , says the BBC's Adam Brookes in Baghdad .
But by referring to a " major strategic shift " he has used language that Gen Petraeus and US ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker have deliberately avoided , our correspondent adds .
Gen Petraeus said the situation in Iraq was still unsatisfactory US Defence Secretary Robert Gates later emphasised that he expected the drawdown to resume later in the year .
" The hope , depending on conditions on the ground , is to reduce our presence further this fall , " he said .
Mr Bush also said he was cutting tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan from 15 to 12 months , effective from 1 August , and that service personnel would have a year at home for every year served overseas .
The decision to halt withdrawals means the US presence in Iraq is likely to last well beyond January , when Mr Bush will leave office and a new president will take over .
Iraq is one of the key battlegrounds of the election campaign , with Republican John McCain arguing for continued engagement while Democratic rivals Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama call for full withdrawal .
Optimistic Mr Bush said the two main threats to US progress in Iraq were al - Qaeda and " the destructive influence of Iran " , and that US failure would allow both to increase their influence in the region .
However , he insisted the outlook was optimistic , saying : " Fifteen months ago , Americans were worried about the prospect of failure in Iraq ; today , thanks to the surge , we 've renewed and revived the prospect of success . "
Democratic leaders welcomed Mr Bush 's shortening of combat tours , but said keeping troops committed to Iraq was unacceptable .
The speech " can only be described as one step forward and two steps back , " said the leader of the Democrats in the Senate , Harry Reid .

The three defendants must take an English test at the court next year A judge in the US state of Pennsylvania has ordered three Spanish - speaking men to learn English or go to jail .
The trio , who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery , were told they could remain on parole if they studied English and got full - time jobs .
Judge Peter Olszewski said the unusual sentence was supposed to help the men .
They will serve their full jail terms if they fail an English test in a year .
Lawyers for the three said they had not yet decided whether they would appeal .
Luis Reyes , Ricardo Dominguez and Rafael Guzman - Mateo , ranging in age from 17 to 22 , all needed interpreters when they pleaded guilty at the Luzerne County court .
Police said they were in a group which had accosted two men on a street in May last year .
The two said they had been asked if they had marijuana , hit on the head and threatened with a gun .
The Luzerne County judge sentenced the three defendants to jail terms of between four and 24 months but said they could be released on immediate parole provided they met his conditions .
The men have been ordered to return with their parole officers in 12 months ' time to be tested on their reading and writing skills .
" If they do n't pass , they 're going in for the 24 [ months ] , " Judge Olszewski said .
A lawyer for Guzman - Mateo was quoted by the Associated Press as saying his client was " happy " with the sentence and that it would probably help him .
A fourth defendant was not given immediate parole but remained in prison on an unrelated drugs charge .

As you know , earlier today Hillary Clinton tried to stoke the Jeremiah Wright controversy by telling an editorial board meeting in Pittsburgh that Jeremiah Wright “ would not have been my pastor ” and then going on to note that she had denounced Don Imus in contrast to Obama ’s allegedly more tolerant attitude toward hate speech .
Later in the afternoon she repeated the same comments at a press conference and when asked why she had chosen to engage Obama on the Wright controversy she seemed to suggest that rather than being intentional she was only providing an answer to a direct question .
“ Well I answered a question in an ed board today that was very specific about what I would have done , ” Clinton told the reporter , “ And you know I ’m just speaking for myself , and i was answering a question that was posed to me . ”
Now obviously , Hillary ’s been in the political big leagues for a while .
She knows how to deflect a question .
But it ’s actually much richer than this .
This afternoon Greg Sargent and I were talking this over and one of us realized that this was n’t just any Pittsburgh paper .
It was the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review , the money - losing , vanity , fringe sheet of Richard Mellon Scaife , funder of the Arkansas Project , the American Spectator during its prime Clinton - hunting years and virtually every right - wing operation of note at one point or another over the last twenty years or more .
In fact , what I only discovered late this evening , when Eric Kleefeld sent me this link at National Review Online , is that not only was it Scaife ’s paper .
Scaife himself was there sitting just to Clinton ’s right apparently taking part in the questioning .
This alone has to amount to some sort cosmic encounter like something out of a Wagner opera .
Remember , this is the guy who spent millions of dollars puffing up wingnut fantasies about Hillary ’s having Vince Foster whacked and lots of other curdled and ugly nonsense .
Scaife was the nerve center of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy .
Those of us who spent years defending the Clintons from all that malarkey learned this point on day one .
But there ’s more .
Let ’s game this out .
Hillary ’s saying this was n’t some planned thing .
She just got hit with this question and she answered it .
But here ’s my question .
You think Richard Mellon Scaife might want to dig into the Jeremiah Wright story ?
This is sort of like , ‘ Hey , I go on Hannity and next thing you know he ’s asking me about Wright and Farrakhan .
How was I supposed to see that coming ?’
I do n’t know just how this went down .
But the idea Sen .
Clinton and her staff went into an editorial board meeting with Scaife and his lackey reporters without a clear sense that they were going to get at least one choice Jeremiah Wright question just somehow does n’t ring true to me .

( CareerBuilder.com ) --
Have you ever received poor service from someone you expected should be helping you as part of his or her job ?
The answer is almost certainly " yes . "
And , if you 're like most people , you have probably also experienced the frustration of working with someone who made your own job more difficult .
In both cases you may have wondered , " Why do n't they just fire this person ? "
Firing someone may seem easy in theory , but it is often a last resort for an employer .
A bad employee 's supervisor may know that the employee is n't performing up to snuff , but that supervisor -- or the company -- may have what they consider to be a good reason for not firing the employee .
Whenever you encounter someone who you think deserves to be fired -- either in your own workplace or elsewhere -- consider if any of the following might be the reason the bad employee is still on the job :
1 . The employee has a relationship with someone higher up .
A relationship does n't necessarily have to be romantic or family , although either is a possibility .
In many cases , the relationship that keeps someone from getting fired is friendship .
The bad employee may not perform well on the job , but may be a golf or drinking buddy for your boss , or may simply be someone that senior management enjoys having around the office .
2 . The boss relies on the employee .
According to Terence R. Mitchell , Ph.D. , author of the business text " People in Organizations : Understanding Their Behavior , " when a supervisor depends on an employee , the supervisor is less likely to attribute poor performance to the employee 's ability or attitude , and more likely to attribute the poor performance to forces beyond the employee 's control .
3 . The employee brings more value to the company than he or she costs .
Maybe the employee who jokes around and wastes other employees ' time at meetings is also a brilliant worker whose productivity has resulted in significant revenue for the company .
4 . The boss thinks it could be worse .
Even if everyone knows the employee is not pulling his or her weight , management may fear that a replacement could do an even worse job .
This fear is compounded if the company has previously had other people perform more poorly in the position .
5 . The boss is afraid of the employee .
If there are concerns that an employee might sue the company or possibly become violent if fired , it may take longer to let that employee go .
If there 's a threat , the company needs to consult with legal or security experts and put appropriate measures in place before letting a bad employee go .
6 . The boss feels sorry for the employee .
In such cases , a boss is sympathetic to the employee , and not to those whom the employee 's actions may be hurting .
The boss may worry that if the bad employee is fired , he or she wo n't be able to find another job .
If the employee needs the money to support a family , has health problems , or has recently experienced another life challenge , the boss may feel it 's best to let the employee keep the job .
7 . The boss does n't want to go through the hiring process .
It takes time to review applications , conduct interviews , check references , and train a new person .
The boss may believe it 's easier to deal with the consequences when the bad employee messes up rather than deal with hiring a replacement .
8 . The employee knows something .
The employee might know something embarrassing about the boss , but it 's more likely he or she simply knows historical information that the company needs today .
For example , if the employee is the only one who knows how to operate an ancient piece of equipment that the company still uses , your employer may need to keep the employee around .
9 . The employee has everybody fooled .
In their book " Snakes in Suits , " Paul Babiak , Ph.D. and Robert D. Hare , Ph.D. , explain that a surprising number of workplaces employ psychopaths .
While psychopaths make up 1 percent of the general population , Babiak and Hare found that 3.5 percent of the executives they worked with " fit the profile of the psychopath . "
Psychopathic employees are pathological liars who get away with doing little or no work .
They charm senior management with their " leadership potential , " con co-workers into covering for them , and successfully blame others for their mistakes .
If you 're the only one who sees what they 're up to , you 're in a tough spot .
Sometimes it 's the whistle - blower who gets fired , not the snake .
10 .
He or she is not really a bad employee .
So what if a co-worker sometimes works from home , takes long lunches , or does something else you do n't think is fair -- as long as his or her work gets done .
If you 're not the supervisor , you 're not personally affected , and the employee is not hurting anyone such as customers or co-workers , stop stressing over what he or she does and focus instead on your own work .

Background : BoingBoing just put up a post that was ‘ Sponsored by Windows Mobile ’ .
Not surprisingly there was a lot of blowback and discussion in the comments about having ‘ Sponsored ’ posts instead of just separate ad blocks on the site , and notably what this said for transparency and honesty in these posts .
I left for about two hours and came back to follow the discussion further and see what else people had said .
The discussion was totally gone , without even so much as an “ Update :
The discussion got out of hand we moved / suspended / did something else with it ” .
BOOOOOOO .
Here is the letter I sent in :
Frauenfelder I ’m calling you out .
An hour and a half ago there were 58 comments on this story .
I ’ve reloaded the story several times and switched browsers in disbelief , but now there no comments on the Win Mobile story .
In fact , you went so far as to nuke the ‘ discuss ’ link from the story .
There ’s not even an “ Update :
We ’re moving the discussion somewhere else ” note .
Tell me I ’m wrong and you did n’t stoop this low .
For the entirety of it ’s existence bb has been the paragon of well reasoned civlib discussion , a beacon for transparency and frank discussion .
If this is what it looks like this beacon just burnt down , fell over , and sank into the swamp .
We all understand , you ’ve gotta pay the bills , the sidebar / header ads are completely reasonable , even the Honda thing no big deal , but mixing ads and content crosses a line .
You should have expected some discussion on that .
But to kill the discussion and hide it ’s corpse blows right past that line and sails straight into the land of ‘ lost ’ emails , “ No Comment ” , and retroactive immunity we ’ve come to know and loathe .
So Mark , Xeni , Cory , any of you ….
please tell me this is a bad dream .

The harmless - looking silver and brown speckled piranha is the deadliest fish in the world .
This blood - thirsty fish of South America ’s Amazon River has jaws containing triangular - shaped teeth as sharp as razor blades .
A school of these meat - eaters can strip an animal or a human being down to a skeleton in just a few minutes .
Because the piranha has a huge appetite , it will go after any bait on a fisherman ’s hook .
But once it is hooked and unable to free itself , the rest of the school of piranhas will strip its bones clean too .
South American natives use the piranha ’s sharp teeth as tips for their arrows !
British researchers have unveiled the world 's smallest transistor , which measures one atom thick and ten atoms across .
The newly announced transistor is more than three times smaller than the 32 nanometer transistors at the cutting edge of silicon - based electronics .
" It 's molecular electronics with the standard top - down approach which can be used in any semiconductor factory , " said Kostya Novoselov , a researcher at the University of Manchester and a co-author of a new paper on the transistor in the journal Science .
Transistors form the logic gates that underpin computing .
Finding new ways to make them smaller is key to the continuation of Moore 's Law , which holds that the number of transistors on a chip will double every two years .
That doubling translates into performance gains for computers .
While expected improvements to processes and materials , namely silicon , seem likely to keep the law going for the next ten years , even Gordon Moore questions technology 's ability to keep pace after that .
This new transistor may extend Moore 's Law for a while longer .
The transistor is made out of graphene , a new material exactly one - atom thick that was discovered by Novoselov ' s research team in 2004 .
Made of intricately linked carbon atoms , graphene has the ability to retain several important properties when only one atom thick – most importantly conductivity .
When current silicon transistor technology goes below 10 nanometers in size , it 's predicted it will run into the laws of physics and will no longer be able to create reliable transistors .
Graphene , on the other hand , is already seeing working transistors in the sub - 10 nanometer range .
The researchers say their latest , unpublished work has used graphene to make transistors a single nanometer across .
" From the point of view of physics , graphene is a goldmine , " said Novoselov .
" You can study it for ages . "
The researchers created the graphene transistors using standard semiconductor fabrication technology .
They begin with a small sheet of graphene and carve channels into the material using electron beam lithography .
What remains is a quantum dot with a tiny circular cage at the center known as the central island .
Voltage can change the conductivity of these quantum dots , allowing them to store logic states just like standard field - effect transistors .
In the picture above , the scale bar indicates 20 nanometers , but
Novoselov claims the team 's recently created one nanometer graphene transistor could represent the end of the line for Moore 's Law .
" It 's about the smallest you can get , " said Novoselov .
With the creation of what could be the smallest possible transistor , the long line of technology that extends from the first transistor , created at Bell Labs in 1947 and ( a replica of which is pictured at left ) , could come to an end .
For all the new transistors ' promise , Novoselov noted that it is currently impossible to produce large amounts of graphene .
They can only produce graphene crystals about 100 microns or 0.1 millimeters across , far too small for industrial production at Intel 's scale .
But the scientist believes that a process for producing graphene wafers is already in the foreseeable future .
" Probably this problem will be solved in the next couple of years , " he said .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp ’s $ 44.6 billion bid for Yahoo
Inc would use up its cash hoard , but the controversial move at a 62 percent premium might pay off if the company makes its savings targets -- and then some .
The software leader ’s $ 31 - per - share cash and stock offer “ is very astute , ” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Charles Di Bona wrote in a research note , as Yahoo ’s assets are worth $ 39 to $ 45 per share , much more than the offer price , if a restructuring unlocked the Internet company ’s full value .
Investors sent Microsoft shares down 6.6 percent to $ 30.45 on Friday and Yahoo ’s stock up 48 percent to $ 28.38 , within $ 2.07 of the proposed offer price .
The bid far exceeds the 35 percent to 40 percent premium typical in recent large deals .
Di Bona expects the unsolicited bid , if approved by Yahoo ’s board , to reduce Microsoft earnings per share in the first year of combined operations and to be neutral in the second year .
The deal will use up Microsoft ’s more than $ 21 billion in readily - available cash .
“ While a considerable amount of money , the deal makes strategic sense for Microsoft as it has failed to adequately monetize its brand on the Internet , ” Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney said in an investor note .
Microsoft would have to achieve $ 1.6 billion of cost savings and other efficiencies , such as eliminating duplicative research and development efforts , for the deal to break even in Microsoft ’s fiscal year ended June , 2009 , Bear Stearns analyst John DiFucci wrote in a research note .
That scenario assumes Microsoft generates more than $ 600 million in interest income and issues new shares to pay for half the $ 44.6 billion price tag .
Microsoft executives said on Friday they expect $ 1 billion in such “ synergies ” from the deal , which DiFucci calculated included investments in assets such as data centers .
If the $ 1 billion savings goal was not met , the deal would reduce Microsoft ’s earnings per share by 12 cents in its fiscal 2009 , he said .
Microsoft earned $ 1.42 before certain items in fiscal 2007 .
In pre-market trading on Friday after Microsoft made public its bid , Yahoo ’s market value increased by $ 13.7 billion and Microsoft fell by about $ 11 billion , resulting in a net gain of about $ 2 billion for a combined entity , said Narayanan Jayaraman , a professor of finance at the Georgia Institute of Technology College of Management .
“ It ’s a value - increasing proposition , ” Narayaman said in an interview .
“ Investors feel that the combined value is higher ” than if the companies remained separate .
“ It ’s a fair valuation . ”
Shares of Internet search leader Google Inc fell 8.6 percent on Friday , indicating investors believe the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo may offer tough competition for the high - flying search company .
“ The market must believe that Microsoft ’s decision is a good one because it is strategic , and a good way to catch up with Google ’s market share in online advertisement , ” Narayaman said .
Still , some analysts doubted that Microsoft shareholders would get their money ’s worth under the proposed takeover , as Yahoo warned this week that it faced “ head winds ” in 2008 amid a weakening economy , forecasting revenue below analysts ’ expectations .
“ The premium is exorbitant for what is a dwindling business , ” said Tim Smalls , head of U.S. stock trading at brokerage firm Execution LLC .
Sanford Bernstein ’s Di Bona calculated that even at a 62 percent premium , Microsoft ’s offer could generate a return on investment of 13.9 percent , assuming Microsoft can achieve “ modest revenue and meaningful cost synergies . ”

X - Factor boss Simon Cowell has revealed the real reason he will never marry girlfriend Terri Seymour - because he fears she will " do a Heather Mills on him " and leave him broke .
The music mogul said his partner of five years was " great " but admitted the concept of marriage in the entertainment industry was a scary and unrealistic one .
" I do n't believe in marriage , certainly not in this business , " the 48 - year - old told the Mirror .

" The truth is that you get married and in a year or two they clean you out !
It 's just not going to work .
" I know a lot of people going through divorces now and once the lawyers get involved it starts to get nasty . "
Fortunately for Simon , Terri , accepts this and his 33 - year - old partner has also dismissed the rumours that there is more to his on - screen relationship with fellow X - Factor judge Dannii Minogue .
" There were rumours about Dannii and I , " he said .
" If you work with cute girls you get that .
But I do n't have to smooth anything over with Terri .
She understands . "
Cowell also squashed rumours about Sharon Osbourne leaving the hit ITV1 show and revealed that her new seven - figure contract is already in the post .
But he admitted the on - going row between Minogue and Osbourne made great viewing .

Missing out on Brit award was the best thing for Leona Lewis , says Cowell as it ' will make her stronger '
" The truth is we have offered all of the judges new contracts to come back but I deliberately have n't pushed it , " he said .
" Sharon is a handful , but she 's what makes the show interesting .
If someone does n't want to come back then that 's their decision . "
" It 's the two girls who need to sort it out , " Simon admits .
" It 's with them that the tension lies .
If they both return next series they will have dressing rooms at opposite ends of the corridor . "

Cowell says he feels pop star Britney Spears has brought her recent troubles on herself
Cowell also took time to have a swipe at Britney Spears saying she has brought her " current situation upon herself " .
He also revaled he was glad previous X - Factor winner Leona Lewis had missed out on a Brit Award as it " was the best thing that could have happened to her " .
" She had the biggest selling single of last year so it 's a mockery that she never won a Brit .
This knockback will make her stronger , " he said "
And Cowell left his nicest comments for struggling Amy winehouse , who he described as " an amazing talent " .
" Given the chance I 'd take her on , but I do n't think she 'd work with me , " he said .
" If I had been managing her I would have got her into rehab from day one .
Then maybe none of this nonsense would have happened . "

Music fans around the world faced confusion today as it was announced they would be able to download unlimited , free songs without breaking the law .
A revamped online file - sharing service had vowed to offer a catalogue of 30 million free songs that are compatible with iPods , but record labels have denied they had granted permission to share the songs .
Qtrax , which makes its debut today , is the latest online music venture counting on the lure of free songs to draw in music fans .
The key to their revolutionary venture was thought to be advertising , which they hope will pay the bills , namely record company licensing fees .
The New York - based service was among several peer - to - peer file - sharing applications that emerged following the shutdown of Napster , the pioneer service that enabled millions to illegally copy songs stored in other computers .
But Warner Music said it had not authorised the use of its tracks by Qtrax - and later Universal Music Group and EMI followed suit , saying they did not have licensing deals with Qtrax and discussions were continuing .
Justin Kazmark , a spokesman for New York - based Qtrax , has declined to comment .
To take advantage of the free but legal service , the user will need to download the Qtrax software which displays adverts while the user is searching and downloading songs .
The site was expected to feature special sections including one called " Last Night " where users can search for newly added tracks from live concerts that were recorded the night before .
It will also feature music videos , artist documentaries , interviews , album reviews and biographies among other features .

Qtrax , which makes its debut today , is the latest online music venture counting on the lure of free songs to draw in music fans
Qtrax is not the first service to offer free songs for download with advertising support .
Last September , SpiralFrog launched an ad- supported free service with music from just one of the major record companies Universal Music .
It is still in talks with other labels .
The latest version of Qtrax still lets users tap into file - sharing networks to search for music , but downloads come with copy - protection technology known as digital - rights management , or DRM , to prevent users from burning copies to a CD and calculate how to share out advertising sales with labels .
Qtrax downloads can be stored indefinitely on PCs and transferred on to portable music players , however .
The service , which boasts a selection of up to 30 million tracks , also hopes that its music downloads will be playable on Apple 's iPods and Macintosh computers as early as March .
i Pods only play back unrestricted MP3s files or tracks with Apple 's proprietary version of DRM , dubbed FairPlay .

CDs sales are falling and file - sharing companies are satisfying the demand for free music online
" We 've had a technical breakthrough which enables us to put songs on an iPod without any interference from FairPlay , " said Allen Klepfisz , Qtrax 's president and chief executive .
Klepfisz declined to give specifics on how Qtrax will make its audio files compatible with Apple devices , but noted that " Apple has nothing to do with it " .
Qtrax downloads can be stored indefinitely on PCs and transferred onto portable music players .
Apple has been resistant in the past to license FairPlay to other online music retailers .
That stance has effectively limited iPod users to loading up their players with tracks purchased from Apple 's iTunes Music Store , or MP3s ripped from CDs or bought from vendors such as eMusic or Amazon.com .
Rob Enderle , technology analyst at the San Jose - based Enderle Group , said he expects Apple would take steps to block Qtrax files from working on iPods .
It 's thought Apple would be unlikely to allow tracks downloaded from its rival to be compatible with its players .
LONDON 
For years , Internet service providers have watched with envy as the likes of Google , Yahoo and Microsoft sliced up the online advertising pie .
Selling Internet access has been a good business , but selling Web advertising has been an even more lucrative one .
Now , three Internet providers in Britain have teamed up to try to obtain a piece of online advertising for themselves .
The three companies  BT , Carphone Warehouse and Virgin Media  announced a deal last week with a company called Phorm , whose technology tracks
Web users and sends them ads related to their interests .
Phorm said it would set up a new online advertising platform called the Open Internet Exchange , which any Web site would be allowed to join .
Proceeds from ads shown on these publishers ’ sites will be shared with BT , Carphone Warehouse and Virgin Media , which together represent more than two - thirds of Britain ’s Internet access market .
The three Internet providers have agreed to give Phorm access to customers ’ browsing records , letting it track a Web user ’s every move .
That way , the Internet exchange can send an ad directly to a select audience anywhere on the Web , rather than hoping that the user lands on a site displaying the ad .
Dark energy is that mysterious force that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the Universe .
But the question is : has it always been pushing the Universe apart with the same force , or was it weaker or stronger in the past , and will it get stronger in the future ?
Researchers from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics have a plan to study distant clumps of hydrogen , to get to the bottom of this question , once and for all .
Dark energy was first discovered nearly a decade ago , when astronomers noticed that distant supernovae were further away than their calculations were expecting .
Some mysterious force appears to be accelerating the expansion of the Universe from every point in space .
As space expands , more dark energy seems to appear .
And although the amount of dark energy in any one point in space is tiny , across the vast reaches of space , it really adds up , accounting for more than 70 % of the Universe .
If dark energy is increasing , however , you could imagine it eventually becoming so strong that it starts to tear galaxy clusters apart , and then galaxies themselves , and even star systems .
Maybe it might even become so strong that it tears apart atoms and even the fabric of space itself .
Astronomers call this theory the “ Big Rip ” .
Or maybe just the opposite is true , and dark energy will eventually become negligible to the expansion of the Universe .
In order to see if the strength of dark energy is changing over time , astronomers are planning to carefully plot the position of clouds of neutral hydrogen , shortly after they formed from the Big Bang .
Although it ’s not possible now , future planned observatories should be able to trace this material all the way back to a time when the Universe was only 200 million years old .
In the early Universe , small fluctuations in energy density and pressure caused oscillations .
Although tiny in the beginning , these ripples have been magnified by the expansion of the Universe so that they stretch 500 million light - years across today .
The clouds of neutral hydrogen should follow the same ripple pattern , so astronomers will know they ’re looking at those first , primordial clouds , and not some closer ones .
And so , astronomers will be able to look back in time , and study the distance to the clouds at each epoch in our Universe ’s expansion .
They should be able to trace how much dark energy was affecting space at each time , and get a sense if this energy has always remained constant , or if it ’s changing .
Their answers will shape our understanding of the Universe ’s evolution , and its future .

British scholar Susan Blackmore theorizes that the evolution of memes occurs outside of human beings ' capacity to control it .
Courtesy Jolyon Troscianko MONTEREY , California –
In the 1970s , Richard Dawkins coined the term " meme " in his book The Selfish Gene to refer to aspects of human culture and how they evolve in a way that 's analogous to how genes evolve .
Since then , the study of memes has become an evolving meme itself .
A meme is an idea or thing that is passed from person to person and is either adopted for its usefulness or other purpose – in some cases becoming a wildly popular idea that can't be stopped – or abandoned to die a quick and ignoble death .
A meme can be a song or snippet of a song , a dance , an urban legend , an expression or behavior , a product brand or even a religion .
British scholar Susan Blackmore , who delivered a presentation on memes at the TED conference Thursday morning , says that human beings are being overrun by memes that want to use us for their own advancement .
Wired.com spoke with her at TED .
Wired :
What 's the difference between a meme and an ordinary idea or thing ?
Does an idea or thing have to be wildly popular and widely adopted to be a meme ?
Susan Blackmore : Absolutely not .
The whole idea of a meme is that it 's information that is copied with variation and selection .
So any idea that is copied from person to person is a meme .
But an idea that you think up for yourself and is not expressed is not a meme .
The emphasis has to be on copying , because that 's what makes evolution possible .
Lots of ideas are never copied at all .
They just go to a couple people and then they fizzle out .
Wired :
Do successful memes have certain qualities in common ?
Blackmore : Yes .
Lots succeed because they 're good for us or they 're true or beautiful or useful and we select them for those reasons .
Some other memes succeed , in spite of not being beautiful or true or useful , by using tricks .
So religions , for example , have some value , but by and large they 're false ideas that use tricks to get into people 's heads – threats of hell , promises of heaven , the allure of being a good person or of God loving you .
There are also memes that trick you into thinking that you 're going to get popular or that you 're going to get rich or that you 're going to get a bigger penis , whatever it is .
Wired :
What about things that get rooted in popular culture despite an aversion to them and a desire for them to go away ?
For example , how is it possible that the Paris Hilton meme has n't reached the end of its shelf life yet ?
Blackmore : Presumably because it presses enough human buttons – you know , sex , greed , celebrity .
Some memes will succeed because they make you talk about them even though you think they 're bad .
For example , a horrible story about murder or torture upsets you .
And one of the ways you try to cope with the upset is to tell somebody else , to share the burden , and that way it spreads and upsets more people , even though you wish it would n't .
Wired :
How big a role does the news media play in spreading a meme ?
And can the media kill a meme ?
I 've noticed that often memes that take off on the internet reach their peak and jump the shark the moment they appear on CNN .
Blackmore : The ( news ) media has huge , huge power to spread a meme because it 's the major mechanism of copying .
Memes are using human brains as their copying machinery .
So we need to understand the way human beings work .
A lot of us want to be the first with a great new fashion .
Well , not the first because we might look ( like ) an idiot .
We want to be the second or third , but we do n't want to be the hundredth .
So once something gets onto CNN , you know you 've missed the exciting , I 'm - up - there - with - the - trendy - stuff moment .
Wired :
You refer to memes as an organism and talk about them as things we have no control over .
Are we completely powerless against them ?
Blackmore : Some of them we can control .
But as more and more stuff comes our way , our control becomes less and less .
You can in the early stages of a new meme drag it back and stop it .
If you know that only two or three other people know something you can stop them from spreading it .
Or if a book has been written , you can burn the paper that it 's written on .
But once a meme has been let loose in the population , you can't take it back .
What culture is doing , what the memesphere is doing , is taking a human being and infecting it with masses of new information and exploiting its tendencies .
We are being turned from ordinary old - fashioned meme machines into what I call " teme " machines – machines for copying technological information , spreading photos and printed words and digital files .
We can choose to turn our computer off if we want to ( stop from absorbing and spreading some memes ) .
But we as a species are not in control of the internet .
We are not in control of the growth of new media .
And we are getting less and less able to control what goes on out there .
What I believe is happening now is that true teme machines are arriving – that is , machines that copy and produce variations and then select .
That 's what you need for an evolutionary process ; that 's natural selection .
Up until very recently in the world of memes , humans did all the varying and selecting .
We had machines that copied – photocopiers , printing presses – but only very recently do we have artificial machines that also produce the variations , for example ( software that ) mixes up ideas and produces an essay or neural networks that produce new music and do the selecting .
There are machines that will choose which music you listen to .
It 's all shifting that way because evolution by natural selection is inevitable .
There 's a shift to the machines doing all of that .
We 're not there yet .
But once we 're there , there 's going to be evolution of memes out there that is totally out of our control .
Wired :
What will that look like ?
Blackmore :
Well , it will look like humans are just a minor thing on this planet with masses ( of ) silicon - based machinery using us to drag stuff out of the ground to build more machines .
We are so ego - centric .
We think of ourselves as the center of the universe .
We need to do a flip and see us as a player in a vast evolutionary process , which we 're not in control of .
Wired :
Why is the area of meme study controversial ?
Blackmore : I can think of three reasons .
One , people misunderstand it .
They think memes are the same as ideas .
Two , they are frightened of it .
Memetics appears to have a lot of implications that we humans are machines , which people have never liked .
Of course we 're machines , we 're biological machines .
But people do n't like that .
Free will and consciousness is an illusion , and the self is a complex of memes .
People do n't like that .
My view is that if these things are true it does n't matter if we like them or not .
The third possible reason is maybe it's a load of garbage .
But we 'll find that out if we do the science and make testable predictions and compare memetics with other theories about culture ; we 'll find out whether it 's true .
Wired :
Why is it important to study memes ?
What can we learn from the phenomenon ?
Blackmore :
We understand human evolution in a completely different way .
We need to see what 's going on in the world .
The world is being taken over by the technological memes , and if we do n't understand what 's happening we are not going to be able to cope with it .
The stress on a human brain , the way our kids ' brains are torn in 10 bits at once doing multitasking , the pressures to take drugs to stay awake so you can process more memes all day ...
The stresses on the human brain are huge and we need to understand why and how .

Your Pre-trip Guide was very helpful .
I researched the lonely planet guides and alike as well and found these to be an invaluable resource .
The local Project Coordinator Elvis was very helpful .
I could n’t fault him in any way , he was always there for me if I had any questions or needed explanations of local situations .
My host family treated me with so much warmth and friendliness .
I found the host family aspect of the experience to be fantastic particularly because I got to sample the local foods which I helped cook .
One weekend I travelled with a fellow volunteer to Akosombo and the Lake Volta region .
Another weekend I went to two local Castles where the slave trade had once taken place , they were both very interesting .

It was the day they killed a mass murderer .
What he had done in a moment of passion was coldly deliberate d upon by the state till it had decided to rid the world of him in a unilateral and final sense .
Being an American with British colleagues , I could n't avoid the subject .
Sooner or later , they were bound to ask , when I phoned in for the latest sales figures , " So , have they done that man yet ? "
" Done whom , done what ? "
" That fellow convicted of killing all those people .
Have they electrocuted , lethally injected , drawn and quartered him yet ? "
" Ah yes , the barbaric American practice of capital punishment .
Yes , they killed him this morning . "
" Just wretched . "
" Hrmmm ? "
" I mean , to kill a person for killing people ... do n't you think that 's a bit hypocritical ? "
" He killed them horribly .
He killed them en masse .
Society wants its revenge .
Justice is revenge cloaked in a socially accepted ritual .
We , as a people , did n't just kill him -- we thought , deliberated , and agonized over it for years .
Then we stuck a syringe full of toxins into his artery and removed him from the gene pool .
Next question . "
" It seems rather unyielding .
Rather final . "
" Oh , it is .
Do n't get caught killing our citizens -- if you 're one of us , we 'll kill you back .
If you 're some damned foreigner , we 'll bomb your cities .
Simple people , simple justice .
That 's America .
Fear it . "
" Oh , I do . "
" Good .
Fine .
How about those sales figures , then ? "
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - A majority of U.S. households now know what a Blu-ray Disc is , while the number of households with a high - definition disc player has crossed the 10 million threshold , a new study shows .
A shopper walks past a Blu-ray Disc logo at an electronic shop in Tokyo February 18 , 2008 .
A majority of U.S. households now know what a Blu-ray Disc is , while the number of households with a high - definition disc player has crossed the 10 million threshold , a new study shows .
REUTERS / Issei Kato
The study , from media research firm Interpret , finds that 60 % of U.S. consumers are aware of Blu-ray Disc , “ up from zero two years ago , when the format was still in the talking stages , ” said Jason Kramer , the Santa Monica , Calif . - based firm ’s chief strategy officer .
Making that number even more significant is that the survey of consumers age 18 - 54 was conducted in mid-January , after Warner Home Video threw its support exclusively behind Blu-ray but before Toshiba officially ended the format war by abandoning its rival HD DVD product .
Since then , the studios and consumer electronics manufacturers supporting Blu-ray Disc have been ratcheting up their own promotional efforts and encouraging retailers to devote more floor and shelf space to the next - generation format .
Among men 18 - 34 , the critical “ early adopter ” demographic , Blu-ray awareness is at 76 % , the Interpret study found .
Still , Kramer said , Blu-ray supporters “ still have a lot to do .
The format war is over , and they ’ve taken Blu-ray from zero to majority awareness , but it does n’t get easier from here , unfortunately . ”
Kramer sees the biggest impediment to Blu-ray ’s mass market success the fact that it requires not just a new player but also a new television .
There are now 44.4 million HDTV households in the U.S. , Interpret research shows , or 39 % of the 113.9 million TV households .
That ’s a significantly smaller pool than the one DVD faced when it was launched 11 years ago .
“ It ’s an intermediate step DVD did n’t have , ” Kramer said .
“ But it ’s also a huge opportunity for studios to work with consumer electronics companies to get consumers to both at the same time . ”
The 10.3 million U.S. homes with a high - definition disc player represent 9 % of all households .
DVD penetration , by contrast , is at 91 % , which Kramer calls “ the saturation point . ”
The 9 % figure includes Sony ’s PlayStation 3 , with a built - in Blu-ray drive .
Disc buys among high - def disc player owners are fairly evenly split between high - def discs ( an average of 8.7 discs over the last six months ) and standard DVDs ( 7.7 discs ) , but that ’s because until the format war ended not all studios were producing compatible discs .
Two of the six majors , Universal and Paramount , were exclusive with HD DVD and have yet to release their first Blu-ray Discs .
Internationally , Blu-ray has even further to go than it does in the U.S. Awareness is at 56 % in Great Britain , 49 % in Germany , 45 % in Japan and just 30 % in France .
The HDTV household penetration rate , accordingly , is lower in those countries as well .
In Great Britain , an estimated 26.2 million households have HDTVs , for a penetration rate of 35 % .
In Japan , the rate is just 28 % , followed by 21 % in France and 18 % in Germany .
“ But we ’ve got the digital switchover taking place , which is a good thing , because the fact that you are replacing your TV means people will be thinking they might as well get an HDTV , ” Kramer said .
The high - def player penetration rate in Japan and Great Britain is currently at 9 % , on par with the U.S. ; it ’s 4 % in France and Germany .
In contrast , 92 % of British households have at least one DVD player , a higher percentage than in the U.S. France is next at 89 % , followed by Germany at 84 % and Japan at 82 % .

China 's attempts to counter international criticisms of the state crackdown on Tibetan unrest received another setback this morning , as a second state media trip to a protest - hit area was interrupted by Tibetan monks .
The authorities have launched a drive to counter what they allege is biased coverage of the unrest and their response by many in the western media .
Foreigners are not allowed into Tibet at present and even under normal circumstances journalists are rarely granted permission to travel there .
Reporters attempting to reach other areas of unrest in China have been turned back or ejected by security forces .
Officials arranged for a small group to travel to Xiahe , Gansu province today .
The town was the scene of angry protests last month .
But the visit took an unexpected turn as between 15 and 30 lamas , carrying a banned Tibetan flag , burst out of a building at Labrang monastery and rushed across to the group of Chinese and foreign journalists .
" The Dalai Lama has to come back to Tibet .
We are not asking for Tibetan independence , we are just asking for human rights , we have no human rights now , " one monk told the reporters in Chinese .
According to a Reuters journalist covering the trip , many of the lamas had their heads covered in robes .
They said other monks were being held by the authorities and that armed plainclothes agents were stationed throughout Xiahe .
The state news agency Xinhua reported only that a group of monks at the monastery of Labrang in western Gansu province bordering Tibet had interrupted the event , and said the visit resumed soon afterward .
It did not mention the tour on its websites .
Last month lamas at the Jokhang temple in Lhasa disrupted the first trip for foreign journalists to Tibet , interrupting a speech on inter-ethnic harmony and telling reporters : " They are tricking you .
Do n't believe them .
They are lying to you . "
At a separate press conference in Beijing , Qiangba Puncog , chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region government , said police had detained 953 people suspected of involvement in last month 's violent riots in Lhasa .
But he added that they were " an extremely tiny minority " of Tibetans and that only " an extremely tiny minority " of monks protested .
" They do not , and cannot , represent Tibet and the Tibetan people , " he added .
Puncog said prosecutors had also issued arrest warrants for 403 of those detained , a step that generally leads to formal prosecution .
He said 362 people had handed themselves in to police in response to a government ultimatum , but 328 were released on the grounds that their crimes were light and they had a " good attitude " in confessing them .
It was unclear if the remaining 34 were included in the tally of detainees .
Police also issued warrants for 93 suspects , 13 of whom have been caught and nine who surrendered themselves .
The government says 22 people , mostly " innocent civilians " , died in the Lhasa riots .
Independent accounts have described vicious attacks on Han Chinese residents .
The Tibetan government - in - exile alleges the true tally across China is more than 140 with many protesters dying in clashes with security forces .
Scientists from the University of Bonn are researching which plants giant dinosaurs could have lived off more than 100 million years ago in order to find out how they were able to become as large as they did .
Such gigantic animals should not have existed .
Their recipe ; take 200 milligrams of dried and ground equisetum , ten milliliters of digestive juice from sheep 's rumen , a few minerals , carbonate and water .
Fill a big glass syringe with the mix , clamp this into a revolving drum and put the whole thing into an incubator , where the brew can rotate slowly .
In this way they obtained an artificial ' dinosaur rumen ' .
With this apparatus ( also used as a ‘ Menke gas production technique ’ in assessing food for cows ) Dr. Jürgen Hummel from the Bonn Institute of Animal Sciences ( Bonner Institut für Tierwissenschaften ) is investigating which plants giant dinosaurs could have lived off more than 100 million years ago , since this is one of the pieces still missing in the puzzle involving the largest land animals that ever walked the earth .
The largest of these ' sauropod dinosaurs ' with their 70 to 100 tons had a mass of ten full grown elephants or more than 1000 average people .
Dr. Jürgen Hummel ( c ) Frank Luerweg , Uni Bonn
Larger than permitted
How the dinosaurs could ever attain this size is something the scientists from Germany and Switzerland are investigating .
The Bonn palaeontologist , Professor Martin Sander , coordinator of the research group ' Biology of the Sauropod Dinosaurs : The Evolution of Gigantism ' , says , ' There is a law to which most animals living today conform .
The larger an animal , the smaller the density of the population , i.e. the fewer animals of the same species there are per square kilometre . '
The larger an animal is , the larger the amount of food it has to have in order to survive .
Therefore a specific area can only feed a certain maximum number of animals .
At the same time there is a lower limit to the density of population .
If this is undercut , the species dies out : ' In this case diseases can rapidly wipe out the whole stock .
Moreover , finding a mate becomes difficult , ' Martin Sander explains .
An animal like a 100 - ton argentinosaurus should have normally not had this ' minimum population density ’ , actually it should not have been able to exist at all .
But there are hypotheses for this apparent paradox : for example the giant dinosaurs presumably had a metabolism that was lower than that of mammals .
In this context it is unclear how nutritious the plants were that formed their diet .
This question is being investigated by Dr. Jürgen Hummel in conjunction with Dr. Marcus Clauss from the University of Zurich .
' We assume that the herbivorous dinosaurs must have had a kind of fermenter , similar to the rumen in cows today . '
Almost all existing herbivores digest their food by using bacteria in this way .
The panda is the exception .
Because the panda is not like this its digestion is inefficient .
It stuffs bamboo leaves into its mouth all day long , in order to meet its energy needs , despite the fact that it does not move about much , thereby saving energy .
Jürgen Hummel transforms glass syringes into simple fermenters , which he fills with bacteria from the sheep 's rumen .
' These micro-organisms are very old from an evolutionary point of view ; we can therefore assume that they also existed in the past , ' he explains .
To the mix of bacteria he adds dried and ground food plants : grass , foliage or herbs which still form part of animals ’ diet , and for comparison equisetum , Norfolk Island pine or ginkgo leaves , i.e. parts of plants which have been growing for more than 200 million years on earth .
The gas formed during the fermentation process presses the plunger out of the syringes .
Jürgen Hummel can therefore read the success of the fermentation process directly off their scales .
This is measured according to a simple rule : the more gas is produced , the ' higher the quality ' of the food .
Equisetum is bad for the teeth
These ‘ old ’ plants stand their ground surprisingly well compared to today 's flora .
' The difference is not as great as might be expected , ' Jürgen Hummel emphasises .
The bacteria digest ginkgo even better than foliage , but they seem to prefer equisetum most .
With it gas production is even higher than with some grasses .
Nevertheless , equisetum figures in the diet of comparatively few animals .
The reason is that in addition to the toxins present in many modern species it wears down animals ’ teeth too much .
' Equisetum contains a lot of silicates , ' Jürgen Hummel says .
' It acts like sand paper . '
However , many dinosaurs did not have any molars at all .
They just pulled up their food and gulped it down .
The mechanical break - up may have been carried out by a ‘ gastric mill ’ .
Similar to today 's birds , dinosaurs may have swallowed stones with which they ground the food to a paste with their muscular stomach .
However , there are no clear indications of this .
Only recently the Bonn palaeontologist Dr. Oliver Wings doubted that dinosaurs had bezoar stones , at least this assumption could not be verified from fossil findings .
Yesterday I emailed Don Siegelman , as I had a few matters to discuss with him .
Here 's the crucial part :
The other , more important thing is this :
As you may or may not know , the one aspect of your long ordeal that the press has stubbornly refused to mention -- or , I think , even to perceive -- is the theft of that election in 2002 .
Like you , I believe that that was crucial ; but the press , quite typically , wo n't mention it .
Frankly , I believe that they , and most leading Democrats , are in denial about it , as its implications are too frightening .
Just as they 've looked away from all the evidence of vast election fraud throughout Bush / Cheney 's reign , therefore , they 've also looked away from the subversion of that gubernatorial race in Alabama .
And so that chapter of your story is unknown to most Americans , even those who 've lately heard the rest of it .
Here is his reply :
Mark , I mention the vote stealing in every interview .
60 Minutes cut it out .
Don Abrams did n't want to go there either .
I have told the story to the Washington Post and LA Times .
The hook is Rove 's fingerprints are found there too .
First , in that Rove 's friend Jack Abramoff hires Dan Gans , who was in charge of " electronic ballot security " in Baldwin County , Alabama , where the votes were stolen .
Gans , working for the Alexander Strategies Group , claims credit for the win on his website , which he then takes down when Abramoff gets arrested .
The second is Rove 's business partner , Kitty Mc Cullough ( a / k/ a Kelly Kimbrough ) is given credit for the electronic vote switch by the state Republican Party .
I asked Don if I could send that out , and he said yes ( " Have at it " ) .
So now I offer it to you .
If you 're an election reform activist , please start your ( search ) engines .
If you 're a journalist , please do your job .
And if you 're just another patriotic citizen , please do whatever you can do to get the press , and / or the Democratic Party , to pay heed .
For starters , how about asking " 60 Minutes " why they " cut it out , " and asking Dan Abrams why he " did n't want to go there either " ?
And since Don also told the Washington Post and LA Times about the theft of that election , how about we ask them , too ?
This stuff will just keep on happening , until we make it dangerous to do such things .

WITH markets swinging widely , the Federal Reserve slashing interest rates and the word “ recession ” on everybody ’s lips , renewed attention is being given to the gap between the haves and have - nots in America .
Most of this debate , however , is focused on the wrong measurement of financial well - being .
It ’s true that the share of national income going to the richest 20 percent of households rose from 43.6 percent in 1975 to 49.6 percent in 2006 , the most recent year for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has complete data .
Meanwhile , families in the lowest fifth saw their piece of the pie fall from 4.3 percent to 3.3 percent .
Income statistics , however , do n’t tell the whole story of Americans ’ living standards .
Looking at a far more direct measure of American families ’ economic status  household consumption  indicates that the gap between rich and poor is far less than most assume , and that the abstract , income - based way in which we measure the so - called poverty rate no longer applies to our society .
The top fifth of American households earned an average of $ 149,963 a year in 2006 .
As shown in the first accompanying chart , they spent $ 69,863 on food , clothing , shelter , utilities , transportation , health care and other categories of consumption .
The rest of their income went largely to taxes and savings .
Crave and Reuters reports that Apple has sent out invitations for an event on Thursday morning detailing the iPhone Software Developement Kit ( SDK ) :
" Please join us to learn about the iPhone software roadmap , including the iPhone SDK and some exciting new enterprise features , " Apple said in an invitation sent to reporters .
Steve Jobs had originally announced that the iPhone and iPod Touch Software Development Kit ( SDK ) would be released in February 2008 .
Last week rumors pointed to a brief delay in the launch of the SDK .
The SDK will allow developers to release their own software applications for both the iPod Touch and iPhone .
Few details have been made available , but the SDK has reportedly been seeded to select developers in the months ahead of its release .
The event will take places at 10 am Pacific time at Apple 's Cupertino campus .

When radio host Jerry Klein suggested that all Muslims in the United States should be identified with a crescent - shape tattoo , " the switchboard went from empty to totally jammed within minutes . "
Some callers agreed with Klein , one saying that , " Not only do you tattoo them in the middle of their forehead but you ship them out of this country ... they are here to kill us . "
Another caller added that America should , " set up encampments like during World War Two with the Japanese and Germans "
At the end of the show Klein revealed that that it had been staged as a hoax .
" I can't believe any of you are sick enough to have agreed for one second with anything I said , " he told his AM 630 WMAL audience which covers Washington D.C. , Northern Virginia and Maryland
" For me to suggest to tattoo marks on people 's bodies , have them wear armbands , put a crescent moon on their driver 's license on their passport or birth certificate is disgusting .
It 's beyond disgusting . "
" Because basically what you just did was show me how the German people allowed what happened to the Jews to happen ...
We need to separate them , we need to tattoo their arms , we need to make them wear the yellow Star of David , we need to put them in concentration camps , we basically just need to kill them all because they are dangerous . "
Council on American - Islamic Relations Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper commented :
The public reaction to Mr. Klein ’s courageous parody should be a wake - up call for American religious and political leaders who remain silent in the face of growing anti-Muslim bigotry in our society .
Americans of all faiths must come together to marginalize extremists and to challenge ethnic and religious bigotry .

Ron Paul still looks surprised when his calls to follow the Constitution and restore a sound currency set off whoops of approval at a campaign stop .
The 10 - term GOP congressman from Texas has been making these points for 30 years , with little to show for it beyond hundreds of House votes on the short end of 434 to 1 .
Critics called him a crank .
But lately , his views and values – the product of a lifetime of intense , self - directed study – are finding an audience .
His message is basic : freedom and limited government .
Repeal the welfare - warfare state .
Get out of Iraq , now .
Abolish the income tax .
End the war on drugs .
Put the dollar back on a more solid footing .
" Unlike some others , I was n't really anxious to run for president , " he tells supporters at Tea Bird 's Café and Bistro in Berlin , N.H. " I did n't believe the country was ready for a strict constitutionalist . "
When he says " strict , " he means it .
As a member of Congress , he refuses to vote for any bill not explicitly set out in the Constitution , earning him the nickname " Dr. No . "
He routinely votes against new taxes , deficit budgets , government surveillance , gun control , war funding , and the war on drugs .
He would abolish the Internal Revenue Service , the Federal Reserve , the US Departments of Education , Energy , and Commerce as well as other " unconstitutional domestic bureaucracies . "
He has called for America to withdraw from the World Trade Organization and the United Nations .
At the heart of Paul 's worldview is a conviction that people are born free and should govern themselves – and that free markets make better decisions than governments do .
" Some people think I do n't love governing , but it 's different , " he says in a Monitor interview .
" I believe in self - governing and family governing .
The responsibility is put more on the individual than on some huge monstrosity in Washington . "
Family Roots
Paul traces his values of personal responsibility and self - reliance to his early family life .
His father , Howard , the son of a German immigrant , ran a family dairy business in Green Tree , Pa. , near Pittsburgh , where he pasteurized and bottled milk .
The third of five sons , Paul learned responsibility and the work ethic at age 5 in the family basement .
There , milk bottles were washed by hand , and he and his brothers earned a penny for every dirty bottle they spotted coming down a conveyer belt .
" We learned the incentive system , " he says .
The boys soon figured out that one of their uncles was a worse bottle washer than the other .
" We liked to work for that one uncle , because we got more pennies , " he says .
The five boys shared a small bedroom in a four - room house .
From spring through fall , they slept outside in a small , screened porch .
His grandmother and two uncles lived in the same family compound .
His father hoped that all five sons would become Lutheran ministers ; two of them did .
" Confirmation was a big event in my family ; birthdays were n't a big event , " Paul says .
His mother , Margaret , urged her sons to read and get an education .
" I would say that probably from the cradle , their ethic was work and church .
That was it , " says Carol Paul , the candidate 's wife of 50 years .
" They were n't a family that played a lot .
Everything was serious . "
The family lived two miles from the local high school .
Although there was a bus to school , Paul preferred to run .
He won the state championship in the 220 - yard dash and ranked No. 2 in the 440 - yard run in Pennsylvania .
" He knew he was obligated to do with his God - given body the best he could , " says Mrs. Paul .
They met in high school at a track meet and married in his last year at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg , Pa. , where he studied biology .
Paul says he briefly considered becoming a Lutheran minister , but opted instead for medicine .
He graduated from Duke University Medical School in Durham , N.C. , in 1961 , and was just starting a residency in internal medicine when he was drafted into the US Air Force .
From 1963 to 1965 , he served as a flight surgeon , then moved to Texas to practice obstetrics .
As an OB / GYN , he has delivered more than 4,000 babies .
Paul does n't often talk about religion , at least not in the context of a political campaign .
There 's a reason the Gospels teach praying in secret , he says .
Over the years , he has attended an Episcopal church , which " became more liberal than we were comfortable with , " as well as an evangelical church .
He currently attends Baptist services .
Austrian economics
The most decisive intellectual influence in Paul 's life was his discovery , while in medical school , of a passion for economics .
It started with two vast novels : Ayn Rand 's " Atlas Shrugged " and Boris Pasternak 's " Dr. Zhivago , " a gift from his mother .
Both books make a case for the threat that big government bureaucracies pose to creativity and liberty .
Later , he read his way into Austrian economics – the counterweight to Keynesian economic ideas that informed the New Deal .
He read Friedrich Hayek 's " The Road to Serfdom " – a book that influenced a generation of American conservatives – and especially Ludwig von Mises , a libertarian who extended the influence of the Austrian school of economics in the United States .
For the Austrian school , government intervention in free markets is n't a formula for long - term economic growth .
Mises warned that over time it would cripple free markets and lead to state control .
Free markets are always superior to a centrally planned economy , he wrote .
Mises also advocated a non-inflationary gold standard – an idea that Paul has made his own in his 2007 book " The Case for Gold " and a forthcoming book " Pillars of Prosperity : Free Markets , Honest Money , Private Property . "
In 1971 , Paul and another local doctor closed their practices for a day and drove 60 miles to the University of Houston to hear Mises give one of his last lectures in the United States .
" I just thought it was fascinating .
It made common sense – the sort of thing I would have concluded on my own , but the Austrian economists were a lot smarter , " Paul says .
He made friends with American economists such as Murray Rothbard , a student of Mises , and often visited Milton Friedman while continuing his own study of economics and world markets .
" He 's been a very serious student of economics since medical school , and has read a huge amount of history – constitutional history and monetary history .
His philosophical and economic views drive him and everything he does , " says Llewellyn Rockwell , a former congressional chief of staff for Paul .
Mr. Rockwell is president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn , Ala. , and maintains the popular website , lewrockwell.com .
As a physician , Paul says he came to resent government intervention in his practice .
In his years as an OB / GYN , he did n't accept Medicare and Medicaid payments because he felt they represented unconstitutional government overreach .
Sometimes , he 'd treat patients for free .
" I found that government was interfering with my judgment as a doctor , disrupting the doctor / patient relationship , and making prices go up , " he says .
But what drove him into public life was President Richard Nixon 's decision in 1971 to break the last link between gold and US currency and impose wage and price controls .
" I decided to speak out , " he says .
A nation that spends , borrows , and prints too much money inevitably pays a price , he says .
Unrestrained by a link to gold , the Federal Reserve can create too much credit , fueling housing and stock bubbles .
The result :
The dollar continues to goes down in value , the nation becomes ever more dependent on borrowing money abroad , and young people pay the price .
A return to the gold standard restrains the government and restores the value of the dollar .
" My influence , such as it is , comes only by educating others about the rightness of the free market , " he wrote in a 1984 essay , " Mises and Austrian Economics : A Personal View . "
In Congress , Paul often speaks of his own record of consistency in voting against big government and refusing the perks it offers .
He says he will not accept a government pension and did not seek government loans to help finance college for his five children .
Paul , a longtime Ronald Reagan supporter , even voted against awarding the former president a Congressional Gold Medal in 2000 , saying that taxpayers should n't be charged the $ 30,000 to mint the coin .
But critics note inconsistencies in Paul 's long public record .
For example , while Paul crusades against big government and voted against government funds for victims of hurricane Katrina , he has requested and won billions in special projects for his congressional district , which includes Galveston , Texas .
" I put it in because I represent people who are asking for some of their money back … .
And if Congress has the responsibility to spend the money , why leave the money in the executive branch and let them spend the money ? " he said on NBC's " Meet the Press " Dec. 23 .
At a recent town meeting in Conway , N.H. , one audience member said he supported most of Paul 's positions , but wondered whether government was n't needed after all in the cases of monster storms , such as hurricane Katrina .
Paul cited the case of the 1900 hurricane in Galveston , which he said rebuilt significantly without help from Washington .
Some libertarian critics also complain that his opposition to abortion rights for women violates libertarian principles of choice .
In an interview , Paul says that he came to his views on abortion in part from his experience delivering babies .
" From the very beginning , I had a moral and legal obligation to take care of two people , the mother and the child , and if I did anything wrong , I realized that I could be sued for it , " he said .
" That had an impact on me . "
He recalls witnessing an illegal abortion in his first year out of medical school that made an impression , too .
" Once I became more firmly entrenched with libertarian beliefs , I realized that another life was involved , I saw this as a principle of nonaggression , which libertarians adhere to .
The baby has a choice , too . "
For some Washington - based libertarians , Paul 's success on the campaign trail is puzzling .
" Because Ron Paul is personally a very traditional man , a small town guy , his libertarianism is embedded in a lot more traditionalism that you find in many libertarians , " who bristle at his stance on abortion , for example , says Brian Doherty , senior editor at Reason Magazine , the leading libertarian political and cultural journal .
" But many financial analysts , who are disproportionate fans of the Paul campaign , say that in their world , the stuff that might strike a normal American as kooky , such as restoring the gold standard , does not strike them as kooky , especially given how the dollar 's value is plummeting .
There is n't a single other candidate out there talking about their world in an interesting way – or at all , " he adds .
A surge of grass - roots support
When Paul first ran for president as the Libertarian Party candidate in 1988 , he won 0.54 percent of the vote .
In his second presidential bid , he 's on track to do better .
While Paul still polls only in single digits nationally and in early primary states , his supporters have raised more than $ 19 million since October , including a record $ 6.2 million on one day , Dec. 16 .
This unofficial , grass - roots campaign is out - organizing all other campaigns over the Internet and recently launched a Ron Paul blimp .
" I 'm not surprised that the views are popular , but I 'm surprised to the extent that people have rallied and gotten spontaneously involved and done so much in fundraising and campaign events , " Paul said in a Monitor interview .
Paul says his campaign is still working out what to do with the last quarter 's surge of campaign contributions .
" It 's a real job figuring out what to do with it , " he says .
" We 're going to budget it out .
It just means it 's a lot easier planning for super - Tuesday [ on Feb. 5 ] , when we have money in the bank . "
In Iowa , the campaign has used new funds to quickly ramp up a ground operation .
In New Hampshire , it launched new television and radio ads .
Some experts say polls may be undercounting Paul 's support , because so many of his backers have n't voted in the past and use cellphones rather than the landlines , which pollsters use .
That 's why Paul " is likely to do better on election day than polls say he might , " said Fergus Cullen , chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party in an interview for C - SPAN's " Newsmakers " on Sunday .
Both the book and movie Charlie Wilson ’s War glorify the " colorful " liberal Democratic congressman ’s successful crusade to bludgeon the reluctant , neoconservative Reagan administration into dramatically escalating funding , arming , and training of radical Islamists fighting against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan .
Although the zestful life and escapades of Wilson make for an entertaining and true - to - ( Wilson ’s ) - life movie , both the book and movie give short shrift to the dire long - term policy consequences of Wilson ’s and Reagan ’s proxy war .
Hollywood had to use almost none of their usual poetic license to embellish reality to make the film interesting , because the raucous Wilson was more entertaining than fiction .
For example , on a trip to conservative Islamic countries , he took along his own belly dancer , whose uniquely risqué American adaptation of the traditional art form raised eyebrows .
And this was one of the tamer stunts the boozing , womanizing , and allegedly drug - taking congressman pulled off .
But entertaining exploits masked disastrous policy failures .
The danger of this movie resembles that of Oliver Stone ’s 1991 film JFK , which took liberties with facts surrounding John F. Kennedy ’s assassination to imply a conspiracy involving Vice President Lyndon Johnson .
The problem with one - sided movies of historical events , such as JFK and Charlie Wilson ’s War , is that they permanently emblazon in the public ’s mind simple ideas about complex events that may be in dispute among historians .
Although the book version of Charlie Wilson ’s War at one point acknowledges that the causes of the Soviet Union ’s fall are still debated among historians , it then proceeds to enshrine the overall message that the reason the Soviet Union expired was that Wilson and Reagan gave the Soviets a costly , Vietnam - like quagmire in Afghanistan .
Empires most commonly collapse because their economies can no longer support their expensive foreign escapades .
Undoubtedly , the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was costly and may have quickened the " Evil Empire ’s " demise , but the root cause was the nonviable and dysfunctional state - owned economy , in which the workers pretended to work at producing items that no one wanted to buy and the creaky state - owned industries pretended to pay them in worthless currency .
After the Red Army left Afghanistan and the Soviet regime collapsed almost three years later , Wilson argued only that he had hastened its demise by five or 10 years .
But at tremendous cost .
As with many U.S. adventures overseas , funding non-communist forces  even though they happened to be Islamic radicals  to fight the Soviets seemed like a good idea at the time .
Giving the USSR its own military quagmire , in answer to the Soviets ’ doing the same to the United States in Vietnam , was sweet revenge .
Yet the main channel through which the Afghan mujahedeen got their American - funded arms and training was the Pakistani intelligence services .
For their own purposes , Pakistani intelligence gave preference to arming and training the most radical Islamists , as opposed to Ahmad Shah Massoud , the best anti-Soviet fighter .
Unfortunately , U.S. funds were used to train such Islamists in urban terrorist techniques .
On 9/11 , this training came back to bite the United States , because many of the hijackers were veterans of the Afghan War .
Also , the mujahedeen ’s victory over an occupying Soviet superpower emboldened the Islamists to attempt to defeat on its home turf the other superpower that was occupying and intervening in Muslim lands ( the U.S. has had ground troops in the Persian Gulf since the end of the first Gulf War , and heavily supports autocratic and corrupt Arab governments and Israel ) .
After 9/11 , the United States tried to kill two of its favorite commanders in the mujahedeen : Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , who helped Osama bin Laden escape from Tora Bora when he was cornered during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan , and Jalaluddin Haqqani , who harbored bin Laden and is now a prominent Taliban leader .
Therefore , what seemed like sound policy at the time , giving the arch- rival Soviets a bloody nose in an insignificant backwater country , has inadvertently generated one of the few major threats to the U.S. homeland in America ’s history : anti-U.S. Islamist terrorism .
Of course , the Soviets had a plethora of nuclear warheads aimed at the United States , but even now , after the demise of the USSR , a semi-hostile Russia does still .
Although this threat is existential , it has been managed by the two countries to reduce the chance of nuclear war .
Since most empires disintegrate due to financial problems , and because the dysfunctional Soviet economy made the USSR especially susceptible to this fate , the United States during the Cold War might have been smarter to abandon its aggressive containment policy , which actively challenged potential Soviet inroads anywhere in the world .
Instead , the U.S. could have concentrated on securing the centers of economic and technological power  in Europe and Japan  and let the Soviets have economic " basket cases " in the third world , such as Angola , Nicaragua , El Salvador , Colombia , Laos , Cambodia , South Vietnam , and even South Korea ( underdeveloped when North Korea invaded in 1950 ) .
In this alternate scenario , the Soviet Union and its empire likely would have collapsed  this time from the expense of occupying , funding , and administering these backwater countries  but the United States could have saved much blood and treasure that it expended during the Cold War .
It is ironic that during the Cold War , liberals like Charlie Wilson and neoconservatives like Ronald Reagan agreed on pursuing this costly and interventionist containment strategy .
The venues in which they preferred to challenge the Soviets may have differed  the neoconservatives preferred the futile effort to support the Contras in Nicaragua , while the liberals preferred backing the mujahedeen in Afghanistan  but they had the same foreign policy .
The interventionist consensus continued after the Cold War and ultimately led to the blowback of 9/11 .
It should n’t be any surprise that liberals and neoconservatives alike have opted for an interventionist foreign policy , since both support government activism at home ( again , with differing preferences as to the areas of mischief ) .
But unfortunately , 9/11 demonstrated that the cost of overseas meddling by Charlie Wilson , Ronald Reagan , and their liberal and neoconservative brethren in the state apparatus might be even higher than the cost which accrues from government intervention domestically .
We 've really dug into whether Monster Cables ( or other " premium " brands ) are worth the extra cash you 've gotta fork over , asking things lke , " Does it really make your audio / video more pristine ? " or " Are they better than coat hangers ? "
And that 's the wrong approach .
What about the love , sweat and tears that go into making each and every cable ?

Administrivia
The notion of administrative reductions comes up all over the place , even though the term is usually used when discussing continuation - passing style .
Briefly , an administrative reduction is a trivial rewriting step that simplifies an expression that is easy to crank out into an equivalent expression that is natural to take in .
Here is an example from modal logic .
Kripke figured out that we can translate modal logic formulas systematically into predicate logic by adding an extra “ world ” argument x to every proposition .
For instance , whereas the formula S∧T ( “ snow is white and trains are late ” ) translates to the formula S( x ) ∧ T( x ) ( “ snow is white at world x and trains are late at world x ” ) , the formula S∧◻T ( “ snow is white and it is necessary that trains are late ” ) translates to the formula
S( x ) ∧ ∀y. R( x , y ) → T(y ) .
I follow the convention that all operators associate to the right , so the above is short for S( x ) ∧ ( ∀y. ( R( x , y ) → T( y ) ) ) ( “ snow is white at world x and , for every world y accessible from x , trains are late at y ” ) .
More formally , we can define a function f that maps a modal formula and a world variable to a predicate formula , by induction on the modal formula :
f( A , w ) = A ( w ) , if A is an atomic proposition .
f( φ∧ψ , w ) = f ( φ , w ) ∧ f( ψ , w ) .
f( ◻φ , w ) = ∀wʹ.
R( w , wʹ ) → f ( φ , wʹ ) , if w and wʹ are distinct world variables .
Because f takes a world variable for a second argument ( so the metavariables w and wʹ stand for world variables ) , this definition can be a bit tricky to write and understand .
For one thing , because the last case above does not pin down the choice of wʹ , the function f is only defined up to α-equivalence among predicate formulas .
We can avoid the second argument to f if we define the translation a bit differently .
Let us translate S∧◻T to
S(x ) ∧ ∀y. R( x , y ) → ∃x. ( x=y ) ∧ T( x )
or
S(x ) ∧ ∀y. R( x , y ) → ∀x. ( x=y ) → T( x )
instead ( it does n’t matter which ) .
This alternative translation is more verbose and requires equality in the target language , but it is more straightforward to define inductively :
g ( A ) = A ( x ) , if A is an atomic proposition .
g( φ∧ψ ) = g( φ ) ∧ g(ψ ) .
g( ◻φ ) = ∀y. R( x , y ) → ∃x. ( x=y ) ∧ g( φ ) .
To turn the output of g , which is easier to crank out , into the output of f , which is more natural to take in , we can define a second pass of processing that rewrites the use of equality away .
Such a rewriting step is called an administrative reduction because it simplifies an expression into an equivalent expression in a trivial , bureaucratic way .
In general , when we build an expression generator ( especially a translator ) , we can often choose whether to express the same meaning using facilities in the metalanguage or in the object language .
Often , the generated expression is easier to understand if we use the metalanguage ’s facilities , but the generation process is easier to understand if we use the object language ’s facilities .
Hence , the latter strategy calls for a subsequent pass of administrative reductions .
The two passes of this pipeline can be merged to form a so - called one - pass translation by anticipating where administrative reductions take place .
Another example of an administrative reduction lies in flow chart connectors .
We can draw a big flow chart either using a large piece of paper ( the metalanguage ) or using connector symbols ( the object language ) .
Having drawn a big flow chart using connector symbols , we can use scissors and glue ( administrative reductions ) to simplify it into a connector - free flow chart on a large piece of paper .
Yet another example :
When you choose “ Save as … MacWrite ” in Microsoft Word , Word pipes your document in Rich Text Format to an export converter module , which in turn produces a MacWrite file .
As I recall faintly ( I probably have the details wrong — is it MacWrite or some other format ? ) , the beginning of a MacWrite file must contain some kind of a count , which unfortunately the converter cannot determine until it reaches the end of its RTF input .
Yet , the MacWrite converter manages to process its input and produce its output sequentially without buffering up anything , using the following hack .
The MacWrite format has a “ fast save ” feature , which allows a document to be expressed as an old version followed by a series of patches ( differences ) to bring it up to date .
The converter writes out a dummy count at the beginning , then appends a patch to fix the count at the end .
As far as I know , the term “ administrative ” was first used by Gordon Plotkin in his seminal study of continuation - passing - style translations .
For example , one translation Plotkin defines ( the call - by - value one ) maps the term λx.xx to the term
λκ. κ λx. λκ. ( λκ.κx ) λα. ( λκ.κx ) λβ. αβκ
instead of the simpler ( β - reduced ) and equivalent term
λκ. κ λx. λκ. xxκ .
Plotkin introduced the term inside quotation marks , suggesting that he coined it .
Speaking of modal logic , how about this for a disappointing subtitle : “ The neuroscience of belief : effects of placebo treatments on brain & body ” ?
Reading the part before the colon , I expected to find the modal box for knowledge or belief expressed in the brain as a homunculus of a mind , tragically sandboxed from accessing variables in outer scopes .

FOR years the housing market in Britain has defied gravity .
For a few months in 2004 and 2005 house prices moderated , before taking off again .
But now , finally , tighter credit and overstretched household budgets are pulling prices down .
A collective shudder ran down the spines of British homeowners on Tuesday April 8th when Halifax , a part of HBOS and the country 's biggest mortgage lender , revealed that house prices fell in March by 2.5 % .
The monthly decline recorded by the Halifax house - price index was the biggest since September 1992 , when the housing market was enduring an agonisingly prolonged bust .
In fact , monthly house - price figures are notoriously erratic and should be taken with a big grain of salt .
The more important finding from the index was that the annual rate of inflation — comparing the first quarters of 2008 and 2007 — has fallen to 1.1 % , the lowest since March 1996 , when it was 0.3 % .
That fits with the picture painted by the house - price index of the Nationwide Building Society , another big lender .
This has now recorded five consecutive monthly declines , lowering the annual rate to 1.1 % in the year to March .
Mortgage lenders are reluctant to talk down the market , so it says something that both the Halifax and Nationwide are predicting “ modest ” declines in house prices this year .
Forward - looking indicators suggest a gloomier picture .
The number of mortgages approved for house purchase was almost 40 % lower in February than a year before .
According to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors , estate agents have been grappling with the worst conditions — measured by the ratio of completed sales to unsold stock — since September 1996 .
Last week a study by the International Monetary Fund found that Britain 's housing market was the third most over - valued of 17 developed economies , narrowly behind Ireland and the Netherlands .
House prices were almost 30 % higher than could be explained by fundamental factors such as disposable income , interest rates and working - age population .
These findings are not shocking given the extraordinary house - price boom of the past decade .
Between the first quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 2007 , house prices rose by 214 % .
This was the third highest among 20 countries covered by The Economist .
It contrasts with a rise of 135 % in America up to its peak in 2006 .
During the long surge in house prices , the usual siren voices insisted that “ this time it is different ” , despite Britain 's previous record of booms and busts .
Even though prices soared to apparently unsustainable levels — judged by conventional benchmarks , such as the ratio of house prices to average earnings — they still appeared affordable when debt - servicing costs were compared with income , thanks to low interest rates .
Furthermore , a surge in population growth caused by immigration together with sluggish homebuilding rates supposedly warranted the vaulting valuations .
This overlooked the fact that the market also looked greatly overvalued when house prices were compared with rents .
The reality was that the market was lifted artificially high by a tide of cheap credit .
In particular , borrowers benefited from cut - price home loans made possible by mortgage securitisation , notably from Northern Rock , the lender that was brought low last year by the financial crisis .
Now that tide of cheap credit is receding fast as banks and building societies reprice their mortgages and toughen their lending conditions .
Spreads on “ tracker mortgages ” that are linked to the Bank of England 's base rate have risen and lenders are penalising borrowers who can afford only a small deposit .
Some relief may come on Thursday if , as expected , the central bank cuts the base rate from 5.25 % to 5.0 % .
But that would probably do no more than counter the effects of the lenders ' latest moves to constrict credit .
Mervyn King , the Bank of England 's governor , said in March that the bank's two previous quarter - point reductions , in December and February , had done no more than offset the impact of tighter credit conditions , leaving average interest rates paid on mortgages much the same as before .
A period of falling house prices has been long overdue and may be welcomed by those who have been priced out of the market .
But past experience suggests that it is likely to inflict economic damage by slowing consumption and GDP growth .
When the market slowed in 2005 household spending rose by only 1.5 % , its lowest since 1992 .
That augurs ill for Britain 's economic prospects — and for Gordon Brown 's increasingly beleaguered government .
White coats at IBM today said they have built the world 's teeniest optical switch , measuring 100 times smaller than the cross section of a human hair .
Big Blue said its new nanophotonic switch device brings the company another step closer to creating computer chips that use light pulses instead of electrical signals on copper wires .
Once electrical signals are converted into pulses of lights , the tiny device ensures that optical messages are efficiently directed from one processing core to another .
IBM contends in a paper published in the journal Nature Photonics that the old wire way will become yesterday 's news when on - chip optical interconnects are — cough — finally brought to light .
Specifically , the promise of optics will become more and more appealing as chip makers continue to increase processing cores at roughly the same speed that shaving supply companies add superfluous blades to their razors .
Copper wires , they argue , could simply use up too much power and be incapable of transmitting the enormous amount of information between massively multi-core processors .
Switches represented by black boxes
The researchers say each individual wavelength in an optical switch can transfer data at up to 40 Gb /s .
And because the switch is able to route different wavelength " colors " of light simultaneously , IBM claims aggregate bandwidth can exceed 1 Tb /s .
They envision using light will multiply the speed information is sent between cores by as much as 100 times , while using 10 times less energy .
The company said its tiny switch is ideally suited for on - chip applications because of the sheer lack of scale .
Big Blue estimates that as many as 2,000 of the devices could fit side - by - side in an area of one square millimeter .
( Which by the way means that if each device was mounted by an angel , a full 4,000 could dance on the head of a pin .
Who says computer chips and ontology do n't mix ? )
Optical switch ( bright red , actual size )
IBM scientists assert that their optical switch is also rugged enough for the hardcore , heated world of semiconductors .
The optical switch is capable of operating in an environment with changing " hot - spots " that move around depending on the processing function .
The full report is titled " high - throughput silicon nanophotonic wavelength - insensitive switch for on - chip optical networks , " by Yurii Vlasov , William Green and Fengnian Xia of IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center in New York state .

PRESS RELEASE
At 5:00 p.m. on Saturday , February 16 , 2008 , the Milwaukee Impeachment Committee ( MIC ) will hold a press conference at the main entrance of the Midwest Airlines Center , 400 W. Wisconsin Avenue in downtown Milwaukee .
The purpose of this event is to remind the Democratic presidential candidates of their oaths to defend the Constitution , which includes holding President Bush and Vice - President Cheney accountable for their abuse of executive powers .
We will distribute copies of George McGovern ’s statement in favor of impeachment to press members and the public , and we will be available to answer questions from the press .
The February 16th event is part of MIC ’s continuing pressure to hold Congress accountable to its duty to the Constitution .
Congress should pursue the accountability of elected officials , and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as members of Congress should include this issue in their campaigns and in the national Democratic platform .
We , the voters , want the Democratic candidates to follow the Democratic Party of Wisconsin ’s six 2007 resolutions calling for impeachment .
We , the voters , want the Democratic candidates to follow the Democratic Party of Wisconsin 's six 2007 resolutions calling for impeachment .
Wisconsin is an appropriate state to make this demand : in 2006 .
Our state Democratic Party was the first to include the impeachment of Bush and Cheney in its platform .
Since then , two of our Democratic Representatives , Tammy Baldwin ( WI - 02 ) and Gwen Moore ( WI - 04 ) , have signed H.Res.333 calling for Cheney ’s impeachment and Rep .
Wexler ’s letter calling for impeachment hearings by the House Judiciary Committee .
MIC calls for impeachment on numerous grounds , four of the most obvious being :
Starting a war is illegal according to the United Nations , of which the U.S. is a member ;
Lying to Congress and the American public in order to initiate an undeclared war in Iraq ;
The use of warrantless wire - tapping , which contravenes citizens ’ right to privacy as declared in the 4th Amendment to the Constitution ;
The use of torture and rendition , which violates the Constitution ’s 8th Amendment prohibiting “ cruel and unusual punishments ” of prisoners .

The murderous intentions of Kate Knight are all too visible in the terrible injuries she inflicted on her husband , Lee .
His piercing blue eyes stare sightlessly into the distance , and over each ear are the new cochlear implants - put in two weeks ago - which have restored some of his hearing .
Even so , the only way to converse with him is to shout .
Three times a week he goes into hospital for four hourly sessions of dialysis , because the anti-freeze his wife poisoned him with has destroyed his kidneys .
The lower left half of his face is paralysed , from the brain damage he also suffered .
He is 38 , but looks much older .
He will never work again , never live independently again , never see the face of his nine - year - old son , Jack , again .
Scroll down for more ...
His younger brother Michael , 35 , has offered him one of his own kidneys for transplant in a desperate bid to improve the quality of Lee 's existence .
When Lee says that Kate ruined his life , it is impossible to doubt him .
" I try not to think about her too much , " says Lee , a former £ 36,000 - a- year team leader at the JCB plant in Rocester in Staffordshire .
" If I do , I get too upset and I start to hate her for what she did to me .
She has completely devastated my life .
I do n't think I will ever come to terms with it .
How can I ?
She was my wife .
I adored her and I thought she adored me , too .
She used to wake me up in the middle of the night to tell me how much she loved me . "
Last week Kate Knight , 28 , was found guilty of attempted murder after Stafford Crown Court heard she laced her husband 's food and drink with anti-freeze .
After running up thousands of pounds in secret debts , her deadly solution was to poison her husband in the hope of cashing in on insurance policies on his life which she thought would pay out £ 250,000 .
She spent months on the internet researching the best way to kill him , before choosing anti-freeze , which contains ethylene glycol that can kill in small doses .
She also considered giving her husband Ecstasy and iron tablets .
Lee was rushed to hospital with kidney failure on April 9 , 2005 , five days after she had laced their seventh wedding anniversary Chinese meal with the chemical , having already lovingly accepted his gift of an eternity ring .
Lee suffered perforated stomach ulcers and fell into a coma which lasted 16 weeks .
At one point , doctors advised his family to say their goodbyes because he was so gravely ill .
Kate was the only one not to turn up .
Against all odds , Lee survived and was in court when Kate was found guilty , even though he could neither see nor hear her reaction to the jury 's verdict .
" I do n't know how she feels when she sees what she did to me , " says Lee , who now lives with his parents Annette , 58 , and Maurice , 64 , in Stoke - on - Trent , Staffs .
" I'm told that throughout the trial she sat there looking bored , chewing gum and doodling on bits of paper , so I can only assume she does n't care .
" She does n't even call me by my name any more .
She calls me ' Jack 's father ' .
It 's as though I 'm the one who did something wrong .
" She would have preferred it if I had died .
Even while I was lying in hospital in a coma , she cleaned me out .
She moved out of our house with our son and took everything with her except my clothes , which she dumped in a back bedroom .
She even took my wedding ring and wallet .
" She put my dog in kennels and told the owners that they would n't be seeing me again because I was brain dead and she was moving to France to be with relatives .
She does n't have a single relative in France .
" Instead she moved to the Wirral .
Five months later , she was living with a new guy , and by the Christmas they were engaged .
I do n't know how they met or when .
That 's how much she cared about me . "
Lee does n't know if he will be in court on February 28 to see Kate sentenced , but he hopes that she will be locked up for a very long time .
" She tried to make out in court that I was violent , but in all our married life I never raised a hand to her , " he says .
" She said I 'd brought on my medical problems by drinking too much , which is nonsense .
" It was just one of her many lies .
She 's a fantasist .
I think she 's ill and does n't know the difference between right and wrong any more .
She 's somehow managed to convince herself that she did n't do it . "
When Lee surveys his marriage to Kate , he still finds it hard to believe that she was capable of such evil .
The Kate he prefers to remember is the bubbly , outgoing teenager he met when she was waitressing at the pub run by her mother , Kath , and stepfather , Derek .
Lee used to go drinking there with a friend .
She had just turned 18 and he was a 27 - year - old car mechanic , and although Lee 's family thought she was too young for him , the couple fell in love , moved in together and were engaged within months of meeting .
When Kate fell pregnant with Jack , they decided to bring forward their wedding , and they were married on April 4 , 1998 , at Hanley register office .
" We were really happy together and when Jack was born we were just ecstatic , " says Lee , " I was the one who'd get up in the night to give him his feeds , and we formed a really strong bond .
" My happiest memories are of going for a walk with my wife , my son and my dog .
Listening to my family laughing .
Kate and I were always telling each other that we loved each other and holding hands .
I trusted her completely .
We shared everything , or so I thought . "
Lee 's parents , however , had a few niggling doubts about their daughter - in - law .
Annette , who looked after Jack when Kate went back to work in a call centre , thought she lived in a fantasy world .
" She was always talking about things she had done , which you later found out had never actually happened , " says Annette .
" If a friend announced she was pregnant , Kate would say ' I 'm pregnant too ' , then a few weeks later she 'd say casually : ' Oh , I had a miscarriage . '
" She worked in a call centre , then as a waitress , then as a barmaid , then as a receptionist , but none of her jobs lasted more than three months .
" Whenever you asked her what had gone wrong , she 'd say : ' I left because they did n't make me manageress . '
" She hankered after the better things in life and spent all her money on Jack , buying him expensive things which I considered a waste of money .
" I never said anything because I knew Lee adored her and I thought her fantasies were harmless . "
Lee worked 54 hours a week to support his young family , earning £ 500 a week in take - home pay , but crucially he left all the household finances to Kate .
She knew his employers would pay death benefits ( at £ 130,000 it was much less than she 'd expected to receive ) if Lee died , and that he had insurance covering unemployment and illness .
It would be much later that Lee would discover that Kate 's new job as a call centre trainer , earning £ 200 a week , did not exist and that household bills , including the mortgage , had n't been paid .
He had no idea that she 'd taken out loans , credit cards and re-mortgaged their £ 55,000 house without his knowledge , a home which was on the verge of being repossessed when Kate hatched her plan to wipe out those
debts .
He still has no clue where all the money went , because apart from buying things for Jack she was not obviously extravagant .
" I first started to feel ill in February 2005 .
We were due to go to a cousin 's christening , but we missed the ceremony because I felt so awful , " recalls Lee .
" I was so cold , but sweating and being sick .
We went to the party afterwards , but I felt so terrible we could n't stay very long .
Scroll down for more ...
" I'm the kind of guy who hates to take a single sick day , so I thought there must be something wrong with me .
I just did n't feel like myself .
But because it was winter , I convinced myself it was ' flu .
" Then , not long after I 'd recovered from that I started to feel really strange again .
I felt nervous and detached and went completely off my food .
I kept saying to Kate : ' There 's something wrong with me ; I do n't feel well . '
" All the time , Kate acted like the concerned wife , saying it must be the ' flu again .
I went to bed , but the next day I felt even worse .
I could n't stop grinding my teeth and my mind was filled with worry .
" I felt so strange that I actually said to Kate : ' You have n't given me any drugs have you ? '
And she started crying and said : ' Why would I give you drugs ?
I love you .
I would never give you drugs . '
" Then I developed a rash all over my chin , which was really painful . "
Lee 's family , worried about the change in him , urged Kate to take him to the doctor , but she batted away their concerns saying that the physical changes he'd noticed were due to their eating more fruit and vegetables .
One night Lee woke up to find the marital bed empty and the carpet next to him on fire .
He ran out of the room and found Kate sleeping in Jack 's room .
" When I told her the bedroom was on fire , she calmly walked in and threw a duvet over the flames to put them out , " says Lee .
" There was no panic at all .
She simply said that she was used to things like that from working in a pub kitchen .
" When you love your wife and your wife says she loves you , you do n't think : ' Oh she 's trying to kill me . '
You try to find rational explanations .
I still do n't know how that fire started . "
Then on April 9 , Lee , by now very ill , was rushed to hospital suffering from breathing problems .
He 'd lost control of his left foot , which kept shaking , and his chin kept lolling onto his chest .
He had been diagnosed with kidney failure after a biopsy , when he started haemorrhaging from internal ulcers caused by the anti-freeze he had unwittingly ingested .
He underwent an emergency operation , which doctors said he had only a 40 per cent chance of surviving , and was placed on a ventilator in intensive care .
All the while , Kate was by his bedside , apparently beside herself with worry .
It was a chance encounter , however , which uncovered her murderous plan and brought the police to her door .
One of Lee 's cousins bumped into the Knights ' neighbour , Sarah Johnson , shortly after he was admitted to hospital and told her that Lee was in intensive care .
It emerged that Kate Knight had told Ms Johnson after Lee was taken to hospital : " It 's worked .
Nothing has shown up on the biopsy . "
She then showed her the bottle of wine and a container of anti-freeze under the kitchen sink that had 160 ml missing - enough to kill someone by causing kidney failure or heart attack .
Kate had also previously confided in Ms Johnson that Lee 's employers would pay out a six - figure sum if he died , and had even asked her neighbour if she knew a hitman , so she could finish him off .
Until her shocking discovery that Lee was in intensive care , Miss Johnson had not taken Kate Knight seriously - thinking , as many of her friends and in - laws did , that she was a bit of a fantasist and had only been joking .
" We called the hospital and arranged to meet Lee 's doctors .
When we told them what the neighbour had said , they told us : ' We suggest you contact the police and do it immediately , ' " says Annette .
" The worst thing is that if they had known sooner what had caused Lee 's illness , they could have done something to reverse it and could have saved his sight and hearing . "
Even after Kate was arrested , she continued to visit Lee in hospital with Jack , pretending nothing had happened , and it took a superhuman effort for Lee 's family not to show their hatred for what she 'd done .
" Of course we did n't want her there , but we were determined to remain calm and dignified for Jack 's sake , " says Annette .
" We wanted to protect him and knew that if we said or did anything , she would stop Lee seeing his son , which would have been even more devastating for him . "
But when Lee started to recover , his eyesight started to go and then his hearing .
The truth started to dawn on him .
One day he asked his mother " Did Kate do this to me , Mum ? " and Annette wept when she told him that it looked as though she had .
" I was devastated , " says Lee . " I did n't want to believe it .
Even now I think : ' How could she do this to me ? ' "
Since Kate 's conviction , Jack has been living full - time with his father and grandparents .
Understandably , he is a very confused little boy and their priority is to protect and give him a secure , loving home .
" I 've told Jack that Mummy did something very naughty and put something in Daddy 's drink , and that she will have to go away for a while because of what she did , " says Lee .
" We had a very strong bond before , and we are rebuilding it now .
He 's by nature a very happy , easy - going lad , but sometimes he gets upset .
" He 's lost his mum ; his dad has these injuries and he does n't know who to blame , but we are going to make sure he receives all the help and counselling he needs .
" I asked him once if his mum ever talked about me to him and he said : ' No , never . '
I just ceased to exist for her .
I may have survived but I 'm dead in her eyes .
" Jack says he does n't want to see his mum at the moment , but if he changes his mind I would put my own feelings aside and we would take him .
His needs come first . "
It is perhaps more than Kate Knight deserves .
What Comcast / Bittorrent Actually Means : Bittorrent Selling Hardware
from the less - or - more - than - you - expected ?
dept
Comcast 's decision to collaborate with Bittorrent , Inc. attracted a predictably huge amount of attention and analysis .
But surprisingly little of it has actually speculated as to what Bittorrent , Inc. is actually going to do for Comcast .
When guesses have been ventured , they 've frequently suggested that the company will throw its weight around in order to alter the protocol and make it more friendly to Comcast 's network .
But this is unlikely for exactly the reasons Prof .
Felten discusses at that link ( though Felten actually argues that altering the protocol is the goal ) .
Instead , I think there are reasons to believe that Bram Cohen 's startup will be selling network appliances to Comcast .
There are two problems facing Comcast .
( 1 ) the expense that Bittorrent incurs in infrastructure demands and bandwidth bills and ( 2 ) the public outcry and potential FCC action invited by its initial artless solution to that problem .
Announcing the partnership with Bittorrent , Inc. ; pledging to increase upload capacity ( as it no doubt planned to anyway ) ; and ceasing to forge RST packets all go a long way toward solving the second problem .
But the first problem -- the expense -- remains , and it may prove to be the area where the new partnership has the most to offer .
Have a look at the quote that Torrentfreak got from Bittorrent , Inc. 's Ashwin Navin :
We decided to collaborate with Comcast because they agreed to stop using RSTs , increase upload capacity , and evaluate network hardware that accelerates media delivery and file transfers .
Bittorrent , Inc. has primarily been known for acquiring uTorrent and for working to pitch BT as a content distribution system .
But it 's also announced partnerships with various hardware manufacturers .
And while some of these vendors are probably looking for little more than to be able to slap " Bittorrent approved ! " stickers on their consumer - grade routers , others clearly have the expertise to make network appliances .
This is what Bittorrent , Inc. may be selling to Comcast .
What will these theoretical boxes do ?
Despite Comcast 's announced intention to be protocol - agnostic , it seems most likely that the devices would serve as P2P repeaters , keeping more of a given swarm inside Comcast 's systems and thereby minimizing expensive trips across the network boundary .
Contrary to all of the online wailing about bandwidth hogs degrading its neighbors ' internet service , this expense was always the real issue : it 's telling that forged RST packets were only ever sent for Bittorrent connections that extended beyond Comcast 's network .
Establishing a repeater product would also add nicely to the company 's Bittorrent DNA offering .
Whatever the specifics , minimizing network expenses is a reasonable goal that Comcast is certain to continue to pursue .
Hopefully Bittorrent Inc. will help them find a way to do so without antagonizing their customers .

Hiring a President II : Why I Endorse Obama
In 2004 , a wrote an essay titled Hiring a President that looked at the question of why we in the United States elect our president with a process that looks like a Miss America beauty pageant crossed with a fundraising marathon .
On the other hand , when our public companies hire a new CEO , they use a much more rational process that looks at the actual relevant skills of the job candidates .
We can't fix the process in time for the 2008 elections , but I can look at the candidates as if they were interviewing for the job of CEO of the US .
What is clear in 2008 , more so than in 2004 , is that what we need now is a turnaround specialist .
The hard part about effecting a turnaround is fear of change .
I remember when I took over leadership of NASA Ames ' Computational Sciences Division .
This was a high - achieving division that was not in need of major changes .
But still , the upper management of the center hired a coach to help me through the transition period .
The coach stressed fear of change as the main obstacle I would have to overcome .
I thought he was exaggerating the problem , but it turns out he was right .
Everyone wants things to get better , but there is a natural tendency to resist change .
To overcome that , a business needs someone who can institute change .
Articulate a clear vision of where the company needs to go , and how that differs from the current direction .
Convince employees to buy in to the need for the new approach , and inspire them to work hard towards the goal .
Reassure shareholders and analysts that the turnaround process is on track and that the goal is clear , achievable , and will be profitable .
Most importantly , Obama is willing and able to work with everyone , not just with his base .
Clinton wants to reach out to republicans and others who disagree with her , and she has demonstrated some good success in bipartisan work in the senate .
But the level of animosity that many others have towards her may make it difficult for her to rally politicians and citizens of all parties as president .
McCain and Romney seem to be intent on playing towards their base , and have not shown how they will reach out .
Obama has shown he can do it -- he can be the president that brings the whole country together and leads us in a new direction .
The Details
Replace our approach to energy and the environment with a new approach that will be sustainable for centuries to come .
World oil production may well decline during the next president 's term ( see chart 1 below ) , and global climate change will be much cheaper and easier to fix now than in eight years .
Restore the US 's image in the eyes of the world .
Opinion of the US has fallen in most countries during the Bush presidency ( see chart 2 below ) .
Fix the economy .
If the government had to use generally - accepted accounting practices , the deficit would have been $ 1,300 billion last year , not the $ 248 billion recorded in the official announcements .
US citizens now owe $ 30,000 each in national debt .
Bill Clinton was able to reduce the deficit every year in office , ending with a surplus .
Bush produced the largest deficits in history ( see chart 3 below ) .
One could argue that there are other pressing issues , such as Iraq , Health Care , Immigration and Terrorism .
But the three issues I have mentioned are certainly critical , and are ones that require turnaround .
The good news is that unlike the current president , all four of the remaining viable candidates -- Obama , Clinton , McCain and Romney -- appear to be ready to address the issues seriously .
How do they stand on the issues ?
Energy and Environment : Romney is something of a global climate change denier -- he thinks environmental mandates will hurt the economy , and when in Detroit promised to fight against the regulations to increase fuel efficiency that Bush just signed .
This is short - sighted and self - destructive : if he shields US automakers from having to increase fuel efficiency , they will just fall farther behind in the global marketplace .
McCain believes climate change is an important issue but wants market forces to fix the problem for him .
Clinton and Obama take this issue more seriously , particularly Obama , who understands that the effects of climate change could be devastating , and that a succesful renewed clean energy / transportation industry could be an economic windfall for all involved .
Both democrats have appropriate goals for emmission reductions by 2020 .
US Image : McCain and Romney may advocate change , but as supporters of the Bush legacy , they will have a hard time reassuring the world that the US is back on track .
Clinton would bring us back to the era of Clinton I , when the US was viewed in a much better light , but Obama would bring us to the future , and is a more engaging speaker , is respecting and good at working with those with whom he may have disagreements , and has lived outside the US and brings an authentic rapport that the other candidates ( especially McCain ) lack .
Economy :
You might think that Romney , the businessman , would rank best here .
Perhaps , if he were to get into office , he would do a good job .
But his current plans center on cutting taxes .
He has n't yet faced up to the reality of the situation , and prefers to make promises of ever bigger tax cuts .
In the end , the candidates plans are not all that different .

Feliz Natal | Merry Christmas By Marina Chaccur .
“ The 2006 online christmas card started being very real .
In the beginning the letters were drawn by hand , then after the final layout was chosen , the white beads were arranged onto a paper with a very pale outline of the lettering .
In the end , the paper was photographed , the image was altered in Photoshop , and the beads went back to the package . ”
New testimony details alleged Rove ties to prosecution of Democratic governor Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday October 11 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This New testimony released yesterday by the House Judiciary Committee reveals details about the alleged involvement of former Bush administration advisor Karl Rove in the prosecution of Democratic Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
Dana Jill Simpson , a Republican attorney and activist , stated earlier this year that an associate of Rove 's had said that the then top White House political strategist had communicated directly with the Justice Department about " pursuing " the former governor via US attorneys .
In her new 143 - page sworn statement to the House Judiciary , Simpson elaborates on the contents of conversations she says indicate that Rove helped to drive the prosecution of Siegelman .
Simpson says that she was told by the son of current Alabama Gov. Rob Riley , Rob Riley , Jr. , that his father and another prominent state Republican named Bill Canary contacted Rove about Siegelman in 2004 .
That conversation , according to Simpson , prompted Rove to encourage the Justice Department to investigate and eventually indict the former governor .
" What I understood , or what I believed Mr. Canary to be saying , " Simpson says in the transcript , " was that he had had this ongoing conversation with Karl Rove about Don Siegelman , and that Don Siegelman was a thorn to them and basically he was going to -- he had been talking with Rove . "
" Rove had been talking with the Justice Department , " she added , " and they were pursuing Don Siegelman as a result of Rove talking to the Justice Department at the request of Bill Canary . 
Additionally , Simpson was told a judge who hated  the governor would be assigned to the case .
Rob Riley , Jr. " made a statement that [ Judge Mark ] Fuller would hang Don Siegelman , " she said .
" And I asked him how he knew that , if he got him in his court .
And he said that Fuller was -- had been on the Executive Republican Committee at Alabama -- in Alabama before he had been a judge . "
" [ Riley , Jr. ] said that Don Siegelman had caused Fuller to get audited , " she added .
" That 's what Fuller thought .
He hated him for that . "
Siegelman was later convicted on seven counts of corruption -- following a trial presided over by Fuller -- and is currently serving time in Federal prison .
" If Simpson 's version of events is accurate , it would show direct political involvement by the White House in federal prosecutions  a charge leveled by Administration critics in connection with the U.S. attorney scandal that led to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , " Adam Zagorin reports in Time .
 But [ Simpsons ] account is disputed ; those who she alleges told her about Rove 's involvement during a G.O.P. campaign conference call claim that no such conversation took place ,  Time continues .
 Rove himself has not responded to Simpson 's allegations , which are clearly based on second - hand information , and the White House has refused to comment while Siegelman 's case remains on appeal . "
Rob Riley , Jr. " denied Ms. Simpsons accusation ,  reports the New York Times , adding that he said Simpson has more " outlandish accusations  and that none of them are true . 
 Karl has made clear that he had no involvement in that issue at all ,  a White House spokesman said of Rove , according to the Times .
The events leading up to the prosecution of Siegelman will be the subject of an upcoming House Judiciary joint subcommittee hearing .
Earlier this week , the nation 's chief spy screeched about of the danger of cyber attacks – and the need to monitor what everyone does online , in response .
Now , the CIA has made an usually public warning about the perils that network strikes can pose .
Hackers have tried to extort money from overseas utility companies .
At least in one case , the Washington Post reports , the online attackers messed with an electrical grid , disrupting ing power in several cities .
" We do not know who executed these attacks or why , but all involved intrusions through the Internet , " Tom Donahue , the CIA 's top cybersecurity analyst , told a New Orleans trade conference ...
He did not specify where or when the attacks took place , their duration or the amount of money demanded .
Little said the agency would not comment further ...
Cyber extortion is a growing threat in the United States , and attackers have radically increased their take from online gambling sites , e-commerce sites and banks , which pay the money to prevent sites from being shut down and to keep the public from knowing their sites have been penetrated , said Alan Paller , research director at the SANS Institute , the cybersecurity education group that sponsored the meeting .
" The
CIA would n't have changed its policy on disclosure if it was n't important , " Paller said .
" Donahue would n't have said it publicly if he did n't think the threat was very large and that companies needed to fix things right now . "
On Friday Bear Stearns– - even in the throes of a financial collapse that had driven its share price down by three - quarters– - was still worth $ 3.5 billion .
On Sunday night it was worth barely $ 200 m , sold for two bucks a share to J.P. Morgan , in a deal brokered by the Fed .
If this is a bail - out ( and it is ) the shareholders of Bear Stearns are not exactly thrilled about it .
They will want to know why giving away their firm ( whose book value , they had just been told , was in the neighbourhood of $ 80 a share , and whose headquarters building is said to be worth $ 1 billion ) to J.P. Morgan was better for them than going bust .
It was n’t .
Bankruptcy would surely have recovered more value for shareholders than this give - away - –but the Fed evidently feared that closure and disposal of Bear ’s assets would have jeopardized other parts of the country ’s teetering financial system .
Preventing that was the Fed ’s overriding goal .
The firm had to be acquired in a hurry , shored up , and then run , so far as counterparties were concerned , as though nothing had happened .
By any measure , Bear Stearns was not that big : it was surely not “ too big to fail ” .
Apparently , though , it was deemed too delicately interconnected to fail .
One wonders how many such institutions there now are , and who will carry the burden of keeping them in business .
The Fed , helping to answer that question , simultaneously announced a new lending facility for “ primary dealers ” – - non - bank financial firms like Bear , which have hitherto been unable to borrow from the Fed .
This constitutes a remarkable expansion of the Fed ’s financial safety net .
Something else Bear ’s shareholders will want to know is why this facility was not created in time for them to take advantage of it .
At the end of last week , they were having to borrow from the Fed indirectly , through the good offices of J.P. Morgan .
Two days later , J.P. Morgan is getting Bear for nothing , and in addition has been promised as much as $ 30 billion in Fed loans , secured against Bear ’s dodgy assets .
If the assets turn out to be worth less than the loans , the Fed– - ie , the taxpayer– - shoulders the risk .
( And that , by the way , is why these arrangements are indeed a bail - out , though not one that helps Bear ’s original owners . )
On the face of it , this looks like a remarkably good deal for J.P. Morgan .
We will see whether it turns out to be such good value for taxpayers .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

If you face any problem with your computer system you can either fix it yourself or get it fixed by somewhere like Geek Squad .
Most problems are to do with hardware and software related errors , and you can easily fix these yourself with a little patience .
But if you ever feel out of your depth , it ’s always best to stop and get a professional to look at it .
After all , PC repairs cost a lot less than a new PC !
The budget might apply to a one person IT staff or a large enterprise wide IT department .
Maybe someone requires a new laptop , this might have to be in a budget .
This must be sold or explained to non-IT people who might see the IT department as overhead .
That means showing them numbers that make sense and keeping it simple for non -IT folks .
The budget planner must show what was done in the past year and how the money to be allocated for next year will be used .
These usually fix the programming errors , but they can also cause new conflicts within the programming .
It ’s not always perfect , but for some , it answers the “ Why do computers crash ? ” question .
Read update bulletins as they become available to decide which updates you should or should n’t install on your machine .
Longer answer :
They ’ve already started working on it .

Motherboards play a vital role in gaming computer , but in the end , I feel it all depends upon the type of configuration you want such as dual video card support or multi-core processor support .

I tend to spend most on graphic cards , then processor and then motherboard .

Britain must radically change its immigration policy and end immediately the deportation of failed asylum - seekers who fear persecution in Iran , a group of leading peers will tell the Government today .
The call for a moratorium on asylum removals is a direct response to the plight of Mehdi Kazemi , a gay Iranian teenager facing execution if he returns to Iran , whose case has been taken up by The Independent .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In a letter written to this newspaper , 17 members of the House of Lords say the case of Mr Kazemi demonstrates a change of policy is now the " only moral course " for the Government to follow .
And in a stark warning on capital punishment in Iran , the Lords report that , in January alone , more than 30 prisoners were executed for a range of offences deemed criminal by the Middle East state .
The campaign for a more compassionate asylum policy has also been taken up in the House of Commons , where 46 MPs have signed an early day motion demanding that the Government " asserts its position as a supporter of human rights " by granting Mr Kazemi sanctuary .
The peers ' letter , signed by – among others – the film director David Puttnam , the former Commons speaker Betty Boothroyd , and the human rights barrister Helena Kennedy QC , comes the day after a damning report into Britain 's immigration system which described the treatment of refugees in this country as " shameful . "
Jonathan Cox , coordinator of the Independent Asylum Commission , discusses their interim findings as part of the citizen ’s review of the asylum system in the UK , and why they feel that the system is still not fit for purpose .
That report , published by the Independent Asylum Commission , led by a former senior judge , said the immigration policy denied sanctuary to some refugees who were in genuine need of help .
Human rights groups believe the Lords ' letter and yesterday 's report mark a key moment in government thinking on asylum which they hope will lead to a radical overhaul of the list of countries considered too dangerous for asylum - seekers to be deported to .
Asylum rights campaigners also hope such a significant intervention will lead to a broader moratorium on deportations to all countries with poor or questionable human rights records , not just Iran .
But the Lords believe Mr Kazemi 's case is of such grave concern they must act to change British asylum policy on Iran first .
" The case of Mehdi Kazemi demonstrates that a moratorium on the removal of those who could face persecution , torture or execution in Iran is the only moral course of action , " the peers write in their letter .

Mr Kazemi is still being held in an immigration detention centre in the Netherlands from where he is expected to be transferred to the UK in the next few days .
He moved to Britain in 2005 to study English in London and Brighton .
But , while he was here , he discovered that his former boyfriend had been executed for sodomy and his own life was in danger because he had been named as the man 's lover .
Mr Kazemi's family , some of whom have lived in the United Kingdom for more than 30 years , urged him to claim asylum .
But , last year , the Home Office rejected his application forcing him to flee to the Netherlands .
His case provoked a public outcry and , this month , the Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , agreed to reconsider his claim .
Speaking from an immigration detention centre in Rotterdam last week , Mr Kazemi said he still feared for his future .
" I know what Jacqui Smith has said about my case and that , of course , is a good thing .
But I know what this Government can do to me .
They tried to take me at Christmas two years ago when everyone was away , even my lawyer . "
It was only the intervention of his MP , the Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes , that prevented his deportation .
In an 11th - hour appeal , Mr Hughes persuaded the Home Office to halt the deportation so he could look into the case .
Announcing the decision to rehear Mr Kazemi 's case , Ms Smith said : " I have decided Mr Kazemi 's case should be reconsidered on his return to the UK . "
In their letter the Lords say : " We welcome the decision of the Home Secretary to look again at Mr Kazemi 's case and to reconsider the original decision to refuse him asylum in the United Kingdom .
The Home Office have acted appropriately in this , as indeed they have acted within the law throughout this case .
" However , this is not simply a legal matter but a moral one too ... when we are making decisions of life or death , we must be aware of the human consequences of the cold letter of the law . "
In response to an earlier plea by 70 peers to grant Mr Kazemi asylum , Ms Smith defended the Home Office record .
She said in a letter seen by The Independent : " I can assure you the Government is committed to providing protection for those individuals found to be genuinely in need in accordance with our commitments under international law .
" The Home Office Country of Origin Information Service closely monitors the human rights situation in all the countries that generate asylum - seekers to the UK , including Iran .
It provides accurate , objective , sourced and up - to - date information . "
She added " The published Country Reports are updated on a rolling basis and are compiled from a wide range of external information sources including the United Nations High Commission for Refugees World Health Organisation , human rights organisations , news media and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office .
" The current Home Office Iran Country Report was published on 31 January 2008 and includes a specific section on Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender Persons . "
The case of Mehdi Kazemi
Mehdi Kazemi came to Britain in 2005 to study English at a college in Brighton .
But although the young Iranian had settled well into British life he always intended returning home to Tehran .
In April 2006 he received a telephone call from his father who told him Medhi 's former boyfriend had been executed .
He had been interrogated by the state police authorities and named Medhi as his partner .
Fearing for his life if he returned to Iran , Mehdi claimed asylum in Britain .
But last year his case was refused .
He fled to the Netherlands where he was detained in an immigration centre .
A Dutch court ordered him to be returned to the UK , where the Home Secretary agreed to reconsider his case .
In an open letter to Jacqui Smith , Mehdi said : " I can not stop my attraction towards men .
This is something that I will have to live with the rest of my life .
If I return to Iran I will be arrested and executed . "

On the big screen , films like Robocop , Universal Soldier and forthcoming release Iron Man show man-machines with superhuman powers .
But in Utah they are turning science fiction into reality .
We are at a research facility on the outskirts of Salt Lake City , ringed by beautiful snow - capped mountains .
Once they held the Winter Olympics here ; now they are testing endurance in other ways .
The aluminium limbs gleam in the brilliant sunshine , as the strange metal skeleton hangs from a safety harness at the outdoor testing site .
It seems to be treading water ; actually its programme is telling it to keep the hydraulic fluid in its joints moving .
Rex Jameson , a software engineer here at laboratories run by Sarcos , the robotics firm which designed the XOS exoskeleton , steps up and into the suit .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The lightweight aluminium exoskeleton , called XOS , senses Rex 's every move and instantly moves with him ; it is almost like a shadow or a second skin .
It is designed for agility that can match a human's , but with strength and endurance that far outweigh our abilities .
With the exoskeleton on and fully powered up , Rex can easily pull down weight of more than 90 kilos , more than he weighs .
For the army the XOS could mean quicker supply lines , or fewer injuries when soldiers need to lift heavy weights or move objects around repeatedly .
Initial models would be used as workhorses , on the logistics side .
Later models , the army hopes , could go into combat , carrying heavier weapons , or even wounded colleagues .

There are still problems to solve , not least how to create a mobile power supply that can last an effective length of time .
But the US military expects to take delivery of these early prototypes next year , and hopefully deploy some refined versions within eight years .
It is a long way off before we see robot soldiers that can fly or fire missiles - like in the movies - but the designers are already imagining future versions more reminiscent of Hollywood .

2008 IGF finalist World of Goo is now slated to be released on the Nintendo Wii , PC , Mac and Linux platforms .
According to a blurb on developer 2D Boy ’s website , the title will hit PC and Wii in 2008 , and will be coming to Mac and Linux at a later , unannounced date .
Normally this is the kind of information that would fly under the radar , but as you can see from the above video , World of Goo is a seemingly inventive , adorable amalgam of Lemmings and Worms wrapped in a strikingly well implemented physics system .
Plus , to use a technical term , it ’s wicked cute .
World of Goo [ 2D Boy , via WiiNintendo ]
Due to my last trip to Columbia Business school , I ran into this interesting article by Marjorie Kelly from 1995 :
Here 's a story that makes me mad .
It 's a story about the purpose of capitalism , the ways of wealth creation , and for whom the cash register tolls .
It 's a story about a shoe salesman .
His name is John Ulviden , and I first heard about him from a friend more than a year ago .
But as I read headlines about soaring profits and falling wages , I began recalling his story .
I 'm disturbed that S&P 500 profits continue to soar - up 40 percent last year alone - while real hourly wages keep sinking , as they have since 1973 .
John 's story seems to me a parable of what 's gone wrong .
For twenty - one years , John worked as an independent sales representative for Adidas , building his Wisconsin territory up to $ 7 million in annual sales , and his commission up to $ 170,000 .
I mean , this guy was good .
And he had a good product , in a period of rapid growth ( which he helped create ) .
Out of a national sales force of eighty - five , John was one of the top four revenue producers .
And then he was fired .
" Basically , I was making too much money , " John told me .
" Their philosophy is they do n't want anyone to make a lot of money . "
His tone was matter - of - fact , but I could hear the bitterness .
" This happens all the time .
A salesperson is always the ugly stepchild . "
To get rid of John , his manager used the thirty - day cancellation clause in his contract .
" Territory re-alignment , " they called it .
It took three people to replace him , but the company re-configured the pay system and saved money .
I phoned the manager who terminated John , but he declined to discuss it , saying it was a " personal matter . "
As for John , he started over with new shoe lines , and his income this year will approach $ 25,000 .
In capitalism we call this a success story .
A company re-engineers its sales force .
The hard - driving people who build sales are replaced by cheaper folks who can manage existing accounts .
Costs go down .
Profits go up .
What makes me angry about John 's story is how successful he was at creating wealth .
After all , wealth creation is the core task of capitalism .
It 's the genius of the system : Companies end up with more money than they start with , generating profits the way a plant generates oxygen .
This is presumably what justifies wealth piling up :
Those who create it get to keep it .
Only not quite .
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales did n't have such a good weekend .
First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden .
Now , accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created .
On Friday , reports surfaced that the married - but - divorcing internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden .
Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts , which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag .
On Saturday , Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website ( which he later moved to his personal site ) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation 's policies , and stating that the affair had ended .
Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay .
So , what 's the big deal when a relationship goes sour ?
Well , the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her " clean up " what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page , and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence improperly to make changes .
Former associates of Wales ' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization at the foundation .
Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool , who left the foundation last year , wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the nonprofit foundation as his own personal piggy bank .
Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $ 300 + bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors , Wool alleges .
According to Wool , the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia Foundation took away Wales ' corporate credit card .
" There were occasions where he used [ the Wikimedia Foundation ] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission .
And , as someone who was in there for the mission part of it , I found that rather distressful , " Wool told Epicenter .
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment .

Britain and France are to sign a deal to construct a new generation of nuclear power stations and export the technology around the world in an effort to combat climate change .
The pact is to be announced at the " Arsenal summit " next week when prime ministers Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy will meet at the Emirates stadium in north London .
Britain hopes to take advantage of French expertise to build the power stations that do not rely on fossil fuels .
Nearly 79 % of France 's electricity comes from its highly - developed nuclear power industry .
The UK's ageing nuclear plants are ready for decommissioning and supply 20 % of its energy needs .
Brown hopes the partnership will create a skilled British labour force who would then work in partnership with France to sell nuclear power stations to other countries over the next 15 years .
Britain this week started the process of licensing four generic reactor designs , including the French - designed Areva run by EDF ( Électricté de France ) .
The Anglo - French plan will be controversial among those who believe that nuclear power is too dangerous and dirty , and that governments should place more emphasis on renewable sources of power as part of an international effort to reduce carbon emissions by 50 % by 2050 .
There is a growing view within the energy industry that nuclear power could be the next lucrative market .
British Energy , the country 's biggest reactor operator , has become the target of a potential £ 7bn takover bid as the UK tries to guarantee a secure future energy supply without relying on gas imports from Russia as North Sea oil and gas supplies dwindle .
The nuclear deal is one of several Anglo - French initiatives the two are expected to announce when they meet on Thursday .
They will also unveil a new drive against illegal immigration , with a range of measures to tighten border controls at the Channel ports and take joint action to remove failed asylum seekers .
The immigration package will include :
· Joint charter flights which would start in Britain , make a stop - over in France and take migrants back to countries including Iran , Afghanistan and Iraq .
The French believe they can learn from the British on how to implement forced and voluntary removals , including of foreign prisoners
· An increase in the number of lorry checks at French and British ports .
Ministers believe more staff could double the number of lorries searched , from 1 million last year .
It is claimed 18,000 illegal immigrants were stopped in trucks in 2007
· An increase in the number of French undercover officers targeting gangs smuggling people into Britain
· Confirmation there would be no Sangatte II reception centre in Calais to attract asylum seekers and migrants .
Sarkozy will use his two - day visit to Britain to push for a plan to sign a Europe - wide pact on immigration during France 's presidency of the EU in the second half of the year .
The pact would require European countries not to grant rights of residency to large numbers of illegal immigrants , and sign up to an EU policy of returning illegal immigrants either by offering incentives to leave voluntarily or by use of forced repatriation .
The summit is also likely to see further steps on defence cooperation .
Sarkozy is expected to tell Brown privately the details of a French deployment of special forces to the frontlines in Afghanistan , and in return seek British backing for an expanded European role in Nato .

ON Feb. 9 , 1950 , Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed his place in the history books by telling a crowd in Wheeling , W.Va. , that the State Department was full of Communists .
“ We are not dealing with spies who get 30 pieces of silver to steal the blueprint of a new weapon , ” he said .
“ We are dealing with a far more sinister type of activity because it permits the enemy to guide and shape our policy . ”
The claim was baseless , scurrilous  and plagiarized .
The same words , practically verbatim , had been spoken on the floor of the House of Representatives two weeks earlier , by Representative Richard M. Nixon of California .
Senator McCarthy ’s wholesale borrowing was discovered only years later .
Had reporters noticed it sooner , he might have run into a different kind of trouble than he did , for the press loves a plagiarism quarrel .
Consider the well - aired sins of numerous writers in recent years  and last week ’s back - and - forth over Senator Barack Obama ’s uncredited use of the words of others .
Last weekend it was reported that Mr. Obama used on the presidential campaign trail a rhetorical set - piece first spoken by Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts , a friend and co-chairman of his campaign .
The sequence contained famous political lines followed by the refrain “ Just words ”  a gibe meant to rebut the taunt of his rival , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , that he offers voters only speeches , not deeds .
Mr. Obama acknowledged that the failure to cite Mr. Patrick was an error , if an unimportant one .
In Thursday ’s debate , Mr. Obama said he thought it was “ silly ” that this was even under discussion .
Mrs. Clinton pressed the case , saying , “ If your candidacy is going to be about words , then they should be your own words . ”
Mr. Obama is unusual among politicians for having written a memoir praised for its literary skill and for being the author of at least some of his own finely wrought speeches .
That reputation is partly why the suggestion of plagiarism was startling to some .
Hendrik Hertzberg , who was a speechwriter for Jimmy Carter , wrote on his blog at newyorker.com that Mr. Obama ’s was “ not a mortal sin , ” but rather a “ damaging mistake ... given that Obama ’s eloquence and ‘ authenticity ’ are so central to his appeal . ”
To appreciate the strain online miscreants are putting on internet infrastructure , consider this :
As much as three per cent of the net 's traffic is malicious garbage designed to inflict damage one party or another , Arbor Networks estimates .
The endless barrage of malicious packets comprise about 1,300 distributed denial of service attacks every day , according to Arbor 's ATLAS portal , which examines traffic flowing over 68 separate internet service providers .
During peaks , DDoS attacks accounted for " well above " five per cent of aggregate reported traffic , according to the data , which was culled over 18 months .
By contrast , email makes up one per cent to 1.5 per cent of all internet traffic .
Assuming 66 per cent of that is spam , that means about four per cent of internet packets are junk of one form or another .
Attackers mostly use DDoS attacks as a way of exacting revenge on enemies .
Greg King , allegedly tried to DDoS security watchdog site CastleCops into the Stone Age after a forum participant bad - mouthed one of his reprobate friends .
At its peak , the five - day attack flooded CastleCops with close to 1 gigabyte of data every second .
King has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection with the case .
Other targets include official Estonian websites targeted by Russian nationalists and the the Church of Scientology , which was recently taken offline by critics .
For a brief spell , attackers tried to use DDoS attacks as a means of extracting protection money from vulnerable online businesses , especially gambling sites , but that practice seems to have died down .
The most common DDoS targets observed by ATLAS were IRC servers , although the amount of junk traffic thrown at them tends to pale when compared with attacks on other targets .
The most common attack vectors are SYN floods , with ICMP floods coming in a close second .
While it may seem an onerous task to generate so much junk , attackers manage to take time off during the holidays .
Attack frequency drops " significantly " on Christmas Day , New Year 's Eve and New Year 's Day , according to Arbor 's Danny McPherson , " perhaps while the miscreants are either hung over or expending their spoils . " ®

" She told me my father was dead and I would have to be the man of the house .
I thought ' mum , I 'm only five years old ' .
But I had to stand up and be counted - and I did . "
To this day being told the news of his father 's death is still vivid in Donald Overall 's memory .
Over 500,000 children lost their father in World War I .
It was the biggest loss of fathers in modern British history .
Those who did return carried the mental and physical scars .
Donald Overall , then and now , became the man of the house ... aged five
Remembrance of the 750,000 British soldiers who lost their lives has long been one of the nation 's most important rituals and will be marked on Sunday , along with Armistice Day .
But the impact on their children is an aspect of the tragedy that 's rarely explored .
So how did they cope ?
And for those who did get their dad back , could home life ever return to normality after the horror of what their fathers had been through ?
When war began in 1914 more than two million men dutifully volunteered to serve King and country .
Fathers enlisted alongside young , single men in a wave of patriotic fervour .
Treasured memories
As the pressure on the British forces increased , the government was forced to introduce conscription and raise the upper age limit for service from 38 to 41 .
It meant even more fathers went to war .

Home leave meant Mr Overall 's father could put him to bed for the first time ever and it remains one of his most treasured memories .
" To me he was everything , he was a man that I wanted to be like , " he says .
" He carried me upstairs on his left shoulder ... my head was against his face and I can remember seeing his ears , and smelling his khaki and smelling his tobacco . "
But many fathers were virtual strangers to their children and had to work hard to win the trust of a young child who they had yet to establish a bond with .
Returning to the front after was hard .
The awful carnage of trench warfare was often left out of letters home .
The men chose to deny the horror by putting on a brave face and clinging to comforting events at home , like birthdays .
Lost for words
" My mother had told my dad that my second birthday was coming along and I wanted an engine , " says George Musgrave .
" He 'd been injured at the time and somehow ... he drew me an engine and that is an engine that 's remained vividly in my mind and has always linked me to him . "
From 1916 onwards the numbers killed on the Western Front increased dramatically .
The bad news arrived by telegram or by letter and the impact was devastating .
" Mother opened it , she read the telegram and collapsed on the floor ...
I was holding on to her skirt , " recalls Mr Overall .
Fathers were scarred by the war
But for children with no , or little , memory of their fathers , the effect of their deaths was incomprehensible .
" I boasted about it to my friends I 'm afraid , " says Charles Chilton .
" I did n't know my father , I did n't have any feeling for him , he was a photograph hanging on the wall .
I 'd never seen him , never touched him . "
The worst news of all for a family was to learn that their father had been shot for cowardice .
It was the fate of 306 British soldiers to be shot at dawn .
' Hard to cry '
Harry Farr was shot at dawn on 18 October 1916 .
For his daughter Gertrude Harris , and her mother , the tragedy was compounded by shame .
Her father 's war pension was stopped and they were asked to leave their rented accommodation .
They were homeless and penniless .
They went to work for a wealthy family in Hampstead , and were treated well .
But their situation always felt precarious and Gertrude was told to behave and never to cry in case she was heard .
Photos were often all children to remind them
When the war ended in 1918 the soldiers who returned home were feted as heroes .
But carrying the scars of fighting in the trenches often made their reintegration into normal family life difficult .
The full horror of their ordeal often remained unspoken .
" I remember asking my mother why my father slept in the way he did , " says Mabel McCoy .
" I do n't know how he managed but he wrapped the sheet and the blanket completely round his head ... covering his eyes with just his nose sticking out .
" My mother 's answer was that he had to sleep like that in the war because he was very afraid of rats .
" It was very difficult for me as a small child to understand why my father never spoke about his experiences in the war . "
The returning soldiers had been promised homes fit for heroes , but with the post - war economy in turmoil many had to endure further hardship and poverty .
New breadwinners
It was most difficult of all for war widows , who had to get by on a meagre army pension .
Some remarried , often for the sake of the children .
But the loss of so many men in the war meant that competition for their hand in marriage was fierce .
Even when a woman was successful in finding a new breadwinner it was often difficult for the children to accept their new father , as Mabel Howatt 's mother discovered .
Letters were a lifeline for soldiers
For some the battles continued .
Gertrude Harris campaigned for the pardon of the 306 men shot by firing squad for cowardice .
It took 15 years to win the case .
" I was so happy for it to be proven that my father was not a coward and he was a brave soldier as my mother said , " she says .
" Every year when she watched the Armistice she used to see the veterans walking along and say ' my Harry should have been amongst them ' . "
For others , they are still mourning the loss of their father and always will .
" I miss him , I missed him when I was a boy and now I miss him as an old man , " says Mr Overall .
" I 've never forgotten , I never will , never will . "
What Did You Do in the Great War , Daddy ? will be broadcast on Sunday , 11 November at 2000 GMT on BBC Four .
hanging out the upstairs window whilst her Mother made the beds and she saw a man with red hair and glasses coming up the street and said " Daddy 's coming home " and her Mum came to the window and without a word ran down the stairs and they all ran down to meet him !
I always thought it was such a lovely story !

My mother 's father went off to WW1 an ordinary enough young man , according to family history , but he returned home , after he'd taken part in the Battle of the Somme and God knows what other horrors , as a wife - beating drunkard who scared and shamed all his 8 children .
My aunt , who was a most loving person , once said of him : " he was a horrid little man and I hated him " which really shocked me .
That was our little tragedy - think of it multiplied across all the countries that took part in that conflict and all the others since .

I remember my late grandmother telling me that her father came home on leave and when he was at the station waiting for his train to go back to the front said to his brother - in - law look after them I am not coming back .
He was killed a couple of days later and nine months after his leave my grandmother was born .
My great grandmother did remarry and have other children but her new husband was never accepted by my grandmother and her elder brother and sister and from what I have been told he did not accept them either .
Nicola Tustain , Bury st Edmunds - England
My Dad , who died in 2000 , lost his father in Ypres in 1918 .
My grandfather was only 21 and my father was just 18 months old so was deprived of growing up with him .
But he knew all about his dad , the wonderful man he was , a Sunday School teacher and clerk on the railways at Stockport in Cheshire .
He told me his father was never out of his thoughts especially when he joined the RAF to fight in the Second World War .
I was fortunate to have grown up with such a brilliant dad and despite discussing the subject with him many times , can still not contemplate how difficult it must have been for him to be without a dad himself and from an early age having to become " the man of the house " with a mother and older sister .
I have visited my grandfather 's grave in a small Belgian village many times and went there with my father .
His loss is just as real to me as it was to my dad .
A number of years ago I was dealing with the estate of a spinster who died with no surviving relatives .
In the First World War she had lost her fiancé and 2 brothers and she had never got over her loss .
Hanging on her wall was a photograph of a soldier but there was no note as to which one of the three is was .
The photograph was due to be put in a skip so I took it home and hung it on my wall and it 's still there .
On Sunday we will remember him even if I still do n't know who he is .

My Grandmother lost her first husband in 1917 .
She was left with 6 children .
She remarried in 1919 to a man with 6 children also .
Unfortunately my Grandmothers boys had to be placed into Barnardo's as she got no pension for them and my Grandfather started to beat them .
They were eventually emigrated to Canada and only one has been traced .
I still feel sad that they suffered so much .
Sheila Robinson , York
My father was in the WWII he suffered mental scars after a parachute jump went wrong in Algeria where is was training to go out over Arnem .
If he had done he would n't have survived as the Germans machined them as they came down .
The accident left his nerves shot to pieces .
The Doctors now call him a problem patient , they need to remember that the likes of men like my Dad are the reason why they have the lifestyle they have today .
ann , whitstable
Tears are rolling down my cheeks at the thought of a small child carried on his fathers shoulder and still clinging to that memory after all these years .
So touching and sad to think of the terrible loss suffered by so many .
Mr Overall will never forget , and after reading this story it will stay in my mind too .
Lucy Chaplin , Lichfield , England
The stories and the memories of both wars are still etched in the minds of most people in the UK over the age of 30 .
Even if we are too young to remember either war , we grew up hearing the stories and seeing films documentaries and lessons in school .
And I still can't believe what our soldiers were conscripted to do !
I am very glad that conscription is not necessary any longer but I fear that if a new war on these scales happens , we will have hundreds of thousands of British men and women forced back into that life .
I just hope that they get more dignity and more funding than those poor souls of WWI .

Performance comparison of FreeBSD 7.0 to FreeBSD 4.11 and Dragonfly BSD 1.12 ( Mar 2008 )
In May 2007 I ran some benchmarks of Dragonfly 1.8 to evaluate progress of its SMP implementation , which was the original focus of the project when it launched in 2003 and is still widely believed to be an area in which they had made concrete progress .
This was part of a larger cross-OS multiprocessor performance evaluation comparing improvements in FreeBSD to Linux , NetBSD and other operating systems .
The 2007 results showed essentially no performance increase from multiple processors on dragonfly 1.8 , in contrast to the performance of FreeBSD 7.0 which scaled to 8 CPUs on the benchmark .
Recently Dragonfly 1.12 was released , and the question was raised on the dragonfly - users mailing list of how well the OS performs after a further year of development .
I performed several benchmarks to study this question .
In this round of testing I compared Dragonfly 1.12 , FreeBSD 4.11 and FreeBSD 7.0 , running on the same 8 - core Xeon hardware .
On Dragonfly the GENERIC kernel configuration was used except for enabling SMP and APIC_IO ( for the SMP tests ) , and removing I486_CPU .
Under FreeBSD the GENERIC kernel was used except for enabling the SCHED_ULE scheduler on 7.0 , removing I486_CPU and enabling SMP when appropriate .
The test applications were compiled from ports / pkgsrc and the same versions and configuration options used for each OS .
MySQL
MySQL configuration is the same as in my previous test and is also documented here
Here are the results :
Dragonfly 1.12 achieves peak SMP performance of only 15 % better than UP performance , and drops to about 50 % below UP performance at higher loads .
Enabling SMP has a 20 % performance overhead on this benchmark .
UP mode is faster than 4.11 when using the libthread_xu library .
With libc_r ( not graphed ) performance is identical to 4.11 in both UP and SMP mode , so the UP performance increase is most likely due to the thread library .
Note : I am using mysql 5.0.51 in the current tests , which has different performance characteristics than the older 5.0.37 tested last year , so the current data cannot directly be compared to the previous dragonfly 1.8 graphs to evaluate whether a small amount of progress was made since 1.8 .
However , there does not appear to be any significant performance improvement from dragonfly 1.8 to 1.12 .
FreeBSD 7.0 scales to 8 CPUs on this benchmark .
Peak performance is 6.5 times higher than peak dragonfly performance , and 9.0 times higher than FreeBSD 4.11 performance .
UP performance is consistent with SMP performance with a single thread .
7.0 UP is 45 % faster than 4.11 UP and 10 % faster than dragonfly UP .
Note that while these benchmarks are on a test system with 8 CPU cores , the results also provide information about performance on systems with fewer than 8 cores , such as dual core systems .
If the system does not show appreciable performance gain when 2 threads are active and most CPUs are idle , it is unlikely to perform much better when the system only has 2 CPUs .
I could not test this directly because I do n't know how to disable CPUs at boot time / run time in dragonfly .
For example , this graph shows FreeBSD 7.0 running postgresql on the same system with 1 , 2 , 4 or 8 CPU cores active , as well as comparing the UP and SMP kernel running with 1 CPU active
The performance seen with 8 CPUs also scales down to 1 , 2 and 4 CPUs .
This also shows that there is negligible overhead from running the FreeBSD 7.0 SMP kernel on a UP system on this workload .
Filesystem I/
O
Currently the major focus of the dragonfly project is the development of a new filesystem , so it 's interesting to see how well the dragonfly filesystem layer performs .
I created a 500 MB memory filesystem ( MFS ) and used sysbench to perform multi- threaded random write I/O .
It seems that MFS cannot create file systems larger than 500MB , which was a limiting factor on dragonfly and 4.11 .
Dragonfly 1.12 UP performance is about 30 % lower than FreeBSD 4.11 UP performance .
Enabling SMP does not impose an overhead on this test , but there is no performance benefit seen from multiple threads , and instead performance drops as low as FreeBSD 4.11 SMP performance at high loads .
FreeBSD 7.0 does not support the MFS file system ; the nearest alternative is the tmpfs filesystem which was used for this test .
The sysbench file I/ O benchmark apparently has a race condition that cause it to abort under high I/O load ( enabling debugging shows that sysbench is sometimes generating I / O requests that are out of range of the specified test parameters such as file size and number of files , so this appears to be a sysbench bug ) .
This was only a factor on 7.0 but the benchmarks were averaged over 5 trials to reduce error .
FreeBSD 7 scales to 3 simultaneous writers and peak SMP performance is a factor of 4 times higher than dragonfly peak performance and 2.6 times higher than freebsd 4 performance .
FreeBSD 7 peak performance may be limited by memory bandwidth rather than kernel scaling limitations , although those come into play at higher loads .
FreeBSD 7.0 has a 20 % overhead from SMP on this test compared to UP , which may be because the lockmgr primitive has not yet been optimized for SMP mode ( this work is in progress ) .
However , SMP performance exceeds UP with a second writer , and SMP remains 17 % faster than UP at high loads .
UP performance on FreeBSD 7 is 2.6 times higher than dragonfly UP performance and 1.8 times higher than freebsd 4 UP performance .
It is unknown how much of this difference is due to the different design of the tmpfs filesystem .
Networking
Networking is the major subsystem that has received SMP development work in dragonfly , although it was never completed and still does not allow concurrency in network processing ( FreeBSD has a parallelized network stack , and further performance work is ongoing in FreeBSD 8.0 ) .
I did not directly test network performance as e.g. a DNS or web server .
I can do this if someone is interested .
NFS performance on this hardware was anomalously low in both 4.11 and dragonfly , averaging only about 300 KB / sec on an intel gigabit ethernet NIC .
This did not impact the other benchmarks because they were not performing NFS I/O .
Stability
The assertion is often made by dragonfly project supporters that dragonfly has " much better " stability than FreeBSD .
It is not clear by what metric this is being objectively evaluated ( if at all ) .
A direct measurement of stability is desirable .
One measure of system stability is the ability to function correctly under extreme overload conditions .
This tends to provoke race conditions and other exceptions at a higher frequency than at the light loads encountered on desktop systems .
To simulate system overload I ran the stress2 benchmark suite on the 8 - core xeon .
This is a suite of test applications that impose massive overload on the system under various concurrent workloads .
FreeBSD is able to run this test suite indefinitely without errors .
The first problem was encountered while trying to unpack the stress2 archive to NFS :
# ls
stress2.tgz
# tar xvf stress2.tgz
tar : Error opening archive : Failed to open ' stress2.tgz ' :
No such file or directory
# ls -l
ls : stress2.tgz :
No such file or directory
total 0
This looks like it might be a bug with the dragonfly name cache .
After starting the stress suit , the system panicked in under 4 minutes .
Unfortunately I was unable to obtain details of the panic because the serial console was not working .
Obviously one panic does not demonstrate wide - ranging system instability , but it does point to a possible selection bias amongst the project supporters , who may not be looking hard enough for the stability problems that exist .
Summary
As with the dragonfly 1.8 kernel , the dragonfly 1.12 kernel does not scale to a second CPU on the benchmarks performed , and the limited SMP implementation can cause a large performance loss at higher loads .
There is sometimes a large performance overhead from enabling SMP compared to UP , and performance was sometimes worse than that of 4.11 .
In all cases measured , FreeBSD 7.0 performs significantly better than both FreeBSD 4.11 and dragonfly 1.12 in both SMP and UP configurations .

A new poll by the non-partisan think tank the Center for Immigration Studies found that the majority of voters know very little about the three remaining presidential candidates ’ positions on immigration .
All three candidates favor eventual citizenship for illegal immigrants who meet certain requirements , but only 34 % of McCain voters , 42 % of Clinton voters , and 52 % of Obama voters could correctly identify their candidate ’s position .
Among McCain voters , 35 % thought he favored returning illegal immigrants home .
Ten percent thought he favored mass deportations , and 21 % did n’t know his position .
The poll also found that voters often held a different position then the candidate they voted for .
Only 31 % of McCain voters shared his position on immigration .
45 % of Clinton voters shared her position , and Obama did the best with 61 % sharing his position .
In the cases of McCain and Clinton each of those campaigns has been intentionally vague about their candidates ’ positions on immigration .
Advertisements
McCain would love nothing more than for Republicans to forget his support for the Bush immigration reform , and can anyone forget Clinton flailing about trying to dodge the question of driver ’s licenses for illegal immigrants during a Democratic debate ?
However , each of these candidates , if elected , faces an uphill battle with many American citizens on the issue of citizenship for illegal immigrants .
Only 25 % of Republicans and 50 % of Democrats say that they would support a plan for the eventual legalization of illegal immigrants .
If immigration becomes an issue during the fall campaign , McCain is the candidate with the most to lose .
A general election matchup between Clinton and McCain would probably result in the issue being buried and not discussed .
McCain ’s support of the Bush plan almost killed his presidential campaign once , and if it becomes an issue again , McCain could lose most of his base .
Democrats would rather not talk about the issue at all , but immigration is not nearly the divisive issue for the Democrats that it is for the Republicans .
Hispanic voters are already angry and leaving the GOP because of their hard line stance on this issue .
It would not surprise me to see the Democratic nominee embrace the Bush plan in an attempt to court Hispanic votes .
By taking such a radical stand on the issue , the Republican Party has destroyed two decades worth of Hispanic support that will play a critical role in states like Nevada , New Mexico , and Colorado this November .
John McCain is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to immigration .
He will either alienate his white border state support , or send Hispanic voters flocking to the Democrats if he adopts his party ’s stance on the issue .
The Democrats would probably be wise to sit back and let the GOP tear itself apart over this issue .

High - profile videogame opponent Jack Thompson will no longer be able to file documents in Florida court following a ruling on a show cause order issued last month .
According to a GamePolitics report , the Florida Supreme Court has sanctioned Thompson , meaning if he wishes to file documents with the Florida Court , he will have to hire an attorney to do so on his behalf .
The action comes as the result of a show cause order issued in February which said Thompson must " show cause on or before March 5 , 2008 , why this Court should not find that you have abused the legal process and impose upon you a sanction for abusing the legal system , " which would include the rejection of any future filings submitted by Thompson himself .
At the time , Thompson called the order " the single greatest gift any court has ever given ( him ) " and claimed he would " deconstruct " the Florida Bar by way of a federal lawsuit .
In its ruling , the Court pointed out that Thompson had been warned that he would face sanction if he continued his inappropriate filings , but that despite this , " Thompson has submitted over fifty filings directly with this Court , all of which have either been forwarded to the referee , dismissed , or denied .
Additionally , Thompson 's most recent filings are repetitive , frivolous , and , like his earlier ones , insulting to the Court . "
The ruling went on to describe one of his most recent filings in which Thompson " pasted images depicting swastikas , kangaroos in court , a reproduced dollar bill , cartoon squirrels , Paul Simon , Paul Newman , Ray Charles , a handprint with the world " SLAP ! " written under it , Bar Governor Benedict P. Kuehne , a baby , Ed Bradley , Jack Nicholson , Justice Clarence Thomas , Julius Caesar , monkeys , and a house of cards . "
Noting Thompson 's ongoing " ignorance as to the rules of procedure , forum selection , and timing , " the Court wrote , " In sanctioning Thompson , we are requiring him to retain qualified counsel so that his arguments might be properly presented through the appropriate procedures in the appropriate forum .
We do not limit such counsel 's ability to challenge the referee 's findings and recommendations on review .
What we cannot tolerate , however , is Thompson 's continued inability to maintain a minimum standard of decorum and respect for the judicial system to which all litigants , and especially attorneys , must adhere . "
In an emailed response , referred to the Court 's order as both " good news " and " idiotic . "

ONE OF ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S most enduring bits of cinematic comedy is the auction scene in the espionage thriller North by Northwest .
Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill , a businessman who has been mistaken for a CIA agent by the ruthless Phillip Vandamm .
At a critical juncture , Thornhill is cornered by his enemies inside a Chicago auction house , and the only way he can escape is by drawing attention to himself .
When the bidding on an antique reaches $ 2,250 , Thornhill yells out , “ Fifteen hundred ! ”
When the auctioneer gently chides him , he loudly changes his bid : “ Twelve hundred ! ”
When the bidding on a Louis XIV chaise longue reaches $ 1,200 , Thornhill blurts outs , “ Thirteen dollars ! ”
The genteel crowd is outraged , but Thornhill gets precisely what he wants : the auctioneer summons the police , who “ escort ” him past Vandamm ’s henchmen to safety .
Clever thinking and good comedy .
It is funny for a lot of reasons , and one is that Thornhill violates every psychological “ rule ” for how we negotiate price and value with one another .
So much of life involves “ auctions , ” whether it is buying a used car or making health care choices or even choosing a mate .
But , unlike Roger Thornhill , most of us are motivated by the desire for a fair deal , and we employ some sophisticated cognitive tools to weigh offers , fashion responses , and so forth — all the to - and - fro in getting to an agreement .
But how does life ’s dickering play out in the brain ?
And is it a trustworthy tool for getting what we want ?
Psychologists have been studying cognitive bartering for some time , and several basics are well established .
For example , an opening “ bid ” of any sort is usually perceived as a mental anchor , a starting point for the psychological jockeying to follow .
If we perceive an opening bid as fundamentally inaccurate or unfair , we reject it by countering with something in another ballpark altogether .
But what about less dramatic counter offers ?
What makes us settle on a response ?
University of Florida marketing professors Chris Janiszewski and Dan
Uy suspected that something fundamental might be going on , that some characteristic of the opening bid itself might influence the way the brain thinks about value and shapes bidding behavior .
In particular , they wanted to see if the degree of precision of the opening bid might be important to how the brain acts at an auction .
Or , to put it in more familiar terms :
Are we really fooled when storekeepers price something at $ 19.95 instead of a round 20 bucks ?
Janiszewski and Uy ran a series of tests to explore this idea .
The experiments used hypothetical scenarios , in which participants were required to make a variety of “ educated guesses . ”
For example , they had subjects think about a scenario in which they were buying a high - definition plasma TV and asked them to guesstimate the wholesale cost .
The participants were told the retail price , plus the fact that the retailer had a reputation for pricing TVs competitively .
There were three scenarios involving different retail prices : one group of buyers was given a price of $ 5,000 , another was given a price of $ 4,988 , and the third was told $ 5,012 .
When all the buyers were asked to estimate the wholesale price , those with the $ 5,000 price tag in their head guessed much lower than those contemplating the more precise retail prices .
That is , they moved farther away from the mental anchor .
What is more , those who started with the round number as their mental anchor were much more likely to guess a wholesale price that was also in round numbers .
The scientists ran this experiment again and again with different scenarios and always got the same result .
Why would this happen ?
As Janiszewski and Uy explain in the February issue of Psychological Science , people appear to create mental measuring sticks that run in increments away from any opening bid , and the size of the increments depends on the opening bid .
That is , if we see a $ 20 toaster , we might wonder whether it is worth $ 19 or $ 18 or $ 21 ; we are thinking in round numbers .
But if the starting point is $ 19.95 , the mental measuring stick would look different .
We might still think it is wrongly priced , but in our minds we are thinking about nickels and dimes instead of dollars , so a fair comeback might be $ 19.75 or $ 19.50 .
The psychologists decided to check these lab findings in the real world .
They looked at five years of real estate sales in Alachua County , Florida , comparing list prices and actual sale prices of homes .
They found that sellers who listed their homes more precisely — say $ 494,500 as opposed to $ 500,000 — consistently got closer to their asking price .
Put another way , buyers were less likely to negotiate the price down as far when they encountered a precise asking price .
Furthermore , houses listed in round numbers lost more value if they sat on the market for a couple of months .
So , bottom line : one way to deal with a buyer ’s market may be to pick an exact list price to begin with .
This is n’t all about money , however .
Medical information , Janiszewski and Uy note , can also be offered in either precise or general terms : a physician might say that your chance of responding to a medication is “ good ” or that your chance of responding is 80 percent .
The percentage is more precise , but many studies have shown that patients prefer vague generalities like “ good , ” so doctors tend to use them .
But remember that life is an auction .
In his mind , the patient is dickering with the doctor , so why not negotiate “ good ” up to “ excellent ” ?
When treatment choices are on the line , the auction house can indeed be a perilous place .
We all know that even the greatest of actors with have a bad day at the office once in a while .
They ’re great … but even the best has a bad performance or two on their resume , that if you saw it , and ONLY it , you might be fooled into thinking that person could n’t act or should at least sign up for some Takelessons acting classes .
Well … sadly , the opposite of that is true as well .
There are actors out there who just can’t carry a film to save their lives , and yet they fluked into have ONE good day at the office that tricked you into thinking they were good actors , and thus got about 10 more movies lined up … which did n’t work out .
So I now present to you , 9 actors who ca n’t act , but tricked us into thinking they could with one good outing .
1 ) Hayden Christensen ( Life as a House )
At the 2002 Golden Globe awards Hayden Christensen got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Life as a House .
A very special movie with apparently some very special performances .
I thought Christensen was so good in it , that it became my fall back position for whenever over - zelous fanboys would harp about how Hayden could n’t act .
As a matter of fact , I ’ve spent a lot of time the last couple of years defending the “ talent ” of this good Canadian boy .
Sadly , after a long string of piss poor performances like in Awake , Jumper and Factory Girl …
I can no longer just write off his wooden performances in the new Star Wars movies to George Lucas just not knowing how to direct actors .
At some point you have to start looking at the actor themselves … and we ’ve reached that point with Christensen .
2) Heather Graham ( Boogie Nights )
Oh she was that sexy little girl on the roller skates … and Boogie Nights was awesome … so that means everyone in it was awesome too right ?
That ’s a mistake a lot of people make .
Just because a movie was good , they believe that everyone who was in it was good too .
That just simply was n’t the case with Heather Graham in Boogie Nights .
What you saw is what you got with her… and she spent the last several years pretty much proving that she does n’t have anything else left to show us .
She just ca n’t act , it ’s that simple .
Go watch Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged me , or perhaps anything else she ’s appeared in since .
3 ) Chris O’Donnell ( Scent of a Woman )
Damn this guy was the Hollywood golden boy for a while .
Scent of a Woman comes out where he gets to act opposite Al Pacino , he does a great job doing more than just holding his own while on the screen with a legend … and suddenly everybody wanted him .
Great .
One problem … it appears that instead of holding his own , Pacino was carrying this guy , because as we started to see in just about everything he appeared in afterwards … this guy ca n’t carry groceries .
Batman ???
Are you kidding me ?
The Bachelor ???
Vertical Limit ???
These movies did n’t just suck … he sucked in them .
Some people may argue that he ’s found his groove on TV .
Personally I have n’t been impressed with his TV work either .
He almost pulled something off with Circle of Friends , but that was more Mini Driver than him .
Yeah , Scent of a Women almost had us fooled , but Chris O’Donnell is Hollywood ’s golden boy no more .
4 ) Amanda Peet ( The Whole 9 Yards )
There are n’t enough digits in modern mathematics to calculate how often I fantasized about licking chocolate off this woman after seeing her in The Whole Nine Yards .
She was my movie day dream girl for a couple of years and as a matter of fact I still think she ’s one of the 3 most beautiful women in Hollywood .
She was sexy , funny and apparently talented .
She was a big reason why I loved that movie so much .
I ’ll still zone out once in a while imagining her and I running on some beach … but I digress .
Sadly , after The Whole Nine Yards she got several opportunities that she just could n’t capitalize on .
Saving Silverman , Changing Lanes ( which was a GREAT movie , but she just stood out for all the wrong reasons ) , The Whole 10 Yards , A Lot Like Love , yadda yadda yadda .
That magic she had in 9 Yards seemed to disappear .
I hope it comes back some day , that it was n’t just an illusion .
Sadly , the proof suggests the illusion theory .
5 ) Kate Hudson ( Almost Famous )
Kate Hudson looked like her career was being shot out of a canon after Almost Almost Famous .
She was poised for huge success .
Bread from fame , a sexy look , and seemingly could really act .
Yup … she was going to be the next “ IT ” girl .
I ’ll even give her that she was n’t bad in the solid Rom - Com “ How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days ” .
But that special something that everyone thought she had was n’t there .
Nor would it ever rear its head again as we ’ve been subjected to her horrible performances in movies like Four Feathers , Raising Helen , The Skeleton Key , You Me and Dupree and most recently Fools Gold .
Yes Kate , you did a great job fooling us into thinking you could really act in that one movie … but the jig is up and we ’re on to you now !
Maybe you should hook up with Owen Wilson again .
That ’ll create some headlines .
6 ) Jon Heder ( Napoleon Dynamite )
Napoleon Dynamite was one of those pop cultural phenomenon ’s that spread like wildfire through nothing but word of mouth primarily , and at the heart of it was the performance given by star Jon Heder .
A total unknown who was suddenly being quoted by everyone on every campus in America , and whose image was adorned on every 5th t- shirt you saw on the street .
This guy was going to be the next big thing in comedy !
Oh wait … no he ’s not .
Turns out Heder was a one trick pony who ca n’t live nearly up to the hype created by his early ( and fluke like ) success .
Usually the exact same guy , Heder has tried and failed in projects like The Benchwarmers , School for Scoundrels , Blades of Glory and Mama ’s Boy .
Hear that bell Heder ?
It ’s the alarm clock … your 15 minutes are up .
Please move along .
7 ) Mira Sorvino ( Mighty Aphrodite )
To be fair , I suppose it ’s hard to go anywhere but down after winning a frigging Academy Award !
Man Sorvino was good in Mighty Aphrodite .
I mean REALLY good .
So what happened to that girl , and when was she replaced by the look - a- like who ended up appearing in movies like Mimic , Romy and Michele ’s High School Reunion and a few other totally forgettable roles ?
I mean really … someone this seemingly talented , beautiful and from a good bloodline steeped in Hollywood with an Oscar on her shelf should at the very least be a legit A - Lister right ?
Nope .
Today you ’ll be hard pressed to find her on the direct to DVD shelves or guest appearing on House MD .
A potentially fantastic career flushed away because it was a torch just too big for her to handle .
Shame .
8 ) Ed Furlong ( American History X )
No one gave much notice to Edward Furlong in Terminator 2 because he was just “ that kid ” in the movie .
He neither brought anything to the film nor did he distract from it .
He was just sort of there doing his thing which is fine .
But in American History X it looked like he was showing us flashes of brilliance .
Perhaps a prodigy was emerging before our eyes ?
Oh no… those are just sun spots , cause it ai n’t Furlong .
There are a lot of stories that run around this town about the whys and hows of Furlong apparent fall from Hollywood grace , but really the bottom line it he just does n’t have the chops to be a movie star .
Some people try to champion a couple of his smaller projects ( like The Crow flick he did ) , but I just do n’t see it … apparently no one else does either .
9 ) Orlando Bloom ( Lord of the Rings )
Orlando Bloom was the face that made all the little girls scream with delight in the Lord of the Rings films .
Women went bloody NUTS for Legolas .
As a matter of fact , my friend Mylana watched Two Towers with me in the theaters … and at the scene where Legolas grabs the horse that Gimli is on and swings himself onto it ’s back while the horse was in full stride ( you know the scene ) made her turn to me and basically proclaim that the first man she saw ( present company excluded ) after the movie was going to get raped .
Yes , Orlando made the juices flow .
But more than that , he played the role well .
Surely this skinny hunk was going to have a great career !
Nope .
Everything Orlando Bloom has been in since dreadfully shows his lack of ability time and time again .
It does n’t matter if it ’s in the Pirates films , Kingdom of Heaven , Elizabethtown or Troy .
Each time given a great opportunity … and each time fell flat on his face .
Too bad .
So there you have it folks .
I ’m sure there are some on this list that you agree with , and some you ’ll vehemently disagree with … but that ’s the beauty of the subjectivity of the art .
The question I have for you is ….
Who else would you put on this list , and what was the one movie that made you think they could be a great actor ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration can proceed with a plan to open the U.S. border to long haul Mexican trucks as early as next week after an appeals court rejected a bid by labor , consumer and environmental interests to block the initiative .

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco late on Friday denied an emergency petition sought by the Teamsters union , the Sierra Club and consumer group Public Citizen to halt the start of a one - year pilot program that was approved by Congress after years of legal and political wrangling .
The Transportation Department welcomed the decision and said in a statement that allowing more direct shipments from Mexico will benefit U.S. consumers .
The 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement approved broader access for ground shipments from both countries but the Clinton administration never complied with the trucking provision .
A special tribunal ordered the Bush administration to do so in 2001 .
“ This is the wrong decision for working men and women , ” Jim Hoffa , president of the Teamsters , said in a statement after the court ruling .
“ We believe this program clearly breaks the law . ”
The Teamsters represents truckers that would be affected by the change .
The emergency stay was sought on grounds the administration ’s pilot program had not satisfied the U.S. Congress ’ requirements on safety and other issues .
But the appeals court ruled otherwise .
SAFETY ASPECTS
The administration plans to start the program on September 6 .
Transportation Department officials hope to receive final clearance early next week from the department ’s inspector general ’s office , which is reviewing its safety aspects , and finalize details with Mexican authorities .
The Mexican government must grant reciprocal access to U.S. trucks under NAFTA .
That provision is not expected to be a problem , regulators said .
Mexican trucks operating in the United States have for years been restricted to U.S. points near certain large border crossings where their goods are transferred to trucks owned by U.S. firms .
Under the pilot program , Mexican long haul trucking companies that have met safety , licensing , and other U.S. requirements will be allowed to operate their rigs throughout the country .
Proponents say this will reduce costs and speed up shipments .
Trucking regulators said in a court filing the goal is to gradually accommodate 100 Mexican trucking companies by the end of the pilot program , or roughly 540 large trucks .
But opponents said those figures do not reflect the number of companies that could seek access to U.S. roads if the pilot is successful , which they said raises safety concerns .
“ This ( pilot ) program is basically a show trial .
They have n’t provided notice up front about who will participate .
You just do n’t know what the program will look like , ” said Bonnie Robin - Vergeer , attorney for Public Citizen .
Public Citizen and the Teamsters still plan to proceed with a lawsuit they filed in federal court , challenging the Mexican truck program on broader grounds .
That case will not likely be decided until next year .
Trucks from Canada have no operating restrictions in the United States .
Even when hope does n’t reside within me — those days happen , too — I know that it is safely in the hands of fellow Black adventurers to hold until I am ready to reclaim my share of it .
Despite his loss in Pennsylvania and other campaign bumps , Barack Obama is heavily favored to win what will be the final and decisive contest for the Democratic presidential nomination -- the " invisible primary " for the convention votes of party leaders .
The reasons say a lot about these superdelegates ' calculations for the November elections -- the presidential one , or their own .

Folks , it 's Super Tuesday and Californians are going to the polls , along with 22 other states .
But if you 're a registered independents in California , take note :
Your vote might not be counted if you do n't fill out one single bubble .
SJ Mercury News :
In addition to vote - tallying issues , some concerns had arisen about the voting process .
Voter - outreach groups criticized the ballot in Los Angeles County , saying it could disenfranchise independent voters .
The Democratic and American Independent party ballots given to independent voters who request them include an extra bubble specifying that the ballot is for that party 's primary .
The bubble appears before the list of presidential candidates .
If voters fail to mark that spot , the county 's scanning machines will not read the selection for president .
Lawyers for the Los Angeles - based Courage Campaign said that violates California election law .
The group sent a letter to Los Angeles County officials threatening legal action if the issue is n't addressed before Tuesday 's election .
" We did talk to the county , and they admit it's a problem , " Courage Campaign chairman Rick Jacobs said .
" They just do n't seem to know what to do about it . "
Other groups , including the California League of Women Voters , said they had fielded numerous calls from independent voters asking how they could get a party ballot .
" These voters are getting ballots that are blank , because they 're not in a party , and it did not seem clear to most of the decline - to - state voters that they could request a party ballot , " said spokeswoman Elizabeth Leslie .
Independents account for nearly 20 percent of California 's registered voters .
The GOP does not allow them to vote in the Republican primary , but Democrats and some other parties do .
The lede , from the AP report on Rudy ’s prostate claims :
No one argues that Rudy Giuliani was diagnosed with prostate cancer , underwent treatment and survived .
Yet there is a dispute about the statistics he quotes about his chances of survival .
If you go on to read the whole article , you sort of learn that there ’s no dispute at all — he ’s simply wrong , and refuses to admit it .
But how many readers will get it ?
The FBI has at least one private contracting agency being given special powers - including right - to - kill - and preparing big businesses for the possibility of martial law .
This business owner says he attended a small InfraGard meeting where agents of the FBI and Homeland Security discussed in astonishing detail what InfraGard members may be called upon to do .
“ The meeting started off innocuously enough , with the speakers talking about corporate espionage , ” he says .
“ From there , it just progressed .
All of a sudden we were knee deep in what was expected of us when martial law is declared .
We were expected to share all our resources , but in return we ’d be given specific benefits . ”
These included , he says , the ability to travel in restricted areas and to get people out .
But that ’s not all .
“ Then they said when — not if — martial law is declared , it was our responsibility to protect our portion of the infrastructure , and if we had to use deadly force to protect it , we could n’t be prosecuted , ” he says .

Presidential candidates Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas held this debate on April 16 , 1858 at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
MODERATORS :
CHARLIE GIBSON , ABC NEWS
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS , ABC NEWS
LINCOLN : Thank you very much , Charlie and George , and thanks to all in the audience and who are out there .
I appear before you today for the purpose of discussing the leading political topics which now agitate the public mind .
We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object , and confident promise , of putting an end to slavery agitation .
Under the operation of that policy , that agitation has not only not ceased , but has constantly augmented .
STEPHANOPOULOS : I ’m sorry to interrupt , but do you think Mr. Douglas loves America as much you do ?
LINCOLN : Sure I do .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But who loves America more ?
LINCOLN : I ’d prefer to get on with my opening statement George .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
If your love for America were eight apples , how many apples would Senator Douglas ’s love be ?
LINCOLN : Eight .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Proceed .
LINCOLN : In my opinion , slavery will not cease , until a crisis shall have been reached and passed .
" A house divided against itself cannot stand . "
I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Excuse me , did an Elijah H. Johnson attend your church ?
LINCOLN : When I was a boy in Illinois forty years ago , yes .
I think he was a deacon .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Are you aware that he regularly called Kentucky “ a land of swine and whores ” ?
LINCOLN : Sounds right -- his ex-wife was from Kentucky .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Why did you remain in the church after hearing those statements ?
LINCOLN : I was eight .
DOUGLAS : This is an important question George -- it 's an issue that certainly will be raised in the fall .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Do you denounce him ?
LINCOLN : I ’d like to get back to the divided house if I may .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Do you denounce and reject him ?
LINCOLN : If it will make you shut up , yes , I denounce and reject him .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Do you denounce and reject him with sugar on top ?
LINCOLN : Yes .
STEPHANOPOULOS : No takesies - backsies ?
LINCOLN : Yes .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Whoa , so you would consider a takesie - backsie ?
LINCOLN : That ’s not what I meant …
DOUGLAS : When I was 11 , my grandpappy and I chopped wood and shot bears .
LINCOLN : Ahem , I do not expect the Union to be dissolved -- I do not expect the house to fall -- but I do expect slavery will cease to be divided .
It will become all one thing , or all the other ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Do you love America this much ( extending fingers ) , this much ( extending hands slightly ) , or thiiiiiis much ( extending hands broadly ) ?
LINCOLN : I think we covered this …
GIBSON : If I may interrupt …
LINCOLN : Please .
GIBSON : I noticed , Mr. Lincoln , that your American flag pin was upside down …
LINCOLN : Yes , the wind caught it .
Now , as I was saying ...
GIBSON : We get questions about this all the time over at Powerline and on Hannity ’s talk show .
Mr. Douglas has said this is a major vulnerability for you in the fall .
So I ’ll ask again – do you love America ?
LINCOLN : ( scowling with a forced smile ) .
Yes .
GIBSON : If your love for America were ice cream , what flavor would it be ?
LINCOLN : ( pausing with disgust and turning back to camera )
Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it ; or its advocates will push it forward , till it shall become alike lawful in all the States , old as well as new -- North as well as South .
DOUGLAS : He did n’t answer the question Charlie .
This fall , that question is going to be on the minds of the American public .
I ’ve proudly stated that my love for America is Very Berry Strawberry .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me ask it another way .
If Elijah Johnson were chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream , would you eat it ?
Or would you decline to eat it ?
DOUGLAS : Personally , as for me , I would decline to eat it .
LINCOLN ( shaking his head ) :
Let any one who doubts , carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination -- piece of machinery , so to speak -- compounded of the Nebraska doctrine , and the Dred Scott decision .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
We ’ll get to Dred Scott in the second hour , time willing , but I want to get back to the ice cream question .
And that 's what we 'll do , after the break .
( CNN ) -- Actor Wesley Snipes was found guilty Friday on three misdemeanor charges of failing to file tax returns -- but jurors cleared him of more serious felony charges of tax fraud and conspiracy .
Snipes could have faced up to five years in prison on both the conspiracy and fraud charges .
He was found guilty of only half -- three out of six -- of the failure to file charges .
He faces a maximum one - year sentence on each but can be expected to be sentenced to less .
" Our position has been all along that Mr. Snipes committed no fraud , " said Robert Bernhoft , Snipes ' attorney , after the verdict was read Friday afternoon .
" He had no bad intent , and that 's what the jury accepted . "
Snipes , dressed in a black suit , smiled and thanked well - wishers outside the courthouse -- walking with his hands held in a prayer position .
He did not make a statement or take questions from the media .
Watch the media crush after the verdict »
Almost immediately , agents of the Internal Revenue Service made it clear that they still intend to pursue taxes Snipes owes on roughly $ 38 million in income .
" Ultimately , if he really wants to take this all the way , he can go to tax court , " said Victor Lessoff , a special agent with the IRS .
" But we will pursue , civilly , the taxes .
That 's very important to us . "
Bernhoft suggested Snipes will try to take care of the payments .
" Mr. Snipes has always been committed to doing the right thing and after this trial is over , he 'll make whatever amends are required , " he said .

Indictment ( U.S. v. Snipes ) WESH : Attorney : Snipes will make amends
Snipes , who starred in such movies as " New Jack City , " " White Men Can't Jump " and the " Blade " series of action films , had pleaded not guilty to charges that he failed to pay his federal income taxes from 1999 through 2004 .
In October 2006 , Justice Department and IRS officials issued an arrest warrant for Snipes that charged him with conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and presenting a fraudulent claim for payment to the IRS .
Snipes was charged in Florida because he lived in Windermere in Orange County , Florida , during the years covered by the indictment .
Two other men -- Eddie Ray Kahn and Douglas Rosile -- were charged along with Snipes .
Kahn was described in the indictment as the founder of what he billed as a Christian group but allegedly was a " for - profit commercial enterprise that promoted and sold fraudulent tax schemes that interfered with the administration of the internal revenue laws of the United States . "
Rosile is described as a former certified public accountant who continued to do accounting work after his license had expired .
According to the indictment , the men claim the IRS is entitled only to income derived from foreign - based activities .
Kahn and Rosile were found guilty on fraud and conspiracy charges .
Lessoff , of the IRS , said Kahn 's group is believed to have as many as 4,000 members .
" This was a very high - profile case with us and we 're satisfied with the result because it clearly shows you cannot get away with not paying taxes , " Lessoff said .
" If you are part of this organization , if you 're one of them , you need to get in touch with us and make right with us . "

Snipes will be sentenced at a later date .

All About Wesley Snipes • Internal Revenue Service
On June 22 , 2007 , Defense Secretary Robert Gates acknowledged that the Pentagon 's network had been successfully attacked the previous Wednesday , and that this attack was responsible for a disruption in email service to some 1,500 Pentagon employees .
At the time , Gates downplayed the attack , saying that it affected only the OSD's ( Office of the Secretary of Defense ) non-classified e-mail service and that there was " no anticipated adverse impact on ongoing operations . "
It seems that the adverse impact of the June attack may have been much greater than Gates ' early guidance implied .
According to a top DoD technology official quoted at GovernmentExecutive.com , the thieves behind that attack seized an " amazing amount " of data .
New details on the attack itself have become available in the months since it occurred .
According to Dennis Clem , CIO of the Pentagon and the OSD , the intrusion was first detected during an IT restructuring that was underway at the time .
By the time it was detected , malicious code had been in the system for at least two months , and was propagating via a known Windows exploit .
The bug spread itself by e-mailing malicious payloads from one system on the network to another .
The messages themselves were spoofed and appeared to be legitimate missives from other employees .
Once the recipient opened an infected e-mail , the worm sent that person 's password and other login credentials back to home base .
The government is n't saying what , exactly , got stolen .
There 's no evidence to contradict Secretary Gates ' claim that the classified e-mail system remained unaffected , but data that Clem describes as " sensitive " was accessed and encrypted before being transmitted to the hackers ' location .
As for where that location might be , unconfirmed reports point towards China 's People 's Liberation Army .
China , of course , has vehemently denied any knowledge or responsibility .
The Pentagon has stepped up its network protection since the intrusion , and added additional protection in the form of smart cards and digital signatures .
Such security measures are the ultimate example of closing the barn door after the horse is gone , but should at least make further intrusions more difficult .

Obama - Clinton debate : A whiff of McCarthyism as media pushes Democratic campaign to the right
By Bill Van Auken
18 April 2008
The debate aired Wednesday night by ABC television from Philadelphia was the 21st such contest held since the beginning of the Democratic primary campaign and , without a doubt , the most reactionary and contemptible .
After two brief opening statements followed by a commercial break and a stale repetition of the attempt to get Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to declare that each would accept the other as a running mate , the moderators — ABC ’s Charlie Gibson and George Stephanopoulos — settled into what can only be described as a right - wing inquisition .
While the term “ McCarthyite ” has no doubt been overused as a political adjective over the years , there was a good deal in the moderators ’ questions — demanding affirmations of patriotism and implying guilt by association — that recalled the anti-communist witchhunts of more than half a century ago .
Inevitably , the questioning began with a rehashing of Obama ’s “ bitter ” statement .
The remark , made privately to a group of well - heeled contributors in San Francisco , was used to describe the political alienation of Pennsylvanians from small towns who have seen industries shut down , their jobs destroyed and successive administrations —
Democratic and Republican alike — do nothing about it .
In response , he said , they “ cling to guns or religion . ”
The statement has become the focus of a firestorm of right - wing attack from both the Republican Party and the Clinton campaign over the past week .
Sounding like a prosecutor , Gibson demanded of Obama , “ Do you understand that some people in this state find that patronizing and think that you said actually what you meant ? ”
There is no indication from opinion polls that Obama has been wounded politically by the remark .
With the Pennsylvania primary less than a week away , some polls show Hillary Clinton ’s lead narrowing , if not evaporating altogether .
Nonetheless , Obama expressed the demanded contrition , saying he could “ see how people were offended . ”
He went on , however to reiterate that “ people feel like Washington ’s not listening to them , ” and that “ wedge issues ” are “ exploited ” to divert public attention from more fundamental questions facing society .
This was followed by the umpteenth round of extended questioning on statements made by the Reverend Jeremiah Wright from the pulpit of Obama ’s church in Chicago .
“ If you knew he got rough in sermons , why did it take you more than a year to publicly disassociate yourself from his remarks ? ” Gibson demanded .
After Obama disassociated himself , yet again , from Wright ’s remarks , Hillary Clinton was invited to weigh in on the subject .
She used the opportunity to declare that what Wright “ said and when he said it , and for whatever reason he might have said these things ” was an issue that “ deserves further exploration . ”
She then dragged in Louis Farrakhan and a statement in the church ’s bulletin — reprinted from the Los Angeles Times — by a leader of the Palestinian movement Hamas — something that has been promoted heavily on the Internet by right - wing Republican and Zionist groups .
Not stopping there , Stephanopoulos — whose past employment as the communications director in the Clinton White House would seem to raise serious conflict of interest questions — was given the floor .
He shamelessly pressed Obama with , “ Do you think Reverend Wright loves America as much as you do ? ”
Clinton was then handed a softball question about her false claims that she had come under sniper fire in Bosnia during a visit there as first lady in 1996 .
Stephanopoulos directed the follow - up not to Clinton , but rather to Obama , in the form of a charge that his campaign had sent out a daily “ cascade of e-mails ” questioning Clinton ’s credibility .
Obama responded by observing that both candidates inevitably made misstatements and suggesting that it is “ important to make sure that we do n’t get so obsessed with gaffes that we lose sight of the fact that this is a defining moment in our history . ”
He pointed to an economy “ teetering not just on the edge of recession but potentially worse , ” US involvement in “ two wars ” and “ greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s ” as more fitting topics for debate .
The ABC moderators , however , were having none of it .
Instead , they aired a video clip from a Pennsylvania woman asking why Obama did n’t wear a flag lapel pin .
Gibson sought to defend the relevance of this line of inquiry — dredged up from a non-news item dating from a year and a half ago — by declaring , “ As you may know , it is all over the Internet . ”
No doubt it is , featured on the same right - wing web sites that refer to the Illinois senator as “ Barack Hussein Obama ” and suggest that he is a closet Muslim .
Obama replied obediently that he “ revered the flag , ” while noting that this was the “ kind of manufactured issue that our politics has become obsessed with . ”
Without skipping a beat , Stephanopoulos pressed on with what he termed “ the general theme of patriotism in your relationships . ”
He questioned Obama about William Ayers , a former member of the Weather Underground , a radical protest group implicated in bombings during the Vietnam War .
Ayers , now a professor of education at the University of Illinois in Chicago and a neighbor of Obama , had hosted a meeting for him when he was running for state senator in 1995 .
This question had been directly fed to Stephanopoulos by the right - wing Fox News commentator Sean Hannity , when he appeared on Hannity ’s radio show Tuesday .
Hannity said Obama should be “ asked about his association with Bill Ayers , the unrepentant terrorist from the Weather Underground , ” and demanded of Stephanopoulos , “ Is that a question you might ask ? ”
The ABC moderator replied , “ Well , I ’m taking notes right now . ”
Visibly exasperated , Obama responded by pointing out he had no close relationship with Ayers .
He protested against the implication that “ me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when I was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values , ” adding that it “ does n’t make much sense , George . ”
Clinton again was invited to pile on , adding the tidbit that Obama and Ayers had served on the same board of a local Chicago social welfare foundation , and stressing that “ deeply hurtful ” comments by Ayers were published “ on 9/11 ” defending Weather Underground bombings .
The article in question , which was printed by the New York Times in its arts section — coincidentally on September 11 , 2001 — was based on an interview given well before the 9/11 attacks on a memoir that Ayers had written of his 1960s protest days .
Instead of exposing this line of accusation as the McCarthyite smear that it was , Obama responded by pointing to President Bill Clinton ’s decision to commute the prison sentences of two other former members of the Weather Underground , calling it “ a slightly more significant act ” than his own .
This questioning of Obama ’s “ patriotism ” occupied the entire first half of the debate .
What followed was a fairly perfunctory review of political positions held by the two candidates on the Iraq war , Iran , taxation , gun control and affirmative action .
On Iraq , both candidates repeated their vows to withdraw “ combat troops ” from Iraq after taking office .
Left unstated — and certainly unexplored by the ABC moderators — was the position of both campaigns that US military forces would be left behind in the occupied country for the purposes of “ counter - terrorism ” operations , training Iraqi forces and protecting US interests .
Both pitched their opposition to the elevated US troop presence in Iraq from the standpoint that forces were needed for military operations elsewhere , including in Afghanistan .
On Iran , Clinton made the most noteworthy statement of the evening , vowing that an Iranian attack on Israel “ would incur massive retaliation from the United States . ”
She went further , declaring that Washington should “ do the same with other countries in the region ” and “ create an umbrella of deterrence that goes much further than just Israel . ”
The implication was the founding of a NATO - like mutual defense pact between the US and various repressive and semi-feudal Arab regimes aimed at preparing a war against Iran .
Again , the moderators showed no interest in questioning such an unprecedented military commitment and escalation in the region .
The most extended questioning was on taxes , with Gibson heatedly grilling both candidates about the possibility that they would raises capital gains taxes or taxes on those earning more than $ 250,000 a year , something that he seemed to take quite personally .
So one - sided and inquisitorial was the questioning that it provoked significant criticism of ABC from commentators in the major media .
Washington
Post television critic Tom Shales condemned Gibson and Stephanopolous for “ shoddy , despicable performances , ” in which they “ dwelled entirely on specious and gossipy trivia that already has been hashed and rehashed . ”
Will Bunch of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote an open letter to the ABC pair , declaring , “ you disgraced my profession of journalism , and , by association , me and a lot of hard - working colleagues who do still try to ferret out the truth , rather than worry about who can give us the best deal on our capital gains taxes . ”
He added , “ asking Obama whether he thought Rev. Wright ‘ loved America ’ and then suggesting that Obama himself is somehow a hater of the American flag , or worse , were flat - out repulsive . ”
Greg Mitchell , editor of the trade magazine Editor & Publisher , posted a blog on the liberal Huffington Post web site which noted , “ Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the health care and mortgage crises , the overall state of the economy and dozens of other pressing issues had to wait ...
Yet neither candidate had the courage to ask the moderators to turn to those far more important issues .
Talking heads on other networks followed up by not pressing that point either .
The crowd booed Gibson near the end .
Why did n’t every other responsible journalist on TV ? ”
The popular reaction to the ABC debate was one of generalized outrage and disgust .
This was reflected on the reader comment section linked to the network ’s online article on the event , which had received nearly 17,000 responses by late Thursday .
The words “ travesty , ” “ shameful ” and “ disgusting ” were among the most recurrent in these reactions .
“ ABC should be ashamed .
George should be ashamed .
Charlie should be ashamed .
This is n’t a debate .
This is a hit job , ” wrote one viewer .
Another commented : “ The cost of oil is at an all - time high and the value of our currency is at an all - time low .
We are fighting two wars and the subprime mortgage crisis is having a debilitating effect on the middle class .
We have record numbers of Americans without access to affordable health care and our Social Security system is barely solvent .
And Gibson and Stephanopoulos — two despicable clowns posing as thoughtful journalists — focus on lapel pins , the Weather Underground , Jeremiah Wright , a misstatement about sniper fire in Bosnia and whether one candidate likes and respects the other candidate .
This ‘ debate ’ was an affront to all middle class American families who have no alternative but to rely on circus clowns to pose questions to the ruling class . ”
A third wrote : “ It is so hard to try and identify the absolutely WORST question .
Was it , ‘ Does Rev Wright love America ? ’
Was it , ‘ Do you love the flag ? ’
This travesty of a debate was an insult to the intelligence of the American people .
It was a reflection of the degradation of the state of the press .
The issues that face this country are immeasurable and you trivialized the problems that we face . ”
There is every reason to believe that the revulsion expressed in these comments is shared by broad sections of the American people , including those who will vote in Pennsylvania .
The motivation behind what can only be described as a crudely biased intervention by ABC in the presidential campaign is not so much a desire to shift the opinion of the public as to intimidate Obama and drive the Democratic Party even further to the right .
Clinton proceeds with similar calculations , as her increasingly desperate campaign seeks to convince the so - called “ super delegates ” — the party and state officials who will cast the deciding votes at the Democratic convention in August — that Obama is unelectable , despite his winning the majority of the primaries .
For his part , Obama will inevitably shift further to the right to accommodate his critics within the Republican Party , the media and the Democratic leadership .
In the end , he represents the same fundamental class interests as they do , and therefore cannot have a program to address the real issues facing the American people .
While his candidacy , with its promise of “ change , ” has undoubtedly aroused a degree of popular support , it represents not an insurgency from below , but rather a bid by sections of the ruling elite itself to revive the credibility of US imperialism both at home and abroad , and effect changes in the tactics and tone of American foreign policy , in order to better pursue the same strategic goals .
Such a political project offers no real alternative to the broad layers of American working people seeking an end to war and the attacks on jobs , living standards and social conditions that are being driven by a historic crisis of the profit system .
GTK + has come a long way .
From its humble beginnings as “ The GIMP ToolKit ” , it is now used in a plethora of applications .
In fact , GTK + is very popular .
GNOME , one of the leading desktop environment on Unix systems , uses GTK + almost exclusively .
The Gimp is built upon GTK + , of course .
And there are many commercial software developers like Adobe , NVidia and VMware that decided to use it as a base for their products .
Still , there are several shortcomings with GTK +.
Development of the 2.x series started back in 2002 .
Since then , GTK + has ripened and aged .
It has aged well , but still : its age shows .
Throughout the 2.x cycle , several years now , the developers have kept GTK +
ABI compatible .
This keeps application developers depending on GTK + very happy : they can be sure that code linked to an older version of GTK + continues to work with newer releases .
Packages released back in 2002 will continue to work with new library releases .
That ’s great , because no third - party application developer likes to rebuild and repackage the whole product line , just because a new version of the underlying libraries got released and all the distribution start packaging that version .
It causes work and trouble .
And for commercial / proprietary developers that means costs .
The commitment not to break ABI made a lot of people very happy .
But it also put very tight constraints on the GTK + developers .
It ’s not that easy to add new features and remain ABI compatible .
Minor features , yes .
But as soon as you want to make radical improvements and need to change the exposed data structures , you run into serious trouble .
It just not possible beyond a certain point .
On the 2008 GTK +
Hackfest in Berlin , Imendio ’s GTK + hackers presented their vision [ 1 ] of GTK +’s future and the reasons why they think that GTK + has to make a step forward , embrace change and break ABI compatibility .
Other GTK + developers [ 2 ] have also voiced their opinions , listing parts of GTK + that need serious love , but state that they do n’t require breakage .
Whether or not these are the things that will mark the road to GTK +
3.0 , almost all of them need attention .
And give hints to the shape of things to come .
Theming :
Theming is one major aspect of GTK + that needs a serious overhaul .
Theming in GTK + sucks and blows big time .
The initial concept of how theming works in GTK + stems from the very first releases and never received serious love .
As a result it is very difficult to do fancy graphic things in GTK + or to make custom widgets that fit into the rest of the desktop .
The funny look of Evolution ’s tree headers in some themes is one symptom , but every developer with the need to write custom widgets is looking for a hard time .
There have been several suggestions on how to do that , some of them involving CSS - style theming [ 3 ] .
CSS would be nice , for sure .
But even the ability to paint one widget to mimick another would be a huge gain .
Application - specific theming and custom layouts ?
Delicious .
Animations :
Although it is possible to create animations in plain GTK + , it ’s not very easy to do .
Out of the desire to create fancy interfaces in the image of the iPhone interface arose several GLib / GTK + inspired libraries ; Clutter , Pigment and Moonlight .
All of those have drawbacks , however : Clutter does n’t use the GLib event system , Moonlight is written in C++ ( a no - go for a GTK + library ) and Pigment is in a very rough state .
Still , there are very solid plans to what extent a scene - graph library might interact with GTK + and what requirements such a library has to fulfill [ 4 ] .
Canvas :
GTK + has no standard Canvas .
There is a GnomeCanvas , but it ’s deprecated , not very popular and lacks some key features , like drawing GUI .
Many developers resort to plain Cairo when it comes to custom graphics , but Cairo is lacking a way to draw GUI elements also .
Nothing gained .
There are some possible candidates [ 5 ] for a possible GTKCanvas , but none of them seems to be the right candidate .
And then there is the question , if a specialised canvas is a good idea at all .
This problem might be solved with the emergence of the aforementioned scene - graph library ; instead of introducing a specialised library for custom paint operations , make that library the standard way .
OS integration :
GTK + is not limited to X11 systems anymore .
There are many GTK + applications that have been ported to Windows and enjoy a surprising popularity there ; Inkscape for example has a significant Windows user base .
And OS X gets more important with every passing month .
Some of these applications make extensive use of operating system features .
Up to now , GTK + featured only a limited set of functions to provide access to operating system functions , but the first solutions addressing this problem are starting to appear [ 6 ] .
Introspection :
One of the GTK + buzzwords of the last few month has been introspection .
Introspection allows to , well , inspect an object , its methods , public members and its inheritance .
This is not only very comfortable for debugging , it also allows for very easy bindings : automated bindings for your favourite programming language ?
Here it comes .
It might still be a while until all parts are in place , but already the results are amazing [ 7 ] .
It might still be a long time until GTK + 3.0 gets released .
And in any way ; GTK + 3.0 wo n’t be about adding new features .
There are still some mistakes of the past lumbering in GTK +.
Exposed private structues , public members that get manipulated directly : things like these have to be fixed before a GTK + 3.2 can start adding features [ 8 ] .
But with some of the features , especially a scene - graph , window - independent widget placing and over - rideable paint methods for GTK + widgets , GTK + is starting to look very interesting again .

CHAMPAGNE is a drink that is generally quaffed when times are good .
And for nearly 40 years the world has apparently had much to celebrate : exports of French fizz soared to over 150 m bottles last year .
Nonetheless , the world 's thirst for champagne is particularly sensitive to economic turmoil .
As oil prices have peaked ( and the world economy has foundered ) exports of bubbly have dipped .
The oil shocks of the 1970s , economic downturn in the late 1980s and the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000 all took a toll .
Now record champagne exports and oil prices might suggest a period of “ decoupling ” .
However , the effects of the credit crunch may yet be felt in the vineyards of northern France .

For the past month I have been making the rounds on the interview circuit in anticipation of leaving my current job ( more on this later ) .
Last week I was relating the gritty details of each interview with a close friend and expressed my anxiety about receiving an offer from any one of the companies where I was interviewing .
My friend responded with these words of reassurance :
“ Do n’t worry .
You have what everyone is looking for in a co-worker : Looks and personality . ”
We both laughed at the time , but later I began to wonder if his words did n’t have at least some kernel of truth to them .
How great a role does appearance really play in career success ?
While physical appearance is not supposed to legally be a factor in whether or not to hire / promote a person , studies have shown that attractive people , on average , make more than their less attractive counterparts .
For example , a study highlighted in The Regional Economist reports that overweight or obese women are shown to earn significantly less than their thinner peers :
“ Economists Susan Averett and Sanders Korenman studied the effects of obesity on wages , using a sample consisting of individuals aged 16 - 24 in 1981 who were 23 - 31 in 1988 .
They showed that women who were obese according to their Body Mass Index ( BMI ) in both 1981 and 1988 earned 17 percent lower wages on average than women within their recommended BMI range . ”
Women are not the only ones to suffer discrimination based on appearance .
While obesity had a slightly negative effect on a man ’s earning power , height seems to play a much more significant role in determining a man ’s salary , with shorter men getting the “ short end of the stick . ”
The study revealed the following :
“ Economists Nicola Persico , Andrew Postlewaite and Dan Silverman tried to explain the origin of the “ height premium . ”
They focused on white men to avoid possible discrimination based on gender or race .
After controlling for a number of family characteristics that are generally correlated with both height and wages ( parents ’ education , parents ’ occupation and number of siblings ) , they found that for white men in the United States , a 1.8 - percent increase in wages accompanies every additional inch of height . ”
While nothing short of plastic surgery can make you taller ( or even thinner in some cases ) exuding a polished , professional appearance can do wonders in how co-workers treat and perceive you at work .
A recent column in Diversity Inc. does an excellent job of explaining the importance of following the corporate dress code :
“ Corporate culture will reflect what is necessary to do business with the widest range of people .
Since the United States has the largest gross domestic product ( GDP ) of any other single nation–almost four times as large as the next largest economy ( Japan ) – it is only natural that other nations adopted our dress code .
Further , psychological tests show that we are predisposed to trust people who look just like us .
That ’s one reason sycophantic behavior is often successful .
Most human beings really do n’t like change .
Having a dress code simplifies the number of variables we all have to deal with .
This creates a comfort level from which we can deal with what business is there to do :
Be profitable . ”
Some might argue that following a prescribed dress code , such as a suit and tie , is conformist , stifling , and reminiscent of a drone scurrying around a hive .
However , what a suit and tie says to co-workers , bosses and clients alike is “ Yes , I understand you –how you dress , how you think , what your needs are .
You can relate to me and I to you . ”
And in business , this could mean the difference between getting that corner office or making that big sale .

I recently came across a book review of Saints to Lean On and wanted to interview the author , Sister Janice McCrane .
Sister McGrane was diagnosed at age 25 with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , a form of arthritis which is painful and which also creates deformities in the joints .
She shares some of her wisdom below .
How to Cope with Pain : Can you tell us a little about yourself ?
Sister McGrane : I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at age 25 , and unfortunately it ’s severe .
I have so many joint replacements and fusions that my friends refer to me as the Bionic Nun .
I entered the Sisters of Saint Joseph in 1983 , and my primary ministry has been with disabled persons .
Presently I ’m chair of the board at Liberty Resources , the disability advocacy organization for Southeastern Pennsylvania .
And I ’ve just begun working on a sequel to Saints to Lean On , which is selling quite well .
HtCwP : Can you tell us a bit about your own experiences with pain ?
SM : Yes , I ’ve had times of significant pain , mainly because RA wears away the cartilage in joints , resulting in bone rubbing against bone .
Before I had the major joint replacements , I remember contemplating , Should I keep standing in pain , or sit down and have the pain of getting up again ?
A few months ago I fell , resulting in a severe hip contusion ( thankfully , not a break ) .
It was so painful I had to use a wheelchair for three weeks .
I ’m fortunate , however , that since the major joint replacements , pain does not rule my life .
HtCwP : Your first book is Saints to Lean On : Spiritual Companions for Illness and Disability .
Can you tell us what the book is about , and what your inspiration for writing it was ?
SM : From my own experience , and ministering with people with disabilities and illnesses of all kinds , I recognized a need for us ( actually , all people ) to turn to someone among the Communion of Saints who has experienced illness , disability , or pain .
I hope to encourage people to recognize that , along with their genuine holiness , saints also lived with physical and mental ills .
I attempted to invite people to turn to someone among the Saints to whom they feel drawn .
I relied on Sister Elizabeth Johnson ’s scholarship in Friends of God & Prophets , which reclaims the early church model of saints as companions , as well as intercessors and role models .
HtCwP : Can you give us an example of one of the saints whom you write about ?
SM : Probably the best example of someone with excruciating pain is Therese of Lisieux , the Little Flower .
She was in agony as her lungs deteriorated from tuberculosis .
In addition , her superior denied her any relief from morphine , deeming it not appropriate for a nun .
The treatments  were ineffective and awful , for example , puncturing her chest with burning needles .
Therese was honest about the fact that she was in great pain .
Her death is quite well documented .
HtCwP : Illness , pain , and other challenges can sometimes test our relationship with God .
Did you ever experience that ?
SM : Definitely .
For years I struggled with , Why me ?
Of course I ’ve been angry with God , too .
As my level of disability is quite visible , I also go through periods of struggling with how I walk , people gawking at my hands , etc .
HtCwP : On the other hand , great wisdom and growth can come out of adversity .
Do you believe there were silver linings for you in your experience of illness , related to your spirituality or otherwise ?
SM : I do n’t just believe , I KNOW that human struggles of whatever nature have the potential to bring us closer to God , assuming we ’re open to the grace .
In my case , I have united my pain with Jesus time and time again .
I believe as Caryll Houselander articulated so well in her work , that suffering is redemptive , that it heals the Body of Christ , in whatever mysterious way that occurs .
As for silver linings ,  I stopped driving years ago , which is difficult .
However , several of my friendships have deepened through many a car talk  that would never have happened if I were still driving myself .
I ’m convinced God will bring good out of even the worst situations .
Thanks so much to Sister Janice McGrane for sharing some of her story .
Kirk , Spock , McCoy , and Sybok are on the surface of a distant world called Nimbus III beyond “ The Great Barrier , ” where the ambitious Vulcan half - brother of Spock named Sybok has forcefully led them on a quest to find ultimate universal truth and meaning — a.k.a. the search for Eden and God .
Moments after their arrival , they are met by a Father Time - ish being who , incidentally , could n’t have looked more like Caucasian humanity ’s version of God if all the artists in the world tried to get him to …but I digress .
This sagely - looking , incorporeal being of obviously great presence and power learns of the starship that brought them to his world .
He informs them that he has been imprisoned in this distant world for an eternity , unable to reach the rest of the galaxy , and that the Enterprise would be his means of travel beyond it .
But the red flag of skepticism had already been raised in the mind of Kirk , who boldly asked : “ What does God need with a starship ? ”
Now , the situation becomes especially tense .
McCoy says , “ Jim , what are you doing ? ” Kirk says , “ I 'm asking a question . ”
The so - called “ God ” says , “ Who is this creature ? ”
Kirk asks , “ Who am I ?
Do n't you know ?
Are n't you God ? ”
Comically , Sybok remarks , “ He has his doubts . ” “ God ” asks , “ You doubt me ? ” Kirk says , “ I seek proof . ” McCoy says , “ Jim !
You do n't ask the Almighty for his ID ! ” “ God ” tells Kirk , “ Then here is the proof you seek . ”
At this point , Kirk is struck by a bolt of energy and knocked to the ground .
Despite the brutal nature of this “ God ” emerging in such a terrifying fashion , the planted seeds of doubt begin to grow into what would be considered by any god a tree of heresy .
Kirk asks , “ Why is God angry ? ” Even Sybok , the kooky believer of the bunch , is now compelled to ask , “ Why ?
Why have you done this to my friend ? ”
Coldly and bluntly , “ God ” says , “ He doubts me . ”
But that evil , heretical Kirk had already spread the disease of disbelief .
Spock reminds “ God , ” “ You have not answered his question .
What does God need with a starship ? ”
So “ God ” hits Spock with lightning as well , and then it addresses McCoy : “ Do you doubt me ? ”
And at this point , even emotional , sentimental , non-reasoning McCoy is forced to go with his mind : “ I doubt any God who inflicts pain for his own pleasure . ”
Now this perceived “ God ” and the God of the Bible should do lunch sometime .
They have lots in common , do n’t they ?
In any other context , you would n’t be able to tell them apart judging by their actions and attitudes .
For instance , they both believe they are the final authority and should be obeyed without question .
They both prefer human instrumentality to get their will done ( even though they should n’t ) , they both use torture to enforce their demands , and they both hate the living hell out of skeptics !
As with just about every god there ever was , doubt is the most damnable of all offenses .
Make no mistake about it — asking the Alpha - and - Omega probing questions will get your ass struck down !
This tendency describes the God of the Bible to a “ T ” .
But that ’s not what I ’m hitting at here .
I ’m honing in on the question asked by Kirk : “ What does God need with a starship ? ”
The question is priceless in that no matter what theistic concept is under investigation , it is the mere asking of the “ need ” question that leads to the unraveling of theism .
Ask a lot of questions and you ’ll be called an annoying kid , ask a few more questions and you ’ll be called a UFOologist or a new - ager , but ask too many questions and you ’ll end up an atheist !
You have been warned !
But again , I digress .
The gods have always hated questions as badly as they hate the questioners .
To question God is to totally rob him of all power whatsoever because when you begin to question him , you naturally undercut his authority as you take on the role of one asking a subservient to give an account of himself to a superior .
And when God ’s authority is undercut , not only is his power rendered inert , his afflicting guilt ca n’t get to you either , nor can his tug at your pocketbook .
So the logic of inquiry and God just do n’t line up , much like Air Traffic Control scoping for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve .
Now God does n’t “ need ” anything .
He ca n’t need anything , being that he ’s omnipotent as the fully self - sufficient prime mover and sustainer of the cosmos .
And Christians will fully agree .
God does n’t need to have children sacrificed to him by having babies thrown to the hungry crocs of the Nile .
God does n’t need to have the still - beating heart ripped out of a young Aztec man ’s chest and held up to the sun as a means to preserve or sustain the universe and “ feed ” God .
God does n’t need to be clothed or bathed or groomed .
He does n’t need a W - 2 booklet for tax time , he does n’t need Febreaze air freshener , he does n’t need patio furniture , and he does n’t need Limewire .
He just does n’t .
But Christians do n’t go far enough .
It ’s not enough to look down on the pagan gods and goddesses of old and talk up how inferior they are for having typically carnal ( and often conjugal ) needs .
They need to look down on their own God as well .
Christians gloat in the supposed superiority of their own deity , but their gloating is as short - lived as an Oprah trim - down .
The God of Christianity is , in fact , guilty of the very same absurdity of having unjustifiable needs as any pagan god ever was .
To be forthrightly logical about it , if God exists , he can’t want anything at all – nothing – because to want is to have a lack of something , which is to have a need .
And as we have already seen , a God cannot “ have needs , ” like I do at the moment ( Ohhh Belindaaaaa ?
Where are you , hun ?
I ’m a comin ’ for ya ! )
Well , for yet a third time , I digress !
What application does this have for the Christian ?
It means that God does n’t need a starship for the same reason that he does n’t need a temple , a church , a mosque , a synagogue , or a shrine .
And God does n’t need worshippers , and therefore , a universe to house them .
It means that even if an omnimax deity like the God of the scriptures existed , that being would have no desire to create us or anything else at all .
Nope , God does n’t need solar systems or planetary bodies , and he does n’t need fleshly flattery in the form of blubbering blood - bags to tell him he ’s so , so , so , so , so , sooooo worthy .
He would know that already and would n’t have a complex about it , causing him to fixate on himself so much with the neurotic narcissism of a throat - slashing serial killer .
And God would n’t need or want a son .
The idea of a god having a son does n’t even make sense on the face of it .
That is , it makes about as much sense as a god who ejaculates to make a son ( if you can imagine that ? ! )
Nope ,
God would n’t have a son and he certainly would n’t have a virgin - born son , and he would n’t have his son brutally killed and then raised to life again for the purpose of setting up a death - glorifying , cannibalistic cult where beings who are infinitely less powerful than he sit around and eat the flesh of his dead / resurrected little boy , and then proceed to clamor on about how junior ’s the greatest thing since sliced bread ( well , actually before sliced bread ! )
Now God may not need anything , but it is definitely an understandable mistake for Christians to think that he wants things .
Talking about a God creating a people to be tokens of his glory or sending disciples on a mission to do “ his will ” is understandable .
I mean , we collect keepsakes and send people to the store for us .
We build houses and make plans , and so it should come as no surprise when the gods we create in our image “ do things ” just as we do .
That ’s why the gods get angry just like we do and command to have the heads of their enemies placed on sticks to face the sky until the evening so that their fierce anger will be turned away ( Numbers 25:4 ) .
But that ’s another problem ; a god ca n’t be angry anymore than a god can need or want a thing , because getting angry can only happen when a being is limited in power and unable to rectify a situation or is put in an edgy predicament of some sort .
But you ca n’t put the great “ I Am ” in a predicament , and so to say that he can get angry ( or become jealous , or regretful , or embarrassed , or amused ) makes no clear sense .
We ’re dealing with the classic anthropomorphic problem here — you ca n’t take the emotions found in limited beings and expect them to fit beings who transcend all limits .
This tells us that the gods were made in our image and not the other way around .
So no , God would n’t need a starship , but he also would n’t need us .

Coronary Calcification Predicts Future Heart Attacks and Coronary Death .
Cholesterol Not Found to be a Significant Risk Factor
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
A striking report just published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates the accumulation of calcium in coronary arteries , and not cholesterol , more accurately predicts a future heart attack or other heart trouble , far more than cholesterol or other standard risk factors .
This report gives evidence of a major misdirection by modern medicine — the creation of cholesterol phobia in the population at large .
Prior studies show use of cholesterol - lowering drugs does not reduce mortality rates for coronary artery disease .
This report follows a front - page report in Business Week magazine declaring cholesterol - lowering drugs to be of marginal value .
The study involved 6722 men and women , ~age 60 , who were studied for a period of 3.8 years ( median ) .
None had coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study .
Subjects who experienced an adverse coronary event ( heart attack , angina , placement of a stent , coronary death ) were more likely to be taking cholesterol - lowering drugs ( ~ 28 % ) than those who did not experience such an event ( ~16 % ) .
Furthermore , subjects who experienced a heart attack or angina had about the same total cholesterol ( ~199 ) as subjects who did not ( ~194 ) .
Cholesterol barely met statistical significance whereas calcium was a highly predictive factor .
Traditionally - used risk factors , such as C - reactive protein ( a marker of inflammation ) , triglycerides , HDL cholesterol and greater body mass , were not predictive for a future coronary artery event .
Among subjects whose coronary artery calcium score was zero , their risk for any adverse coronary event was only about one - half of 1 % ( 0.0044 ) , or less than 1 in 200 , whereas those with a coronary calcium score over 300 , about 8.0 % experienced an adverse event involving coronary arteries ( 0.0804 ) , or about 8 in 100 , an 18 - fold difference ( 1800 % ! ) , over the 3.8 - year period .
This study shows the risk for a future heart attack is nil for those with a calcium arterial score of zero .
This data helps to explain why hundreds of thousands of Americans experience a sudden - death heart attack with low - to - normal cholesterol .
Most heart attacks emanate in the four coronary arteries that supply the heart with oxygenated blood .
About 50 % of arterial plaque is calcium and only 3 % is cholesterol .
Arterial calcium can be measured by use of a CT scan ( called an Agatston score , for Dr. Arthur Agatston , South Beach Miami , Florida cardiologist ) .
About 70 % of white males , 52 % of black males , 57 % of Hispanic males and 59 % of Chinese males , have coronary calcium scores greater than zero .
The calcium arterial scores for women are about half that of males owing to the fact they donate calcium to their offspring during pregnancy and lactation and control calcium via estrogen throughout their fertile years .
Calcium begins to accumulate in coronary arteries in males as soon as full growth is achieved , around age 18 .
Women begin to accumulate calcium in their arteries with the onset of menopause or early hysterectomy .
It was recently reported that postmenopausal women who take calcium supplements increase their risk for a heart attack by about 45 % .
[ British Medical Journal 2008 Feb 2 ; 336 ( 7638 ) : 262—6 ]
In the early 1990s British cardiologist Stephen Seely noted that countries which consume that highest amount of calcium ( New Zealand , Ireland , North America , Scandinavian countries ) , mostly from dairy products , have the highest rates of cardiovascular disease .
[ International Journal Cardiology 1991 Nov ; 33 ( 2) :191—8 ]

A Canada -U.S. research team has solved a major genetic mystery :
How a protein in some people 's DNA guards them against killer immune diseases such as HIV .
In an advance online edition of Nature Medicine , the scientists explain how the protein , FOX03a , shields against viral attacks and how the discovery will help in the development of a HIV vaccine .
" HIV infection is characterised by the slow demise of T - cells , in particular central memory cells , which can mediate lifelong protection against viruses , " said lead researcher Rafick - Pierre Sékaly , a Université de Montréal professor and a researcher at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal and the French Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale ( Inserm ) .
" Our group has found how the key protein , FOX03a , is vital to the survival of central memory cells that are defective in HIV - infected individuals even if they are treated , " added Dr. Sékaly , who produced his study with CHUM and Inserm colleagues including Elias El Haddad and Julien van Grevenynghe .
Collaborators also included Jean - Pierre Routy , a McGill University Health Centre researcher and professor at McGill University and Robert S. Balderas , Vice - President of Research and Development at BD Biosciences of San Diego , CA .
Public support for the research came through Genome Canada and Génome Québec , among others , while private contributions came via a segment of BD ( Becton , Dickinson and Company ) .
" Public - private collaborations such as this play an important role in advancing medical research , " Robert S. Balderas .
" BD Biosciences was pleased to provide powerful research instruments , reagents and technical expertise to support this breakthrough research . "
The breakthrough emerged by studying three groups of men : One HIV - negative sample , a second HIV - positive group whose infection was successfully controlled through tritherapy and a third group whose HIV did not show any symptoms .
Called elite controllers , this third group fended off infection without treatment because their immune system , which would normally be attacked by HIV , maintained its resilient immune memory through the regulation of the FOX03a protein .
" Given their perfect resistance to HIV infection , elite controllers represent the ideal study group to examine how proteins are responsible for the maintenance of an immune system with good anti-viral memory , " said Dr. Haddad .
" This is the first study to examine , in people rather than animals , what shields the body 's immune system from infection and to pinpoint the fundamental role of FOX03a in defending the body . "
Beyond HIV treatment , Dr. Sékaly said his team 's discovery offers promise for other immune diseases .
" The discovery of FOX03a will enable scientists to develop appropriate therapies for other viral diseases that weaken the immune system , " he said , citing cancer , rheumatoid arthritis , hepatitis C , as well as organ or bone marrow transplant rejection .
Paul L'Archevêque , president and CEO of Génome Québec , lauded Dr. Sékaly 's team for their breakthrough and the people who volunteered for the study .
" This discovery , the first such study in humans , is a major step forward in the understanding of how our immune system responds to life - threatening infections such as HIV .
This advance stems directly from research co-financed by Génome Québec , which demonstrates the impact that genomic research can have in improving healthcare . "
This research was made possible by public and private institutions across Canada , the United States and France : the Université de Montréal , CHUM , Inserm , MUHC , Genome Canada , Génome Québec , Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec , Canadian Institutes of Health Research , National Institutes of Health and BD Biosciences .
Imagine yourself sitting down transfixed and watching video footage of U.S. bombs hitting Iran .
You see children ripped limb from limb , mothers screaming and wailing , people panicked , tortured , traumatized , and killed .
Imagine asking yourself at that point :
What was I doing these past many months that I thought was more important than preventing this ?
Now ask yourself today :
What am I doing that is more important than ending the ongoing hell of the U.S. occupation of Iraq ?
Are you struggling to support your family ?
So are many , many other people who still find hours and days to commit .
While congress members and senators have the gall to tell constituents that opposing Pelosi or Reid and cutting off the funding lies outside their " comfort zone , " citizens are going without sleep , ruining marriages and friendships , losing money , fasting , and risking serious jail time for nonviolent protests .
Are those children hit by the bombs living within a " comfort zone " ?
Are you working on an election campaign ?
Is that where you believe democratic activism belongs ?
Here are a few reasons to consider putting at least some of your energy into ending the occupation of Iraq right now :
First , there is no good reason to believe votes will be honestly counted .
Second , there are no candidates in the two big parties who intend to end the occupation quickly , but there might be one if the peace movement were larger - and that shift in policy would help that candidate win more than doing what he wants you to do would help .
Third , a great many people will die unnecessary deaths during the next 10 months , and it is simply not true that Congress cannot prevent it .
Any Senator can commit now to filibustering the funding , just as Senator Chris Dodd committed to filibustering telecom immunity .
Any representative can commit now to voting
No and to lobbying Pelosi not to bring the funding up for a vote .
We elected them to do this in 2006 , and if we do not hold them to it we will lose the power to elect anyone to do anything we want in 2008 .
Are you working to pass federal legislation on an important issue that will benefit millions of people ?
That 's sweet of you , but a complete waste of time .
As I said in November of 2006 , and as has proved true over 15 months : good bills will be vetoed , bad ones will become law , and mixed ones will have the good parts signing - statemented .
Building momentum to pass your bill next year is all well and good , but there will be no money to pay for it if the occupation of Iraq continues .
Were Congress to find the nerve to impeach , you might get your legislation turned into law this year .
And I would ask you to close your eyes and look one more time at the dying children of Iran .
If that does n't work , open your eyes and look at these images from our occupation of Iraq : http://afterdowningstreet.org/image
Are you working to make change at the local or state level ?
Are you working to educate , to change our culture , to inject decency into the world of business ?
Are you providing direct assistance to people in need ?
By no means should you stop , but you will be stopped if global war results from the suicidal course our government is on .
You will be stopped if global warming is not reversed .
You will be stopped if the hatred for the United States that Bush and Cheney are developing around the world blows back at us in a violent form .
You will have to live with the destroyed human beings who are veterans of U.S. military service in Iraq .
And you will have to live with knowing that collectively we could very easily have prevented hundreds of thousands of deaths , and you did n't do your bit .
So , let 's all do our share .
Let 's do it this week .
Let 's put an end to this murderous catastrophe right now and get on with the enormous task of building a peaceful and sustainable world .
So , what should you do ?
You should get involved in one of the events planned everywhere in the country on March 19th and surrounding days : http://resistinmarch.org
The international community 's patience with Zimbabwe 's president , Robert Mugabe , is wearing thin , Gordon Brown warned last night , adding that he was " appalled " at the latest developments in the country .
Earlier , Zimbabwe 's state radio station announced a ban on political rallies as the result of the presidential election continued to be withheld , almost two weeks after the poll Mugabe is believed to have lost .
On the eve of a summit of African leaders in Zambia to discuss the crisis , Brown said : " The Zimbabwean people have demonstrated their commitment to democracy .
We , and the leaders of the region , strongly share this commitment .
" I cannot understand why it is taking so long to announce the result of the presidential elections .
I am appalled by the signs that the regime is once again resorting to intimidation and violence .
" We will be vigilant .
The international community will remain careful to do nothing to undermine efforts to secure an outcome that reflects the democratic will of the people of Zimbabwe .
But the international community 's patience with the regime is wearing thin . "
Mugabe is expected to snub the summit in Zambia .
As tension rose over the withheld results , Zimbabwe police accused the opposition Movement for Democratic Change of " spoiling for a fight " and of deploying 350 youth wing members around the country .
The police banned a rally planned for tomorrow by the MDC , which has called a general strike for Tuesday to push for results to be released .
An opposition spokesman , Nelson Chamisa , said : " You ca n't be a political organisation and not hold a rally , that is what makes us who we are , how we communicate with our supporters . "
He added that the party had not decided whether to go ahead with the rally .
" We can not accept a declaration of a police state .
People have just voted for change , for democracy and what do they get ?
This is unacceptable .
This is ridiculous . "
State radio said Zimbabwe would be represented by three ministers at the summit on Saturday of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , which was expected to press Mugabe to issue results from the March 29 election .
State radio said demands for Mugabe to release the results were misplaced because that was the prerogative of the Zimbabwe electoral commission .
Human rights organisations and the MDC say Mugabe has unleashed a campaign of systematic violence in response to his Zanu - PF party 's first electoral defeat , when it lost control of parliament in the March 29 election .
The MDC says its leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , won the presidential vote , and that Mugabe 's 28 - year rule is over .
It accuses Mugabe of delaying the result so that he can intimidate opposition supporters before a runoff vote against Tsvangirai .
Zimbabwean police said all political rallies had been banned because officers were too busy guarding ballot boxes or deployed to prevent post-election violence .
Amnesty International said there were widespread incidents of violence in Zimbabwe " suggesting the existence of coordinated retribution against known and suspected opposition supporters " .
Amnesty called on SADC leaders to redouble efforts to avoid further deterioration of the human rights situation and urge the electoral commission to release the results .
Human Rights
Watch said the Lusaka meeting was SADC 's " last real chance " to resolve the crisis in Zimbabwe .
The US - based body also accused Zanu - PF of increasing assaults on opposition activists and polling agents .

Long - married couples often schedule a weekly “ date night ” — a regular evening out with friends or at a favorite restaurant to strengthen their marital bond .
But brain and behavior researchers say many couples are going about date night all wrong .
Simply spending quality time together is probably not enough to prevent a relationship from getting stale .
Using laboratory studies , real - world experiments and even brain - scan data , scientists can now offer long - married couples a simple prescription for rekindling the romantic love that brought them together in the first place .
The solution ?
Reinventing date night .
Rather than visiting the same familiar haunts and dining with the same old friends , couples need to tailor their date nights around new and different activities that they both enjoy , says Arthur Aron , a professor of social psychology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook .
The goal is to find ways to keep injecting novelty into the relationship .
The activity can be as simple as trying a new restaurant or something a little more unusual or thrilling — like taking an art class or going to an amusement park .
If you car comes up missing here in the U.S. , you probably do n't want it back once the thieves are done with it .
Over in Scotland , they do things differently , even illegal things .
Police say someone in southeast Scotland 's Borders area is sneaking into houses , taking car keys and going for rides in the homeowners ' cars .
In this country , that 'd be the end of it until the police found your Malibu up on cinder blocks in a bad neighborhood .
The Scottish twist , however , is that the next morning all these cars are right where they were parked the day before .
The burglar has struck at least eight times , and so far , only one car has ended up crashed .
The only things that tip people their car has been stolen are finding their keys in strange places and discovering more miles on their odometers .
Sometimes lots of miles .
Until the thief is nabbed , we recommend the Scottish keep their tanks empty and their keys on the nightstand .

P4P : P2Pの進化系？
DCIA : P4P Working Group ( P4PWG ) が公開してい る 「 P4P : Explicit Communications for Cooperative Control Between P2P and Network Providers 」という論文を読みました。 ISPがP2Pに協力することによって、ネットワークに対する負荷を大幅に軽減できるという内容です。 アメリカのP2Pは、今後ISPと協力関係を構築していくのかも知れないと思える論文でした。
P4P WG
この論文を作成したP4P技術ワーキンググループには、結構豪華なメンバーによって構成されています。
P4Pの論文が話題になっているのは、発表したメンバーが豪華で、実際に実現(採用/デプロイ)されていく技術なのではないかと思えるからかも知れません。

論文要約
以下、論文の要約です。 簡単に言うと 、End-Endだけでは調べきれない情報をネットワークプロバイダ側が提供する事によって、P2Pの効率を上昇させようというものです。 情報提供用のiTrackerは補助的な機能で、それが無くてもP2Pは動作できるようになっているところがポイントです。
主に手法等に注目しています。 勘違いや誤訳が含まれる可能性があるので、是非原文もご覧下さい。
P4P とは
P4P と は「 Proactive network Provider Participation for P2P 」 もしくは「 Provider Portal for P2P 」 。
P4Pの目的は、
(1) P2Pアプリケーションによるネットワークリソースの公平かつ効果的な利用を促進する。
(2) ネットワークプロバイダが保有する資源を公平かつ効果的に活用でき、アプリケーションの要求を満たし、コストを削減し、収益を増大させられるようにすること。
P4P のモチベーション
P2Pアプリケーションが効果的な通信を実現するには、ネットワークトポロジ等を知る必要がある。
現在の測定技術では、End-Endの努力だけでネットワークトポロジを詳しく知るのは困難である。
また、各アプリケーションが個別に分析行動(probe)を行うのは無駄である。
MPLSのような新技術や、計測用のprobeに答えないルータの存在が測定をより一層難しくしている。
利用可能な帯域や、パケット喪失レートの測定をEnd-Endで行うのは困難である。
Endホストで測定できる値は、主にLast Mileのボトルネックでぼかされてしまう(例えば、Last Mileの回線が一番細いなど ) 。
さらに、コストやポリシーをEndが知るのは非常に難しい。 例えば、どのinterdomainリンクを通った方がコスト(経費)が安くなるかなど。
このときのコストに影響する要素としては、ピアリングしているプロバイダ間に流れるトラフィックの量(割合)などが挙げられる。
設計思想
より良 いP2Pパフォーマンスを得られること
より詳細なネットワーク情報を得ることによってP4Pは効率的になる。
より効果的なネットワーク資源利用が実現できること
P2Pへネットワークに関する情報を提供する事によって、P4Pはバックボーントラフィックを軽減し、オペレーションコストを削減する。
スケーラビリテ ィ
P4Pは、多数のユーザとP2Pネットワークを同時にサポートすべき。
プライバシ ー
ネットワーク情報を開示するときにプライバシーを考慮できること。
拡張性
様々なタイプ のP2Pアプリケーションが存在する。
例えば、ファイル共有とストリーミングは異なる要求があるかも知れない。
ブートストラップ時に利用するtracker(appTracker)が存在するシステムもある。
P4Pには、様々なアプリケーションに適応できる柔軟性が求められる。
徐々にデプロイできること
一気に全てを入れ替える事はできない。 徐々に適応していける仕組みでなければいけない。
プロバイダが参加することによるP2Pのアクセラレーション
例えば 、CoS( Class of Service ) やQoS( Quality of Service ) をプロバイダが提供する事や、高速サーバを用意することなどが挙げられる。
設計概要
P4Pは、コントロールプレーンとデータプレーンに分かれる。
コントロールプレー ン
コントロールプレーンでは、P4PはiTrackerと呼ばれるポータルを用意する。
各ネットワーク( ISPや大学ネットワークなど)は、各自用にiTrackerを用意する。
P2Pクライアントは、各自のネットワーク内でのiTrackerのIPアドレスをDNSに問い合わせる。
DNSへの問い合わせには新しい「 P4P」レコードタイプが利用される。 ( ！新しいDNSレコードを作って、それを使うんですね。。。)
同一ドメイン内に複数のiTrackerを用意しても良い。
データプレー ン
データプレーンでは、ネットワークがP2Pアプリケーションにフィードバックを提供できる。 例えば、ECN( Explicit Congestion Notification、参考：ECN in TCP/IP ) を利用し てTCPパケットに輻輳マークをつけることなどが挙げられる。 それを見てEndホストは利用帯域を調整できる。
i Tracker
i Trackerは、XMLで記述されたinfo/policy/capabilityの3つの情報を提供する。
info
プロバイダ内に存在しているピア候補に関する情報。
ネットワークプロバイダIDである「ASID」、ネットワークノードグループに割り当てられる「PID」、仮想的もしくは物理的位置情報を表す「LOC」などが提供される。
policy
希望するネットワークの利用方法を伝える。 例えば、inbound/outboundのトラフィックの割合、利用を避けて欲しい大まかな時間帯の提示、リンクの利用量に関するポリシー、など。
capability
ネットワークプロバイダが提供できる機能を伝える。
例えば、プロバイダが提供できる複数のサービスクラス( Class of Service ) を示したり、ネットワーク内の既設サーバを示したりできる。
実験と評 価
論文では、仮想的 なBitTorrentシュミレータを構築したり、PlanetLab上でLiveswarmsを使って実験を行っています。
実験を行った結果、P4Pによってネットワーク利用効率と転送速度を50％〜70％改善できたと主張しています。
実験や結果に関して詳しく知りたい方は論文をご覧下さい。
Q & A
Q : 何でP2P側が勝手にできないの？
A : アプリケーションが自力でネットワーク構成や状態をリバースエンジニアするのが非常に困難だからです。
ポリシになるとさらに困難になります。
Q : ネットワーク運営者側の利点はわかるが 、P2P側のインセンティブは？
A : 評価で示したよう にP2P側にもメリットがあります。
一方で 、P4PがなければプロバイダはP2Pアプリケーションが使う帯域を制限する可能性があります。
P2Pトラフィックはネットワーク帯域を大きく消費する反面、プロバイダの利益にならないことをP2P開発者達は気がついています。 そのため、P4Pを使った効果的な協調は魅力的であるはずです。
Q : P4Pによってrobustnessは減少してしまいますか？
A : P4Pはrobustness ( 頑健性/堅牢性) を制限しません。 通常の運用では、iTrackerはヒントを提供するだけです。 また、iTrackerはクリティカルパスではありません。 iTrackerが落ちても、P2Pは通常の動作をするだけです。

What 's the first thing we did with our Casio Exilim EX - F1 , the Hiro Nakamura camera / camcorder that makes time stand still ?
We recorded a mini Cuisinart laying havoc to some tomatoes .
Why ?
If you have to ask , you probably should n't be here .
The top vid is a view of the carnage at 300 frames per second .
( As you 'll see , I call my food processor " Hitchcock " because it 's always keeping me in suspense . )
Below , additional tomatoes get annihilated at 600 fps and then 1200 fps , with increasing detail , but decreasing resolution and light .

This is probably the happiest tradeoff of resolution to slow - mo devastation .
The first video records at 512x384 , while this one drops you down to a funky widescreen 432x192 .
The 1200 fps setting is pretty much a novelty more than anything else , since you need a ton of light , and it records at an all too wide 336x96 .
We had to crop it so that it made any kind of sense , but here 's a screengrab of the original vid :

There 's more to come with this fun little camera , but we wanted to give you a rather violent taste straight away .

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve 's rescue of Bear Stearns Cos. will come to be seen as its " worst policy mistake in a generation , " a former top Fed staffer said .
The episode will be seen as comparable to " the great contraction " of the 1930s and " the great inflation " of the 1970s , Vincent Reinhart said Monday at a panel organized by the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative - leaning think tank where he is now a scholar .
Until mid-2007 , Mr. Reinhart was director of monetary affairs at the Fed and secretary of its policy - making ...
See more pictures of Duncan Scott at Mullagmore Head
In pictures
Duncan Scott , 29 , from Newquay , was surfing at Mullagmore Head in Donegal Bay as waves estimated at 55 ft ( 16.7 m ) high lashed the coast .
Weather forecasters had warned of hazardous conditions for ships , fishing vessels and coastal walkers .
He said that he was safe because friends were on hand with a water bike .
Flood fears
He and Alistair Mennie , Gabe Davies , and Ritchie Fitzgerald , who have surfed some of the biggest breaks in the world , used the water bike to tow them onto the waves .
Mr Scott said : " These were the biggest waves I have ever surfed , but I never felt in danger because we were using experienced riders who were on hand all the time .
" The jet skis have a platform at the rear so you can get back to safety . "
It is understood that low pressure near Iceland is causing the high sea levels with waves growing for between 500 and 600 miles by the time they crash against the Irish coastline .
Dr Glenn Nolan , of the Marine Institute , said : " This is allowing waves to travel all the way uninterrupted to the Irish coast .
" It 's quite unusual .
The last time we would have had waves close to this height would have been in early 2005 and before that in 2000 . "
Dr Nolan warned that the entire west coast , from Cork up to Donegal , was affected .
Previously the biggest waves recorded by the Marine Institute 's data buoys were to the west of Galway Bay in January 2005 , when swells of 44ft ( 13.4 m ) were recorded .
The high seas come just weeks after the east coast of England braced itself for tidal surges , sparking flood fears and evacuations .
News in Science
Cute animals ' skewing ' extinction debate
News analysis Global extinctions are rarer than commonly believed and the extinction debate is too narrowly focused on pin-up images of charismatic birds and mammals , an Australian zoologist says .
Instead Professor Nigel Stork , of the University of Melbourne , urges greater focus on threats facing invertebrates and local extinctions .
Stork says statements about " 100 extinctions a day " have become accepted , cited by organisations such as the United Nations and repeated in the popular media .
But Stork believes the science does not back this .
" The truth at the moment is we do n't have enough information to talk about hundreds of species dying out , " says Stork , the head of the university 's School of Resource Management and Geography .
Stork says the number of known extinctions since 1600 is several thousand with only 60 - 70 species of insects included in the list .
Most of the extinctions occurred on islands , he says , and coincided with the arrival of humans .
" When you compare birds and mammals to snails , molluscs and insects , there is a seven times greater chance of a species becoming rare and endangered for birds and mammals than for these invertebrates , " he says .
Stork says this reflects a lack of information about insect and other invertebrate numbers .
" It 's bad science , when you 've got millions of species , to extrapolate in the same way , " he says .
" The threats are different .
For birds and mammals the threats are hunting and loss of habitat , for invertebrates and other insects it may be another suite of threats . "
Stork says he accepts many larger animals are as threatened as various reports outline .
" [ But ] we need to take a broader range of approaches to looking at extinction and extinction rates and look more carefully at other groups before we can extrapolate the rates of extinction from birds and mammals to the rest of biodiversity . "
Certainly skewed
Environmental scientist Professor Mark Burgman agrees and says extinction data is " certainly skewed " .
The director of the Australian Centre of Excellence for Risk Analysis at the University of Melbourne says we do n't know the degree to which the " biased data " affects our potential to manage the changing environmental landscape .
He says the problem of bias is caused by scientists ' lack of interest in studying the invertebrates that make up most of biodiversity .
" We know 90 % of the vascular plants in Australia , but we only know 5 % of the fungi , " he says .
" We know a great deal about birds and mammals ... but the majority of living things are n't these things . "
Instead he says there should be a focus on dealing with the processes and things that threaten invertebrates .
Burgman says the consequences of our inattention could be catastrophic and that increased interest and funding of taxonomy is required .
He says the classification of species is " not a groovy topic for government expenditure " .
But he says that knowledge of new species could be vital for future biosecurity .
Stork says local extinctions of " keystone " vertebrate species are also a concern because they cause major changes to ecosystems by altering key processes such as the dispersal and pollination of flora .
Climate change effects widespread
Climate change may be the next driver of widespread extinctions and that this will be " less discriminating " in its impact , says Stork .
His comments follow recent reports by environmental group WWF - Australia and CSIRO that show climate change will severely affect the survival and habitats of Australian native animals .
Professor Peter Steinberg , of the School of Biological , Earth and Environmental Sciences , at the University of New South Wales , says Stork 's view on the extinction debate has some merit .
But Steinberg says it has been " reasonably documented " that the world is now experiencing extinction rates comparable to some of the major extinction events in history .
He says if " we have a feel for this with high - profile animals " then it is possible to postulate this might be reflected among other living organisms .
Steinberg also believes more focus needs to be directed at the smaller organisms that make up biodiversity .
" Biodiversity develops on an evolutionary scale , " he says .
" The rate of extinction is so rapid the evolutionary process is not going to be able to replace the loss of biodiversity . "

“ THE MOST WRENCHING SINCE THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR ” …. Alan Greenspan today :
The current financial crisis in the US is likely to be judged in retrospect as the most wrenching since the end of the second world war .
It will end eventually when home prices stabilise and with them the value of equity in homes supporting troubled mortgage securities .
This means , presumably , that he thinks we may be about to enter a recession worse than the one in 1981 — and that it ’s not going to end until house prices stop falling , which probably wo n’t be until 2010 or so .
This is bad , right ?
The rest of Greenspan ’s piece is basically a convoluted way of saying that Wall Street never expects the good times to end , but when they ( inevitably ) do , all the computer models that worked when prices were going up suddenly seize up and die :
In line with the time - honoured observation that diversification lowers risk , computers crunched reams of historical data in quest of negative correlations between prices of tradeable assets ; correlations that could help insulate investment portfolios from the broad swings in an economy .
When such asset prices , rather than offsetting each other ’s movements , fell in unison on and following August 9 last year , huge losses across virtually all risk - asset classes ensued .
….
Over the past half - century , the American economy was in contraction only one - seventh of the time .
But it is the onset of that one - seventh for which risk management must be most prepared .
Negative correlations among asset classes , so evident during an expansion , can collapse as all asset prices fall together , undermining the strategy of improving risk / reward trade - offs through diversification .
In other words , all those risk management systems created by the rocket scientists were n’t designed to take into account the possibility that there was any actual risk in the system .
In any case , Greenspan alludes to the fact that traumatic events have become more common in the global economy over the past couple of decades , which is certainly true .
Just to name a few , we ’ve seen the run on the pound ; the Mexican collapse ; the Asian collapse ; the LTCM smashup ; the dotcom bust ; and now the subprime debacle .
The next big argument , I assume , is going to be between people like Greenspan , who essentially say there ’s nothing we can do about this , and others who think that reining in the wild west of global finance a bit might be a useful thing to do .
Count me in the latter camp .
A quick question :
What are the most beautiful programming books that you ’ve ever read ?
The type of book that , when you cracked it open , made you just want to stare at the code forever .
( Beautiful , non-programming but still technical , books are also acceptable . )
On a related note :
What ’s the best code formatting that you ’ve ever seen ?
( Color , font face , font size , etc. )
These questions may , or may not be , related to this .
Currently , my favorite for “ most beautiful programming book ” would have to be “ Processing : A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists “ .
The code is elegantly written , is crisp , and tightly spaced .
I wish the code , itself , could ’ve been printed in color , with syntax highlighting , but that seems like a necessary sacrifice to make with most technical books .
( Side note : I ’m a huge sucker for hardcover programming books – I desire more of them since having acquired this one . )
“ Most beautiful technical book ” would have to be Tufte ’s The Visual Display of Quantitative Information .
I love the stark contrast of the , simple , diagrams against the smooth text .
I ’ve you ’ve never held a Tufte book , then you do n’t know what a beautiful book can look like .
My favorite syntax highlighting scheme would be Gruber Dark , by the always excellent John Gruber .
However , Gruber Dark generally is n’t acceptable for print ( nor is it particularly situated for code – I have to bash it around a bit to get something that I like ) .
Unfortunately , I do n’t have a particularly memorable light syntax - highlighting scheme ; input here would be most appreciated .
Bonus : I ’m in love with the Shoes programming guide Nobody Knows Shoes .
_why ’s sheer zaniness , whimsy , and deep programming knowledge is exactly what the programming world needs .
If there were more books like his ( see also : Why ’s ( Poignant ) Guide to Ruby ) the programming movement would be in a better place .
I ’m completely convinced that programming has a strong symbiosis with art and that the two are entirely intertwined .
I ’ve been constantly exploring to try to get to the root of this relationship but , like most things , it ’s a never - ending inspection .
Pointers to the roadsigns are appreciated .
This is what you get when you capture 69,550 full resolution frames from the six Star Wars movies and combine them with a version of DaVinci 's Last Supper on a PC with mosaic - making software and a custom matlab - based algorithm .
The 262 - megapixel mosaic ( 24,168 x 10,864 pixels ) took two weeks to complete , including 30 hours of computing power and manual retouching for the final version .
Avinash Arora , the guy who did it , tells us about the process .
Advertisement
Jesús Díaz :
What materials did you use for creating this huge thing ?
Avinash Arora :
The 69,550 - image collection I made is from all the movies .
Originally I extracted EVERY image using vlc's image output plug - in from Episode IV , and used a photoshop programmed command to delete every 19 frames , and save the 20th .
Only after that did I discover AndreaMosaic could do that for me , which saved me a ton of time in the other five movies .
As the base , I used Eric Deschamps ' Star Wars Last Supper painting done for Giant Magazine .
JD : What kind of computer did you use to do this ?
AA : An Asus M2N SLI motherboard with AMD 5400 + X2 , eVGA nVidia Geforce 8800 GTS 640MB , and 2GB DDR2 Corsair XMS memory .

JD : What about the software ?
AA : The original software I used is AndreaMosaic , but I found that the algorithm was n't really producing the results I wanted .
I ended up tinkering with the settings and producing dozens of sample mosaics to view , and I did some research and found out how it worked .
JD : Did you get what wanted at the end ?
What did you do to improve the quality ?
AA : I created my own slightly modified algorithm to include pathlines of the strongest " importance " ( or rather color distinction , so I could find pictures that followed the image 's contours for every detail ) I got more satisfying results .
I kept tinkering with this one and made six full - size mosaics , until I finally settled on the last one ...
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
JD : And that was that ?
AA : No , I went to work on it by hand after that .
I replaced at least a thousand images by hand that looked like they were out of place ( my programming is n't perfect ) , and did some color corrections on others .
The entire thing was done when I took sections and pieces from the mosaics I made with AndreaMosaic , my own matlab - based algorithm , and the original image I drew inspiration from , and put it all together in Photoshop ( I also discovered that .psd files have a maximum size of 2GB , but luckily .raw files do not . )
JD : How long did it take you , then ?
AA : Each movie 's image extraction process took about an hour , that was the easy part .
Each sample mosaic I made for testing took about 90 minutes .
Each full mosaic I made took about 6 - 8 hours .
Once I had the final mosaic and went to work , I 'd say I put about 25 - 30 hours of work into touching up by hand .
Advertisement
The process ( not including extracting the images from the movies ) took me about two weeks from the time I made the first full mosaic , about a dozen samples , second full mosaic , dozen samples , etc .
During the two weeks I missed all but about two classes , and the day I finished I took an exam for a class I forgot I had ...
JD : Geezuss ...
AA : Do n't worry , I still did well . :-)
JD : How big is the thing ?
AA : Each image was about 640x272 , but when placed into the mosaic they were shrunken down to 120 pixel wide .
Each image is a full - quality jpeg , and they 're cut up into folders ( because my computer does n't take too kindly to one folder with 69,550 files in it ) .
Advertisement
The final resolution of the image 24,168 x 10,864 pixels ... 262 megapixels .
Unfortunately I could n't print it at the epic level I wanted to , which would have been a 5x11 ' composite , not a 3x6 ' , and that would have been a 712 - megapixel image .
The guy who prints them says his computer is incapable of opening an image that large ( which flattened would have been about 3GB ... and uncompressed almost 40 GB . ) [ Avinator ]

We 'll hand it to IBM 's researchers .
They think big - really big .
Like holy - crap - what - have - you - done big .
The Register has unearthed a research paper that shows IBM working on a computing system capable " of hosting the entire internet as an application . "
This mega system relies on a re-tooled version of IBM's Blue Gene supercomputers so loved by the high performance computing crowd .
IBM 's researchers have proposed tweaking the Blue Gene systems to run today 's most popular web applications such as Linux , Apache , MySQL and Ruby on Rails .
The IBM paper rightly points out that both large SMP ( symmetric multi- processing ) systems and clusters have their merits for massive computing tasks .
Of late , however , most organizations looking to crunch through really big jobs have preferred clusters , which provide certain economic advantages .
Customers can buy lots of general purpose hardware and networking components at a low cost and cobble the systems together to equal or surpass the performance of gigantic SMPs .
Sun Microsystems , Amazon.com , Google and Microsoft stand as just some of the companies using these clusters to offer software , processing power and storage to other businesses .
Their customers tap into these larger systems and can " grow " their applications as needed by firing up more and more of the provided computing infrastructure .
But there are a few problems with this approach , including the amount of space and energy the clusters require .
So , IBM wants to angle Blue Gene boxes at the web software jobs , believing it can run numerous applications on a single box at a lower cost than a cluster .
" We hypothesize that for a large class of web - scale workloads the Blue Gene / P platform is an order of magnitude more efficient to purchase and operate than the commodity clusters in use today , " the IBM researchers wrote .
Under a project code - named ' Kittyhawk , ' IBM has started running new types of applications on Blue Gene .
For example , it has run the SpecJBB benchmark for testing Java performance and the LAMP ( Linux Apache MySQL Perl / Python ) software , finding comparable performance to today 's clusters .
Blue Innards
IBM 's unique Blue Gene design has attracted a lot of attention from national labs and other major HPC customers .
In fact , four of the 10 fastest supercomputers on the planet rely on the Blue Gene architecture , including the world 's fastest machine : the Blue Gene / L at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
The newer Blue Gene / P system combines hundreds and thousands of low - power processor cores to make a single box .
A typical configuration would include four 850MHz PowerPC cores arranged in a system - on - a - chip model with built - in memory and interconnect controllers .
You can take 32 of these " nodes " and pop them onto a card .
Then you have 16 of those cards slot into a midplane .
Each server rack has two midplanes , leaving you with 1024 nodes and 2TB of memory .
In theory , you can connect up to 16,384 racks , providing up to 67.1 m cores with 32 PB of memory .
That 'll get some work done .
Each rack boasts IO bandwidth of 640 Gb/s , which puts our theoretical system at 10.4 Pb/s .
The architecture of Blue Gene gives IBM a so - called " hybrid " approach , according to the researchers , where they can get the best of both the SMP and cluster worlds .
" The key fact to note is that the nodes themselves can be viewed for the most part as general purpose computers , with processors , memory and external IO , " they wrote .
" The one major exception to this is that the cores have been extended with an enhanced floating point unit to enable super - computing workloads . "
So , you 're working with systems in a sense very similar to the individual x86 boxes that make up most clusters .
Although the unique packaging of the Blue Gene systems along with their low - power cores allows IBM to create a more reliable computer - by more than two orders of magnitude - than commodity boxes which fail all the time .
To date , IBM 's Blue Gene systems , which obviously have remarkable scale , have been aimed at running a single job well across the entire box .
But now we 're on to flashier stuff .
I read through an article on CNET yesterday that got me fired up about something I ’ve had on my mind for the last three years – the unfortunate , yet inevitable , demise of Circuit City .
About three summers ago , I worked there part time as a TV / Home Theater salesperson and strange as it might sound , I absolutely loved it .
Obviously I enjoyed being around the latest and greatest consumer electronics products , but I also got a lot of satisfaction from sharing what I knew with my customers and helping them pick out something that really rocked .
But alas , as both you and I can well attest , this level of customer service is not typical fare inside most big - box retailers these days .
And the teenagers masquerading as technology experts leave a lot to be desired .
In years past , the stores incentivized their employees to deliver exceptional customer service by offering sizable commissions on sales , which often led to quite comfortable salaries and great employee discounts .
In this era of shrinking profit margins , however , commissions have become a thing of the past ( as all Best Buy employees seem conditioned to report ) , and we are left to our own devices …or to the recommendations of Timmy , the high school junior .
What these retailers seemingly fail to understand , though , is that the one remaining competitive advantage they may yet have – the one key factor of differentiation between themselves and the countless online stores offering the exact same products for less money – IS CUSTOMER SERVICE .
And as a result of their negligence , most people ( myself included ) are more inclined to visit a big - box store , play around with a product for a while , and then purchase it on Amazon at a significant discount .
My direct challenge to Circuit City , then , is to bring back the days of commissioned sales ( at least for specific departments with higher margins like TV / Home Theater ) and see if things do n’t get a little better .
Because at $ 4.14 a share , they could hardly get worse .
Poole council admitted using RIPA powers on six occasions A council has admitted spying on a family using laws to track criminals and terrorists to find out if they were really living in a school catchment .
A couple and their three children were put under surveillance without their knowledge by Poole Borough Council for more than two weeks .
The council admitted using powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) on six occasions in total .
Three of those were for suspected fraudulent school place applications .
It said two offers of school places were withdrawn as a consequence .
Human rights pressure group Liberty called the spying " ridiculously disproportionate " and " intrusive " .
James Welch , legal director for Liberty , said : " It 's one thing to use covert surveillance in operations investigating terrorism and other serious crimes , but it has come to a pretty pass when this kind of intrusive activity is used to police school catchment areas .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" This is a ridiculously disproportionate use of RIPA and will undermine public trust in necessary and lawful surveillance . "
RIPA legislation allows councils to carry out surveillance if it suspects criminal activity .
On its website , the Home Office says : " The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) legislates for using methods of surveillance and information gathering to help the prevention of crime , including terrorism . "
It goes on to say the act allows the interception of communications , carrying out of surveillance and the use of covert human intelligence sources .
Poole council said it used the legislation to watch a family at home and in their daily movements because it wanted to know if they lived in the catchment area for a school , which they wanted their three - year - old daughter to attend .
It said directed surveillance was carried out by a council officer who was fully trained and authorised to exercise RIPA powers , once it had decided it may be a criminal matter .
' Potential criminal matter '
The council is keen to ensure that the information given by parents who apply for school places is true
Tim Martin , Poole Borough Council Tim Martin , head of legal and democratic services at Poole Borough Council , said : " The council is committed to investigating the small minority of people who attempt to break the law and affect the quality of life for the majority of law - abiding residents in Poole .
" On a small number of occasions , RIPA procedures have been used to investigate potentially fraudulent applications for school places .
" In such circumstances , we have considered it appropriate to treat the matter as a potential criminal matter .
" The council is keen to ensure that the information given by parents who apply for school places is true .
" This protects the majority of honest parents against the small number of questionable applications .
" An investigation may actually satisfy the council that the application is valid , as happened in this case . "

What are these ?
I was walking into Fulham Broadway underground station a couple of years ago when I saw police officers holding dogs on leashes , encouraging them to sniff the crotches of passing commuters .
What , I asked one of the policemen , was the purpose of this operation ?
" I can't say , " he replied .
I explained that I was a lawyer with a professional interest in crime .
He looked at me with something approaching interest .
" Well , you know that most crime is caused by drugs ? "
" Yes , " I lied .
" These dogs can smell the smallest trace of a drug on a person .
Once the dog has picked up a scent of drugs on them , we have the right to search them .
If we find drugs on them , we can then search their homes and in their homes we usually find all manner of incriminating articles . "
Who needs a warrant when you 've got a dog ?
Olfactory surveillance - the monitoring of personal odour - is on the increase .
The number of dogs trained in the detection of criminal suspects and substances is growing .
But dogs are n't the only tool envisioned for the future .
The Home Office is known to have funded at least one study into the feasibility of releasing swarms of trained bees to search out target odours .
The US has similar plans for moths , bees , wasps and cockroaches , and Russia has cross - bred jackals with dogs for an enhanced sense of smell .
Even yeast has been genetically manipulated to react to molecules of interest to the security services .
Companies across the globe are designing and touting " electronic noses " , machines that seek to mimic the mammalian sensory apparatus , in an attempt to satisfy new security demands .
" Headspace " ( a term borrowed from the beat generation , where it connoted psychological privacy ) is the technical term for the area surrounding an object or person in which their odour can be analysed .
But odour detection is not limited to the discovery of drugs and explosives .
Scientists and electronic nose entrepreneurs claim headspace analysis can reveal everything from the substances people have been in contact with and their emotional state , to their personal identity and ethnic origin .
Although the science behind this field is nascent and the scientific validity of such claims is hotly disputed , they are gaining in stature .
Researchers believe the unique smell that we each emit is tied to the makeup of the major histocompatibility complex , a group of genes found on the surface of T - cells that are crucial to the immune system .
Several police dog handlers attribute their dogs ' knack for identifying criminals to an ability to detect the scent of fear emitted by the guilty , and a synthesised version of this scent is available as a training aid .
Scientists are undertaking research into how potential aggressors - or even , for instance , people with schizophrenia - might be identified by the odours they emit .
In the 90s an electronic nose company based in the UK was approached by the South African police for the " odour signature " of black people .
A company representative told me they refused to supply it , but could have done .
He said that ethnic signatures are quickly obtainable by finding patterns between the molecules present in the headspace of different ethnic groups .
He added that his electronic nose had already been trained to detect at what stage a woman was in her menstrual cycle , " just by sniffing her from the other side of the room " .
Once referred to as the " neglected sense " , the science of olfaction is experiencing a resurgence of interest and researchers predict that , in the near future , our knowledge of it will rival that of the visual sciences .
Biologist Lyall Watson outlines the pivotal role played by the olfactory system in his book Jacobson 's Organ and the Remarkable Sense of Smell : " There is a general and universal system of chemical communication in which all living things are involved .
The result is a coordinated ecological mechanism for the regulation of who goes where , and how many can afford to do so . "
The security services want to tap into this primordial information , then exchange and use it in border controls and the wars on crime , terrorism and antisocial behaviour .
Watson predicts that a heightened olfactory consciousness will enable us to " get to know who the good guys are " .
The security services seem to think the science of olfaction is already sufficiently advanced to enable them to do this .
Last summer , Der Spiegel magazine revealed that the German police had been collecting human scents from political activists to enable their dogs to trace persons they believed might try to violently disrupt the G8 summit .
China has established a " scent bank " of odours sampled from criminal suspects and crime scenes .
According to a document leaked to the Observer , GCHQ , the British intelligence agency , has been evaluating the merits of odour as a means of personal identification .
Common law jurisdictions across the world are struggling to come to terms with this sensory mutation of police searches and interrogations .
The case law is strewn with conflicting decisions on the extent to which olfactory surveillance requires regulation .
So far , New South Wales in Australia is the only state to have put it on a statutory footing .
The Law Enforcement ( Powers and Responsibilities )
Act 2002 specifies the limited circumstances in which drug detection dogs can be used and requires regular parliamentary review of the exercise of these powers .
The supreme court of South Australia dismissed the argument that a dog " sniff " is an invasion of privacy on the basis that odours emitted from a person are routinely exposed to the perception of the public at large .
But this reasoning ignores the fact that odour detection " tools " - such as trained dogs and electronic noses - enable the police to perceive information beyond the range of the human senses , placing them firmly within the category of " new surveillance " techniques first identified as a threat to legal regulators by Gary Marx , professor emeritus of sociology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
According to Marx , in extending the senses , new surveillance " challenges fundamental assumptions about personal and social borders that have been maintained not only by values and norms and social organisation but by the limits of technology to cross them " .
The threat is obvious : these new methods promise to render traditional investigatory techniques obsolete .
The New South Wales supreme court refused a request in 2001 to regulate olfactory surveillance on the basis that a dog's nose is no more than " an extension of the police officer " .
But this is a dangerous argument that ignores the privacy issues linked with the expanding range of information sought by olfactory surveillance , as well as the invasive threat of other technologies under development .
We are right to fear the new surveillance , even when we have nothing to hide , because it reaches beyond the rule of law , stripping us of our privacy ( the right to determine the extent to which we release personal information about ourselves ) and leaving us vulnerable to arbitrary state interference .
In 2001 , the US supreme court recognised this new threat to privacy .
In Kyllo v United States , the police had aimed a thermal - imaging device at Danny Kyllo 's residence to detect heat emanations associated with high - powered marijuana grow - lamps .
The court held that when the police obtain by sense - enhancing technology any information regarding the interior of a home that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion , it constitutes a search .
The court observed that this would ensure preservation of that degree of privacy and protection from government intrusion that existed when the US constitution was drafted .
Justice Souter has since stated that " if constitutional scrutiny is in order for the imager , it is in order for the dog " .
In Britain , there has yet to be any challenge to the legality of sniffer dog operations .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) is adamant that a sniff does not amount to a search and that an indication from a trained dog amounts to reasonable grounds of suspicion for a stop and search .
Acpo reasons that because the dog is deployed to " scent the air surrounding an individual person " and indicate the presence of the smell " in the close vicinity of an individual " no search of the person takes place .
In this way , Acpo distances the subject from the source of the scent , to justify its denial that the sniff amounts to a search - and then re-links the subject to the scent to justify a tactile search .
Acpo guidance on the use of sniffer dogs concedes that a police - dog sniff could amount to a search if a person is " funnelled " past the dogs .
The guidance clearly states that the police should not funnel people past a sniffer dog because officers have no powers to insist that a member of the public submit to a dog sniff .
But commuters , confronted with police dogs at the top of escalators , are faced with little choice on exiting a station .
" We do n't have any power to tell people to walk past the dog , " one senior dog handler conceded .
" But we can take advantage of the natural environment . "
Officers treat attempts to evade a dog as grounds of reasonable suspicion for a stop and search .
Smell has historical associations with sin , which may explain why some people find the experience of being sniffed by a police dog offensive .
The devil has often been described as identifiable by his " sulphurous stink " .
In the late 1500s , odour was used to identify witches in Europe .
Odour remains a deeply personal attribute , which most of us seek to disguise .
Patrick Süskind sums up the accusatory nature of a nasal interrogation in his novel Perfume : " All at once he felt as if he stank ...
The child seemed to be smelling right through his skin , into his innards .
His most tender emotions , his filthiest thoughts lay exposed to that greedy little nose ... "
The suspicion generated by an alert from a sniffer dog is difficult to dissipate , as the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann and the supposed " scent of death " illustrates .
Three months after Madeleine 's disappearance , dog handler Martin Grime ( then working for South Yorkshire police , now for Jersey police on a freelance basis in the search for human remains at Haut de la Garenne ) flew out to Portugal to help review case evidence .
He was accompanied by his " advanced dog " Eddie .
Up until then , corpse - detection dogs had only ever been used in this country to help the police to locate human remains .
Eddie the dog reportedly reacted to Mrs McCann 's clothing .
Almost overnight , the McCanns turned from victims into suspects , and the crowds who had surrounded them in support began to boo and jeer at them in the street .
Seemingly as a result of the dog's reactions , the Portuguese police made the McCanns official suspects .
However , the accuracy of sniffer dogs is hugely exaggerated in the popular consciousness .
Even the courts in England and Wales appear to have taken the reliability of the dog for granted .
In Devon in 1999 , the police were called to a house because a slice of fruitcake had been stolen from it .
The police attended with a dog .
The dog sniffed around the kitchen area and then appeared to follow a track 100 m away from the house .
The dog stopped and indicated at an abandoned car , in which a homeless man was sleeping .
No fruitcake crumbs were found on the man or in the car .
The man was interviewed and denied involvement .
He said he had been sleeping rough in a barn .
It was cold and he had found the car unlocked .
He was convicted on the basis of the dog indication and inferences from his decision not to give evidence in court .
In 2000 the Court of Appeal upheld his conviction for burglary .
In the US , scent line - ups are used .
People have been convicted of robbery , rape , and even murder when the primary evidence against them is , in effect , a bark .
In fact , remarkably little is yet known about how the sense of smell works and there is a shocking shortage of reliable empirical research on the accuracy of detection dogs .
The only substantial body of research was conducted in Australia .
The Privacy Ombudsman of New South Wales reported its review on the use of drug- detection dogs to parliament in 2006 .
His research revealed that 74 % of those searched following an indication by a dog were found not to be in possession of illegal drugs .
This statistic adds weight to Justice Souter 's statement that the " infallible dog " is a " legal fiction " .
While many police dog handlers appear to hold a genuine belief in the " magic powers " of the dog ( Russell Lee Ebersole was convicted of fraud for selling police officers in the US dogs said to be able to indicate which substances they were detecting by pointing their noses at letters of the alphabet ) , others are even more sanguine .
A senior police dog handler told me that the dog's heightened olfactory sensitivity is not its only asset : " Admissions flow out of people indicated like a gush of air - they 're so relieved not to have anything on them . "
A police sergeant who has received national recognition for his drug work laughs at the exaggerated portrayal of drug dogs ' abilities in the street addict 's mind : " They think they can detect drugs from 300 m away ! '
For now , the principal advantage of olfactory surveillance to police forces may reside in the nose 's mysterious reputation for infallible detection .
The police and security services are constantly on the lookout for technologies that can be used to justify hunches , coerce suspects into confessing and legitimise the use of force with something that can be labelled intelligence .
Right now , smell fits the bill .

After two months of downtime , it is still uncertain whether Demonoid will ever return .
However , if it is up to The Pirate Bay , it will .
The Pirate Bay has recently offered 2 servers to the Demonoid team , in Sweden of course .
Will Demonoid ever return ?
That was the question we asked last December .
There was some hope for the thousands of Demonoid users when Deimos , the founder of the site , said that he was looking for a new location to host the popular BitTorrent tracker .
He said : “ Money is an issue , but the real problem at the moment is finding a suitable place to host the website .
There has been no luck there .
And there ’s some personal stuff I need to take care of that takes most of my time at the moment , and that does not help . ”
It now seems that there ’s some good news for Deimos as The Pirate Bay is offering their help .
In fact , they claim to have two servers lined up for Demonoid already .
Pirate Bay ’s Brokep made this public in a recent interview on the Subdemon techcast where he said : “ We tried to contact the guys behind Demonoid and we ’ve set up a tracker for them but they have n’t responded .
But , we have two servers running for them if they want to set it up . ”
Brokep also says that he has n’t heard back from Deimos yet , but it sure is a great gesture .
If Demonoid decides to take them up on their offer they will not be alone .
In 2007 quite a lot of torrent sites moved to Sweden , and to PRQ in particular .
Sweden is considered to be a safe haven for BitTorrent sites , and PRQ is popular because it is owned by TiAMO and Anakata , two of the founders of The Pirate Bay .
Ironically , however , The Pirate Bay is not hosted in Sweden or at PRQ , which is probably a wise decision .
In the remainder of the interview Brokep and the interviewers discuss some of the recent news surrounding The Pirate Bay , such as the huge pile of paperwork they received last month , the new protocol they have been developing , and the explosive growth of their tracker .
It is definitely worth listening to , and I ’m looking forward to the next episodes of this podcast , and to more news surrounding Demonoid .
You can download the podcast , including the interview here , or stream ( might be buggy ) the torrent and listen to it right away , with Bitlet .
The prosecutor 's case began to unravel when he turned his attack to the tea light - candle headlights .
Up until that point , Daniel Lerner had argued that the car in question was unsafe because of its dangerous braking system .
Granted , classifying the hollowed - out Buick a car is a bit of a stretch .
It 's actually a piece of art made to look like a car by Montreal artist Michel de Broin .
More than anything , it 's a four - seater bicycle , propelled entirely by pedalling .
At top speed , the Buick can hit 15 km/h .
It has no floor .
No engine .
No transmission .
No signal lights .
And as mentioned , tea lights sit in place of light bulbs at the front .
" What would happen , " Lerner charged with pointed conviction , " if a lit candle hit another car ? "
As the small courtroom in Old City Hall erupted in giggles , Lerner withdrew his question .
Now it was legal adviser Terry Fox 's turn .
Fox , with the Canadian Automobile Association , decided to take on the case pro bono for the group of artists .
" After all , I 'm the one that advised them they could drive it in the first place , " Fox said earlier .
" I thought the least I could do was come down here and back up my advice . "
" Shared Propulsion Car " had been put on exhibit at the Mercer Union Centre for Contemporary Art on Oct. 24 .
The next day , a group was planning to take it for a ride down Queen St. W. That 's when Larry Zack , a fan of the gallery , thought he would find out if it was actually legal to take on city streets .
He called an acquaintance at the Canadian Automobile Association , Fox .
" After getting the details I told them not to drive at night , because of the headlights , not to go on the 401 or the DVP , use hand signals , and it should be fine , " Fox said .
But within the hour , the group had been pulled over .
Const .
Derek Walsh testified he was driving westbound on Queen St. when a motorist flagged him down to say an illegal pedal car was heading his way .
" Not even close to being legal , " was among Walsh 's first comments to driver Dean Baldwin , a Toronto artist .
He handed him a ticket for operating an unsafe vehicle .
Baldwin and a score of others were happy to take it to court .
" Either way , we 're happy the conversation about the car continues , " Baldwin said before his traffic court trial began .
On the stand , the Crown asked Walsh about the brakes , which are traditional bike hand brakes .
The left cyclers control the left side ; ditto for the pair on the right .
And what would happen if the left side happened to brake before the right , Lerner asked Walsh .
" It would cause friction on the road , causing that side to anchor ( and the other ) side to pivot around , " the officer answered .
This , Walsh continued , could possibly send the car swerving into oncoming traffic .
Fox was quick to point out the car stopped without difficulty when asked to pull over .
He also argued that rickshaws – another muscle - propelled vehicle on Toronto streets – have no brakes at all and those drivers are n't targeted .

And as for tea lights ?
" The Amish used candles in their ( buggies ) " not long ago , Justice of the Peace Patrick Marum said in his judgment .
" I would agree with the defence that the Crown has not met the ( burden of proof ) at this point .
The case is dismissed . "
To celebrate , Baldwin and his group took the car , or bicycle , or whatever it is , for a drive around Bloor and Dufferin Sts .
Secret Video Reveals Natalee Holloway Confession by Van der Sloot
Dutch TV reporter Peter de Vries claims to have cracked thecase wide open .
The case had been officially closed a short while back , when Aruban authorities releasedand his brother , after acknowledging that there was no new evidence in which to make a case against the trio .
It looked as if justice would not be served in the disappearance of the high school student .
The reporter , de Vries , was compelled to do a little undercover work and spent the last few months with a hidden video camera , patiently working to get a confession from Joran Van der Sloot .
Apparently he has got the goods and has contacted Aruban authorities .
They have reopened the case in light of this new development .
The reporter had planned to go public with the video on Sunday night but was beaten to the punch by Velcomen Kut website .
They were able to tap into de Vries ' personal website and get a transcript of the tape 's contents .
He lost out on his own exclusive story , which will still air .
A transcript of his conversation with Aruban officials is available here .
Natalie Holloway 's parents are aware of this latest development , and Beth Twitty is reportedly traveling to Holland to meet with De Vries and view the tape .
She remarked afterward , " How could they have done that to Natalee ? "
Joran Van der Sloot 's American lawyer , Joseph Tacopina , expressed skepticism about the existence of a secret tape and faulted the Aruban authorities for ' acting like clowns ' with their cryptic information and leaking of details .
We have the Joran Van der Sloot confession video on another post .

New ELF linker code added to GNU binutils
From : Ian Lance Taylor < iant at google dot com >
To : binutils at sourceware dot org
Date : Fri , 21 Mar 2008 17:02:13 - 0700
Subject : New ELF linker code added to GNU binutils
I have been working on a new ELF linker for some time .
With the agreement of the main GNU binutils maintainers , I have just added it to the GNU binutils .
The new of the new linker is gold .
There are two new directories : src/gold and src/elfcpp .
Checking out binutils as usual will pick up the new directories .
To build it , configure with -- enable - gold .
You will then get gold instead of the usual GNU ld. gold is written in C ++.
It is likely that it only works with gcc version 4.0 or later .
I would be happy to apply simple compatibility patches for earlier versions .
gold only supports ELF targets such as GNU / Linux and other free operating systems .
gold does not support Windows .
There is no expectation that gold will ever support anything other than ELF targets .
At the moment gold only supports x86 and x86_64 targets .
It is designed for portability , and we expect to add support for more targets in the future .
At the moment gold has only one significant advantage over the existing linker : it is faster .
On large C++ programs , I have measured it as running five times faster .
At this time gold should be considered as beta quality software .
It has had quite a bit of testing inside Google .
However , it has not been widely tested in other environments .
For most normal use cases I expect it to work correctly .
However , I have been told that it has problems building the Linux kernel , in that a kernel linked with gold does not boot .
I hope that people will be able to help identify and resolve this problem .
gold does not yet have any internal documentation .
I plan to work on that .
gold does not yet have a manual .
For now the GNU linker manual should be accurate for those features which gold supports -- which is to say , many of them but not all of them .
I have added gold to the binutils with development history .
This will have the odd effect that if you check out the binutils as of a given date you will see gold sources from that date , even for times when gold was not part of the binutils .
However , check outs of old release tags will still pick up only the correct sources .
I would be happy to receive any feedback .

Justices David H. Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer dissented .
Justice Souter , in an opinion joined by Justice Ginsburg , said the Indiana law , which calls for a government - issued photo identification , like a driver ’s license or passport , “ threatens to impose nontrivial burdens on the voting rights of tens of thousands of the state ’s citizens . ”
Some Democrats have complained that those who succeeded in passing the law and fought on its behalf were citing problems that did not exist , because prosecutions for impersonating a registered voter are exceedingly rare , or non-existent .
The real motivation of those behind the law was to hamper Democrats , those foes of the law have argued .
“ This decision is a body blow to what America stands for  equal access to the polls , ” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , who leads the Democrats ’ Senate election efforts .
Other Democrats offered similar expressions of dismay .
Ken Falk , legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana , which brought the case , told The Associated Press that he was “ extremely disappointed . ”
But Brian C. Bosma , who was speaker of the Indiana House when the law was enacted and is now the House ’s Republican leader , dismissed the Democrats ’ complaints .
“ This is only a burden for those who want to vote more than once , ” Mr. Bosma said in a telephone interview from Indianapolis .
“ It protects everyone . ”
When the case was argued before the Supreme Court in January , there was considerable back - and - forth over how much of a burden the Indiana law could be in an age when an overwhelming majority of people old enough to vote also possess a driver ’s license or other form of photo identification .
There was also discussion over how much voter fraud really exists , with some suggestions that the reason it has apparently never been prosecuted in Indiana is because those who commit fraud are good at it .
But , as Justice Stevens noted , there have been flagrant examples of voter fraud in American history .
He cited the 1868 New York City elections , in which a local tough who worked for Tammany ’s William ( Boss ) Tweed explained why he liked voters to have whiskers :
“ When you ’ve voted ’em with their whiskers on , you take ’em to a barber and scrape off the chin fringe .
Then you vote ’em again with the side lilacs and a mustache .
Then to a barber again , off comes the sides and you vote ’em a third time with the mustache .
If that ai n’t enough and the box can stand a few more ballots , clean off the mustache and vote ’em plain face . ”
Henry Waxman , the most dogged of congressional committee chairmen , has been described by Republicans as ' the scariest man in Washington ' .
Since the Democrats took control of the House and Senate in January , he has been in overdrive , launching inquiries into issues ranging from global warming to White House emails , and the one that concerns the congressman most - Iraq .
Nancy Pelosi , the House speaker , is the public face of the new Democrat - led Congress , but Mr Waxman is the embodiment of the pent - up release of Democratic energy , determined to harry George Bush in his last two years in office .
The Bush administration is feeling the squeeze , from the White House to the Pentagon , state department and various federal organisations .
Mr Waxman is currently waiting for the response from the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , on whether she will give evidence about the run-up to the war in Iraq .
He issued a subpoena last month demanding her presence before his committee and , though she has hinted she will not attend , he seems confident that she will .
In an interview in his office overlooking Congress , he said his main concern is to discover why Mr Bush took the country to war .
The issue has been churned over by journalists , by books from insiders and in reports but Mr Waxman does not feel anyone has yet got to the heart of the matter .
" We have gone to war , lost thousands of people - Americans , British , many more Iraqis - and spent billions of dollars .
The whole of the Middle East is in turmoil ... it is hard to know where you are going if you do not know how you got there . "
He is aware of the label " the scariest man in Washington " and says he is amused rather than proud of it .
" I do not think of myself as scary .
I think people who are frightened are not frightened of me but of things they have done , the questions they do not want answered . "
Mr Waxman is investigating why Mr Bush , in his state of the union address in 2003 , only months before the invasion , cited British intelligence saying that Iraq had tried to secure uranium from Niger for use in a nuclear weapons programme .
" This issue is important to me .
I voted for authorisation to go to war in Iraq on the claim that Saddam Hussein was developing nuclear weapons .
I found out that before the war began , the CIA knew that claim was based on forgeries .
We wrote to Bush and said ' Did [ the CIA ] ever tell the administration ?
If they did not , that would be maladministration . "
He is not planning to call any British government officials to give evidence .
The UK has never formally admitted that MI6 was wrong but privately acknowledges the information was untrue while insisting it was put together in good faith .
What matters to Mr Waxman is not that the intelligence was wrong and that the CIA had concluded it was wrong , but why Mr Bush chose to cite British intelligence in his speech .
" To say British intelligence provided information was almost a way of being technically accurate but attempting to deceive , " he said .
That is why he wants Ms Rice , who was national security adviser at the time , to give evidence .
The CIA said that it told the White House that the British information was wrong , but she says she either did not see that or cannot remember seeing it .
He is investigating other aspects of the war too , from postwar reconstruction , and in particular the role of the US conglomerate Halliburton , to battlefield misinformation .
As part of the latter , Private Jessica Lynch gave evidence to his committee last month that the Pentagon had misrepresented her as a heroine .
The committee inquiry is also looking into the death of Pat Tillman , an American football player who turned down a lucrative contract to go to war in Afghanistan .
The Pentagon initially said he had died in heroic action against the Taliban , but it turned out he was killed by friendly fire .
" The administration made up a wholly fictious story , " Mr Waxman said .
Asked about the Bush administration 's reputation as one of the most secretive - or dishonest - in US history , he said they had " at certain times come up with statements that turned out to be untrue and they must have known to be untrue , but I do not want to brand them as dishonest per se .
I feel confident they have been the most secretive , even more than Richard Nixon . "
Mr Waxman feels that the Republicans , who had control of both the House and the Senate during the first six years of the Bush administration , failed in their constitutional duty to hold the administration to account and contrasted the way in which they pursued Bill Clinton when he was in power .
He said that when he issued his subpoena for Ms Rice and two others , a Republican complained it was like living in a Stalinist country .
Mr Waxman said that the Republicans had issued 1,000 subpoenas when Mr Clinton was in power .
He denied he was being similarly partisan , saying that such scrutiny was a necessary part of the checks and balances of the US system and that he wants to get more information on the record .
" People want the truth , " he said .
College student Jason Rae has become a Wisconsin celebrity .
News reports have him fielding a call from ex-President Clinton and breakfasting with Chelsea .
He also has chatted with Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts , an Obama backer .
Not bad for a 21 - year - old who has never voted in a presidential election .
Rae is a momentary superstar because he is a superdelegate , part of an elite 800 - member club that , in the likely event that neither candidate can drum up the 2,025 pledged delegates needed to win , would choose the Democratic presidential nominee .
With Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton nearly in a dead heat , this assortment of Congress members , Democratic governors and party leaders has suddenly become a focus of the two campaigns .
The bad news for Democratic voters is that many superdelegates are jumping the gun and making up their minds about which candidate to back , so the candidate with the most votes may not win the nomination .
That would be a tremendous mistake .
The system of superdelegates , created after the 1980 election , gives roughly seven - millionths of the Democratic Party 20 % of the vote at the convention .
It was put in place after party leaders felt sidelined by earlier rules changes that had returned the bulk of nominating power to voters .
What they hoped to avoid was another fiasco like the nomination of George McGovern in 1972 .
The ultra-liberal wing of the party ensured he won the primary vote , but in the general election he carried only a single state , Massachusetts .
Yet 1972 was a long time ago , and the superdelegate system is showing signs of wear .
It ’s too late to tinker with it for this election , but there are ample reasons for these special delegates to hold back and avoid anointing a winner while voters are still doing their part .
Here ’s a consideration for them to ponder .
Which wing of party stalwarts can superdelegates afford to alienate by backing one candidate prematurely ?
Moderate to liberal men , who back Obama ?
White women , who back Clinton ?
Do you drive away Obama ’s supporters in the African American community , or Clinton ’s in the Latino community ?
Advertisement
The best function of superdelegates would be to legitimize a candidate who already had won the majority of Democratic delegates .
That ’s what happened in 1984 , when Walter Mondale had a narrow lead over Gary Hart going into the convention and the superdelegates backed the former vice president .
Although this page firmly supports Obama , the Democrats have two worthy choices and do not need party bigwigs to decide for them .
For the bulk of the superdelegates to commit now would be not only unnecessary , it would be undemocratic .
You 're probably not going to live to see an electric 747 landing at O'Hare , but a growing number of aeronautical engineers believe electric airplanes are the future of general aviation .
They may be right .
These engineers work at places like NASA and say the battery and fuel cell technology that is pushing automobiles beyond internal combustion will do the same for light aircraft .
One company leading the way is Pipistrel and its Taurus Electro , which uses a 30 kilowatt motor to take off then glides silently on air currents .
It 's already received a dozen orders for the plane and plans to begin delivering them by year 's end .
" We have this technology , " says Tine Tomazic , the company 's test pilot .
" It 's here now . "
Electric aircraft trace their history to 1884 and the La France , a dirigible powered by chromium - chloride batteries and 7.5 - horsepower motor .
It flew five miles in 23 minutes to become the first airship to take off and land from the same point .
Ninety - six years later , the solar - electric Gossamer Penguin made its first flight on Aug. 7 , 1980 .
Solar Challenger flew 163 miles from Paris , France to Dover , England in 5 hours and 23 minutes about a year later .
Solar panels gave way to the first manned battery - electric flight on July 16 , 2006 , when students at Tokyo Institute of Technology built an airplane powered by 160 AA batteries .
It flew almost 1,300 feet in 59 seconds .
Last month , Boeing successfully tested a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell - lithium ion battery airplane .
The plane flew for 20 minutes using power generated by fuel cells alone .
The Taurus Electra mates an electric motor to a glider with a 48 - foot wingspan .
The lithium - polymer battery pack weighs 101 pounds and provides enough power to climb to 6,000 feet at a climb rate of 560 feet per minute .
Pipistrel CEO Ivo
Boscarol says the battery pack recharges about as quickly as a cell phone and the Taurus Electro offers the same performance as the gasoline - powered Taurus .
It will sell for around $ 100,000 .
Pipistrel spent 1 million Euros ( about $ 1.5 million at today 's exchange rate ) developing the Taurus Electro ; the European Union contributed about one - third that amount to the project .
The engineers , pilots and academics who attended the Electric Aircraft Symposium in San Francisco say advancements in battery technology , composite materials and electric motors will make electric airplanes like the
Taurus Electro increasingly common .
AC Propulsion , for example , is developing an 15 kilowatt motor that is 17 inches in diameter and weighs 18 pounds ; it hopes to see the motors used in the Solar Impulse solar - electric airplane that will attempt to fly for 36 hours straight sometime next year .
Mark Moore , an engineer at NASA Langley Research Center , says electric motors offer many benefits over internal combustion , including zero emissions , greater efficiency and improved reliability .
This allows " all kinds of freedom of design " and " new and exciting possibilities . "
There are still some bugs to be worked out , not the least of which is the limited range afforded by current battery technology .
Greg Cole , an engineer and designer at Windward Performance , says even the best batteries do n't offer more than one hour of flight time , but he expects that to double within five years .
Hydrogen fuel cells are another possibility for extended range , although they remain fairly far over the horizon .
Electric aircraft advocates say two things will spur innovation and help bring electric aircraft to general aviation .
The first is a proposed " Green Prize " competition by the CAFE Foundation to reward the first airplane capable of 100 mph and the equivalent of 100 mpg .
The second is the Experimental Aircraft Association 's request that the Federal Aviation Administration to allow the use of electric motors in ultralight and light sport aircraft .
“ The EAA community is committed to this direction , ” said engineer and lifetime EAA member Craig Willen .
" Man can and will develop electric propulsion for flight . "

The Big Importance of Brakes
Perhaps even more important than making your car fast , is making your car stop .
Modifying a car always starts with increasing horsepower and torque .
And then to handle the added muscle , we proceed to upgrade the suspension with more capable shocks and beefier springs .
A wheel and tire package comes next for more contact patch .
By now , we may have made Tracy Chapman ’s Fast Car .
But then to make a turn so we wo n’t fall off a cliff , we need to upgrade the car ’s brakes .
And brakes are n’t just essential for our fast road cars , it is also a very important part of racing .
Drag cars need strong brakes to not end up in a tree .
Formula 1 even uses carbon fiber brakes to make sure the cars stop properly before taking the fast , sweeping chicanes at Imola .
Bigger is Better !
The ideology that comes with “ bigger is better ” is n’t always accurate .
Unless you have a wonderful chassis and suspension setup , bigger wheels and small tires will always result in a harsh ride .
A large capacity engine might give you all the power that you need but it is very heavy and very thirsty .
On the contrary , this idea might be accurate on a car ’s braking system .
Big cross - drilled brake rotors are more effective in stopping your modified car especially when paired with multi-piston calipers and big brake pads .
However , to have a more effective braking power , you need a more capable master cylinder and stronger steel - braided brake lines .
Mind you , because of small - ish wheels , Formula 1 cars only have 12 - or 13 - inch rotors .
Tiny , yes , but made of carbon fiber which makes it cost more than a fully - optioned Ford Mustang Bullitt – and that ’s only one disc .
So Formula 1 brakes are big … in cost .
The Need for Speed … and Heat
Because we have established that fast cars need big brakes , the next gremlin we are about to tackle is heat .
As you probably know , most automotive braking systems use the friction of pads squeezed onto a rotor to slow the vehicle down .
While this design works is really how brakes are supposed to work , it effectively turns all that rotational energy into heat .
Heat tends to break things .
Most OEM brake systems are designed to deal with the heat from braking on the street and maybe a tiny bit of track usage , but they can quickly heat up to the point of becoming ineffective .
We call this brake fade .
The heat is spread across the pad and the rotor , which means size changes how the system absorbs the heat .
A larger rotor can absorb more heat than a smaller rotor , and the same goes for pads .
The reason race cars use massive rotors is to deal with the insane amounts of heat more consistently braking very hard .
As we have established earlier , when it comes to brake rotors , calipers , and pads , bigger is – and this ca n’t be argued – better .
When Should I Upgrade to Big Brakes ?
There is not a definitive answer to this question , as every vehicle and owner is different , but there are some situations where a big brake kit could be considered necessary .
If you plan on going to the track , chances are your stock brakes will not be able to keep up with the demand , so a big brake kit is a good idea .
For AutoX racing , the racing is pretty short , so a big brake kit is not necessary , but is a good idea .
If you are towing a lot , a big brake kit can be a good idea , as the adding weight will force your brake to work harder , even with the trailer brakes set up properly .
For street use , OEM brakes are fine as long as you have n’t massively increased power .
Once you increase power , you will also be increasing the speeds , meaning your brakes need to work harder .
Depending on how hard you drive , a big brake kit may be needed even on the streets .

Sammamish , WA Pictor Guy Member Cable cost and service life ?
So if glass fiber makes up 30 % of the install cost what will plastic fiber reduce that to ?
And what is the service life for plastic vs. glass .
I would think that if you 're hanging the fiber then plastic may be a good alternative but if you have to bury it then lower initial cost may not make up for lower service life of a plastic cable .

Eye Safety
Optical sources used in fiber optics , especially LEDs used in premises networks , are of much lower power levels than used for laser surgery or cutting materials .
Even the output of OTDRs , WDM and fiber amplifier systems , which are much higher than LED systems , are still well below that used in laser surgery or machining .
The light that exits an optical fiber is also spreading out in a cone , so the farther away from the end of the fiber your eye is , the lower the amount of power your eye receives .
If you are using a microscope , which can efficiently focus all the light into your eye , it should have infrared filters to reduce the danger of invisible infrared light .
The infrared light in fiber optic links is at a wavelength that cannot penetrate your eye easily because it 's absorbed by the water in your eyeball .
Light in the 1300 - 1550 nm range is unlikely to damage your retina , but might harm the cornea or lens .
A typical laser pointer , which has a beam that is collimated ( not expanding ) , and is at visible wavelength ( 650 nm ) where the eye is transparent , is probably more danger to the retina than a fiber optic link .
That being said , it 's not a good idea to look into a fiber unless you know no source is being transmitted down it .
Since the light is infrared , you can't see it , which means you cannot tell if there is light present by looking at it .
You should always check the fiber with a power meter before examining it .
The real issue of eye safety is getting fiber scraps into the eye .
As part of the termination and splicing process , you will be continually exposed to small scraps of bare fiber , cleaved off the ends of the fibers being terminated or spliced .
These scraps are very dangerous .
If they get into your eyes , they are very hard to flush out and will probably lead to a trip to the emergency room at the hospital .
Whenever you are working with fiber , wear safety glasses !
When most people think of safety in fiber optic installations , the first thing that comes to mind is eye damage from laser light in the fiber .
They have an image of a laser burning holes in metal or perhaps burning off warts .
While these images may be real for their applications , they have little relevance to most types of fiber optic communications .
Eye safety is an issue , but usually not from light in the fiber .
However , fiber optics installation is not without risks .
Eye SafetyOptical sources used in fiber optics , especially LEDs used in premises networks , are of much lower power levels than used for laser surgery or cutting materials .

Seriously though , there 's no longer a need to turn down circuits anymore with our the new scope we just got at work .
It 's this neat little USB unit that hooks right into your laptop , which gives you get a nice full screen ( live ) view of the fiber .
The scope does n't mind if the fiber is lit or not .
It even has this sweet feature where it will analyze any contaminants it sees and then tell you their size and a best guess of what they are .
Sure beats having to kill the circuit , use a light meter to confirm the fiber is dark , and then hold a bulky monocular - type scope up to your eye while trying to focus the darn thing !
Ah , technology .

I think the big deal is having odd loop lengths ... usually fiber optic cables have to be of a certain length to actually work .. usually cutting it with a pair of scissors is a big no - no especially if your over or under the spec for loop lengths .. they measure and deploy cables after they measure the distance it needs to run ( and spool up the slack ) -- if they can cut and paste anywhere , that would save loads of time , I guess .

usually fiber optic cables have to be of a certain length to actually work ..
And I 've never heard anyone say , " That cable needs to be X.X meters long or this circuit is n't going to work . "
Now , if you go beyond the length that is necessary for a certain transceiver , then yes , the circuit may not work or have errors .
But there is no " certain " length a fiber must be , it is usually , an " up to " length .
And if you have long reach transceivers that would overpower on a short fiber , then you just add attenuators to reduce the light getting through .
Usually ?
I would say rarely , if ever with technology from the last 10 years at least .
I 've never had to use a certain length fiber to have a circuit work .
I use 1 meter up to 100 meter lengths between identical transceivers .

The old kits use to require a large roll - a- round card and was clumsy .
But the newest kit we got is about the size of deskphone and is as simple as 1 , 2 3 and your done .
Thing with plastic is the chance of getting deformity from the plastic not mixing / drying while it 's being formed is greater then glass , therefore , quality control is n't something to ignore .

Programming platform experience is like knowing your way around the kitchen .
Where are the knives , what size plates do we have , and what spices are available .
It ’s very useful for getting things done without having to search high and low for every little thing .
But it ’s also an asset with a cut - off point of diminished returns .
Once you have a reasonably good idea where things are , it ’s no longer the bottleneck in your culinary performance .
Like chefs , like programmers .
Peopleware quotes a study that six months seemed to be the cut - off point for programmers .
Once they had six months under their belt , the platform knowledge was no longer the bottleneck in their abilities .
That sounds about right to me .
That ’s how I felt it going to Ruby .
In the beginning , I would constantly be looking things up .
Trying to internalize the idioms and not merely convert previous patterns to new syntax .
But after about six months of exposure , I knew where things were .
What tools to reach for .
Yes , I kept on learning ( and still do ) , but the difference between now and then is not all that dramatic .
Which leads me to my point : Requiring X years of experience on platform Y in your job posting is , well , ignorant .
As long as applicants have 6 months to a year of experience , consider it a moot point for comparison .
Focus on other things instead that ’ll make much more of a difference .
Platform experience is merely a baseline , not a differentiator of real importance .
In turn that means you as an applicant can use requirements like “ 3 - 5 years doing this technology ” as a gauge of how clued - in the company hiring is .
The higher their requirements for years of service in a given technology , the more likely that they ’re looking for all the wrong things in their applicants , and thus likely that the rest of the team will be stooges picked for the wrong reasons .

According to a Circuit City employee in Chicago , the consumer electronics chain is trading in HD DVD players bought into their stores " within 3 months of the announcement , " as opposed to their 30 - day return policy .
According to the internal memo announcing the demise of the format , they will either give customers a Blu-ray player — paying the price difference , if any — or a gift card .
The trade - in , however , will not be widely promoted and it will be only made available if the customer asks for it .
Have any of you tried this ?

When I mentioned awhile ago that the announcement of Hello Kitty Wold Order pro wresting was a sure sign the apocalypse was now upon us , little did I realize what an understatement that would be as these photos will show :
Not only is this wrong in so many ways , people actually paid to see this .
You know that Sanrio has confidence that nothing can ever defeat them when they are willing to let Hello Kitty be represented as some random white guy with a pot belly in a pink costume which just confirms that Hello Kitty
Hell will always get worse than you could ever imagine …

On December 7th of last year Something Awful made history by breaking with its long tradition of political neutrality to endorse Democratic Senator Christopher J. Dodd for President of the United States .
Dodd dropped out of the race less than a month after securing our prestigious endorsement .
It was a hard - fought campaign , but after garnering a respectable .02 % of the vote in the Iowa caucuses Dodd decided to withdraw his candidacy .
We were sad to see our chosen candidate bow out of the race .
With the 22 - state February 5th primary just a day away , we feel it is time to endorse another candidate from the remaining pool of viable contenders .
On the Republican side , Senator John McCain received consideration from our editorial board , but we ultimately decided that even though he would make a great resident of the White House , we prefer our veterans to physically and mentally disintegrate hidden away beneath highway overpasses .
Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney also received some consideration from our editorial board .
He comes so close to the American ideal of a presidential candidate that if he were a GI Joe he would be codenamed " Head of State " or possibly just " Veto . "
Romney asks the difficult questions of our time and enthusiastically embraces democracy by shifting his positions depending on polls .
Despite these qualifications , we felt that his unwillingness to embrace a trustworthy protestant religion disqualifies him .
There is also libertarian outsider Congressman Ron Paul , but despite a six - hour conference call with Congressman Paul we remain unconvinced that he is not a ghost or spirit trapped within our telephone .
If we were to elect a ghost as president we enter a constitutional gray - area in which we believe his vice president may immediately become president .
That leaves us with the Democratic candidates for president .
Of them , only two remain viable choices : Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama .
The only way to decide which of the two possessed the attributes we desire in a president was to match them up in a head - to - head competition .
In our editorial survey , on 11 out of 11 issues , it cannot be denied that Hillary Clinton comes out on top .
For this reason Something Awful is pleased to announce that we are endorsing ...
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA !!
GOOD LUCK HILLARY !!

The authorities were investigating the mysterious death on Tuesday of a young man in Queens whose face and back had been spray - painted blue by a drinking buddy , the police said .
Investigators did not immediately identify the victim , who was described as a 19 - year - old man , or his friend .
The victim ’s body , clad in boxer shorts , was found at the bottom of a flight of stairs , the police said .
It was unknown whether a fall , excessive drinking or the paint had caused or contributed to his death , investigators said .
The victim and his friend worked together at a bar on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village , the police said .
They had been drinking heavily through Monday night into Tuesday morning at the friend ’s apartment at 78- 02 86th Avenue in Woodhaven , the police said
As weird as this may sound , I mean literally reach in and touch the inside of the cow !
In case you did n’t know animals can live perfectly well with a permanent hole in their stomachs .
Scientists call these surgically made holes , fistulas , which are covered by a canulla , a sort of cover from the outside world .
They are used to test the digestibility of various cattle food , the cows are fed and as the food passes through her stomachs , scientist can just reach in and see how it is processed .
As brutal as it might look , this does n’t hurt the animals at all , it actually prolongs their life , in case of stomach disease , they can receive helping medicine directly in there .
The one thing I do n’t approve of is people sticking their hand in animals just out of curiosity , like the kid in our photo .
Sure it ’s not something you ’d call ordinary , but turning a medical procedure into a circus is n’t very ethical .

QUITO ( Reuters ) - Ecuador broke off diplomatic ties with Colombia on Monday , escalating a dispute across the Andean region that erupted after Colombian soldiers raided inside its southern neighbor to kill a guerrilla leader .
Colombia also fueled the tensions by accusing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez of funding Colombia ’s Marxist rebels -- a charge denied by the anti-U.S. president ’s government .
The three - nation crisis erupted when Colombia flew troops into Ecuador at the weekend in a bombing raid that killed a leading guerrilla commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC .
It was a major blow to Latin America ’s oldest guerrilla group .
Chavez responded by ordering troops and tanks to the border with Colombia and he warned conservative President Alvaro Uribe that a similar strike on Venezuelan soil could lead to war .
Ecuador has also sent thousands of troops to the border and took another step in the dispute on Monday .
“ The Ecuadorean government has decided to break off diplomatic relations , ” it said in a letter to Colombia ’s foreign ministry .
Colombia earlier said it found documents in the FARC camp inside Ecuador showing evidence that Chavez gave the rebels $ 300 million and that the slain commander , Raul Reyes , had ties with an official close to Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa .
Both Venezuela and Ecuador denied the allegations .
“ The government of Ecuador energetically rejects these accusations which cynically add to the hostile attitude shown in the recent violation of our sovereignty , ” Correa ’s government said .

Reyes had been involved in talks with Venezuela , France and Ecuador to win the freedom of hostages held for years in the FARC ’s jungle camps .
Chavez has brokered those talks , securing the release of six captives since the start of the year .
He called the killing of Reyes a cowardly assassination .
Latin American governments , including diplomatic heavyweight Brazil , also lined up to condemn Colombia ’s raid and demand an explanation .

A photo taken by police Monday shows suspect Josef Fritzl at an unspecified location .
Police allege he held his daughter captive for 24 years and fathered seven children with her .
( ( Police Niederoesterreich / Associated Press ) )
A 73 - year - old Austrian man confessed Monday to imprisoning his daughter in a windowless cell in his basement for 24 years and fathering seven children with her , police said .
" He admitted that he locked his daughter , who was 18 , in the cellar , repeatedly had sex with her and that he is the father of her seven children , " said Franz Polzer , head of the criminal investigations unit in the province of Lower Austria .
Polzer said the man , Josef Fritzl , who was earlier identified only as Josef F. , also confessed to tossing the body of a newborn baby boy into an incinerator when the infant died shortly after birth .
" We are being confronted with an unfathomable crime , " said Austrian Interior Minister Guentter Platter .
Hans -Heinz Lenze , a local official in the town of Amstetten , said the man 's wife " apparently had no idea " of what was going on .
She and the suspect had seven children of their own .
Drugged , imprisoned in 1984
Three of the daughter 's offspring were raised in the family home while the rest were kept hidden in the basement with their imprisoned mother .
" You have to imagine that this woman 's world [ just ] fell apart , " Lenze said .
Police said Sunday that a 42 - year - old woman , identified as Elisabeth , told them her father lured her into the basement of the family home in 1984 , and drugged and handcuffed her before imprisoning her .
Photos were released Monday showing the basement cell where the woman was held .
It included a small bathroom and a narrow passageway leading to a tiny bedroom .
Investigators say an electronic lock with a keyless entry system and a soundproof door apparently kept the woman from escaping the cell , which was constructed of reinforced concrete .
Police picked up the woman and her father on Saturday at a hospital in a nearby town , where one of the surviving children was rushed unconscious with a serious , undisclosed illness .
3 children never went outside
In her statement , Elisabeth said her father began sexually abusing her when she was 11 .

( ( Helmut Stamberg / Associated Press ) )
Her father allegedly locked her in a room in the cellar on Aug. 28 , 1984 .
The woman was reported missing the next day and a month later , a letter surfaced , allegedly written by her , saying she did n't want to be found .
Police said the woman appeared " greatly disturbed " during questioning and agreed to talk only after authorities assured her that she would no longer have contact with her father , and that her children would be cared for .
The woman and her children are undergoing psychiatric care , officials say .
Three of the children were raised upstairs in the family house by Elisabeth 's father and his wife .
They went to school and lived relatively normal lives , according to police .
The other three remained locked up in the cellar with their mother and none of them had been outside before last week .
Similar incident unearthed in 2006
Neighbours said Fritzl and his wife were quiet but friendly , and frequently shopped in local stores and talked to members of the community .
The CBC's David Common , reporting from Austria , said the story is causing shock and revulsion across the country .
" It 's a very embarrassing day for Austria , " Common said , " because this is the second time something like this has happened here . "
Natascha Kampusch was 10 years old when she was kidnapped in 1998 on her way to school in Vienna .
She was held by Wolfgang Priklopil for nearly nine years in a small dungeon in his home in the suburbs .
Hours after Kampusch escaped in August 2006 , Priklopil killed himself by jumping in front of a train .
The Indonesian government 's plan to block porn and violence websites is based on common sense , Communications and Information Minister Mohammad Nuh said .
" Nobody has reason to build a nation by disseminating pornography and violence .
I think nobody will agree to such notion , " Antara news agency Wednesday quoted the minister as saying .
According to a law passed recently by the Indonesian parliament , anybody found guilty of providing and using pornographic sites may face a maximum of three years in prison or a fine of up to 1 billion rupiah ( about 100,000 U.S. dollars ) .
The law mostly dealt with bans on the dissemination of pornography and other such contents detrimental to the public through the Internet .
The government was resolved to block obscene sites in response to public calls on the government to minimize Internet users ' access to adult content , the minister said in a press conference here on Tuesday .
" The aim is not to censor porn sites and the like but encourage the public to make optimum use of the Internet .
Therefore , positive regulations banning the dissemination of pornography are needed , " he said .
Earlier , the minister said the government planned to block all obscene sites starting April 1 .
" Admittedly , the number of Internet users in Indonesia is relatively small , reaching around 25 million .
But their number will skyrocket in May because we will provide special facilities to senior high schools across the country , " he said .
The special facilities given free of charge would lead to a drastic increase in the number of Internet users , he added .
" The special facilities will double the number of Internet users to 50 million , which is relatively small , accounting for 25 percent of the Indonesian population .
But it is 20 times as much as that of Singapore or even Malaysia , " he said .

Various courts have held that by putting something in the trash , you are relinquishing your ownership of those goods .
However , apparently that might not apply to music .
William Patry has the story on an unfortunate decision by our court system , suggesting that if you find a CD in the trash and sell it you may be charged with copyright infringement .
The story of the case is as follows : BMG famously offers a CD and DVD " club " that sends out new CDs and DVDs on a regular basis to subscribers .
Sometimes those subscribers move and cannot be found or for whatever reason the discs are determined to be " undeliverable . "
BMG so devalues its own discs that it has told the post office to throw out the undeliverable discs , rather than spend the postage to have them sent back to BMG .
The post office dumps the discs in its dumpsters -- at which point a Postal Service employee dumpster dives to rescue them .
He then goes and sells those discs to local stores , cashing in to the tune of nearly $ 80,000 .
This gets discovered , and he gets charged with mail fraud before settling on charges of copyright infringement .
However , what no one seems to clearly explain is where the infringement is ?
BMG instructed the CDs to be thrown out .
The Post Office threw them out .
At that point , the property has been relinquished by BMG and the Post Office , so it would appear that anyone who finds the discs would n't be committing any kind of infringement ( or , for that matter , fraud ) in selling them .
A lower court ruling was especially bizarre , in demanding that the guy give up all the money he earned to BMG due to the " lost opportunity " to BMG in selling the music .
As we 've discussed at length before a " lost opportunity " is not an actual loss and it's not a crime .
It 's simply a marketing challenge .
Otherwise , just about any business could be guilty of creating a " lost opportunity " for any competitor .
The pizza shop down the street creates a " lost opportunity " every time I eat there instead of the deli .
Hell , just buying one musician 's CD rather than another 's creates a " lost opportunity . "
So , it 's ridiculous to equate a " lost opportunity " to a crime -- and even worse when that " lost opportunity " was self - created by BM Gto throw out the discs .
Luckily , the Appeals Court tossed out the " lost opportunity " part , but as Patry notes , it does n't appear that anyone questioned how the facts of this case could possibly be considered copyright infringement .
Selling used CDs is considered to be perfectly legal and non-infringing .
How is selling CDs that have been thrown in the garbage any different ?

Yesterday , the California State Assembly approved a proposal to allow voters to express their opinion on the “ immediate , complete , safe and orderly withdrawal of United States forces ” from Iraq .
The bill goes back to the State Senate , which had approved a slightly different version of the bill in June .
The bill will go to the desk of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger who will decide whether to allow Californians to express their opinion on Iraq .
If he signs the bill , or lets it go into effect without his signature , the measure will appear on the February ballot along with the Presidential primary .
Schwarzenegger has tried to avoid taking a firm stance on the issue , saying he supports the troops and the war on terror but also backs a “ timetable for withdrawal . ”
A spokesman for the governor , Aaron McLear , said Schwarzenegger had not taken a position on the bill .
Please contact the Governor ’s office and urge him to allow voters to express their position on this important measure .
PS : More good news — while the Assembly was debating whether to pull out of Iraq , the Senate approved a resolution urging the president to stop sending National Guard troops to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan .
As a consultant I constantly come across organizations that are more than willing to throw millions of dollars at their information security problems .
Almost invariably this money is spent on technology : elaborate IDS / IPS deployments , expensive SEM solutions , etc .
All this , but I seldom see any real security improvement as a result of adding high - end security products .
Too often I return to customers months later to find the exact same problems .
Organizational > Technological
The failure to address security problems today is by in large caused by organizational issues , not technological limitations .
Listed below are three of the most important organizational obstacles to an effective security program :
Not Knowing What The Problem Is Many companies are n’t even aware they are being attacked .
Whether internal or external , the majority of companies with massive security issues suffer from the head in the sand problem .
And the solution is n’t , “ you need a SIM ” .
The problem is the lack of a ) motivated curiosity and b ) talent .
Technological solutions are next worthless for risk analysis , which is an essential piece of any security approach .
You do n’t start with a NAC implementation when your employees are pilliaging you from the inside using their own legitimate credentials .
You have to start with an accurate view of the issues to be addressed .
Knowing , But Not Being Allowed To Address The Problem
This one makes me sad .
Even if you have a good security team that knows what the issues are , more often than not there are major organizational obstacles to actually solving the problem .
These are the very human issues such as political battles , turf wars , managers that do n’t want to rock the boat , etc .
These issues destroy the effectiveness of more security programs than the lack of any product or technology .
Knowing You Have Issues , Having Authorization To Address
Them , But Not Knowing How
This one is also common , and is usually just a case of not having the right people in the security program .
I ’ve seen so many security groups where the people just somehow “ ended up ” in the security department .
They do n’t have any particular interest in security ( or even IT at all ) and their skills reflect this fact .
The easy answer ( and the one most companies go with ) is to hire consultants and / or outsource the whole thing .
Being a consultant this is great for me , but the better solution ( in my view ) is to clean house and get a real security team .
That takes longer , and it ’s more effort , but in my opinion it benefits the company far more in the long run .
The key thing about this list is that if you do n’t have all three things ( KET ) …
Knowledge Of What Needs To Be Done
Of What Needs To Be Done Empowerment To Make Necessary Changes
To Make Necessary Changes Talent To Execute Properly
… you ’re probably going to fail .
And it does n’t matter what whizbang super - product you bring in .
Technology helps a security team do their job more efficiently , but only if they are already doing their job .
And that ’s precisely what they ca n’t do when organizational obstacles are in the way .
That ’s why organizational issues need to be addressed with the highest priority — before adding additional expensive , superfluous technology .
Sure , if you have to spend the money , go ahead and get the products , but focus on making sure you can actually use the stuff , otherwise it might as well stay in the box . :
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. Federal Communications Commission official is seeking an inquiry into the blacking out of a politically charged segment of the CBS News magazine “ 60 Minutes ” by a local television station in Alabama .
FCC Commissioner Michael Copps said he had asked the chairman of the FCC to open an inquiry into the February 24 incident at WHNT , a CBS affiliate in Huntsville , Alabama , in which civil rights footage from the 1960s was blacked out .
“ The FCC now needs to find out if something analogous is going on here , ” Copps said at a luncheon with media watchdog groups .
“ Was this an attempt to suppress information on the public airwaves , or was it really just a technical problem ? ”
Copps is one of two Democratic appointees on the five - member FCC .
The chairman of the agency , Kevin Martin , is a Republican .
Martin responded by saying he would look into the matter but has not indicated yet whether he would issue a letter of inquiry to the station , a source close to the commission said .
The “ 60 Minutes ” segment centered on the prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , who was convicted in 2006 on charges of corruption .
The program made the case that Siegelman had been wrongly convicted on the basis of a politically motivated case built by Republican prosecutors and White House political advisor Karl Rove .
The blackout of the segment in Huntsville prompted an editorial in The New York Times the following week that raised comparisons between the WHNT incident and systematic efforts by a Mississippi TV station to suppress information about the civil rights movement during the 1960s .
WHNT denied that the blackout was politically motivated .
It said it had failed to get the segment on the air because of an equipment failure at the station that cut off the feed from CBS .
WHNT said the problem was corrected a few minutes before the end of the Siegelman segment .
In a posting on WHNT ’s Web site , the station ’s news director , Denise Vickers , said the station had been “ bombarded ” with complaints and accusations that the station had sabotaged the broadcast for political reasons .
“ But I assure everyone that the notion is patently false , ” Vickers wrote in her Web site posting .
“ Who would invite such a public relations nightmare on themselves ? ? ”
WHNT was sold along with eight other stations by The New York Times Co last year to the private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners .
Station managers requested and received permission from CBS to re-air the segment twice in the following days , Vickers said .
Copps said on Monday the FCC should move quickly to “ determine the facts ” surrounding the incident .
“ If the decision was intentional , who made the decision and why ?
The FCC needs to get to the bottom of this , ” Copps said .

A cup of black tea could be the next line of defence in the threat of bio-terrorism according to new international research .
A new study by an international team of researchers from Cardiff University and University of Maryland has revealed how the humble cup of tea could well be an antidote to Bacillus anthracis -- more commonly know as anthrax .
As a nation , Brits currently drink 165 million cups of tea , and the healing benefits of the nation 's favourite beverage have long been acknowledged .
But now the team of scientists led by Professor Les Baillie from Welsh School of Pharmacy at Cardiff University and Doctor Theresa Gallagher , Biodefense Institute , part of the Medical Biotechnology Centre of the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute in Baltimore , has found that the widely - available English Breakfast tea has the potential to inhibit the activity of anthrax , as long as it is black tea .
Anthrax - a potentially fatal human disease - is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis .
A very serious and rapidly progressing form of the disease occurs when bacterial spores are inhaled making anthrax a potent threat when used as a biological warfare agent .
Published in the March issue of the Society for Applied Microbiology 's journal Microbiologist , Professor Baillie said : " Our research sought to determine if English Breakfast tea was more effective than a commercially available American medium roast coffee at killing anthrax .
We found that special components in tea such as polyphenols have the ability to inhibit the activity of anthrax quite considerably . "
The study provides further evidence of the wide range of beneficial physiological and pharmalogical effects of this common household item .
The research also shows that the addition of whole milk to a standard cup of tea completely inhibited its antibacterial activity against anthrax .
Professor Baillie continued : " I would suggest that in the event that we are faced with a potential bio - terror attack , individuals may want to forgo their dash of milk at least until the situation is under control .
" What 's more , given the ability of tea to bring solace and steady the mind , and to inactivate Bacillus anthracis and its toxin , perhaps the Boston Tea Party was not such a good idea after all . "
Professor Les Baillie is Professor of Microbiology at Welsh School of Pharmacy .
He is also Associate Professor , Director Biodefense Initiative , Medical Biotechnology Centre , University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute in Baltimore , and Adjunct Professor in the Microbiology and Immunology Department , University of Maryland at Baltimore .
Clashes between machete - wielding mobs erupted in western Kenya on Monday after dozens were killed in weekend violence that pushed the estimated death toll since last month 's disputed presidential election to more than 800 .
Police provide armed escort for a truck being used to carry families fleeing from their neighbourhood in Naivasha on Monday because of threats by members of opposing tribes .

In the Rift Valley resort town of Naivasha , about 90 kilometres northwest of Nairobi , hundreds of people from rival tribes confronted one another on a main road .
The crowds retreated only when a handful of police between them fired live bullets into the air , the Associated Press reported .
The fighting began after President Mwai Kibaki's Dec. 27 re-election , which opposition leader Raila Odinga and his supporters say was rigged .
International and local election observers have said there were significant problems with the vote .
The violence has featured battles between armed police and protesters in the western opposition heartland and in Nairobi 's slums , as well as politically motivated clashes between rival ethnic groups .
Some 250,000 Kenyans have been forced from their homes out of fear of targeted attacks from tribes aligned with Odinga 's Luo ethnic group and reprisal attacks from Kenya 's influential Kikuyus .
Kibaki is a Kikuyu , which prompted mobs to target the president 's suspected supporters immediately after his Dec. 30 swearing - in ceremony .
At least 22 people were killed in Naivasha over the weekend , said district commissioner Katee Mwanza .
Nineteen of them were Luos whom a gang of Kikuyus chased through a slum and trapped in a shanty that they set on fire , said police commander Grace Kakai .
The others were hacked to death with machetes , a local reporter told the Associated Press .
Similar clashes were reported in Nakuru , the regional capital of the Rift Valley , where an unnamed morgue worker said 55 bodies were counted Sunday after battles between tribes broke out earlier in the week .
National police commissioner Hussein Ali told reporters in Nairobi that police had arrested 159 people in Nakuru and Naivasha " for possession of crude weapons and for suspected involvement in the murders . "
He also said 95 people were arrested in Nairobi , but gave no details .
The deaths present new challenges to former UN secretary general Kofi Annan , who is in Nairobi attempting to mediate a solution to the political crisis .
Kibaki has said he is open to direct talks with Odinga , but that his position as president is not negotiable .
Odinga says Kibaki must step down and only new elections will bring peace .
The media rushed to McCain 's side to shower him with love and affection after he told an audience that he'd be happy to stay in Iraq for 100 years .
He 's tried to say that American casulties are his bench mark .
Well sir , how many Americans do you consider expendable in Iraq ?
And how many Iraqi 's should die in the process too .
Not that they seem to matter in his mind .
Heck , it 's only their country .
Over 60 % of America believes it was a bad idea to invade them even after the Petraeus Propaganda Show .
In the latestes ABC / WaPo poll 56 % of Americans believe we should get out of Iraq even after the media blitz on " the surge . "
Do you think the United States should keep its military forces in Iraq until civil order is restored there , even if that means continued U.S. military casualties ; OR , do you think the United States should withdraw its military forces from Iraq in order to avoid further U.S. military casualties , even if that means civil order is not restored there ?
56 % withdraw 41 & Keep forces in
There 's no spin here .
Their efforts to control the message has not worked .
Vote McCain and you 'll get more of the same .
It 's that simple .

This MSNBC article notes how the price of wheat is being driven up not just by the devaluation of the dollar , but by " increased demand " for ethanol .
The article fails to mention that the demand for ethanol has not just magically increased on its own , but has increased only because massive government subsidies have made it more relatively attractive .
Nor does it mention that ethanol is also now much more attractive to farmers because it receives fat subsidies that wheat - growing does not receive .
The result has been massive distortion in the market , causing a flight from other grains into corn , producing smaller supplies and thus higher prices for the other grains such as hops and wheat .
Corn for food has become much more expensive as well , and in Mexico the price of tortillas has skyrocketed because in the North American market , corn is now being grown for ( subsidy rich ) ethanol and not for food .
On top of all of this is the fact that it takes 5 gallons of water to produce 1 gallon of ethanol .
So , the demand for water in arid western states has spiked .
This will likely impact the farmers themselves less than city dwellers ( since farmers have priority on water through comfy arrangements with governments ) , but it will likely lead to higher urban water prices and many more lectures from politicians about conserving water .
Of course , if the government were not meddling with the corn market to begin with , there would be much more water to go around , and food would be cheaper .
Ethanol has never been economical or environmentally sound , but ethanol subsidies are an easy way to buy votes .
If one ever needs proof of the latter , one need only drive through Nebraska where the many billboards and ads proclaiming the messianic power of ethanol are enough to make a believer of any politician .

What 's That Stuff ?
Contact Lenses
From Plexiglas to silicone hydrogels — the materials that let you see through to the other side
AS A KID who could barely stand eye drops , I had to struggle to muster strength to insert my first contact lens .
I was about 13 years old , needed correction only for my left eye , and had to have the lens in place for a couple of hours before an after - school check with my optometrist .
It took 30 minutes of staring myself down in the junior high school bathroom mirror to land that first lens .

More than two decades later , inserting my lenses ??? now needed for both eyes ??? happens with barely a second thought .
I have also hardly given a thought to exactly what it is that I put on my eyes every day .
Like most people , I suspect , I tend to think of my lenses as a rather innocuous personal care product .
In fact , they 're considered a medical device and are regulated by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration Center for Devices & Radiological Health , along with breast implants , artificial knees , and drug- eluting coronary stents .
The first contact lenses were blown of glass in the 1880s and rested on the white of the eye rather than covering just the cornea ; they could be worn for a few hours at most .
Plastic lenses were introduced in the 1930s .
The first lenses with mass appeal were smaller lenses that covered just the cornea and were made from poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) , also known as Plexiglas .
Popular through the 1960s , PMMA contacts were notorious for popping out at inconvenient moments .
Softer , more comfortable lenses made from poly ( hydroxyethyl methacrylate ) ( poly - HEMA ) were introduced in the 1970s .
A key thing to know about eye anatomy is that the cornea does not have blood vessels .
Consequently , corneal cells get nutrients from tear fluid and from gelatinous material called the aqueous humor , which is located on the inside of the eye .
Corneal cells get their oxygen directly from the air .
A big drawback for PMMA and poly - HEMA lenses was that neither is permeable to oxygen .
This became a particular problem for the softer poly - HEMA lenses because wearers found them more comfortable than rigid PMMA lenses and people therefore wore them longer .
In extreme cases , oxygen deprivation to the cornea can lead to growth of blood vessels into the cornea , threatening eyesight .
From the 1970s to the 1990s , much of contact lens research focused on improving oxygen permeability of lens materials .
This effort first led to rigid gas - permeable lenses that incorporated a small amount of silicone for flexibility and oxygen permeability , but many wearers found it hard to adjust to the new lenses .
Having started with soft lenses in junior high , I tried rigid gas permeables in high school but went running back to soft lenses within a few weeks .
IN THE 1990s , manufacturers turned to the soft hydrogel materials , silicone hydrogels in particular , that are used in the lenses most common today .
Of approximately 30 million contact lens wearers in the U.S. , around 98 % wear soft lenses , says James Gardner , vice president for marketing at contact lens manufacturer CooperVision .
Hydrogels are networks of water - insoluble polymers that can simultaneously hold large amounts of water .
They provide significant advantages over previous lenses in oxygen permeability and comfort — their high water content means that they 'll stay moist and nonirritating even during extended periods of wear .
A major component in some modern lenses is phosphorylcholine , a hydrophilic material that mimics part of the cell membrane .
It is commonly used in medical devices to improve biocompatibility , reduce protein adsorption , and reduce inflammatory response .
In contact lenses phosphorylcholine also helps to maintain hydration while preventing deposition of lipids and proteins on any dry spots that do develop , Gardner says .
As an alternative to phosphorylcholine , lenses can be engineered to contain longer siloxane chains , which hydrogen bond to water and eliminate the need for added wetting agents .
In saline the lenses contain 48 % water by weight and are extremely soft , contributing further to comfort .
Common varieties of contact lenses can be replaced daily , weekly , or monthly .
The materials used in these lenses are fundamentally the same , Gardner says .
The differences lie in the manufacturing .
Lenses to be replaced daily are made on very high volume lines set up to maximize production efficiency , and such lenses are typically offered in fewer power increments and perhaps with only one base curve — the radius of the sphere described by the lenses .
Lenses replaced less frequently have more options to achieve better sight correction and fit .
At lens manufacturer CIBA Vision , R&D efforts are directed toward incorporating lubricants that elute over time , to maintain that " fresh lens feeling , " says Lynn Winterton , global head of research .
For example , a daily disposable lens approved by FDA earlier this year has a lubricant that is forced out with each blink of the eye .
Winterton also says that the company is working on ways to improve the safety of lenses , primarily by looking for materials that do n't create a good breeding ground for bacteria , fungi , or other microorganisms that can cause eye infections .
Most of the patent literature involves impregnating lenses with silver , he says , although some people are looking at incorporating active pharmaceutical agents .
He notes that companies have to juggle maintaining transparency , avoiding an inflammatory response , and preventing the evolution of drug - resistant microbes .
That 's a lot to consider for a product most of us insert in just a blink of an eye .

Not a day goes by when people I deal with ( mostly at the office ) complain about the latest record price - per - barrel of crude or the pain at the gas pump .
And yes , prices are a bit higher , in inflation - adjusted dollars , than they were the last time we had serious gas - price problems .
But there is one crucial difference between 1980 and today : Supply .
Whenever I hear the woe - is - me complaints from my co-workers , I steer the conversation this way :
ME : Were you able to buy gas , at that price , today ?
THEM : Well …yes …but …
ME : Is the gas always available ?
THEM : What do you mean ?
ME : I mean , is the station always open ?
THEM : Well , yeah , but …
ME : Is n’t it true there are a lot of gas stations in our area that are actually open 24/7 , gas is always available and plentiful on demand ?
THEM : That ’s true , but …
ME : So there is no gas supply shortage , it ’s just that they ’re selling the gas at a price you think is too high ?
THEM : Exactly !
ME : So … what do you think the government needs to do about it ?
Price controls ?
THEM : I dunno… that might help …
ME : Do you have any idea what happens when governments all over the world have tried to fix the price of some commodity or another , throughout history ?
THEM : What ?
ME : The demand for that commodity increases at that artificially low price , and you end up with …supply shortages .
THEM : …….
At which point , I return to my office and close the door .
With all the complaints by consumers , pols and pundits alike about gas prices , wanting to blame the war , OPEC , corrupt leaders of OPEC countries , or the horrendous lack of constant government oversight , no one mentions the actual supply of gas available .
While financial reporters are always citing " supply concerns " when reporting another rise in the per - barrel crude price , I have never , except in rare circumstances , seen any evidence of actual supplies being unavailable or rationed to consumers .
I ’m old enough to have survived the last gas crunch , which went off - again - on - again during the 70’s and peaked in the 1980 election cycle .
These periods were marked by such gas - saving measures as mandatory Federal CAFÉ standards , and a Federally imposed 55 mph speed limit .
Closer to home , such things as " even-odd " days were imposed , where , if your license plate was an even number , you could only fill up on even - numbered days , the same went for odd numbers .
" Topping off " your tank on those days was also prohibited .
This was to make the available supply distributed as " fairly " as possible .
The efficacy of that policy was dubious , at best , but there it was .
In 1980 , in Portland , Oregon , I typically filled up , under these draconian conditions , for an average of $ 1.24 per gallon .
Adjusted for inflation , this comes out to $ 3.18 today .
( I filled up in Lodi , NJ , last weekend for $ 2.92 , and that was the highest I ’d seen it in quite awhile . )
A short year later , however , 9 months after Reagan finished deregulating oil and gas , the price fell to $ 0.80 / gallon .
In 2001 ( pre -9/11 , pre-war ) , I could fill up near my home for $ 1.54 / gal .
Adjusted backward for inflation to 1981 , that price was — you may have guessed it — $ 0.80 .
So for twenty straight years , the price ( and supply ) of gas was actually disgustingly stable , only subject to the effects of currency inflation .
Inflation fools a lot of people .
Like the proverbial frog in the pot set to boil , they do n’t pay attention to the slow , inexorable erosion of their buying power over time .
If you earn $ 100,000 per year today , you may feel OK about your middle - class lifestyle , but that pre-tax money only had the buying power of $ 39,037 in 1980 , and $ 16,486 in 1968 , roughly my father ’s gross earnings that year .
Plus , you probably pay a lot more in taxes on that $ 100 k than your father or grandfather did on his $ 16,486 .
To avoid those taxes , you put as much as you can into a 401k or IRA , 529 ’s for your kids college tuition , and pay up for a bigger house than you really need to get the home mortgage deduction .
Net effect is that you actually have less spending power .
On every real measure , are we , today , truly better off than our parents / grandparents were , just a generation or so ago ?
The other side of the " money coin " is the hammering the dollar itself is getting in the global market .
As of this morning , the dollar is trading at almost $ 1.54 against the Euro , when , only a few short years ago , both currencies were virtually at par .
The other day , I saw crude prices hit a peak of $ 104 a barrel .
But that ’s about u20AC68 .
So , if by some miracle , the dollar could restrengthen itself back to par with the Euro ( seems like a forlorn hope , I know ) , the crude price would lower itself accordingly to $ 68 per barrel , which would mean a savings of about $ 1.30 at the pump .
But then demand would probably increase , and …here we go again .
The fact that , while there is political pressure to increase CAFÉ standards , after nearly a generation of inactivity , but no pressure to reinstate the hated " double - nickel , " even - odd days , or anything else , says to me that there is really no problem with the supply of gas itself , but rather the issue of energy independence we ’re trying to grapple with .
Then again , no one talks about how the destruction of our currency plays just as important a role in consumer ’s perceptions regarding gas prices .

↓あまり興味ないけど、lionfan さんの先手を打ってやってみた。わざとかなり意訳してみた。それを除いても明らかに誤訳と思われる部分が
2、3 箇所はある。直したいひとは直して適当にうpしてください。ぼくはもう興味なし。
最優先 : コア言 語
( original : First Priority : Core Language )
2008 年 2 月
目下、私にとっ て Arc 関連の至上命題はコア言語である。 コア言語とは、car や cdr といった原始的オペレータでもなく、かといって専門用途のライブラリ関数でもない部分、 つまり Common Lisp で言う mapcar , let , remove - if - not のようなオペレータのことだ 。
Arc Challenge で述べたとおり、公理系から出発して
「 日常プログラミング完全」な言語 に至る最短経路が一つはあるはずで ( 訳注 : 「 完全 」 も 「 公理」と同様、数学の用語である ) 、
Arc の目標はそれを発見することだ 。
公理系を変更することにはやぶさかでない。 有用な変更なのであればなおさらだ。 ただ、それはいつもいつも考えつくようなものではない。
いま私が公理とライブラリの中間へ目を向けている理由は、
その領域のオペレータこそプログラマの観点からすれば言語そのものだということにある。
それこそがプログラムの原材料なのだ。
Lisp が家だとすると、そうしたオペレータは玄関のドアであり、居間のソファであり、
食卓テーブルである。そこにちょっとしたデザインの違いが生じただけで、言語の働きは大いに影響されうる。
ここに気を取られていることについて色々と非難されているが、
私の考えではこれは重要かつ解決困難な問題なのである。
その難しさを示すひとつの例として、Lisp はもう 50 歳にもなろうというのに、 私の知る限りすべての Lisp 方言におけるコア・オペレータが最短経路にほど遠いという点を挙げよう。 たとえば cond マクロ。こいつに は
Lisp 1 からこのかた余計な括弧がびっしり付いてきて、それを誰も何ともしてこなかった。 if と cond を押しつぶしてひとつのオペレータにす る
Arc の技も、誰かがとっくに見つけていたっておかしくなかったのだが、 間違いなくそんな周知の事実はない。こんなことができると気づいたときは嬉しかったなあ。
Lisp のコアがそれほど遅い進化に甘んじてきた理由のひとつは、慣れである。 人はまず今あるオペレータで考える。 存在しないオペレータを使ってコードを書き直す方法について想像するには、意識的な努力が必要なのだ。
このことは、私がコードの大きさに注意を向ける理由の一部でもある。
長いということが外からの制約となるのだ ( 訳注 : この段落かなり自信なし:コメント参照←なるほどねえ ) 。
「 このコードに必要な長さの下限はどれぐらいだろう」と考えながら見てしまう人は、
限界まで短くする新オペレータの発見から一歩離れたところにいる。
Lisp コアの進化が遅いもうひとつの理由は、これが実装というより設計の問題だという点にある。 ほとんどのハッカーはその種の仕事ができないし、しようとも思わない。 そんなことをしてもハッカー仲間に威張れないし、職の安定にもつながらない。
1 日に 500 行のコードを吐き出すのではなくマイナス 20 行のときには、単に運がよかったと考えてしまうのだ ( 訳注 : ここは誤訳かも ) 。
しかし設計に労力を払うのはくだらないことなどではない。 実際 、Lisp がこれほど長続きしているのは、ひとつには
McCarthy が偉大な設計者だったからだろう。 プログラミング言語を自然言語に似せようという無思慮な企てや当時のハードウェアのせいで 皆が妥協した言語を作っていた時代に、彼は小さくていつまでも色あせないものを作り出したのだ。
Lisp の美点はこの明察に負うところが大きい。 その輝きは、彼ほど才能に恵まれなかった後代の設計者たちの闇を通すと一層際立つ。
最初のリリース で Arc を DIS った人たちのジョークに 、「 McCarthy の再来だ 」 というのがあった。 こういう意味でないのは分かっているが、私は実のところ、彼のやっていた言語設計を、彼のやめたところから再開したいと思っている。
だから Arc ユーザに頼みがある。私が気まぐれにちょこちょこ変更を加えているように見えるとき、辛抱してほしいのだ。 今のところコアはすべてエンピツ書きの状態だと考えており、希望としては大幅な変更も可能であってほしい。 これだ と
Arc でプログラムを書くのは面倒極まりないことになるが、最終成果はそれに見合うものとなるはずだ。
Arc はウェブアプリ作成に便利なライブラリ ( あまりに強力で 、 文字列をサーバに保存する必要のある問題で他の言語と
Arc を比べるのがズルいほどのライブラリ ) を持ってはいるが、 現時点で焦点はそこにない。ウェブアプリを書いたのはすべて、コアに現実世界の圧力を加えるためだけだ。 それで、ウェブアプリの新アイディアも興味があるとはいえ、私が本当に聞きたいのは言語コアに実施できる新しいことである。
この高度に絞り込まれ選び抜かれた分野で新たなアイディアを考えるのは並大抵のことではないが、
報いの大きい仕事でもある。それに、我々が求めているものが存在することは分かっている。
定義からして、( 公理から完全言語への ) 最短経路はある。プラトニックな Lisp は岩塊のどこかにある。 なすべきは、そこまで削りつづけることだけなのだ。

These past few weeks have provided an unfortunate opportunity to discuss inflation .
The dollar index has reached new all - time lows .
The total money supply , M3 , as calculated by private sources , is growing at a disturbing 17 % rate .
The Fed is pumping dollars into the economy at an alarming rate .
Just recently the Fed announced new loan auctions totaling $ 100 billion .
That is new money created from thin air .
If these money auctions , combined with the bailout of Bear Stearns , continue to be the trend , we are in for some economic stormy weather .
The explanation lies in understanding the basics of money , and why it is dangerous to give government and big banks control over it .
First , money is not wealth , in and of itself .
You cannot create more wealth simply by creating more money .
Wall Street bankers cry out for more liquidity , but what is really needed is more value behind the dollar .
But the value , unfortunately , is n't there .
You see , the Fed creates new money and uses it to purchase securities from banks .
Flush with funds , these banks seek to put this money to use .
During the Fed 's expansionary period , much of this money went to home loans .
Through a combination of federal government inducements to lend to risky borrowers , and the Fed 's supply of easy money , the housing bubble took shape .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were encouraged to purchase and securitize mortgages , while investors , buoyed by implicit government backing , rushed to provide funding .
Money that could have been invested in more productive , less risky sectors of the economy was thereby malinvested in subprime mortgage loans .
The implicit guarantee from the Fed is quickly becoming explicit , as those institutions deemed " too big to fail " are bailed out at taxpayer expense .
Wall Street made a killing during the housing bubble , reaping record profits .
Now that the bubble has burst , these same firms are trying to dump their losses on the taxpayers .
This approach requires more money creation , and therefore debasement of all dollars in circulation .
The Federal Reserve , a quasi - government entity , should not be creating money or determining interest rates , as this causes malinvestment and excessive debt to accumulate .
Centrally planned , government - manipulated economies always fail eventually .
The collapse of communism and the failure of socialism should have made this apparent .
Even the most educated , well - intentioned central planners cannot plan the market better than the market itself .
Those that understand economics best , understand this reality .
In free markets , both success and failure are options .
If government interventions prevent businesses , like Bear Stearns , from failing , then it is not truly a free market .
As painful as it might be for Wall Street , banks , even big ones , must be allowed to fail .
The end game for this policy of monetary inflation is that the money in your bank account loses purchasing power .
So , by keeping failing banks afloat , the Fed punishes those who have lived frugally and saved .
The power to create money is a power that should never be granted to government .
As we can plainly see today , the Fed has abused this power , and taxpayers are paying the price .

The Met Office believes easterly winds could be carrying the smells
A foul smell detected in parts of England and Wales is being blamed on easterly winds bringing farming or industrial smells across the Channel .
Labelled " Euro - whiff " by the Met Office , the source of the smell - alternately described as sulphur and manure - is under investigation .
The Met Office said it had had hundreds of calls from the public looking for information about the odour .
The BBC News website has received more than 1,000 e-mails about the smell .
Readers have reported a range of sulphur and manure - like smells hanging over large parts of England and Wales .
' Stagnant air '
The Met Office 's Sarah Holland said : " Basically , over the last few days , we 've had fresh , strong winds from an easterly direction .
As a result some of our air is coming from continental Europe . "
Please turn on JavaScript .

She added that while members of Met Office staff were trying to trace the exact source of the " apparent atmospheric aroma " , the likely explanation was either agricultural or industrial works in western Europe .
" Normally , our winds are westerly , coming off the Atlantic Ocean , which bring little or no pollution with them . "
Helen Chivers of the Met Office said the origin of the smell had been narrowed down to the area of Europe roughly bordered by Holland , Germany and Belgium .
But , she said , it was unlikely the exact source would be pinpointed .
" I do n't think there 's any way we will know .
The air over that part of Europe has been very stagnant over the past few days , so there wo n't be any way of telling where it is coming from . "
Mrs Chivers said the smell had been described as everything from manure to methane gas to metallic in nature .
Dead animal smell
Some of the strongest smells have been reported in Reading and Basingstoke , with other reports of a stench in East Anglia , as far north as Durham and as far south as Devon .
It is the sort of smell you can taste

Readers ' experience of the smell
Forecasters say the easterly winds , which are bringing the current cold front in addition to the bad smell , are expected to last two or three more days .
BBC News website reader Sriram from Stevenage wrote that he feared there might be a dead animal near his house .
" I thought there was something that was dead , like a rat or a cat , and it was their decay that was causing the smell , " he said .
" I quickly got into the car and drove off , then at the station I parked the car and got out and the stench was still there .
I had a serious scare now . "
Marian Miller from High Wycombe , Buckinghamshire , said the smell had induced nausea .
" I noticed an acrid smell rather like burning plastic during the night , about 5 am .
It is the sort of smell you can taste . "

Matt from Cardiff said his first thought was to blame the neighbourhood pets .
" I thought it was our local neighbourhood dogs and cats being busy in the night in our garden - but the smell stayed noticeable during my three - mile bike ride to work . "
Stu Maddison of Ealing , west London , said he noticed the stench as soon as he stepped out the door this morning .
Mr Maddison said the smell was still in the air when he arrived for work in Notting Hill .
" It 's a bit rude really , " he said of the air .
" Various colleagues thought they 'd trod in something but no , it 's the air . "

My wife and I live in Clapham and we noticed a smell this morning and thought it was from a fox .
When I returned to the house a while later , the smell was still there and was all down the road .
This afternoon it seems to have died down .

I 've noticed a sickly sweet off smell , similar to silage , occasionally over the past couple of weeks .
When we had the same smell a couple of years ago , which lasted for two weeks , it was blamed on a local sewage problem .

When I went to work this morning I thought that a farmer had been spraying his fields with manure .
It was so strong it made me choke .
The smell followed me all the way to Windsor .
Lunchtime ( 1.00 pm ) the smell seems to have dissipated somewhat .

For the last couple of days when i've gone out into the garden there has been this foul , strong smell in the air .
As if 100 foxes have poo'd in the back garden .
Now i know where the smell is coming from , does n't make it smell any nicer though .

I went outside this morning at 8.30 am with my daughter and we both smelt a disgusting manure smell .
We thought our neighbour had been putting manure on his garden and blamed him !
It reminded me of when I used to live in the country and did n't mind it too much but not every day !!!

In Norwich first thing this morning the smell was obvious and quite awful .
As the wind picked up it appeared to clear slightly .
Do remember that any pollution , emissions from agriculture and other " aromas " from the UK are usually blown across to Europe , so it 's only fair we 're suffering for once !

The crocodile locked its jaws around its victim 's legs
A woman has been rescued from the jaws of a saltwater crocodile in Australia after her husband jumped onto its back and forced it to flee .
The attack took place in the Litchfield National Park near Darwin in Australia 's Northern Territory .
The crocodile lunged at its victim as she stood on the banks of a river , locking its jaws around her legs before trying to drag her into the water .
Police have said the heroism of her husband almost certainly saved her .
As the crocodile attacked , Wendy Petherick shouted to her husband Norm who told reporters he acted instinctively .
" I saw Wendy in the water , trying to pull something out of her leg , and I knew it was a croc , " he said .
" I acted quickly , just jumped on top of it , and looked for the eyes .
I found them , and poked its eyes , and that 's when it released her , I think . "
The 36 - year - old woman suffered serious injuries and will have surgery in Darwin .
Her husband escaped unharmed .
Last week , police in the Northern Territory opened fire on a crocodile as it closed in on a drunken man who had accepted a dare to swim in dangerous waters .
Our day has finally come .
CSS coders got some love with Internet Explorer 7 – us JavaScript folk got absolutely nothing .
In fact , at last count , all we got were a couple new bugs to deal with ( file :// requests not working via XMLHttpRequest and < object>.getElementsByTagName ( “ * ” ) always returning no elements ) .
Internet Explorer 8 is our release .
The first beta was pushed out today and it shows huge promise .
It ’s already achieved way more than I would ’ve expected and it ’s made me hungry for more .
If you had bet me that Microsoft would be mentioning the phrases “ ARIA ” , “ SVG ” , and “ MathML ” in their release notes I would ’ve lost .
Here are my thoughts on a bunch of the browser features :
W3C : querySelector
A super - fast way of finding elements based upon a CSS selector .
The second browser to implement the selectors API has hit the market ( behind a WebKit nightly release ) .
It ’s important to realize that any selectors here are completely reliant upon the browser ’s native selector implementation .
IE8 is only shooting for CSS 2.1 support – which means that you really should n’t be holding your breath for CSS 3 selectors .
As I mentioned previously these blackbox APIs are going to be a source of never - ending hair - pulling and struggle going into the future .
HTML 5 Party !
I was hoping for some HTML 5 - compliant features to land – well , hoping is n’t the right term , perhaps ‘ feverishly expecting the worst ’ is more correct .
However we can see that we ’ve been graced with 4 full feature implementations from the spec – fantastic !
HTML 5 : window.location.hash
Already supported fairly well by most browsers .
Modifying window.location .hash changes the page URL and adds the page to the history ( allowing for back - button simulation in Ajax applications ) .
IE went a step further and broadcasts the hashchanged event ( the first browser to do so , as far as I know ) .
HTML 5 : DOM Storage
A feature that I discussed previously in which data can be persisted in a way that supersedes the use of primitive cookies storage .
This has been in Firefox since version 2 but is absent from Opera and Safari .
HTML 5 : postMessage
As I discussed previously postMessage serves as a way of communication across frames with simple text strings .
IE 8 , Opera 9 , Firefox 3 , and WebKit nightlies all support this feature – making it the only one with complete browser support .
HTML 5 : Offline Events
As I ’ve written about previously this is an easy way of detecting connectivity within the confines of JavaScript .
With it we can write graceful offline Ajax applications .
Firefox 3 and IE 8 appear to be the only browsers to support this feature .
XDomainRequest
This is an interesting feature for doing cross -domain requests but does n’t appear to conform to the existing Cross - site XMLHttpRequest work which is in Firefox 3 .
Even at that it appears to be quite crude – forfeiting any form of filtering or security controls for a simple boolean “ yes / no ” header .
Seeing this new API concerns me .
The Cross - site XMLHttpRequest work may be in some flux , as some API points are still being hammered down , but it ’s doubtful that the resolution will end with something identical to what ’s being described by Microsoft .
DOM bug fix love
getAttribute/setAttribute have seen a major overhaul – in short :
They now behave like they should and as they do in every other browser .
The notorious issue of accessing relative / absolute href / src attributes is also resolved – which is just great .
They also saw fit to add hasAttribute .
Also newly fixed / added :
.ownerElement and .ownerDocument – Finally we have a unified way of dealing with iFrames .
and – Finally we have a unified way of dealing with iFrames .
getElementById returns elements by id – ONLY .
Been such a long time coming , thank goodness .
returns elements by id – ONLY .
Been such a long time coming , thank goodness .
Doing getAttribute ( " checked " ) now returns “ checked ” instead of true .
now returns “ checked ” instead of true . < button /> values are actually submitted now , instead of their inner text values .
Dynamically created ( or modified ) radio buttons are now checkable .
I simultaneously feel both joy and anger in seeing these fixed .
Happy that they ’re being released and anger for the fact that I had to struggle through them and that they now consume some portion of my brain .
W3C : Events
This is one area that is completely absent from this beta .
We are still stuck with IE ’s attachEvent system – no addEventListener in sight .
I do n’t know how serious they are about supporting Acid3 but it includes a test for addEventListener so they may want to consider it extra strongly .
I can partially understand their desire to keep their existing API but I do n’t understand why they have no interest in , also , adding addEventListener , etc. to complement what ’s there .
I assume it ’s because they would now have to support concepts like event capturing .
I ’m really disappointed with this .
This should ’ve been a top priority fix before implementing new psuedo - XHR systems like XDomainRequest .
JavaScript Language
The IE team has made some big improvements in improving garbage collection issues , memory management , and performance – all of which will be greatly appreciated in everyday applications .
Although , I mis - spoke slightly earlier :
While IE8 is been great for JavaScript developers I was implying “ JavaScript + DOM ” developers .
For pure JavaScript it ’s completely frustrating :
There does n’t appear to be any new pure - JavaScript features in this release .
I can only hope that we ’ll see more in a future beta release .
ARIA Support
This one completely blew me away .
ARIA is a fantastic specification for empowering web applications with the ability to clearly communicate their intentions to a screen reader .
The biggest hurdle with the effort , up until this point , has been the lack of IE support – obviously this will no longer be the case .
Firefox , IE , and Opera all support ARIA now .
The WebKit team does n’t appear to have interest in implementing this feature , which is a real shame .
Embedded SVG
Support for embedding namespaced elements within XHTML is now possible .
This means that you can now do inline markup for SVG and MathML , amongst others , and have it “ just work ” ( as long as you have their associated plugins installed ) .
It ’s probably a bit much hoping for native SVG support , but I ’ll take what I can get .
Firebug for Internet Explorer
We finally have a heavily - Firebug - inspired tool inside Internet Explorer .
To quote Joe Hewitt ( creator of Firebug ) : “ I could n’t be happier that Microsoft completely copied Firebug for IE8 . ”
I have to agree – a tool like this has been a long time coming and it ’s greatly appreciated .
Only the Internet Explorer team would ’ve ever been the ones to build this tool – there ’s simply too much information here that ’s unavailable to typical IE extensions .
Browser mode toggling
At first glance this feature makes the most sense for seeing if your IE 7 page will work ok in IE 8 .
In actuality , however , this will end up being very useful for developing a standards - compliant page ( in IE 8 , FF , Safari , Opera ) and then toggling to see what the result is like in IE 7 .
This is so much better than the IE 6 to IE 7 jump where you have to keep your browser in a virtual machine in order for it to run side - by - side ( according to Microsoft , at least – even though there were standalone solutions ) .
Bug Feedback
The Internet Explorer team is collecting feedback from select beta testers and publishing the bugs on a publicly - accessible site .
This a huge step in the right direction ( going from no communication to some is great ) .
“ Common ” users are forced to vote for their “ favorite ” bugs to try and catch the eye of an IE developer .
It ’s a strange situation but one that shows progress , at least .
Conclusion
In all I ’m positive about this release , even with all the ups - and - downs .
Seeing features like querySelector , ARIA , and postMessage helps to warm my frosty , bitter , heart .
While there ’s still some major faux - paus in this release ( no new JS langauge features ? , no W3C events ? , no CSS3 selectors ? )
I think we can , at least , be excited to see what happens in the next beta .
If nothing else the Internet Explorer team has done a great job of tackling many of the expectations of the development community – if they continue this trend I do n’t think anyone will be left disappointed .
DNC ad : McCain's ' 100 years ' in Iraq
" If all he offers is more of the same , is John McCain the right choice for America 's future ? "
Honing in on statements Senator and presidential hopeful John McCain ( R - AZ ) has made in favor of a continued occupation of Iraq , a television spot released Friday by the Democratic National Committee reminds the public how much has been lost , in money and lives , in a mere five years .
The commercial , as posted to YouTube on April 25 , 2008 , is available to view below :
American spies went out of their way last week , to answer questions about that mysterious nuclear facility that once sat in the Syrian desert .
But the spooks ' presentation to Congress seems to have raised nearly as a whole heap of new issues , even as it put others to bed .
The question that 's coming up the most is :
Why now ?
American and Israeli spies have had clues of Syria and North Korea cooperating to build a nuclear reactor since 1997 .
Satellite images show the so - called " Al Kibar " facility under construction in 2003 .
Why wait so long to take the reactor out ?
" I think the administration believes it will help them get to a deal with North Korea , " Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan , the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , told CNN's " Late Edition . "
Gary Samore , with Council on Foreign Relations , comes to a similar conclusion :
For over a year the talks have been stuck over the issue of North Korea making a declaration of all of its nuclear activities .
The main question there is North Korea ’s refusal to acknowledge a secret uranium - enrichment program and then more recently , its nuclear assistance to Syria .
So the administration has made a compromise with
North Korea .
In the compromise the North Koreans will declare how much plutonium they ’ve produced over the years and instead of North Korea having to directly acknowledge the uranium - enrichment program and their assistance to Syria , the United States will make a statement expressing its belief that these activities have taken place and the North Koreans will not refute or challenge that U.S. statement .
The next question :
What was the reactor for , exactly ?
The Syrian site now known as " Al Kibar " was initially billed in the press as being " virtually identical "
to the North Korean reactor at Yongbyon , which has been known to process plutonium of Kim Jong Il 's nuclear weapons program .
However , as our buddy Jeffrey Lewis notes , the spies ' actual claim " was much more careful — that there were
similarities in the configuration and in the size and capacity of the reactor . "
But just how similar are the two ?
Jeffrey and his merry band of nuclear geeks have been taking a very , very careful look over at ArmsControlWonk.com .
It appears that Al Kibar was smaller than Yongbyon .
Which means it would make for a less - than - ideal site for arms - production , since it would take a number of years to generate enough plutonium for a bomb .
Officials from the Director of National Intelligence 's shop say that
" the reactor inside that building was clearly not configured to produce electricity .
We saw no way and there are no power lines coming out of it , none of all the switching facilities that you would need . "
Counterpunch quotes Joseph Cirincione , director of nuclear policy at the Center for American Progress , as saying , " It is a basic research program built around a tiny 30 kilowatt reactor that produced a few isotopes and neutrons .
It is nowhere near a program for nuclear weapons or nuclear fuel . "
But Jeffrey figures its probably too soon to jump to conclusions .
" There 's a lot that does n't add up yet , " according to the Wonk – like why the Syrians did n't properly defend this oh - so - important facility , for instance .
While we 're all trying to figure this out , the irreplaceable Allen Thomson has put together an 812 - page sourcebook on the Syrian affair .
" Additional information would be welcome , " he says .
UPDATE : More mysteries .
The * L.A. Times ' Babylon & Beyond * blog picks up on some possible Photoshop shenanigans in the spies ' recent Al Kibar presentation .

President Bush 's speech was being closely watched
Bush speech
President Bush announced a package of measures to help homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages amid the current sub - prime loan crisis .
Meanwhile Mr Bernanke hinted that rates may be cut as the Fed seeks to " promote general financial stability " .
Related losses had exceeded " the most pessimistic of projections " , he said .
Recent disturbances in the sub - prime mortgage industry are modest in relation to the size of our economy
President George W Bush
These losses stem from defaults on sub - prime mortgages , higher risk loans offered to people with poor credit ratings or on low incomes .
' No bail out '
President Bush said the measures were aimed at stopping more people defaulting on their repayments and to allow owning a home to remain " at the centre of the American dream " .
PRESIDENT BUSH'S COMMENTS
Calling on Congress to pass laws giving more flexibility to the Federal Housing Administration to assist those with sub - prime mortgages .
Pledging to reform the tax code , aiding borrowers to refinance loans .
Demanding stronger lending practices and the enforcement of laws designed to stop predatory lending .
They include reform tax laws to help troubled borrowers refinance their loans , but the President added that it was not the government 's job to bail out speculators .
" Recent disturbances in the sub - prime mortgage industry are modest , modest in relation to the size of our economy , " the President said .
" But if your family 's one of those having trouble making the monthly payments , this problem does n't seem modest at all . "
Mr Bernanke insisted it was not the job of the Fed " to protect lenders or investors from the consequences of their financial decisions " .
But he added : " The Fed stands ready to take additional actions as needed to provide liquidity and promote the orderly functioning of the markets . "
The Fed will meet to set rates on 18 September amid growing speculation that it will cut the cost of borrowing to ease the current liquidity problems in the financial markets .
Wall Street investors saw Mr Bernanke 's remarks as a hint of potential interest rate , which could lower borrowing costs and give a boost to credit markets .
In Friday trading the Dow Jones index and the Nasdaq ended 0.9 % and 1.2 % ahead respectively .
" The Fed continues to embrace the market with tough love , but will do what is necessary , " said Stephen Gallagher , economist at Societe Generale in New York .
Loan guarantees
Worries about loan defaults have roiled stock markets and investors around the world , and raised the cost of borrowing worldwide .
The Fed stands ready to take additional actions as needed to provide liquidity and promote the orderly functioning of the markets
Ben Bernanke
In quotes : Ben Bernanke
The Fed has so far released billions of dollars of emergency funds into the financial system in an attempt to ease fears over the lack of available credit .
It has also cut the interest rate at which it lends to banks .
The crisis in the US sub - prime mortgage sector has been caused by American mortgage rates rising sharply over the past year .
This has meant a growing number of sub - prime borrowers have been unable to meet their monthly payments as their initial low rates expire , leading to record levels of defaults .
The result has not only been significant financial difficulty for banks and investment firms heavily exposed to the sub - prime market , but also the recent stock market turmoil .
This is because of fears that the crunch in the sub - prime sector will spread to the wider loans market as banks become far more cautious about whom they lend to .
The situation has been exacerbated by the fact that sub - prime debt is often resold as part of a wider debt package , meaning that banks and investors are , as yet , unsure about how far the sub - prime downturn could spread .
A number of firms have already been knocked by the turmoil , most notably the US investment bank Bear Stearns .

Superempowerment -- an increase in the ability of individuals and small groups to accomplish tasks / work through the combination of rapid improvements in technological tools and access to global networks -- has enabled small groups to radically increase their productivity in conflict .
For example , if a small group disrupts a system or a network by attacking systempunkts , it can amplify the results of its attacks to achieve as much as a 1,400,000 percent return on investment .
High rates of innovation .
Increased survivability among the participant groups .
More frequent attacks and an ability to swarm targets .
Open source warfare is an organizational method by which a large collection of small , violent , superempowered groups can work together to take on much larger foes ( usually hierarchies ) .
It is also a method of organization that can be applied to non-violent struggles .
It enables :
Here are some suggestions ( this is but one of many methods based on recent history , I 'm sure that over time a better method will emerge ) for building an open source insurgency :
An enemy .
The enemy serves as the target of attacks .
This enemy can either be either received or manufactured ( any group or organization that can be depicted as a threat ) .
The enemy can be any group that currently holds and exerts power : invader , the government , a company , an ethnic group , or a private organization .

The enemy can be any group that currently holds and exerts power : invader , the government , a company , an ethnic group , or a private organization .
A goal .
This objective animates the group .
Because of the diversity of the groups and individuals that join together in an open source insurgency , the only goal that works is simple and extremely high level .
More complex goal setting is impossible , since it will fracture / fork the insurgency .

More complex goal setting is impossible , since it will fracture / fork the insurgency .
A demonstration .
Viability .
An attack that demonstrates that its possible to win against the enemy .
It deflates any aura of invincibility that the enemy may currently enjoy .
The demonstration serves as a rallying cry for the insurgency .
Relinquish .
Give up any control over the insurgency gained during its early phases .
In practice , this means giving up control of how the goal is achieved , who may participate , how to communicate , etc .
The only control that remains is the power of example and respect gained through being effective .

The only control that remains is the power of example and respect gained through being effective .
Resist ( temptation ) .
Stay small .
Do n't grow to a size that makes the original group easy for the enemy to target ( very few new members ) .
Further , do n't establish a formal collection of groups , a hierarchy of control , or set forth a complex agenda .
This will only serve to alienate and fragment / fork the insurgency .
In some cases , it will make the foco a target of the insurgency itself .
It will also slow any advancement on the objective since it limits potential pathways / innovation .

Provide resources , ideas , information , knowledge , recruits , etc. with other groups and individuals that join the insurgency .
Share everything possible that does n't directly compromise the foco 's integrity ( operational security and viability ) .
Expect sharing in return .
.
The idea that holds the open source insurgency together .
The plausible promise is composed of : .
Every open source insurgency is ignited by a small founding group , ain guerrilla parlance .
The foco sets the original goal and conducts the operation that provides the insurgency with its demonstration of viability .
It 's important to understand that in order to grow an open source insurgency , the founding group or individuals must follow a simple path :
Will keep adding to this doctrine over the next couple of months .
Could potentially package it into a PDF document for wider distribution when done .
UPDATE : Here 's a very smartly penned application of OSW ( and the foco ) by a member of Anonymous .
Venezuela has hired Belarus to build an air defense system for them .
Belarus has the credentials .
They still operate several of the Soviet era air - defense schools , and many Soviet era air defense installations .
Two years ago , Belarus received 24 Russian S-300 missile systems .
Roughly equivalent to the U.S. Patriot , S - 300 was known as the SA - 10 to NATO , when the system first appeared in the early 1980s .
S-300 missiles weigh 1.8 tons each and are 26 feet long and about 20 inches in diameter .
The missiles have a range of some 200 kilometers and can hit targets as high as 100,000 feet .
The missile has a 320 pound warhead .
Belarus and Russia have integrated their air defenses , mainly to give Russia more " depth " in case of an attack from the west .
Of all the former communist nations in Europe , Belarus is the only one still run by its Soviet era officials .
Basically it 's a police state , and very tight with Russia .
In 2006 , Venezuela said that it was interested in buying S - 300 systems from Russia .
Venezuela has since ordered shorter range Tor M - 1 system .
Known to NATO as the SA - 15 Gauntlet , the Tor - M1 has a maximum range of 12 kilometers .
It is only effective up to 6,000 meters altitude .
The system was designed as a successor to the SA - N - 8 Gecko .
Each launcher carries eight missiles , and it is claimed to be capable of engaging two targets simultaneously .
The system was designed to be a tactical battlefield air - defense system , designed to take out close - air - support planes like the A - 10 or tactical fighter - bombers like the F - 4 , F - 16 , and F - 18 .
Now Belarussians will help install and operate these missiles , along with the communications systems needed to create a national air defense system .
Ben Stein , Scientific Crusader
Update : I ’ve been Bad Astronomered !
Welcome to everyone coming here from Phil Plait ’s site .
( Image from Ono . )
You ’re probably aware that fundie clowndick Ben Stein has a forthcoming movie about the alleged “ Darwinist ” conspiracy to suppress science .
I ’m expecting the film to be something on the order of the infamous Fox TV Moon Hoax “ documentary ” , which was full of outright lies and deceptive editing .
When it comes out , maybe we can compare the two and see which is worse .
Fundiecast Cybercast News Service has published an interview with Ben Stein .
Let ’s take a look .
Intelligent design theory …
Wow !
They do n’t waste any time .
The very first phrase is a lie !
Intelligent design creationism is not a theory .
The American Heritage Dictionary has a good definition of “ theory ” .
A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena , especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena .
As you can see , ID creationism fails on three counts :
1 . It has not been repeatedly tested .
2 . It is not widely accepted .
3 . It can not be used to make predictions about natural phenomena .
Let ’s get back to the Cybercast article :
[ A ] new movie , “ Expelled ” starring Ben Stein explores how an “ elitist scientific establishment ” is apparently muzzling and smearing scientists who publicly discuss ID .
There ’s no question that anybody claiming that ID creationism is science is being laughed at — not only by scientists but just about anybody with even a remote understanding of science — but there is no vast conspiracy to muzzle anybody .
The First Amendment is under brutal attack in the scientific community , Ben Stein , a former presidential speechwriter - turned - actor and commentator , says in the film , which opens in theaters on Feb. 12 .
Really ?
Now the First Amendment is “ under brutal attack ” .
Actually , that part is true .
The attack is n’t coming from scientists , though .
It ’s coming from crackpot organizations like the Discovery Institute and Access Research Network that are trying to get their religious dogma ( ID creationism ) taught in the schools .
In an exclusive interview with Cybercast News Service – with audio clips below – Stein contends that rigid Darwinists are silencing their critics in academia , which the film explores , and discusses how ID ideas are helping in cancer research and similar work .
Really ?
ID creationism cures cancer !
Please , Ben Stein , tell us how !
Hello ?
Bueller ?
Bueller ?
Apparently no one ’s home .
As is typical of creationist asshats , he makes wild claims and then never bothers to back them up .
Yet the ID research that could potentially produce medical breakthroughs , says Stein , is also being undermined by Darwinian scientists who do n’t want ID research viewed as legitimate .
According to Ben Stein , there is cancer research being stifled by Darwinists because of some sort of philosophical agenda .
I agree that would be bad .
But apparently it ’s OK to stifle stem cell research because fundies do n’t like it .
Yeah , Ben. Real consistent .
Now we get into the actual interview between Cybercast News Service ( CNS ) and Stein .
In the interests of brevity , I will only excerpt parts of the longer answers .
( You can go to the article to see that I ’m not quote mining ) :
Stein : Science should always be in the business of attempting to disprove itself .
Neo -Darwinian science is exactly in the opposite business of endlessly trying to rationalize itself – and reprove itself , you might say – reprove that it ’s right without any kind of test .
Science is in the business of attempting to disprove itself .
He is mischaracterizing modern biology , and not providing any support for his allegations .
He also suffers from Kevin Wirth syndrome .
He ’s so fixated on Darwin that he has blinded himself to the advances in evolutionary theory that have happened since .
No wonder he thinks evolution is outdated .
He ’s using a 150 - year - old definition .
CNS : What sort of separation do you see or perhaps do n’t see between creationism , on the one hand , and intelligent design ?
Stein : I believe in God and God created the heavens and the earth and all the life on the earth .
But what other people , who are intelligent design people , think , I could not characterize .
At least he ’s honest about his own motivations .
Apparently old Ben is n’t above mischaracterizing others on his own side , though .
Intelligent design is creationism , just a different flavor .
CNS : … [ N] eurosurgeon , Michael Egnor , and another scientist , Jon Wells , who indicate that given how the cells are put together , with eye toward intelligent design , and with the idea that animal cells have tiny turbines – or if viewed as tiny turbines – he was able to formulate a theory that said in the event these things malfunction and do n’t properly shut down and could break apart , this is the first step on the way to cancer . …
First of all , that is n’t a theory .
It ’s a hypothesis .
Second , intelligent design creationism is irrelevant here .
Viewing the organelles inside the cell as turbines may be useful , but ID creationism is not needed .
If proponents are lumping this into their pile of breakthroughs resulting from ID creationism , they ’re just plain cheating .
CNS : … He does n’t explicitly say ‘ a cure for cancer , ’…
Wait .
Is this the great big scientific breakthrough in cancer research that these retards alluded to earlier ?
It ’s not even connected to their “ theory ” !
Stein : [ T ] here is this big issue about RNA and DNA , and whether RNA and DNA can respond to changes in the world around them .
I think we say it can respond to changes in the world around them and that neo -Darwinians say it can only do that by random chance …
Again , Stein shows his colossal non-grasp of science .
Evolution is n’t random .
The mutations are random , but they are acted upon by the environment .
Stein :
… We say the cell may have the possibility of doing itself in an intelligent way that there may be some intelligence in the cell itself … .
We believe there ’s some possibility the cell could have an intelligence of its own .
Ben Stein thinks that the cells can intelligently respond to the environment and reprogram their DNA accordingly .
That ’s pretty far - fetched , but we should never rule anything out .
If it ’s true , and they ’ve yet to provide any data that it is , the mechanism would be naturalistic .
If it ’s naturalistic , then it is n’t intelligent design !
Stein : I was just overwhelmed by the fact , at least as I am told , that Darwinists have never observed natural species being originated …
Lie .
Stein :
There ’s not even a clear definition of what a species is …
Another lie , although nature does n’t fit into clean boxes .
There are always things at the edges that do n’t quite fit our definitions .
Stein : … and the Darwinists have no theory whatsoever about the origin of life , none whatsoever , except the most hazy , the kind of preposterous , New Age hypothesis . …
A completely irrelevant separate issue .
Stein : … And I think our theory that there is a creator strikes even some people , even Dawkins very possibly , as more likely than it all happened by total chance .
Now Stein even knows what Richard Dawkins thinks !
Stein : [ Richard Dawkins ’ ] idea that there is a complete rock solid consensus [ in favor of evolution ] is completely wrong .
And Ben Stein is clearly more qualified to make that assessment than Richard Dawkins .
CNS : Why do you think the very idea or suggestion of intelligent design is so antagonistic to scientists who claim they have evidence ?
Stein :
That ’s a deep question .…
One , if they are Darwinists and they owe their jobs to being Darwinists , they are not going to challenge the orthodoxy because that would challenge the whole basis of their jobs and their lives .
So they are not going to challenge the ideology that has given them lush positions in real life .
Hey , Ben !
Where are all of these Darwinists you ’re always talking about ?
I ’ve never met any .
Secondly , the whole point of science is to challenge itself .
You made this unfounded claim before that there is some sort of conspiracy to retain a set of beliefs against all outside attacks .
The only place I ’ve seen that behavior is at the Discovery Institute .
Stein : Second thing , once people are locked into a way of thinking , they are unlikely to change .
OK .
There is truth to that statement , but that refers to individuals .
There are so many scientists out there looking at new things that there is no stagnation in science .
Stein :
Third is , if they acknowledge the possibility of intelligent design and that intelligent design is God , then they may think God has moral expectations of them and they may be falling short of those moral expectations , and they may be worried about some sort of judgment upon them .
Holy crap !
What a pile of holy crap !
So Ben Stein knows that scientists cling to evolution , because they ’re afraid of God ’s judgment !
Stein :
There is a very powerful Marxist establishment within the intelligentsia that does not allow questioning of its premises .
I give up .
That ’s so batshit crazy I can’t even respond to it .
Stein : [ T ] his to us – at least to me …- is a bit like the Civil Rights movement .
You want to have freedom , where our goal is freedom .
We want freedom .
We want all our rights , not some of them , all our rights to free speech .
We want them here in America , and we want them now .
Martin Luther King !!
Thurgood Marshall !!

CONCORD — Supporters of Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul are helping to bankroll the re-count of votes in New Hampshire 's Jan. 8 Republican presidential primary .
CONCORD — Supporters of Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul are helping to bankroll the re-count of votes in New Hampshire 's Jan. 8 Republican presidential primary .
GOP candidate Albert Howard of Ann Arbor , Michigan , requested the re-count , which began Wednesday and was continuing .
Howard got 44 of the more 200,000 votes cast .
Because Howard was n't close to the leaders , he had to pay the nearly $ 60,000 cost of the hand re-count .
Howard said a group of Paul supporters called the " grannywarriors " is paying for the re-count .
He said Lawrence Lepard of Boston � who spent more than $ 100,000 on newspaper ads for Paul � lent the money to get the re-count started .
Gordon Brown is preparing to deliver a bruising snub to the Chinese government by staying away from the opening ceremony of this summer 's Olympic Games in Beijing .
His announcement that he will not attend came as protesters highlighting China 's repression of Tibet prepared to greet the Olympic torch relay as it arrived in California having already interrupted its journey through London and Paris this week .
The Prime Minister will only be in Beijing for the closing ceremony as leader of the next Olympic host country .
Tessa Jowell , the Olympics minister , will represent Britain at the opening in August .

Downing Street insisted it did not represent a change of plan and said Mr Brown was not boycotting the opening of the games as he had never planned to attend .
It said it would be a waste of public money for the Prime Minister to attend both ceremonies and said that Beijing had been informed of the decision .
But Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , described the move as a " last - minute U - turn " , accusing Mr Brown of doing " the right thing late in the day when he is forced to do so because of public opinion " .
A Downing Street spokesman told Channel 4
News last night : " He wo n't be at the opening ceremony .
He never had any intention of going – there was never an expectation that he would attend both ceremonies . "
But his stance is likely to be seen differently in China , where it had been reported he would travel to the country for the start of the Games .
China has already expressed its anger that he will meet the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , who visits Britain next month .
Two weeks ago , Mr Brown was asked if he would follow the lead of Nicolas Sarkozy , the French President , and stay away from the opening ceremony .
He replied : " We will not be boycotting the Olympic Games . "
At his Downing Street press conference 10 days ago , he argued : " I think President Sarkozy said himself he expected Britain , because we are going to host the next Olympics , to be present at the Olympic ceremonies and I will certainly be there . "
Matt Whitticase , of the Free Tibet Campaign , said : " I 'm delighted he is not going to go , but he must – absolutely must – say he is not going to go because of his concerns over human rights .

" It must be made clear – this is the only way the Chinese government will be put in a position where they 're seen to be standing at the opening ceremony with no Gordon Brown .
That will be very embarrassing . "
A YouGov poll for Channel 4
News discovered 43 per cent of the public thought the Prime Minister should stay away .
It also found 66 per cent believe the recent London protests had " damaged " the Chinese government .
Meanwhile , in the US , the White House left the door open to avoiding the Olympics opening ceremony .
The White House spokeswoman , Dana Perino , said : " It is extremely premature for me to say what the President 's schedule is going to be . "
She added : " But I would again reiterate that the President has been very clear that he believes that the right thing for him to do is to continue to press the Chinese on a range of issues , from human rights and democracy , political speech freedoms and religious tolerance , and to do that publicly and privately , before , during and after the Olympics . "
In San Francisco yesterday , the torch procession avoided the kinds of clashes with protesters seen earlier in the week in London and Paris , mainly because the authorities played a cunning game of cat and mouse with thousands of demonstrators who stood futilely along the scheduled route only to discover the plans had been switched .
Instead of being carried by runners along the city waterfront , the flame was taken by bus to an intersection in the heart of the city and then run at breakneck speed towards the Golden Gate Bridge .
The scheduled grand finale to the procession at the Embarcardero on San Francisco Bay never happened .
Some protesters following proceedings on television managed to find the parade and flash the occasional pro-Tibet sign , but were otherwise frustrated .
A member of the city 's board of supervisors , Aaron Peskin , accused the Mayor , Gavin Newsom , of playing into Chinese hands .
" He misled supporters and opponents of the run ... to please the Bush State Department and the Chinese government because of the incredible influence of money , " Mr Peskin said .
On Tuesday night , a huge rally and march was staged just outside San Francisco 's City Hall and ended outside the Chinese consulate a half hour 's walk away .
The protesters waved the Tibetan flag , sang the Tibetan national anthem , prayed , watched a Tibet freedom torch being lit – mirroring the symbolism of the Olympic flame .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton is losing ground to Sen. Barack Obama in a national CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released on the eve of critical Super Tuesday presidential primaries and caucuses .
The two are virtually tied in Monday 's survey , which shows the New York senator has lost a comfortable national lead she 's held for months over Obama and other rivals .
The survey also shows Arizona Sen. John McCain as the clear Republican front - runner .
Obama , who trounced Clinton in January 's South Carolina primary , garnered 49 percent of registered Democrats in Monday 's poll , while Clinton trailed by just three points , a gap well within the survey 's 4.5 percentage point margin of error .
View the poll results »
" Coming out of his overwhelming victory in South Carolina and followed quickly by his Kennedy family endorsements , Obama clearly has the momentum in this campaign , " said Bill Schneider , CNN 's senior political analyst .
Obama has won support from Sen. Edward Kennedy and his nieces Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and Maria Shriver , although Clinton has endorsements from former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend , the daughter of Robert Kennedy , and her brother Bobby Kennedy and sister Kerry .

In the battle for the GOP nomination , McCain has the backing of 44 percent of registered Republicans , while former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney received 29 percent , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee got 18 percent and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas won 6 percent .
McCain took the top spot in most national surveys of Republican voters after his January 8 victory in the New Hampshire primary .
Prior to that , former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani had the lead in the national polls .
Giuliani gave up his bid for the White House last week after a third - place finish in Florida 's primary .

CNN's " poll of polls " of the Republican race puts McCain at 45 percent compared with 24 percent for Romney .
" McCain is clearly the front - runner nationwide , thanks in part to his recent victories in South Carolina and Florida .
Both McCain and Obama are on the rise not only because they 've won important primary victories but because they 've captured the change issue .
Clinton and Romney tried to echo the change theme but do n't appear to have had much success , " Schneider said .
The economy remains the top issue on the minds of Americans , according to the new poll .
Two - thirds of those questioned say that the economy is in a recession .
That 's up five points from January and 20 points from October .

The economy ranked as the most important issue to 44 percent of those surveyed , while 20 percent cited the war in Iraq and 16 percent identified health care .
Illegal immigration was the most important issue to 10 percent of respondents , while 8 percent cited terrorism .
" Clinton has an advantage among registered Democrats on most issues , including the economy and health care , but Obama is seen as the candidate who would best handle Iraq , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .

The poll results come out one day before Super Tuesday , which is as close as the country comes to a national primary , as contests will be held 24 states and American Samoa .
The Democratic candidates will compete for 1,681 Democratic delegates Tuesday , less than 400 shy of the 2,025 needed to clinch the nomination .
On the Republican side , 1,020 delegates are at stake , just shy of the 1,191 needed to lock up the GOP nomination .

National polls may not be the best indicator of what could happen on Super Tuesday .
A look at polls in the crucial states voting Tuesday could give a clearer indication of what may occur .
In the Democratic race , two new polls in California have Clinton up by single digits .
New surveys suggest the race is virtually tied in Arizona and Missouri .
Clinton leads in Connecticut and New Jersey and is ahead by double digits in her home state of New York .
Obama leads in Georgia and is the clear front - runner in his home state of Illinois .
Watch how the race is stacking up in California »
McCain has a single - digit lead in California over Romney .
That could be one reason why Romney has added a last - minute campaign stop in California on Monday .
Polls suggest McCain has large leads in New York , New Jersey , Connecticut and Illinois , but he 's only ahead by single digits in Georgia and Missouri .
Watch Romney respond to McCain 's criticism »
The key to many races are undecided voters , which could make up from 10 to 15 percent of those who cast ballots .
There is one thing Democrats and Republicans agree upon , according to the poll , 58 percent of registered Democrats and 56 percent of registered Republicans say clear winners wo n't emerge from Super Tuesday .
Looking ahead to the general election in November , Clinton tops McCain 50 percent to 47 percent and beats Romney 56 to 41 in hypothetical matchups .
Obama beats McCain 52 percent to 44 percent and tops Romney 59 percent to 36 percent .
" Issues also appear to play a big role as registered voters nationwide look ahead to general elections matchups , " Holland said .
" Will the race boil down to a fight over foreign policy , or will 2008 be the year of ' It 's the Economy , Stupid -- the Sequel ' ?
If it 's foreign policy , McCain has the edge -- he is seen as better able to handle Iraq and terrorism than Clinton or Obama .
If it 's the economy , which is the top issue with voters , the Democrats have an advantage ; either Clinton or Obama is seen as better able to handle the economy than McCain , " Keating said .
The poll surveyed 1,192 adults .
Of 974 registered voters , 500 described themselves as Democrats and 412 identified themselves as Republicans .
The poll was conducted by telephone from February 1 - 3 , 2008 .

Gordon Brown will press ahead with toughening up cannabis laws despite claims there is no scientific basis for a change , it was revealed today .
The Government is to reject recommendations from a high - powered group of advisers who believe it should stay a " soft " drug .
The Prime Minister is believed to regard the move as crucial for sending a clear message to young people that cannabis is harmful and linked to serious crime .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A final report from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) was delivered to the Home Office today - although the Government 's response will not be announced until next week at the earliest .
The experts - including doctors , police , judges and drug counsellors - are understood have concluded that cannabis should remain in the Class C category .
However , Whitehall sources indicated that Mr Brown was determined to push through reclassification to Class B .
Going against the ACMD 's decision could spark a massive row and trigger resignations from the committee , which plays a crucial role in setting Britain 's drug policy .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne demanded that the panel 's recommendations be published .
" The Government must stop playing politics and publish this advice as soon as possible , " he said .
" There should be nothing secret about the scientific advice being given to ministers on this important issue . "
Shadow home secretary David Davis said : " This would not come a moment too soon .

" While Gordon Brown has dithered over this , over 24,000 people - including nearly 9,000 under 18s - are estimated to have been forced to seek treatment for cannabis misuse in England alone .
" One can not underestimate the real harm cannabis can do to a young person .
" The demotivating and debilitating effect cannabis can have at the most crucial stage in a young person 's development can seriously harm their life chances . "
A spokesman for Mr Brown said the results of the ACMD inquiry would not be published this week .
" We do have a statutory duty to take into account the advisory committee 's advice so there will need to be proper consideration of what they have to say once we 've seen the report in full , " he said .
Official data revealed earlier this year showed abuse of highly - potent " skunk " cannabis has escalated in the past six years with the drug now dominating the cannabis market in England and Wales .
The powerful strain accounted for just 15 % of seized cannabis in 2002 but now makes up between 70 % and 80 % , initial results of a Home Office - funded project showed .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has insisted she still has an open mind about whether cannabis should be reclassified , following reports that ministers would ignore the ACMD 's advice if they recommended keeping the drug in Class C .
Its downgrading from Class B in 2004 made possession of the drug a largely non-arrestable offence .
A Home Office spokesman said : " We have today received full advice on cannabis classification from the independent ACMD .
" We are grateful for its detailed report and will now consider it carefully alongside other representations before making a decision on the appropriate classification for cannabis .
" Our message has always been that cannabis is an illegal and harmful drug that should not be taken .
" While evidence shows that cannabis use is falling across all age ranges , we are concerned about stronger strains of the drug .
" That is why we asked the ACMD to undertake a review of cannabis classification . "
While your current PC may be dual - or quad - core , the one sitting on your desk in a couple of years will be a " many - core . "
Multicores are the future , and because programming them is so different than programming for traditional processors , you must prepare for the change now , especially in mapping basic algorithms efficiently onto the new hardware .
String searching is one of these basic algorithms .
It has a host of applications , including search engines , network intrusion detection , virus scanners , spam filters , and DNA analysis , among others .
The Cell processor , with its multiple cores , promises to speed - up string searching a lot .
In this article , we show how we mapped string searching efficiently on the Cell .
We present two implementations :
The fast implementation supports a small dictionary size ( approximately 100 patterns ) and provides a throughput of 40 Gbps , which is 100 times faster than reference implementations on x86 architectures .
The heavy - duty implementation is slower ( 3.3 - 4.3 Gbps ) , but supports dictionaries with tens of thousands of strings .
This task is not trivial .
We had to change our algorithm significantly to reach top performance .
In particular , to exploit the memory subsystem at its best , we employ a pipelined parallelization strategy , and we shuffle the data layout to fight congestion techniques that are unfamiliar to most programmers of traditional architectures .
Why Is String Searching So Important ?
The Internet is a dirty place , with malware , spyware , spam , and viruses trying to penetrate your systems through all possible vulnerabilities .
Undesired traffic cannot be filtered anymore on the basis of header information .
What 's needed is " deep - packet inspection , which checks the payload against a database containing signatures of a large number of threats .
But with network links getting faster ( 10 Gbps Ethernet , for instance ) , performing on - the - fly deep - packet inspection is n't child 's play .
For example , running the Snort ( www.snort.org) intrusion - detection system on a Pentium 4 PC only ensures a filtering throughput between 200- 400 Mbps .
This is why network appliance manufacturers often employ specialized hardware like Field - Programmable Gate Arrays ( FPGAs ) or Application - Specific Instruction Processors ( ASIPs ) .
The Cell processor is a new player in this field , with the potential to offer lots of computing power at low price .
In fact , its large production volumes ( it 's used in the Sony PlayStation 3 ) contribute to keeping its price low .
When did the practice of lawmaking require an accompanying press release issued by a professional PR firm ?
An embedded photo of the sponsoring state official , too ?
Shameless .
Nevertheless , it did bring our attention to a new law in the state of Washington which prohibits " malicious " RFID spying .
When the new law ( said to be a first of its kind in the US ) goes into effect in July , anyone caught scanning a person remotely " without his or her knowledge and consent , for the purpose of fraud , identity theft , or some other illegal purpose " will be charged with a Class C felony .
Great , so that covers the obvious criminal abuse of the technology .
However , the original bill also included an opt - in measure that would require your approval before retailers and others could track your activity via that handy , store - issued discount card you carry , the implant you received during that stint in the joint , new credit card , or personal ID card you 're required to carry .
Unfortunately , the opt - in requirement was stricken from the bill ( and therefore not in the final law ) after succumbing to heavy corporate lobbying .

There are 48,000 ' security contractors ' in Iraq , working for private companies growing rich on the back of US policy .
But can it be a good thing to have so many mercenaries operating without any democratic control ?
Jeremy Scahill reports
It was described as a " powder keg " moment .
In late May , just across the Tigris river from Baghdad 's fortified Green Zone , a heavily armed convoy of American forces was driving down a street near the Iraqi Interior Ministry .
They were transporting US officials in what is known widely among the occupation forces as the " red zone " - essentially , any area of Iraq that does not fall inside the US - built " emerald city " in the capital .
The American guards were on the look - out for any threat lurking on the roads .
Not far from their convoy , an Iraqi driver was pulling out of a petrol station .
When the Americans encountered the Iraqi driver , they determined him to be a potential suicide car bomber .
In Iraq it has become common for such convoys to fire off rounds from a machine gun at approaching Iraqi vehicles , much to the outrage of Iraqi civilians and officials .
The Americans say this particular Iraqi vehicle was getting too close to their convoy and that they tried to warn it to back off .
They say they fired a warning shot at the car 's radiator before firing directly into the windshield of the car , killing the driver .
Some Iraqi witnesses said the shooting was unprovoked .
In the ensuing chaos , the Americans reportedly refused to give their names or details of the incident to Iraqi officials , sparking a tense standoff between the Americans and Iraqi forces , both of which were armed with assault rifles .
It could have become even more bloody before a US military convoy arrived on the scene .
A senior US adviser to the Iraqi Interior Ministry 's intelligence division told the Washington Post that the incident threatened to " undermine a lot of the cordial relationships that have been built up over the past four years .
There 's a lot of angry people up here right now . "
While there is ongoing outrage between Iraqis and the military over such deadly incidents , this one came with a different , but increasingly common , twist :
The Americans involved in the shooting were neither US military nor civilians .
They were operatives working for a secretive mercenary firm based in the wilderness of North Carolina .
Its name is Blackwater USA .
It was hardly the company 's first taste of action in Iraq , where it has operated almost since the first days of the occupation .
Its convoys have been ambushed , its helicopters brought down , its men burned and dragged through the streets of Falluja , giving the Bush administration a justification for laying siege to the city .
In all , the company has lost about 30 men in Iraq .
It has also engaged in firefights with the Shia Mahdi Army , and succeeded by all means necessary in keeping alive every US ambassador to serve in post- invasion Iraq , along with more than 90 visiting US congressional delegations .
Just one day before the May shooting , in almost the exact same neighbourhood , Blackwater operatives found themselves in another gun battle , lasting an hour , that drew in both US military and Iraqi forces , in which at least four Iraqis are said to have died .
The shoot - out was reportedly spurred by a well - coordinated ambush of Blackwater 's convoy .
US sources said the guards " did their job " , keeping the officials alive .
In another incident that has caused major tensions between Baghdad and Washington , an off - duty Blackwater operative is alleged to have shot and killed an Iraqi bodyguard of the Shia vice - president Adil Abdul - Mahdi last Christmas Eve inside the Green Zone .
Blackwater officials confirm that after the incident they whisked the contractor safely out of Iraq , which they say Washington ordered them to do .
Iraqi officials labelled the killing a " murder " .
The company says it fired the contractor but he has yet to be publicly charged with any crime .
Iraqi officials have consistently complained about the conduct of Blackwater and other contractors - and the legal barriers to their attempts to investigate or prosecute alleged wrongdoing .
Four years into the occupation , there is absolutely no effective system of oversight or accountability governing contractors and their operations .
They have not been subjected to military justice , and only two cases have ever reached US civilian courts , under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act , which covers some contractors working abroad .
( One man was charged with stabbing a fellow contractor , in a case that has yet to go to trial , while the other was sentenced to three years for possession of child - pornography images on his computer at Abu Ghraib prison . )
No matter what their acts in Iraq , contractors cannot be prosecuted in Iraqi courts , thanks to US - imposed edicts dating back to Paul Bremer 's post- invasion Coalition Provisional Authority .
The internet is alive with videos of contractors seemingly using Iraqi vehicles for target practice , much to the embarrassment of the firms involved .
Yet , despite these incidents , and although 64 US soldiers have been court - martialled on murder - related charges , not a single armed contractor has been prosecuted for any crime , let alone a crime against an Iraqi .
US contractors in Iraq reportedly have a motto : " What happens here today , stays here today . "
At home in America , Blackwater is facing at least two wrongful - death lawsuits , one stemming from the mob killings of four of its men in Falluja in March 2004 , the other for a Blackwater plane crash in Afghanistan in November 2004 , in which a number of US soldiers were killed .
In both cases , families of the deceased charge that Blackwater 's negligence led to the deaths .
( Blackwater has argued that it cannot be sued and should enjoy the same immunity as the US military . )
The company is also facing a mounting Congressional investigation into its activities .
Despite all of this , US State Department officials heap nothing but words of praise on Blackwater for doing the job and doing it well .
There are now 630 companies working in Iraq on contract for the US government , with personnel from more than 100 countries offering services ranging from cooking and driving to the protection of high - ranking army officers .
Their 180,000 employees now outnumber America 's 160,000 official troops .
The precise number of mercenaries is unclear , but last year , a US government report identified 48,000 employees of private military / security firms .
Blackwater is far from being the biggest mercenary firm operating in Iraq , nor is it the most profitable .
But it has the closest proximity to the throne in Washington and to radical rightwing causes , leading some critics to label it a " Republican guard " .
Blackwater offers the services of some of the most elite forces in the world and is tasked with some of the occupation 's most " mission - critical " activities , namely keeping alive the most hated men in Baghdad - a fact it has deftly used as a marketing tool .
Since the Iraq invasion began four years ago , Blackwater has emerged out of its compound near the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina as the trendsetter of the mercenary industry , leading the way toward a legitimisation of one of the world 's dirtiest professions .
And it owes its meteoric rise to the policies of the Bush administration .
Since the launch of the " war on terror " , the administration has funnelled billions of dollars in public funds to US war corporations such as Blackwater USA , DynCorp and Triple Canopy .
These companies have used the money to build up private armies that rival or outgun many of the world 's national militaries .
A decade ago , Blackwater barely existed ; and yet its " diplomatic security " contracts since mid-2004 , with the State Department alone , total more than $ 750 m ( £ 370 m ) .
It protects the US ambassador and other senior officials in Iraq as well as visiting Congressional delegations ; it trains Afghan security forces , and was deployed in the oil - rich Caspian Sea region , setting up a " command and control " centre just miles from the Iranian border .
The company was also hired to protect emergency operations and facilities in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina , where it raked in $ 240,000 ( £ 120,000 ) a day from the American taxpayer , billing $ 950 ( £ 470 ) a day per Blackwater contractor .
Yet this is still just a fraction of the company 's business .
It also runs an impressive domestic law - enforcement and military training system inside the US .
While some of its competitors may have more forces deployed in more countries around the globe , none have organised their troops and facilities more like an actual military .
At present , Blackwater has forces deployed in nine countries and boasts a database of 21,000 additional troops at the ready , a fleet of more than 20 aircraft , including helicopter gun-ships , and the world 's largest private military facility - a 7,000 - acre compound in North Carolina .
It recently opened a new facility in Illinois ( Blackwater North ) and is fighting local opposition to a third planned domestic facility near San Diego ( Blackwater West ) by the Mexican border .
It is also manufacturing an armoured vehicle ( nicknamed the Grizzly ) and surveillance blimps .
The man behind this empire is 38 - year - old Erik Prince , a secretive , conservative Christian who once served with the US Navy 's special forces and has made major campaign contributions to President Bush and his allies .
Among Blackwater 's senior executives are J Cofer Black , former head of counterterrorism at the CIA ; Robert Richer , former deputy director of operations at the CIA ; Joseph Schmitz , former Pentagon inspector general ; and an impressive array of other retired military and intelligence officials .
Company executives recently announced the creation of a new private intelligence company , Total Intelligence , to be headed by Black and Richer .
Blackwater executives boast that some of their work for the government is so sensitive that the company cannot tell one federal agency what it is doing for another .
In many ways , Blackwater 's rapid ascent to prominence within the US war machine symbolises what could be called Bush 's mercenary revolution .
Much has been made of the administration 's " failure " to build international consensus for the invasion of Iraq , but perhaps that was never the intention .
Almost from the beginning , the White House substituted international diplomacy with lucrative war contracts .
When US tanks rolled into Iraq in March 2003 , they brought with them the largest army of " private contractors " ever deployed in a war .
While precise data on the extent of American spending on mercenary services is nearly impossible to obtain , Congressional sources say that the US has spent at least $ 6bn ( £ 3 bn ) in Iraq , while Britain has spent some £ 200 m .
Like America , Britain has used private security from firms like ArmorGroup to guard Foreign Office and International Development officials in Iraq .
Other British firms are used to protect private companies and media , but UK firms do their biggest business with Washington .
The single largest US contract for private security in Iraq has for years been held by the British firm Aegis , headed by Tim Spicer , the retired British lieutenant - colonel who was implicated in the Arms to Africa scandal of the late 1990s , when weapons were shipped to a Sierra Leone militia leader during a weapons embargo .
Aegis 's Iraq contract - essentially coordinating the private military firms in Iraq - was valued at approximately $ 300 m ( £ 1147 m ) and drew protests from US competitors and lawmakers .
At present , a US or British special forces veteran working for a private security company in Iraq can make $ 650 ( £ 320 ) a day , after the company takes its cut .
At times the rate has reached $ 1,000 ( £ 490 ) a day - pay that dwarfs that of active - duty troops .
" We got [ tens of thousands of ] contractors over there , some of them making more than the secretary of defense , " John Murtha , chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee , recently said .
" How in the hell do you justify that ? "
In part , these contractors do mundane jobs that traditionally have been performed by soldiers , from driving trucks to doing laundry .
These services are provided through companies such as Halliburton , KBR and Fluor and through their vast labyrinth of subcontractors .
But increasingly , private personnel are engaged in armed combat and " security " operations .
They interrogate prisoners , gather intelligence , operate rendition flights , protect senior occupation officials - including some commanding US generals - and in some cases have taken command of US and international troops in battle .
In an admission that speaks volumes about the extent of the privatisation , General David Petraeus , who is implementing Bush 's troop surge , said earlier this year that he has , at times , not been guarded in Iraq by the US military but " secured by contract security " .
At least three US commanding generals are currently being guarded in Iraq by hired guns .
" To have half of your army be contractors , I do n't know that there 's a precedent for that , " says Congressman Dennis Kucinich , a member of the House oversight and government reform committee , which has been investigating war contractors .
" There 's no democratic control and there 's no intention to have democratic control here . "
The implications , still unacknowledged by many US lawmakers and world leaders four years into this revolution , are devastating .
" One of the key tenets of managing international crises in the aftermath of the cold war was established in the first Gulf war , " says a veteran US diplomat , Joe Wilson , who served as the last US ambassador to Iraq before the 1991 Gulf war .
" It was that management of these crises would be a coalition of like - minded nation states under the auspices of a United Nations Security Council resolution which gave the exercise the benefit of international law . "
This time , " there is no underlying international legitimacy that sustains us throughout this action that we 've taken . "
Moreover , this revolution means the US no longer needs to rely on its own citizens and those of its nation - state allies to staff its wars , nor does it need to implement a draft , which would have made the Iraq war politically untenable .
Just as importantly , perhaps , it reduces the figure of " official " casualties .
In Iraq alone , more than 900 US contractors have been killed , with another 13,000 wounded .
The majority of these are not American citizens and these numbers are not counted in the official death toll at a time when Americans are increasingly disturbed by their losses .
In Iraq , many contractors are run by Americans or Britons and have elite forces staffed by well - trained veterans of powerful militaries for use in sensitive actions or operations .
But lower down , the ranks are filled by Iraqis and third - country nationals .
Hundreds of Chilean mercenaries , for example , have been deployed by US companies such as Blackwater and Triple Canopy , despite the fact that Chile opposed the invasion and continues to oppose the occupation of Iraq .
Some of the Chileans are alleged to be seasoned veterans of the Pinochet era .
Some 118,000 of the estimated 180,000 contractors in Iraq are Iraqis .
The mercenary industry points to this as encouraging : we are giving Iraqis jobs , albeit occupying their own country in the service of a private corporation hired by a hostile invading power .
As Doug Brooks , the head of the Orwellian - named mercenary trade group , the International Peace Operations Association , argued early in the occupation , " Museums do not need to be guarded by Abrams tanks when an Iraqi security guard working for a contractor can do the same job for less than one - 50th of what it costs to maintain an American soldier .
Hiring local guards gives Iraqis a stake in a successful future for their country .
They use their pay to support their families and stimulate the economy .
Perhaps most significantly , every guard means one less potential guerrilla . "
In many ways , however , it is the exact model used by multinational corporations that depend on poorly paid workers in developing countries to staff their highly profitable operations .
This keeps prices down in the industrialised world and consumers numb to the reality of how the product ends up in their shopping basket .
" We have now seen the emergence of the hollow army , " says Naomi Klein , whose forthcoming book , The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , explores these themes .
" Much as with so - called hollow corporations such as Nike , billions are spent on military technology and design in rich countries while the manual labour and sweat work of invasion and occupation is increasingly outsourced to contractors who compete with each other to fill the work order for the lowest price .
Just as this model breeds rampant abuse in the manufacturing sector - with the big - name brands always able to plead ignorance about the actions of their suppliers - so it does in the military , though with stakes that are immeasurably higher . "
In the case of Iraq , what is particularly frightening is that the US and UK governments could give the public the false impression that the occupation was being scaled down , while in reality it was simply being privatised .
Indeed , shortly after Tony Blair announced that he wanted to withdraw 1,600 soldiers from Basra , reports emerged that the British government was considering sending in private security companies to " fill the gap left behind " .
Outsourcing is increasingly extending to extremely sensitive sectors , including intelligence .
The investigative blogger RJ Hillhouse , whose site TheSpyWhoBilledMe.com regularly breaks news on the clandestine world of private contractors and US intelligence , recently established that Washington spends $ 42bn ( £ 21 bn ) annually on private intelligence contractors , up from $ 18bn in 2000 .
Currently , that spending represents 70 % of the US intelligence budget .
But the mercenary forces are also diversifying geographically : in Latin America , the massive US firm DynCorp is operating in Colombia , Bolivia and other countries as part of the " war on drugs " - US defence contractors are receiving nearly half the $ 630 m in US military aid for Colombia ; in Africa , mercenaries are deploying in Somalia , Congo and Sudan and increasingly have their sights set on tapping into the hefty UN peacekeeping budget ; inside the US , private security staff now outnumber official law enforcement .
Heavily armed mercenaries were deployed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , while there are proposals to privatise the US border patrol .
Brooks , the private military industry lobbyist , says people should not become " overly obsessed with Iraq " , saying his association 's member companies " have more personnel working in UN and African Union peace operations than all but a handful of countries " .
Most worryingly of all , perhaps , powers that were once the exclusive realm of national governments are now in the hands of private companies whose prime loyalty is to their shareholders .
CIA - type services , special operations , covert actions and small - scale military and paramilitary forces are now on the world market in a way not seen in modern history .
While the private military / security industry rejects the characterisation of their forces as mercenaries , Blackwater executives have turned the grey area in which they operate into a brand asset .
The company has been quietly marketing its services to foreign governments and corporations through an off - shore affiliate , Greystone Ltd , registered in Barbados .
In early 2005 , Blackwater held an extravagant , invitation - only Greystone " inauguration " at the swanky Ritz - Carlton hotel in Washington , DC .
The guest list for the seven - hour event included weapons manufacturers , oil companies and diplomats from the likes of Uzbekistan , Yemen , the Philippines , Romania , Indonesia , Tunisia , Algeria , Hungary , Poland , Croatia , Kenya , Angola and Jordan .
Several of those countries ' defence or military attaches attended .
" It is more difficult than ever for your country to successfully protect its interests against diverse and complicated threats in today 's grey world , " Greystone 's promotional pamphlet told attendees .
" Greystone is an international security services company that offers your country or organisation a complete solution to your most pressing security needs . "
Greystone said its forces were prepared for " ready deployment in support of national security objectives as well as private interests " .
Among the " services " offered were mobile security teams , which could be employed for personal security operations , surveillance and countersurveillance .
Applicants for jobs with Greystone were asked to check off their qualifications in weapons : AK - 47 rifle , Glock 19 , M - 16 series rifle , M - 4 carbine rifle , machine gun , mortar and shoulder - fired weapons .
Among the skills sought were : Sniper , Marksman , Door Gunner , Explosive Ordnance , Counter Assault Team .
While Blackwater has become one of the most powerful and influential private actors in international conflict since the launch of the war on terror , in many ways it is like a small , high - end boutique surrounded by megastores such as DynCorp , ArmourGroup and Erynis , operating in a $ 100bn industry .
In fact , experts say , there are now more private military companies operating internationally than there are member nations at the UN .
" I think it 's extraordinarily dangerous when a nation begins to outsource its monopoly on the use of force ... in support of its foreign policy or national security objectives , " says Wilson .
The billions of dollars being doled out to these companies , he says , " makes of them a very powerful interest group within the American body politic and an interest group that is , in fact , armed .
And the question will arise at some time : to whom do they owe their loyalty ? "
Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky , a Democrat and a leading member of the House select committee on intelligence , echoes those fears .
" The one thing the people think of as being in the purview of the government is the use of military power .
Suddenly you 've got a for - profit corporation going around the world that is more powerful than states " .
At war with the Pentagon
How Rumsfeld paved the way for Blackwater
The world was a very different place on September 10 2001 , when Donald Rumsfeld stepped on to the podium at the Pentagon to deliver one of his first major addresses as defense secretary under President George W Bush .
For most Americans , there was no such thing as al - Qaida , and Saddam Hussein was still the president of Iraq .
Rumsfeld had served in the post once before - under President Gerald Ford , from 1975 to 1977 - and he returned to the job in 2001 with ambitious visions .
That September day , in the first year of the Bush administration , Rumsfeld addressed the Pentagon officials in charge of overseeing the high - stakes business of defence contracting - managing the Halliburtons , DynCorps and Bechtels .
The secretary stood before a gaggle of former corporate executives from Enron , Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics and Aerospace Corporation whom he had tapped as his top deputies at the department of defense , and he issued a declaration of war .
" The topic today is an adversary that poses a threat , a serious threat , to the security of the United States of America , " Rumsfeld thundered .
" This adversary is one of the world 's last bastions of central planning .
It governs by dictating five - year plans .
From a single capital , it attempts to impose its demands across time zones , continents , oceans and beyond .
With brutal consistency , it stifles free thought and crushes new ideas .
It disrupts the defence of the United States and places the lives of men and women in uniform at risk . "
Pausing briefly for dramatic effect , Rumsfeld - himself a veteran cold warrior - told his new staff , " Perhaps this adversary sounds like the former Soviet Union , but that enemy is gone : our foes are more subtle and implacable today .
You may think I 'm describing one of the last decrepit dictators of the world .
But their day , too , is almost past , and they cannot match the strength and size of this adversary .
The adversary 's much closer to home .
It 's the Pentagon bureaucracy . "
Rumsfeld called for a wholesale shift in the running of the Pentagon , supplanting the old department of defense bureaucracy with a new model , one based on the private sector .
The problem , Rumsfeld said , was that unlike businesses , " governments ca n't die , so we need to find other incentives for bureaucracy to adapt and improve . "
The stakes , he declared , were dire - " a matter of life and death , ultimately , every American's . "
That day , Rumsfeld announced a major initiative to streamline the use of the private sector in the waging of America 's wars and predicted his initiative would meet fierce resistance .
" Some might ask , ' How in the world could the secretary of defense attack the Pentagon in front of its people ? ' "
Rumsfeld told his audience .
" To them I reply , I have no desire to attack the Pentagon ; I want to liberate it .
We need to save it from itself . "
The next morning , the Pentagon would literally be attacked as American Airlines Flight 77 - a Boeing 757 - smashed into its western wall .
Rumsfeld would famously assist rescue workers in pulling bodies from the rubble .
But it did n't take long for him to seize the almost unthinkable opportunity presented by 9/11 to put his personal war on the fast track .

Cheri Oteri's Father , Gataeno Thomas ' Tom ' Oteri , Murdered in Nashville
father of former Saturday Night Live cast member , was murdered by his roommate , country music songwriterin Nashville , TN , Saturday night .
Oteri , a Nashville music producer , had collaborated with Fagan on several songs .
Fagan was pulled over Saturday night for a DUI and told police that there was a fight between he and Oteri at their south Nashville home , and he used a pocket knife to cut Oteri across his body before leaving the scene .
Oteri's body was discovered at the home by a friend on Sunday afternoon .
According to authorities , Cheri Oteri has been informed of her father 's death .
Mexico just keeps getting deadlier .
Even as President Felipe Calderón dispatched more than 24,000 military and security forces to pacify areas overrun by drug gangs , the country saw more than 2,500 deaths related to the drug trade in 2007 .
Mexico has logged important successes , from extraditions to drug seizures , and Mr. Calderón 's administration has been lauded by many observers as the boldest in recent history in the face of organized crime .
On Monday , officials announced the arrest of one of Mexico 's top operatives , a suspected leader of the infamous Sinaloa cartel .
But with each victory comes another daylight shootout , another federal agent down , and a heightened perception that the problem is bigger than Mexico can solve alone .
So far , the administration has refused to back down and increasingly is appealing to the US for support .
A new rhetoric of " shared responsibility " between the two nations was underscored by the recent visit of US Attorney General Michael Mukasey in Mexico .
While the cooperation generates suspicion among those who worry that the US will seek to impose its own interests , many say a bilateral approach is critical if Mexico is to come out from under the deluge of drug violence .
" This is the new perspective of both the Mexican and US governments , " says Erubiel Tirado , director of the national security program at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City .
" But the Mexican state must define the bilateral agenda , not just the American agenda . "
Violence flaring up in Tijuana
Some of the most recent violence has flared in Tijuana , just south of San Diego .
Last week , a federal agent was killed in a shootout that played out in range of schoolchildren .
Earlier in the week , a police commander was murdered at home , along with his wife and daughter .
President Calderón has vowed to press on .
" It is possible to win the battle for public security , " Calderón said earlier this month .
" But to achieve that , we must remain united . "
In fact , many say that the spikes in violence are a result of increased pressure on the drug lords – and that it will get worse before it gets better , especially if the first $ 500 million of a potential $ 1.4 billion US aid package known as the Merida Initiative is approved to assist in enforcmeent .
" Should the Merida Initiative go through , it 's not overnight that the Mexican government , in conjunction with the US , will defeat organized crime , " says Armand Peschard - Sverdrup , an expert on Mexico and head of the Washington - based consulting firm Peschard - Sverdrup & Associates .
" This is a protracted process , and I think in the short term there will be a natural pushback from organized crime . "
Cartel vs. cartel
The growing violence in Mexico is largely attributed to battles between the major drug groups operating in Mexico , including the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels , and the fracturing that has taken place as leaders are arrested and factions have vied to assert control over lucrative smuggling routes .
Violence has even spilled over to the US .
This weekend , a US Border Patrol agent was killed by a suspected drug smuggler when he tried to stop their fleeing Hummer .
The US has hailed the Calderón administration 's efforts .
In response to the arrest of the alleged Sinaloa cartel leader , Alfredo Beltrán Leyva , US Ambassador Tony Garza said in a statement : " When Mexico takes dangerous criminals like Beltrán Leyva and his crew off the streets , the people of the United States also benefit . "
US Attorney General Mukasey pledged to help stop the flow of US guns into Mexico , which has long been blamed for the spectacular gun wars that often break out across this country .
He said US authorities are giving their Mexican counterparts more access to electronic databases to help trace weapons and plan to introduce a Spanish edition of the database soon .
Not all observers welcome a heavy hand from the north .
Mr. Tirado says that cooperation is crucial , but worries that Mexico is reacting to what the US wants .
" If you do not have a bilateral perspective , and are only following the north , you are not taking an integral approach , " he says .
Many also want greater focus on mid-term objectives , such as rooting out corruption , improving the judicial system , and lessening demand for drugs in the US and , increasingly , Mexico .
" If we are not looking at the causes of the violence , the problems will not go away , " says Jose Maria Ramos , a security expert at the research institute Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Tijuana .

You ’re about to see the mother of all flamewars on internet groups where web developers hang out .
It ’ll make the Battle of Stalingrad look like that time your sister - in - law stormed out of afternoon tea at your grandmother ’s and wrapped the Mustang around a tree .
This upcoming battle will be presided over by Dean Hachamovitch , the Microsoft veteran currently running the team that ’s going to bring you the next version of Internet Explorer , 8.0 .
The IE 8 team is in the process of making a decision that lies perfectly , exactly , precisely on the fault line smack in the middle of two different ways of looking at the world .
It ’s the difference between conservatives and liberals , it ’s the difference between “ idealists ” and “ realists , ” it ’s a huge global jihad dividing members of the same family , engineers against computer scientists , and Lexuses vs. olive trees .
And there ’s no solution .
But it will be really , really entertaining to watch , because 99 % of the participants in the flame wars are not going to understand what they ’re talking about .
It ’s not just entertainment : it ’s required reading for every developer who needs to design interoperable systems .
The flame war will revolve around the issue of something called “ web standards . ”
I ’ll let Dean introduce the problem :
All browsers have a “ Standards ” mode , call it “ Standards mode , ” and use it to offer a browser ’s best implementation of web standards .
Each version of each browser has its own Standards mode , because each version of each browser improves on its web standards support .
There ’s Safari 3 ’s Standards mode , Firefox 2 ’s Standards mode , IE6 ’s Standards mode , and IE7 ’s Standards mode , and they ’re all different .
We want to make IE8 ’s Standards mode much , much better than IE7 ’s Standards mode .
And the whole problem hinges on the little tiny decision of what IE8 should do when it encounters a page that claims to support “ standards ” , but has probably only been tested against IE7 .
What the hell is a standard ?
Do n’t they have standards in all kinds of engineering endeavors ?
( Yes . )
Do n’t they usually work ?
( Mmmm … .. )
Why are “ web standards ” so frigging messed up ?
( It ’s not just Microsoft ’s fault .
It ’s your fault too .
And Jon Postel ’s ( 1943-1998 ) .
I ’ll explain that later . )
There is no solution .
Each solution is terribly wrong .
Eric Bangeman at ars technica writes , “ The IE team has to walk a fine line between tight support for W3C standards and making sure sites coded for earlier versions of IE still display correctly . ”
This is incorrect .
It ’s not a fine line .
It ’s a line of negative width .
There is no place to walk .
They are damned if they do and damned if they do n’t .
That ’s why I ca n’t take sides on this issue and I ’m not going to .
But every working software developer should understand , at least , how standards work , how standards should work , how we got into this mess , so I want to try to explain a little bit about the problem here , and you ’ll see that it ’s the same reason Microsoft Vista is selling so poorly , and it ’s the same issue I wrote about when I referred to the Raymond Chen camp ( pragmatists ) at Microsoft vs. the MSDN camp ( idealists ) , the MSDN camp having won , and now nobody can figure out where their favorite menu commands went in Microsoft Office 2007 , and nobody wants Vista , and it ’s all the same debate : whether you are an Idealist ( ” red ” ) or a Pragmatist ( ” blue ” ) .
Let me start at the beginning .
Let ’s start by thinking about how to get things to work together .
What kinds of things ?
Anything , really .
A pencil and a pencil sharpener .
A telephone and a telephone system .
An HTML page and a web browser .
A Windows GUI application and the Windows operating system .
Facebook and a Facebook Application .
Stereo headphones and stereos .
At the point of contact between those two items , there are all kinds of things that have to be agreed , or they wo n’t work together .
I ’ll work through a simple example .
Imagine that you went to Mars , where you discovered that the beings who live there do n’t have the portable music player .
They ’re still using boom boxes .
You realize this is a huge business opportunity and start selling portable MP3 players ( except on Mars they ’re called Qxyzrhjjjjukltks ) and compatible headphones .
To connect the MP3 player to the headphones , you invent a neat kind of metal jack that looks like this :
Because you control the player and the headphone , you can ensure that your player works with your headphones .
This is a ONE TO ONE market .
One player , one headphone .
Maybe you write up a spec , hoping that third parties will make different color headphones , since Marslings are very particular about the color of things that they stick in their earlings .
And you forgot , when you wrote the spec , to document that the voltage should be around 1.4 volts .
You just forgot .
So the first aspiring manufacturer of 100 % compatible headphones comes along , his speaker is only expecting 0.014 volts , and when he tests his prototype , it either blows out the headphones , or the eardrums of the listener , whichever comes first .
And he makes some adjustments and eventually gets a headphone that works fine and is just a couple of angstroms more fierce than your headphones .
More and more manufacturers show up with compatible headphones , and soon we ’re in a ONE TO MANY market .
So far , all is well .
We have a de-facto standard for headphone jacks here .
The written spec is not complete and not adequate , but anybody who wants to make a compatible headphone just has to plug it into your personal stereo device and test it , and if it works , all is well , they can sell it , and it will work .
Until you decide to make a new version , the Qxyzrhjjjjukltk 2.0 .
The Qxyzrhjjjjukltk 2.0 is going to include a telephone ( turns out Marslings did n’t figure out cell phones on their own , either ) and the headphone is going to have to have a built - in microphone , which requires one more conductor , so you rework the connector into something totally incompatible and kind of ugly , with all kinds of room for expansion :
And the Qxyzrhjjjjukltk 2.0 is a complete and utter failure in the market .
Yes , it has a nice telephone thing , but nobody cared about that .
They cared about their large collections of headphones .
It turns out that when I said Marslings are very particular about the color of things that they stick in their ears , I meant it .
Most trendy Marslings at this point have a whole closet full of nice headphones .
They all look the same to you ( red ) , but Marslings are very , very finicky about shades of red in a way that you never imagined .
The newest high - end apartments on Mars are being marketed with a headphone closet .
I kid you not .
So the new jack is not such a success , and you quickly figure out a new scheme :
Notice that you ’ve now split the main shaft to provide another conductor for the microphone signal , but the trouble is , your Qxyzrhjjjjukltk 2.1 does n’t really know whether the headset that ’s plugged in has a mic or not , and it needs to know this so it can decide whether to enable phone calls .
And so you invent a little protocol … the new device puts a signal on the mic pin , and looks for it on the ground , and if it ’s there , it must be a three conductor plug , and therefore they do n’t have a mic , so you ’ll go into backwards compatibility mode where you only play music .
It ’s simple , but it ’s a protocol negotiation .
It ’s not a ONE - MANY market any more .
All the stereo devices are made by the same firm , one after the other , so I ’m going to call this a SEQUENCE - MANY market :
Here are some SEQUENCE - MANY markets you already know about :
Facebook | about 20,000 Facebook Apps Windows | about 1,000,000 Windows Apps Microsoft Word | about 1,000,000,000 Word documents
There are hundreds of other examples .
The key thing to remember is that when a new version of the left - hand device comes out , it has to maintain auto - backwards - compatibility with all the old right - hand accessories meant to work with the old device , because those old accessories could not possibly have designed with the new product in mind .
The Martian headphones are already made .
You ca n’t go back and change them all .
It ’s much easier and more sensible to change the newly invented device so that it acts like an old device when confronted with an old headphone .
And because you want to make progress , adding new features and functionality , you also need a new protocol for new devices to use , and the sensible thing to do is to have both devices negotiate a little bit at the beginning to decide whether they both understand the latest protocol .
SEQUENCE -MANY is the world Microsoft grew up in .
But there ’s one more twist , the MANY - MANY market .
A few years pass ; you ’re still selling Qxyzrhjjjjukltks like crazy ; but now there are lots of Qxyzrhjjjjukltk clones on the market , like the open source FireQx , and lots of headphones , and you all keep inventing new features that require changes to the headphone jack and it ’s driving the headphone makers crazy because they have to test their new designs out against every Qxyzrhjjjjukltk clone which is costly and time consuming and frankly most of them do n’t have time and just get it to work on the most popular Qxyzrhjjjjukltk 5.0 , and if that works , they ’re happy , but of course when you plug the headphones into FireQx 3.0 lo and behold they explode in your hands because of a slight misunderstanding about some obscure thing in the spec which nobody really understands called hasLayout , and everybody understands that when it ’s raining the hasLayout property is true and the voltage is supposed to increase to support the windshield - wiper feature , but there seems to be some debate over wheth er hail and snow are rain for the purpose of hasLayout , because the spec just does n’t say .
FireQx 3.0 treats snow as rain , because you need windshield wipers in the snow , Qxyzrhjjjjukltk 5.0 does not , because the programmer who worked on that feature lives in a warm part of Mars without snow and does n’t have a driver ’s license anyway .
Yes , they have driver ’s licenses on Mars .
And eventually some tedious bore writes a lengthy article on her blog explaining a trick you can use to make Qxyzrhjjjjukltk 5.0 behave just like FireQx 3.0 through taking advantage of a bug in Qxyzrhjjjjukltk 5.0 in which you trick Qxyzrhjjjjukltk into deciding that it ’s raining when it ’s snowing by melting a little bit of the snow , and it ’s ridiculous , but everyone does it , because they have to solve the hasLayout incompatibility .
Then the Qxyzrhjjjjukltk team fixes that bug in 6.0 , and you ’re screwed again , and you have to go find some new bug to exploit to make your windshield - wiper - equipped headphone work with either device .
NOW .
This is the MANY - MANY market .
Many players on the left hand side who do n’t cooperate , and SCRILLIONS of players on the right hand side .
And they ’re all making mistakes because To Err Is Human .
And of course this is the situation we find ourselves in with HTML .
Dozens of common browsers , literally billions of web pages .
And over the years what happens in a MANY - MANY market is that there is a hue and cry for “ standards ” so that “ all the players ” ( meaning , the small players ) have an equal chance to being able to display all 8 billion web pages correctly , and , even more importantly , so that the designers of those 8 billion pages only have to test against one browser , and use “ web standards , ” and then they will know that their page will also work in other browsers , without having to test every page against every browser .
See , the idea is , instead of many - many testing , you have many - standard and standard - many testing and you need radically fewer tests .
Not to mention that your web pages do n’t need any browser - specific code to work around bugs in individual browsers , because in this platonic world there are no bugs .
That ’s the ideal .
In practice , with the web , there ’s a bit of a problem : no way to test a web page against the standard , because there ’s no reference implementation that guarantees that if it works , all the browsers work .
This just does n’t exist .
So you have to “ test ” in your own head , purely as a thought experiment , against a bunch of standards documents which you probably never read and could n’t completely understand even if you did .
Those documents are super confusing .
The specs are full of statements like “ If a sibling block box ( that does not float and is not absolutely positioned ) follows the run-in box , the run -in box becomes the first inline box of the block box .
A run-in cannot run in to a block that already starts with a run-in or that itself is a run-in . ”
Whenever I read things like that , I wonder how anyone correctly conforms to the spec .
There is no practical way to check if the web page you just coded conforms to the spec .
There are validators , but they wo n’t tell you what the page is supposed to look like , and having a “ valid ” page where all the text is overlapping and nothing lines up and you ca n’t see anything is not very useful .
What people do is check their pages against one browser , maybe two , until it looks right .
And if they ’ve made a mistake that just happens to look OK in IE and Firefox , they ’re not even going to know about it .
And their pages may break when a future web browser comes out .
If you ’ve ever visited the ultra - orthodox Jewish communities of Jerusalem , all of whom agree in complete and utter adherence to every iota of Jewish law , you will discover that despite general agreement on what constitutes kosher food , that you will not find a rabbi from one ultra - orthodox community who is willing to eat at the home of a rabbi from a different ultra-orthodox community .
And the web designers are discovering what the Jews of Mea Shearim have known for decades : just because you all agree to follow one book does n’t ensure compatibility , because the laws are so complex and complicated and convoluted that it ’s almost impossible to understand them all well enough to avoid traps and landmines , and you ’re safer just asking for the fruit plate .
Standards are a great goal , of course , but before you become a standards fanatic you have to understand that due to the failings of human beings , standards are sometimes misinterpreted , sometimes confusing and even ambiguous .
The precise problem here is that you ’re pretending that there ’s one standard , but since nobody has a way to test against the standard , it ’s not a real standard : it ’s a platonic ideal and a set of misinterpretations , and therefore the standard is not serving the desired goal of reducing the test matrix in a MANY - MANY market .
DOCTYPE is a myth .
A mortal web designer who attaches a DOCTYPE tag to their web page saying , “ this is standard HTML , ” is committing an act of hubris .
There is no way they know that .
All they are really saying is that the page was meant to be standard HTML .
All they really know is that they tested it with IE , Firefox , maybe Opera and Safari , and it seems to work .
Or , they copied the DOCTYPE tag out of a book and do n’t know what it means .
In the real world where people are imperfect , you ca n’t have a standard with just a spec–you must have a super - strict reference implementation , and everybody has to test against the reference implementation .
Otherwise you get 17 different “ standards ” and you might as well not have one at all .
And this is where Jon Postel caused a problem , back in 1981 , when he coined the robustness principle : “ Be conservative in what you do , be liberal in what you accept from others . ”
What he was trying to say was that the best way to make the protocols work robustly would be if everyone was very , very careful to conform to the specification , but they should be also be extremely forgiving when talking to partners that do n’t conform exactly to the specification , as long as you can kind of figure out what they meant .
So , technically , the way to make a paragraph with small text is < p > < small > , but a lot of people wrote < small > < p > which is technically incorrect for reasons most web developers do n’t understand , and the web browsers forgave them and made the text small anyway , because that ’s obviously what they wanted to happen .
Now there are all these web pages out there with errors , because all the early web browser developers made super - liberal , friendly , accommodating browsers that loved you for who you were and did n’t care if you made a mistake .
And so there were lots of mistakes .
And Postel ’s “ robustness ” principle did n’t really work .
The problem was n’t noticed for many years .
In 2001 Marshall Rose finally wrote :
Counter - intuitively , Postel ’s robustness principle ( “ be conservative in what you send , liberal in what you accept ” ) often leads to deployment problems .
Why ?
When a new implementation is initially fielded , it is likely that it will encounter only a subset of existing implementations .
If those implementations follow the robustness principle , then errors in the new implementation will likely go undetected .
The new implementation then sees some , but not widespread deployment .
This process repeats for several new implementations .
Eventually , the not - quite - correct implementations run into other implementations that are less liberal than the initial set of implementations .
The reader should be able to figure out what happens next .
Jon Postel should be honored for his enormous contributions to the invention of the Internet , and there is really no reason to fault him for the infamous robustness principle .
1981 is prehistoric .
If you had told Postel that there would be 90 million untrained people , not engineers , creating web sites , and they would be doing all kinds of awful things , and some kind of misguided charity would have caused the early browser makers to accept these errors and display the page anyway , he would have understood that this is the wrong principle , and that , actually , the web standards idealists are right , and the way the web “ should have ” been built would be to have very , very strict standards and every web browser should be positively obnoxious about pointing them all out to you and web developers that could n’t figure out how to be “ conservative in what they emit ” should not be allowed to author pages that appear anywhere until they get their act together .
But , of course , if that had happened , maybe the web would never have taken off like it did , and maybe instead , we ’d all be using a gigantic Lotus Notes network operated by AT&T .
Shudder .
Shoulda woulda coulda .
Who cares .
We are where we are .
We ca n’t change the past , only the future .
Heck , we can barely even change the future .
And if you ’re a pragmatist on the Internet Explorer 8.0 team , you might have these words from Raymond Chen seared into your cortex .
He was writing about how Windows XP had to emulate buggy behavior from old versions of Windows :
Look at the scenario from the customer ’s standpoint .
You bought programs X , Y and Z . You then upgraded to Windows XP .
Your computer now crashes randomly , and program Z does n’t work at all .
You ’re going to tell your friends , “ Do n’t upgrade to Windows XP .
It crashes randomly , and it ’s not compatible with program Z. ”
Are you going to debug your system to determine that program X is causing the crashes , and that program Z does n’t work because it is using undocumented window messages ?
Of course not .
You ’re going to return the Windows XP box for a refund .
( You bought programs X , Y , and Z some months ago .
The 30 - day return policy no longer applies to them .
The only thing you can return is Windows XP . )
And you ’re thinking , hmm , let ’s update this for today :
Look at the scenario from the customer ’s standpoint .
You bought programs X , Y and Z . You then upgraded to Windows XPVista .
Your computer now crashes randomly , and program Z does n’t work at all .
You ’re going to tell your friends , “ Do n’t upgrade to Windows XPVista .
It crashes randomly , and it ’s not compatible with program Z. ”
Are you going to debug your system to determine that program X is causing the crashes , and that program Z does n’t work because it is using undocumentedinsecure window messages ?
Of course not .
You ’re going to return the Windows XPVista box for a refund .
( You bought programs X , Y , and Z some months ago .
The 30 - day return policy no longer applies to them .
The only thing you can return is Windows XPVista . )
The victory of the idealists over the pragmatists at Microsoft , which I reported in 2004 , directly explains why Vista is getting terrible reviews and selling poorly .
And how does it apply to the IE team ?
Look at the scenario from the customer ’s standpoint .
You visit 100 websites a day .
You then upgraded to IE 8 .
On half of them , the page is messed up , and Google Maps does n’t work at all .
You ’re going to tell your friends , “ Do n’t upgrade to IE 8 .
It messes up every page , and Google Maps does n’t work at all . ”
Are you going to View Source to determine that website X is using nonstandard HTML , and Google Maps does n’t work because it is using non-standard JavaScript objects from old versions of IE that were never accepted by the standards committee ?
Of course not .
You ’re going to uninstall IE 8 .
( Those websites are out of your control .
Some of them were developed by people who are now dead .
The only thing you can do is go back to IE 7 ) .
And so if you ’re a developer on the IE 8 team , your first inclination is going to be to do exactly what has always worked in these kinds of SEQUENCE - MANY markets .
You ’re going to do a little protocol negotiation , and continue to emulate the old behavior for every site that does n’t explicitly tell you that they expect the new behavior , so that all existing web pages continue to work , and you ’re only going to have the nice new behavior for sites that put a little flag on the page saying , “ Yo ! I grok IE 8 !
Give me all the new IE 8 Goodness Please ! ”
And indeed that was the first decision announced by the IE team on January 21st .
The web browser would accommodate existing pages silently so that nobody had to change their web site by acting like the old , buggy IE7 that web developers hated .
A pragmatic engineer would have to come to the conclusion that the IE team ’s first decision was right .
But the young idealist “ standards ” people went nuclear .
IE needed to provide a web standards experience without requiring a special “ Yo! I ’m tested with IE 8 ! ” tag , they said .
They were sick of special tags .
Every frigging web page has to have thirty seven ugly hacks in it to make it work with five or six popular browsers .
Enough ugly hacks .
8 billion existing web pages be damned .
And the IE team flip - flopped .
Their second decision , and I have to think it ’s not final , their second decision was to do the idealistic thing , and treat all sites that claim to be “ standards - compliant ” as if they have been designed for and tested with IE8 .
Almost every web site I visited with IE8 is broken in some way .
Websites that use a lot of JavaScript are generally completely dead .
A lot of pages simply have visual problems : things in the wrong place , popup menus that pop under , mysterious scrollbars in the middle .
Some sites have more subtle problems : they look ok but as you go further you find that critical form wo n’t submit or leads to a blank page .
These are not web pages with errors .
They are usually websites which were carefully constructed to conform to web standards .
But IE 6 and IE 7 did n’t really conform to the specs , so these sites have little hacks in them that say , “ on Internet Explorer … move this thing 17 pixels to the right to compensate for IE ’s bug . ”
And IE 8 is IE , but it no longer has the IE 7 bug where it moved that thing 17 pixels left of where it was supposed to be according to web standards .
So now code that was written that was completely reasonable no longer works .
IE 8 ca n’t display most web pages correctly until you give up and press the “ ACT LIKE IE7 ″ button .
The idealists do n’t care : they want those pages changed .
Some of those pages ca n’t be changed .
They might be burned onto CD - ROMs .
Some of them were created by people who are now dead .
Most of them created by people who have no frigging idea what ’s going on and why their web page , which they paid a designer to create 4 years ago , is now not working properly .
The idealists rejoiced .
Hundreds of them descended on the IE blog to actually say nice things about Microsoft for the first times in their lives .
I looked at my watch .
Tick , tick , tick .
Within a matter of seconds , you started to see people on the forums showing up like this one :
I have downloaded IE 8 and with it some bugs .
Some of my websites like “ HP ” are very difficult to read as the whole page is very very small …
The speed of my Internet has also been reduced on some occasions .
Whe I use Google Maps , there are overlays everywhere , enough so it makes it ackward to use !
Mmhmm .
All you smug idealists are laughing at this newbie / idjit .
The consumer is not an idiot .
She ’s your wife .
So stop laughing .
98 % of the world will install IE8 and say , “ It has bugs and I ca n’t see my sites . ”
They do n’t give a flicking flick about your stupid religious enthusiasm for making web browsers which conform to some mythical , platonic “ standard ” that is not actually implemented anywhere .
They do n’t want to hear your stories about messy hacks .
They want web browsers that work with actual web sites .
So you see , we have a terrific example here of a gigantic rift between two camps .
The web standards camp seems kind of Trotskyist .
You ’d think they ’re the left wing , but if you happened to make a website that claims to conform to web standards but does n’t , the idealists turn into Joe Arpaio , America ’s Toughest Sheriff .
“ YOU MADE A MISTAKE AND YOUR WEBSITE SHOULD BREAK .
I do n’t care if 80 % of your websites stop working .
I ’ll put you all in jail , where you will wear pink pajamas and eat 15 cent sandwiches and work on a chain gang .
And I do n’t care if the whole county is in jail .
The law is the law . ”
On the other hand , we have the pragmatic , touchy feely , warm and fuzzy engineering types .
“ Ca n’t we just default to IE7 mode ?
One line of code … Zip ! Solved ! ”
Secretly ?
Here ’s what I think is going to happen .
The IE8 team going to tell everyone that IE8 will use web standards by default , and run a nice long beta during which they beg people to test their pages with IE8 and get them to work .
And when they get closer to shipping , and only 32 % of the web pages in the world render properly , they ’ll say , “ look guys , we ’re really sorry , we really wanted IE8 standards mode to be the default , but we ca n’t ship a browser that does n’t work , ” and they ’ll revert to the pragmatic decision .
Or maybe they wo n’t , because the pragmatists at Microsoft have been out of power for a long time .
In which case , IE is going to lose a lot of market share , which would please the idealists to no end , and probably wo n’t decrease Dean Hachamovitch ’s big year - end bonus by one cent .
You see ?
No right answer .
As usual , the idealists are 100 % right in principle and , as usual , the pragmatists are right in practice .
The flames will continue for years .
This debate precisely splits the world in two .
If you have a way to buy stock in Internet flame wars , now would be a good time to do that .
" I think they are taking liberties and they are taking short cuts - I was appalled . "
This was the reaction of Jim Weddick , a retired FBI agent of 35 years , reviewing an FBI case against a suspected al - Qaeda cell in Lodi , California .
As defence consultant for Pakistani Americans Umer and Hamid Hyed , who were accused in 2005 of attending Pakistani terror training camps , Weddick 's first job was to examine tapes of the FBI interrogations .
The case involving the father and son hinged on a contested confession , which was videotaped during a lengthy FBI interrogation .
" I was shocked , the agents seemed to be just leading Hamid Hyed and his father - there was n't anything that I saw that suggested they were guilty , " said Mr Weddick , who was not allowed to give evidence by the trial judge .
The jury were convinced , however , and Hamid Hyed was found guilty of aiding terrorists .
An appeal is still pending .
Umer Hayat negotiated a plea bargain for a non-terrorist - related financial irregularity and was freed in return for time served while waiting for trial .
The event failed dramatically to find an active al - Qaeda cell in California .
Post 9/11 changes
In the course of producing The FBI at 100 for BBC Radio 4 , presenter Tom Mangold and I have interviewed many past and serving agents like Mr Weddick who say they have seen their beloved Bureau undergo a huge change since 11 September 2001 .
Hyed 's case failed to find an active al - Qaeda cell in California
The USA Patriot Act , which was passed the following month , now allows the FBI to investigate suspects without first establishing a link to criminal activity ; it can detain them for longer ; and its powers of surveillance have been extended .
But Mr Weddick 's worries about the possible temptation to short cut on justice are not shared by Philip Mudd , second - in - command at the FBI 's National Security Branch .
" The new FBI represents an evolution , " he says .
" Our responsibility is not only to be the world 's best investigators , but also to provide security for this country - by the use of the collection of intelligence and then the use of law - enforcement tools to pre-empt an operation before it happens . "
Defending America 's homeland against international threats is nothing new for the FBI , and the taking of liberties and the balance between national security and civil rights have been concerns since the first 34 agents were recruited in 1908 to investigative new crimes that crossed state borders .
In 1919 , as America worried over colossal immigration from Europe , and the perceived threat of world Bolshevism , the Bureau of Investigation - as it was originally known - reacted to a series of terrorist attacks on the homes of American public figures by rounding up thousands of suspected communists and anarchists , and throwing them in jail for little more than their political beliefs .
Hoover 's FBI
The raids were masterminded by a young lawyer in the Justice Department by the name of J Edgar Hoover .
After Hoover 's death the FBI was stripped of many of its powers
Five years later , Mr Hoover was appointed director of the Bureau .
He stayed for 48 years under eight presidents , all of whom were unable to replace him because of the mass of secret information he acquired on political enemies , friends , real and imagined enemies of the state , civil rights leaders , film stars , and any ordinary American who fell within earshot or phone tap of his ' G men ' .
After his death in 1972 , Congress stripped the FBI of many of its powers in reaction to revelations about Mr Hoover 's excesses , including his Counter Intelligence Programme ( Cointelpro ) , which at the time was seen by many as little more than a department of dirty tricks involving illegal or improper acts to harass and disrupt targets .
Buck Revell was an FBI man at the time .
" Probably not more than 200 agents in the whole organisation were involved in Cointelpro but all 9,000 agents at the time suffered embarrassment and loss of morale , " he says .
" It was very embarrassing to an organisation charged with the responsibility of enforcing civil rights , to be found to be violating civil rights under these circumstances . "
It is the Congressional firewall erected in the 1970s that many former agents like Mr Revell blame for the FBI 's failure to predict or prevent the 9/11 attacks .
We 've been told by the director repeatedly that we will become a national security bureau
Philip Mudd , FBI
Now the heavy pendulum of the Patriot Act has swung power back their way .
So is this a return to the bad old days ?
Not for Mr Mudd .
" People who look at the Hoover period and worry that we are going down the road towards abusing civil liberties , I believe are mistaken , " he says .
" We 've been told by the director repeatedly that we will become a national security bureau , we 've been told by the American people this is what they expect , we 've been told by presidential and Congressional commissions that we need to improve in this regard . "
But in one sense , the Bureau has turned full circle .
As it prepares for its second century , it is again focusing on new cross - border crimes .
It 's just that this time , the fight is borderless .
The FBI at 100 is being broadcast on Radio 4 this week and next week at 1545 GMT
Implanted medical devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated , moving from simple pacemakers to computerized devices that can actively respond to changes in a patient 's condition .
Perhaps the most sophisticated devices commonly in use are implanted defibrillators .
These devices monitor the heart 's electrical activity and , when an arrhythmic event is detected , can induce a shock that resets the heart .
They also contain small radio transmitters that let doctors read their monitoring of the heart and even reprogram the device to customize it to the patient .
Unfortunately , researchers have found that it 's incredibly easy to reverse - engineer the communication protocol ( PDF ) of these radio transmissions and use that information to hack the implant .
The authors give a long list of wireless , reprogrammable medical devices that are currently on the market , including " pacemakers , implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs ) , neurostimulators , and implantable drug pumps . "
They focused on a single model of defibrillator , but there is no reason to believe that other devices of this nature are any more secure .
The equipment needed for the hack consisted of the device itself ( obviously , they used one that was not currently implanted ) , the equipment normally used to reprogram it , an oscilloscope , and a small radio transmitter that was run using the GNU Radio software libraries .
It turns out that the transmitter portion of the reprogramming equipment is linked to the controller through a standard serial cable ; the researchers were able to track what went through the serial cable and then read the transmissions that resulted .
With that half of the communications channel in hand , they then requested information from the device and used GNU Radio to record the responses , feeding them into Matlab for analysis .
The combination was enough to quickly decode the information coming out of the defibrillator , including details such as the patient 's name , date of birth , medical ID number , and basic patient history .
Further snooping pulled out the doctor 's name and phone number , and the authors were even able to read actual heart function data that the device was recording .
In theory , these devices have a magnetic proximity switch that 's supposed to act as a switch that keeps the device from transmitting unless an appropriate receiver is nearby ; in practice , the authors found even this simply security measure was ignored for most of this information .
The authors did need to place their transmitters within centimeters of the defibrillator , but noted that newer versions can transmit over longer distances .
If the invasion of privacy was n't bad enough , the researchers were actually able to reprogram the device .
They did n't even have to fully reverse - engineer the communications protocol — simply replaying the commands several times was sufficient to get them accepted even in the absence of a full communications stream .
Using their knowledge , the authors could easily reset the owner 's name and personal information , and reset the defibrillator 's clock .
But , more disturbingly , they could also shut off the device 's ability to respond to cardiac events .
The pinnacle of their hacking was to send the device into test mode , in which a carefully - timed current would trigger an arrhythmic event , something that 's normally done under controlled conditions to determine if the device responds successfully .
In effect , they hacked the device in a way that could stop a heart .
If you 've currently got one of these devices , there 's no reason for immediate panic .
" We specifically and purposefully omitted methodological details from our paper , " the authors write , " thereby preventing our findings from being used for anything other than improving patient security and privacy . "
A substantial portion of the paper is also devoted to zero - power ways of improving the security of these devices .
The authors come up with three solutions , all with power envelopes that are sufficiently small that they can be run by harvesting the radio transmissions involved in the normal communications process .
They were all tested for effectiveness using a simulated body environment made of bacon and ground beef .
The first is a simple device that emits audible chirps when appropriate radio frequencies are detected .
The second changes the device 's emissions from radio waves to sound that can only be registered with a sensor in extremely close proximity , making interception of communications very unlikely .
The final option involves challenge - response handshaking and RC5 encryption ; the authors suggest that this could validate an initial communications before switching devices into high - power mode , where they could support more robust encryption .
The ability of these devices to respond to external information is vital to their function , as it allows them to provide critical information to health professionals and to be adjusted to changing patient circumstances without the need for invasive surgery to replace them .
Still , there is no excuse for the minimal security efforts used so far , and this paper provides a clear demonstration of the dangers that this lack of security presents .
Further reading :
Last week I read a post on the concurrency mailinglist about a piece of code from Apache Tomcat .
The code was analyzed with Findbugs by Bill Pough ( one of the inventors ) and it is riddled with concurrency errors .
private InstanceListener [ ] listeners = new InstanceListener [ 0 ] ; public void addInstanceListener ( InstanceListener listener ) { synchronized ( listeners ) { InstanceListener [ ] results = new InstanceListener[listeners.length + 1 ] ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < listeners.
length ; i++) results [ i ] = listeners [i ] ; results[ listeners.length ] = listener ; listeners = results ; } }
Apart from a missing happens - before relation on the write and read of the listeners array causing visibility problems , and the same goes for the content of the array ( piggy backing on synchronization wo n’t work ) , there are serious ‘ old school ’ concurrency problems as well .
Imagine what happens when the lock on the monitor of listeners array is obtained by one thread .
When another thread wants to obtain the lock , it is blocked because the lock is not available .
In the meantime the first thread continuous en replaced the listeners array by a new one ( containing all previous InstanceListeners and the new one ) .
When this thread completes , it releases the lock .
The blocked thread obtains the lock on the monitor of the stale listeners array and starts working on the new listeners array without having a lock on it .
These problems could have been prevented by :
using a constant Object reference for a lock using the CopyOnWriteArrayList ( the CopyOnWriteArraySet maybe would be a better performing alternative if the order of the listeners does n’t matter )

Technology correspondent , in Boston
China blocks many Western media websites
A new book details the extent to which countries across the globe are increasingly censoring online information they find strategically , politically or culturally threatening .
Access Denied : The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering challenges the long - standing assumption that the internet is an unfettered space where citizens from around the world can freely communicate and mobilise .
In fact , the book makes it clear that the scope , scale and sophistication of net censorship are growing .
" There 's been a conventional wisdom or myth that the internet was immune from state regulation , " says Ronald Deibert , one of the book 's editors .
" What we 're finding is that states that were taking a hands - off approach to the internet for many years are now finding ways to intervene at key internet choke points , and block access to information . "
Mr. Deibert heads The Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto .
The Lab , along with Harvard Law School , the University of Cambridge , and Oxford University , has spent the last five years testing internet access in some 40 countries .
We are starting to see something more like the China Wide Web , the Pakistan Wide Web , and the Iran Wide Web
John Palfrey , director of Harvard Law School 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society The book highlights Saudi Arabia , Iran and China as some of the most aggressive nations when it comes to net filtering .
They use a variety of techniques to limit what their citizens can see online .
But they reinforce that filtering with other methods , such as net surveillance .
" Surveillance is a huge deterrent , " says The Citizen Lab's Nart Villeneuve .
" If you talk to dissident groups in these countries , they 'll tell you that they 're under surveillance , that they 're concerned for their safety , and that it definitely influences their online behavior . "
And even as human rights and internet rights groups fight to raise awareness about internet censorship , countries such as China have responded by getting smarter in what they block , and when they block it .
' Selectively blocking ' " We call it ' just - in - time ' filtering , " Mr. Deibert says .
" Countries are selectively blocking access to information around key events , such as demonstrations or elections .
They are clamping down on the internet during times that it suits their strategic interests to do so . "
As an example of this kind of filtering , he points to China 's recent blocking of YouTube after videos of Tibetan protestors appeared on the video - sharing site .
Google has been criticised for working with Chinese authorities Belarus , Cambodia and Burma have all engaged in this kind of selective censorship as well .
And then there is the case of Pakistan , which recently caused the entire YouTube service to go down worldwide for a couple of hours because of a government order to block material .
According to John Palfrey , director of Harvard Law School 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society , the Pakistan case points to certain weaknesses inherent in the very architecture of the internet .
" It was designed by a bunch of friends in essence - academics and military people - who were just creating a local network .
Now , it has scaled globally .
' Informal protocols ' " But it 's still based on some fairly informal protocols .
It turns out that when one censor in one country messes around with something , he can bring down access to entire parts of the internet . "
Mr Palfrey points out that some countries are considering whether or not to bypass the World Wide Web all together by creating what amounts to their own local area networks .
" We are starting to see something more like the China Wide Web , the Pakistan Wide Web , and the Iran Wide Web . "
But The Citizen Lab's Ronald Deibert does not think the evidence points to a complete " balkanization " of the net by sovereign states .
" I do n't think it 's a stretch to say that a person in Iran experiences a much different Internet than a citizen in a country like Canada , " he says .
" But it 's not a simple equation with territorial boundaries .
Maybe the best analogy is with the old Middle Ages , where you had multiple and overlapping layers of authority .
I think that 's the future of the net . "
That future is being complicated by the increased use of mobile phones , PDAs and other devices to access information online .
For citizens , these devices mean more ways to access the internet , and therefore more potential ways around government blocking .
But Jonathan Zittrain , chair in Internet Governance and Regulation at Oxford University , says that governments are already starting to realize the potential threats from mobile devices as tools to access and spread information .
" In fact , when it comes to mobile devices , " Zittrain says , " you may see common cause among China , the United States and Europe , all of whom would like another lever they can pull that will enhance their control over the net , whether they 're looking for terrorists , subversives or political dissidents . "
" I 'd hate to think that the technological advances , say , in America , turn out to be exactly the advances , wrapped in a bow , the technologies China might use to squash dissidents . "

That ’s the key entry system used by Chrysler , Daewoo , Fiat , General Motors , Honda , Toyota , Lexus , Volvo , Volkswagen , Jaguar , and probably others .
It ’s broken :
The KeeLoq encryption algorithm is widely used for security relevant applications , e.g. , in the form of passive Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) transponders for car immobilizers and in various access control and Remote Keyless Entry ( RKE ) systems , e.g. , for opening car doors and garage doors .
We present the first successful DPA ( Differential Power Analysis ) attacks on numerous commercially available products employing KeeLoq .
These so - called side - channel attacks are based on measuring and evaluating the power consumption of a KeeLoq device during its operation .
Using our techniques , an attacker can reveal not only the secret key of remote controls in less than one hour , but also the manufacturer key of the corresponding receivers in less than one day .
Knowing the manufacturer key allows for creating an arbitrary number of valid new keys and generating new remote controls .
We further propose a new eavesdropping attack for which monitoring of two ciphertexts , sent from a remote control employing KeeLoq code hopping ( car key , garage door opener , etc. ) , is sufficient to recover the device key of the remote control .
Hence , using the methods described by us , an attacker can clone a remote control from a distance and gain access to a target that is protected by the claimed to be “ highly secure ” KeeLoq algorithm .
We consider our attacks to be of serious practical interest , as commercial KeeLoq access control systems can be overcome with modest effort .
The word this afternoon is that Industry Minister Jim Prentice will not introduce the Canadian DMCA tomorrow .
The thousands of letters and phone calls over the past week have urged the government to adopt balanced copyright reforms that meets everyone 's needs and does not unduly harm education , consumer rights , privacy , and free speech .
The delay provides an exceptional opportunity for Minister Prentice to consult more broadly and to factor those concerns into the forthcoming bill in the interests of all Canadians .
Update : Media coverage ( CBC , CP ) covers the delay of the Canadian DMCA .
It remains to be seen whether the delay is for a day or two or for at least six weeks .
Moreover , if the longer delay , it will be important to see how Prentice takes advantage of the time to consult Canadians on copyright reform .
Some of the world 's best preserved prehistoric landscapes survive in pristine condition at the bottom of the North Sea , archaeologists claimed yesterday .
Academic interest in what are being described as drowned Stone Age hunting grounds is likely to increase dramatically after the discovery of 28 Neanderthal flint axes on the sea bed off the East Anglian coast .
Dating from at least 50,000 - 60,000 years ago , they were found with other flint artefacts , a large number of mammoth bones , teeth and tusk fragments , and pieces of deer antler .
The sea bed location was probably a Neanderthal hunters ' kill site or temporary camp site .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The axes – one of the largest groups ever found – were spotted by a keen - eyed amateur archaeologist when a consignment of North Sea gravel arrived at the Dutch port of Flushing .
The cache was found 8 miles off Great Yarmouth and is the most northerly point in the North Sea that Neanderthal tools have been discovered .
It had been feared that the ice sheets that destroyed most pre-ice age Brit-ish landscapes had done the same to the land surfaces which existed where the North Sea is now .
But archaeologists now suspect that some Neanderthal landscapes have survived under the North Sea .
What 's more , they are now certain that hundreds or even thousands of square miles of post-ice age prehistoric landscapes do survive there .
On land they have largely been destroyed or degraded by centuries of agriculture , later human settlement and natural erosion .
The North Sea is of immense value to archaeologists and is the largest area of drowned landscape in Europe .
" It 's vital that parts of it should be considered as a potential World Heritage site , " said Professor Vince Gaffney of the University of Birmingham , a leading authority on North Sea archaeology .
Professor Chris Stringer , Research Leader in Human Origins at the Natural History Museum , said : " The quality and quantity of material from the North Sea shows what a rich resource it is for helping to reconstruct missing phases of our prehistory .
The evidence should be preserved and studied .
World heritage status would help in that process . "
In the southern North Sea , Dutch prehistorians working alongside North Sea fishermen over the past decade have identified about 100 Neanderthal flint axes , 200 later Stone Age bone , antler and flint artefacts made by anatomically modern humans , and the remains of thousands of mammoths , woolly rhinos and other ice - age mammals .
Detailed archaeological research at the bottom of the North Sea would be likely to solve a host of Stone Age mysteries .
It should help establish when Britain was recolonised by humans after a 100,000 - year uninhabited period .
It may also reveal for the first time the full technological capabilities of Neanderthal Man , because preservation on and in the sea bed is extremely good .
Wooden , stone and bone implements have almost certainly survived .
Later this week , British and Dutch archaeologists will meet in Holland to formulate a joint program of North Sea research .
German , Belgian , Danish and Norwegian archaeologists and oceanographers are likely to be included in a plan to map and investigate the North Sea 's prehistoric landscapes in detail .
The discovery of the 28 Neanderthal axes was initially reported to the Dutch government archaeological agency , who passed the information via English Heritage to the gravel extraction firm Hanson Aggregates .
" This is the single most important archaeological find from the North Sea .
We have stopped dredging that area and have created an exclusion zone to protect the site , " said a senior Hanson geologist Robert Langman .

The United States is , once again , expanding the size of its largest detention center in Iraq .
According to an October 31 report by the military paper Stars and Stripes , US forces will be increasing the capacity of detainees at Camp Bucca from 20,000 to 30,000 . ( 1 )
An ever - increasing prison population has put extreme pressure on detainment facilities as well as on Iraq ’s fragile , developing judicial system .
The New York Times reported on February 14 that more than half of the 26,000 detainees in US custody are still awaiting trial – many having been imprisoned for years . ( 2 )
For example , Bilal Hussein , a photographer from The Associated Press , has been detained by the US military since April of 2006 , while no evidence or charges have been brought forward against him in court . ( 3 )
Bilal Hussein is one of many individuals urgently seeking a just and expedient manner to challenge their detainment .
Most of the prisoners held by the Iraqi and American governments are Sunni Arabs , accused of fueling the insurgency .
( 4 ) This sectarian imbalance has created controversy , with many Iraqis in the Sunni minority accusing Iraqi and American forces of foul play .
These individuals often reference the precedent set at the detention centers at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan as well as at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Filmmaker Alex Gibney explores these abuses in his new documentary , “ Taxi to the Dark Side . ”
While much of his film examines the mistreatment of prisoners at locations such as Bagram and Guantanamo , Gibney also focuses on the process by which these individuals are often taken into custody .
One such US policy involves offering financial compensation to Afghani warlords and Pakistani forces for the capture of Iraqi “ insurgents . ”
Gibney notes that these bounties accounted for 93 percent of the population at Guantanamo . ( 5 )
These detainees have encountered what many civil rights groups have deemed brutal and inhumane conditions .

Instances abound of phallic imagery supposedly sneaked into product displays and packaging , such as a Renuzit air freshener can , a Star Wars trading card , a Sears catalog underwear ad , and the clamshell case for Disney ’s Little Mermaid video .
Another such example is a Coca - Cola advertising poster supposedly released in South Australia and recalled after the company discovered the artist had hidden some rather obvious sexual imagery in one of the ice cubes surrounding the bottle of Coke :
HOW CLEVER IS THIS
This poster was released in the mid 80s and prompted a total recall of all posters because of the picture painted in ice - cubes at bottom right corner — a woman performing an act .
The graphic artist who designed the picture put this in as a joke , and it went through unnoticed until someone spotted it on the back of a Coke truck .
The artist lost his job and was sued , and all promotional material had to be recalled and destroyed .
Very rare and hard to get hold of — released in South Australia in mid ’ 80s .
Contemporaneous news reports confirm that Coca - Cola did indeed pull an advertisement ( intended to tout the reintroduction of Coca - Cola ’s contour bottle , hence the “ Feel the Curves ! ” slogan ) from the South Pacific marketing area in 1995 due to some questionable imagery :
Philly Mayor Nutter Says ' No Problems , They Got Me Elected '; PA Gov Rendell Admits He ' Knows Nothing About Them , But They 're All Approved by HAVA '
Great Work by Jake Soboroff from Last Night 's Dem Debate ...
Brad Friedman Byon
4/17/2008 , 1:46 pm PT
The following video comes fresh from our buddy Jake Soboroff of Why Tuesday ?
He was at last night 's Democratic debate and tried to get some answers from some of the local Democratic public officials on hand --- including Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and PA Governor Ed Rendell --- to see if they had any concerns about the e-voting machines to be used in next week 's crucial PA Primary .
Kudos to Jake for asking , just one of the so - many questions ( if , arguably , one of the most important ) that the Corporate Media , such as ABC News , could n't even be bothered to dream of , apparently .
Despite the fact that , next week , wholly unverifiable , 100 % faith - based e-voting systems will be in use across much of the Keystone State --- including , perhaps most notably , Sequoia 's AVC Advantage touch - screens in Montgomery and Northhampton counties , even though very same systems failed so spectacularly in neighboring NJ on Super Tuesday ( see this recent BRAD BLOG story for the quick skinny on what happened , and continues to be going on with the NJ / Sequoia failed touch - screen imbroglio ) --- the election officials interviewed by Soboroff , in the following quick video recorded just last night , remain utterly and completely clueless .
It 's simply amazing ...
And folks wonder why the job of restoring Election Integrity in this country is so frickin ' hard ?!
The above video --- including Nutter 's comments that there have been " no problems " with the machines , since , after all , they got him elected , and Rendell 's admission that he " knows nothing about them " , but that they are " all HAVA approved machines " --- underscores how unbelievably difficult this fight is , and how clueless the very folks needed to help make a change actually are , in this entire fine mess .
Suggestion to Soboroff for next vid :
Ask any elected official or election official in PA , or anywhere else , if they can prove that even a single vote --- as cast on any touch - screen machine during any actual election --- has ever been recorded and counted accurately as the voter intended .
Just evidence of a single such vote will do .
They will not be able to do so .
None of them .
UPDATE 4/19/08 :
The good election integrity champions of VotePA touched base with us concerning our above suggestion to Soboroff to point out that there is one way possible to prove that a touch - screen / DRE counted a vote accurately , as per voter intent , during an actual election .
An unusual write - in candidate could be cast , and then checked after the election to see if it was recorded accurately .
Therefore , we 'll slightly modify our currently suggested challenge above , to any election official , asking for proof of any non-write - in vote having been recorded accurately as per voter intent , as ever cast on a DRE / touch - screen voting machine during an actual election .
We 've made that challenge for quite a while ( minus the " non-write - in " part ) , and we 've yet to receive an iota of proof from any election official , even from those who will tell you that their DRE / touch - screens record votes " accurately " .
Truth is , they have nothing to prove their case .
Not even a single ( non - write - in ) vote ever cast .
Yet they still claim them to be " accurate " without any such scientific evidence of same .
Go figure .

O'Neill : Bush planned Iraq invasion before 9/11
In new book , ex-Treasury secretary criticizes administration
( CNN ) --
The Bush administration began planning to use U.S. troops to invade Iraq within days after the former Texas governor entered the White House three years ago , former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill told CBS News ' 60 Minutes .
" From the very beginning , there was a conviction that Saddam Hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go , " O'Neill told CBS , according to excerpts released Saturday by the network .
" For me , the notion of pre-emption , that the U.S. has the unilateral right to do whatever we decide to do , is a really huge leap . "
O'Neill , who served nearly two years in Bush 's Cabinet , was asked to resign by the White House in December 2002 over differences he had with the president 's tax cuts .
O'Neill was the main source for " The Price of Loyalty : George W. Bush , the White House , and the Education of Paul O'Neill , " by former Wall Street Journal reporter Ron Suskind .
The CBS report is scheduled to be broadcast Sunday night ; the book is to be released Tuesday by publisher Simon & Schuster .
Suskind said O'Neill and other White House insiders gave him documents showing that in early 2001 the administration was already considering the use of force to oust Saddam , as well as planning for the aftermath .
" There are memos , " Suskind told the network .
" One of them marked ' secret ' says ' Plan for Post - Saddam Iraq . ' "
Suskind cited a Pentagon document titled " Foreign Suitors For Iraqi Oilfield Contracts , " which , he said , outlines areas of oil exploration .
" It talks about contractors around the world from ... 30 , 40 countries and which ones have what intentions on oil in Iraq . "
In the book , O'Neill is quoted as saying he was surprised that no one in a National Security Council meeting asked why Iraq should be invaded .
" It was all about finding a way to do it .
That was the tone of it .
The president saying ' Go find me a way to do this , ' " O'Neill said .
Suskind also described a White House meeting in which he said Bush seemed to waver about going forward with a second round of tax cuts .
" Have n't we already given money to rich people ...
Should n't we be giving money to the middle ? "
Suskind says Bush asked , according to what CBS called a " nearly verbatim " transcript of an economic team meeting Suskind said he obtained from someone at the meeting .
O'Neill also said in the book that President Bush " was like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people " during Cabinet meetings .
One - on - one meetings were no different , O'Neill told the network .
Describing his first such meeting with Bush , O'Neill said , " I went in with a long list of things to talk about and , I thought , to engage [ him ] on .
... I was surprised it turned out me talking and the president just listening .
It was mostly a monologue . "
White House spokesman Scott McClellan brushed off O'Neill 's criticism .
" We appreciate his service , but we are not in the business of doing book reviews , " he told reporters .
" It appears that the world according to Mr. O'Neill is more about trying to justify his own opinion than looking at the reality of the results we are achieving on behalf of the American people .
The president will continue to be forward - looking , focusing on building upon the results we are achieving to strengthen the economy and making the world a safer and better place . "
A senior administration official , who asked not to be named , expressed bewilderment at O'Neill 's comments on the alleged war plans .
" The treasury secretary is not in the position to have access to that kind of information , where he can make observations of that nature , " the official said .
" This is a head - scratcher . "
Even before the interview is broadcast , the topic became grist for election - year politics .
Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean , who is the early front - runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , issued a statement in response .
" I 've always said the president had failed to make the case to go to war with Iraq , " Dean said .
" My Democratic opponents reached a different conclusion , and in the process , they failed to ask the difficult questions .
Now , after the fact , we are learning new information about the true circumstances of the Bush administration 's push for war , this time , by one of his former Cabinet secretaries .
" The country deserves to know -- and the president needs to answer -- why the American people were presented with misleading or manufactured intelligence as to why going to war with Iraq was necessary . "
Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts also issued a statement .
In 2002 , Kerry voted to support a resolution giving Bush authority to wage war against Iraq if it did n't dismantle its presumed illegal weapons program .
" These are very serious charges .
It would mean [ Bush administration officials ] were dead - set on going to war alone since almost the day they took office and deliberately lied to the American people , Congress , and the world , " Kerry said .
" It would mean that for purely ideological reasons they planned on putting American troops in a shooting gallery , occupying an Arab country almost alone .
The White House needs to answer these charges truthfully because they threaten to shatter [ its ] already damaged credibility as never before . "
Fully aware that it has some work to do , the Transportation Security Administration is rolling out a big redesign of its security screening operations .
As detailed on its blog , the TSA is prepping a " Checkpoint Evolution " project it touts as a way to " calm the checkpoint environment " while at the same time increasing security .
Hallelujah .
The TSA 's Ann Davis says Checkpoint Evolution will bring a " fundamental shift " in the security screening experience .
How ?
By employing what she calls a variety of
" technology and human elements . "
The TSA touts 14 of these elements on their blog , explaining each with a somewhat cheesy video ...
The elements run the gamut from cutting edge ( advanced whole body screening and luggage x- ray technology ) , to the practical ( better signage and an automatic bin return system ) to the somewhat silly ( " calming " light panels and ambient sounds , storyboards with security screener bios and photos , and " recomposure chairs " ) .
Davis says that a team made up of TSA staff and outside consultants developed the system , taking into account passenger complaints and suggestions made by screeners .
To test and refine the system , the agency has been working with a prototype that it built in a warehouse at Reagan National Airport .
Checkpoint Evolution will make its first appearance at Baltimore / Washington International around Memorial Day .
Davis says technology for the Baltimore deployment is running the TSA $ 1.8 million , and that the agency is spending another $ 332,000 for physical elements such as signage , lights , and seating .

In our special briefing , we look at how near Wall Street came to systemic collapse this week — and how the financial system will change as a result .
We start with how financiers — and their critics — have laboured under a delusion
“ A COMPANY for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage , but nobody to know what it is . ”
This lure for the South Sea Company , published in 1720 , has a whiff of the 21st century about it .
Modern finance has promised miracles , seduced the brilliant and the greedy — and wrought destruction .
Alan Greenspan , formerly chairman of the Federal Reserve , said in 2005 that “ increasingly complex financial instruments have contributed to the development of a far more flexible , efficient , and hence resilient financial system than the one that existed just a quarter - century ago . ”
Tell that to Bear Stearns , Wall Street 's fifth - largest investment bank , the most spectacular corporate casualty so far of the credit crisis .
For the critics of modern finance , Bear 's swift end on March 16th was the inevitable consequence of the laissez - faire philosophy that allowed financial services to innovate and spread almost unchecked .
This has created a complex , interdependent system prone to conflicts of interest .
Fraud has been rampant in the sale of subprime mortgages .
Spurred by pay that was geared to short - term gains , bankers and fund managers stand accused of pocketing bonuses with no thought for the longer - term consequences of what they were doing .
Their gambling has been fed by the knowledge that , if disaster struck , someone else — borrowers , investors , taxpayers — would end up bearing at least some of the losses .
Since the era of frock coats and buckled shoes , finance has been knocked back by booms and busts every ten years or so .
But the past decade has been plagued by them .
It has been pocked by the Asian crisis , the debacle at Long - Term Capital Management , a super - brainy hedge fund , the dotcom crash and now what you might call the first crisis of securitisation .
If the critics are right and something in finance is broken , then there will be pressure to reregulate , to return to what Alistair Darling , Britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , calls “ good old - fashioned banking ” .
But are the critics right ?
What really went wrong with finance ?
And how can it be fixed ?
Happy days
The seeds of today 's disaster were sown in the 1980s , when financial services began a pattern of growth that may only now have come to an end .
In a recent study Martin Barnes of BCA Research , a Canadian economic - research firm , traces the rise of the American financial - services industry 's share of total corporate profits , from 10 % in the early 1980s to 40 % at its peak last year ( see chart 1 ) .
Its share of stockmarket value grew from 6 % to 19 % .
These proportions look all the more striking — even unsustainable — when you note that financial services account for only 15 % of corporate America 's gross value added and a mere 5 % of private - sector jobs .
At first this growth was built on the solid foundations of rising asset prices .
The 18 years to 2000 witnessed an unparalleled bull market for shares and bonds .
As the world 's central banks tamed inflation , interest rates fell and asset prices rose ( see chart 2 ) .
Corporate restructuring , wage competition and a revolution in information technology boosted profits .
A typical portfolio of shares , bonds and cash gave real annual yields of over 14 % , calculates Mr Barnes , almost four times the norm of earlier decades .
Financial - service firms made hay .
The number of equity mutual funds in America rose more than fourfold .
But something changed in 2001 , when the dotcom bubble burst .
America 's GDP growth since then has been weaker than in any cycle since the 1950s , barring the double - dip recovery in 1980 - 81 .
Stephen King and Ian Morris of HSBC point out that growth in consumer spending , total investment and exports in this cycle has been correspondingly feeble .
Yet , like Wile E. Coyote running over the edge of a cliff , financial services kept on going .
A service industry that , in effect , exists to help people write , trade and manage financial claims on future cashflows raced ahead of the real economy , even as the ground beneath it fell away .
The industry has defied gravity by using debt , securitisation and proprietary trading to boost fee income and profits .
Investors hungry for yield have willingly gone along .
Since 2000 , according to BCA , the value of assets held in hedge funds , with their high fees and higher leverage , has quintupled .
In addition , the industry has combined computing power and leverage to create a burst of innovation .
The value of outstanding credit - default swaps , for instance , has climbed to a staggering $ 45 trillion .
In 1980 financial - sector debt was only a tenth of the size of non-financial debt .
Now it is half as big .
This process has turned investment banks into debt machines that trade heavily on their own accounts .
Goldman Sachs is using about $ 40 billion of equity as the foundation for $ 1.1 trillion of assets .
At Merrill Lynch , the most leveraged , $ 1 trillion of assets is teetering on around $ 30 billion of equity .
In rising markets , gearing like that creates stellar returns on equity .
When markets are in peril , a small fall in asset values can wipe shareholders out .
The banks ' course was made possible by cheap money , facilitated in turn by low consumer - price inflation .
In more regulated times , credit controls or the gold standard restricted the creation of credit .
But recently central banks have in effect conspired with the banks ' urge to earn fees and use leverage .
The resulting glut of liquidity and financial firms ' thirst for yield led eventually to the ill - starred boom in American subprime mortgages .
The dance of debt
The tendency for financial services to run right over the cliff is accentuated by financial assets ' habit of growing during booms .
By lodging their extra assets as collateral , the intermediaries can put them to work and borrow more .
Tobias Adrian , of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , and Hyun Song Shin , of Princeton University , have shown that since the 1970s , debts have grown faster than assets during booms .
This pro-cyclical leverage can feed on itself .
If financial groups use the borrowed money to buy more of the sorts of securities they lodged as collateral , then the prices of those securities will go up .
That , in turn , enables them to raise more debt and buy more securities .
Indeed , their shareholders would punish them if they sat out the next round — as Chuck Prince let slip only weeks before the crisis struck , when he said that Citigroup , the bank he then headed , was “ still dancing ” .
Mr Prince has been ridiculed for his lack of foresight .
In fact , he was guilty of blurting out finance 's embarrassing secret : that he was trapped in a dance he could not quit .
As , in fact , was everyone else .
Sooner or later , though , the music stops .
And when it does , the very mechanisms that create abundant credit will also destroy it .
Most things attract buyers when the price falls .
But not necessarily securities .
Because financial intermediaries need to limit their leverage in a falling market , they sell assets ( again , the system is pro-cyclical ) .
That lowers the prices of securities , which puts further strain on balance sheets leading to further sales .
And so the screw turns until those without leverage will buy .
You do not need bankers to be poorly monitored or over - incentivised for such cycles to work : finance knew booms and manias long before deposit insurance , bank rescues or bonuses .
And , human nature being what it is , Jérôme Kerviel , who lost Société Générale a fortune , and the staff of various loss - making , state - owned , German Landesbanks did not need huge pay to lose huge sums .
The desire to show that you are a match for the star trader next door , or the bank in the next town , will do .
Yet pay — or at least bad management — probably made this crisis worse .
Trades determine bonuses at the end of the year , even though their real value may not become clear until later .
Earlier this month a group of financial supervisors reported how managers at the banks worst hit by the crisis had failed to oversee traders or take a broad view of risk across their firms .
Perhaps , with proper incentives , managers would have done better .
Alan Johnson , a consultant who designs pay packages for Wall Street , predicts that in future senior executives will face the prospect of some of their bonuses being contingent on the bank 's performance over several years .
Yet to the extent that many senior bankers are paid in shares they cannot immediately sell , they already are .
And to the extent that Bear Stearns 's employees owned one - third of the firm , they already looked to the longer term .
If altering pay cannot stop manias , can regulation ?
The criticism that this crisis is the product of the deregulation of finance misses an important point .
The worst excesses in the securitisation mess are encrusted precisely where regulation sought to protect banks and investors from the dangers of untrammelled credit growth .
That is because regulations offer not just protection , but also clever ways to make money by getting around them .
Existing rules on capital adequacy require banks to put some capital aside for each asset .
If the market leads to losses , the chances are they will have enough capital to cope .
Yet this rule sets up a perverse incentive to create structures free of the capital burden — such as credits that last 364 days , and hence do not count as “ permanent ” .
The hundreds of billions of dollars in the shadow banking system — the notorious SIVs and conduits that have caused the banks so much pain — have been warehoused there to get round the rules .
Spain 's banking regulator prudently said that such vehicles could be created , but only if the banks put capital aside .
So far the country has escaped the damage seen elsewhere .
When reformed capital - adequacy rules are introduced , this is an area that will need to be monitored rigorously .
It is the same with rating agencies , the whipping boys of the crisis .
Most bonds used to be issued by companies , and to judge something AAA was straightforward .
Perhaps back then it made sense for some investors , such as pension funds , to be obliged to buy top -rated bonds .
But this rule created a boundary between AAA and other bonds that was ripe for gaming .
Clever people , abetted by the rating agencies , set out to pass off poor credit as AAA , because they stood to make a lot of money .
And they did .
For a while .
The financial industry is likely to stagnate or shrink in the next few years .
That is partly because the last phase of its growth was founded on unsustainable leverage , and partly because the value of the underlying equities and bonds is unlikely to grow as it did in the 1980s and 1990s .
If finance is foolishly reregulated , it will fare even worse .
And what of all the clever and misused wizardry of modern finance ?
Mr Greenspan was half right .
Financial engineering can indeed spread risk and help the system work better .
Like junk bonds , reviled at the end of 1980s , securitisation will rebound , tamed and better understood — and smaller .
That is financial progress .
It is a pity that it comes at such a cost .

While other Iraq
War reporters have spent the past five years interviewing soldiers , officials , and contractors , Education Week reporter Mary Ann Zehr has focused on a different group : schoolchildren , their parents , and teachers .
It has n’t been easy .
Several Iraqi education ministry officials have been targeted and killed by insurgents .
According to the UNICEF , Iraq ’s school enrollment rate dwindled from 83 percent in 2003 to 50 percent in 2007 .
Grim though the statistics may be , Zehr believes they ’re only part of the story .
Drawing on dozens of interviews , she has painted a vivid picture of how violence and chaos affect students ’ daily lives .
One lesson she has learned along the way : Kids do n’t always deal with trauma in the ways you might expect .
“ One boy I met was totally focused on soccer , ” says Zehr .
“ I asked him if he talked about the war with friends , or the fact that his dad had been murdered , and he said no .
He wanted to talk about soccer moves .
That ’s it .
He was focused on the future .
But his mom was totally stressed out . ”
Because of security concerns , Zehr has not visited Iraq ; instead , she has spoken to students and administrators over the phone .
But last month , Zehr made her second trip to Amman , Jordan , to see how nearly 50,000 Iraqi refugee children — some of whom had missed as many as four years of school since the invasion — were coping with school in a new country .
Mother Jones spoke by phone with Zehr last week about her trip to Jordan , the news from schools in Iraq , and how the U.S. government left Iraqi schools behind in 2006 .
Mother Jones :
What is the situation like now for Iraqi children in Jordan ?
Mary Ann Zehr : I did n’t know , until I went to Jordan , how many kids had been out of school for up to four years .
In some cases , kids did n’t know how long they had been out of school .
Their parents had a clearer sense of time .
And some Iraqi refugee families do n’t always send all of their children to school once they get settled in a new country .
One woman had four school - age children in her household , two of her own children and two grandchildren .
She sent one boy to school , but did n’t have enough money to send a girl who had missed four years of school .
In another case , a family sent the youngest girl , but not the oldest , saying they could n’t afford it .
MJ : What was it like for the school children you interviewed to go back to school , in a different country , after being out of school for several years ?
MAZ : One boy was a little shaky on his time tables in fifth grade , and he had missed two years .
His mom said he was unhappy because he was placed in first grade instead of third , and it was hard for him to be with younger kids in class all day .
Another 16 - year - old boy was in fifth grade , and the principal said he acted like a tough guy .
Kids often said they did n’t like going to school with younger kids .
Other kids might be placed in their grade , but they wanted to be placed in younger classes .
It is hard to know what is best for each kid .
MJ : Meanwhile , back in Iraq , you ’ve reported that there is a “ culture of fear ” in schools .
MAZ : Teachers and parents who came to Amman within the last year or two told me the quality of schooling in Iraq had deteriorated .
One father said militias were in control of Iraqi schools .
A teacher said that school administrators had lost their ability to discipline students , and they did n’t know which groups parents were involved with .
The cultural attaché for Iraq in Jordan did n’t deny that militias had taken over schools , or that there were kidnappings .
MJ : How do children respond when you ask about the experiences they ’ve had to endure ?
MAZ : Some children really did want to tell their stories .
One girl who had to stay home and not go to school said she cried about it , but did n’t want to make her parents feel guilty .
She told me she saw her uncle killed right in front of her in her dad ’s store .
And she wanted to talk about it .
She was now in Amman , several years later , and several years held back , but doing well .
Another girl had missed so much school in Baghdad that when she took a history test , she only knew half the material , and failed .
Asked how that made her feel , she started crying on the spot .
It seems that many kids seem to take on responsibility for the fact that they missed school .
A lot say they had missed two years , but actually they had missed four , almost like it was their fault .
MJ : In June 2006 the United States decided to withdraw financial support for Iraqi schools .
Why ?
MAZ : Right after the invasion , the U.S. was helping to rebuild the education system .
The U.S. helped to repair like 5,000 schools in Iraq , and it got a lot of media attention .
I followed that very carefully .
They helped to train teachers , provided furniture , and printed textbooks .
They did all this after the invasion , but then , very quietly , they stopped in June of 2006 .
There was money allotted for advisers at 10 ministries , but in the end , the education ministry was n’t one of the ministries that got such an adviser .
Projects were scaled back because of security , bureaucracy issues , delays in approvals , and so much turnover in the ministry of education .
It became increasingly difficult for me to get an interview , and people would only respond by email , if at all .
MJ : You believe that Jordan ’s public schools are Iraqi children ’s best chance for an education .
How so ?
What about other neighboring countries ?
MAZ : I know the majority of Iraqi refugee school children are in Syria and Jordan , and some are in Egypt and Lebanon .
A public relations person I spoke with from the Syria office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Iraqi refugee families tend to lie low , because their problems from Iraq follow them to Syria .
One family saw someone in a marketplace who had raped someone in their family back in Iraq .
So they wanted to lie low in Syria and go unnoticed .
People have stress and issues that have followed them to their new country .
Poverty is a real issue also .
In Jordan , the nonprofits said children tend to find work more easily than adults .
They become apprentices to carpenters , and things like that , but bosses can be abusive , and children tend to be paid really low .
MJ : Do Iraqi children talk about career goals ?
Do they think in terms of , “ When I grow up , I want to be a … ”
MAZ : They do .
They want to be engineers , doctors .
One boy , out of school for four and a half years , is now attending school for two or three hours a day and said he wanted to be an engineer just like his dad .
They felt that if they were assigned exams , they could reach their goals , and I think they can , just maybe two years later .

The file , which had 112 seeds and 417 leeches , had been downloaded 2083 times since it was posted Tuesday , according to the listing .
According to the file description notes , Microsoft will release the final version of XP SP3 on March 24 , but the 5503 test build passes all Windows Genuine Advantage checks and is able to download Windows updates that previous XP SP3 builds were n't able to , which suggests that it could , in fact , be the final RTM build .
When Microsoft released Vista SP1 in February , the final RTM code was identical to the Vista SP1 Release Candidate ( RC ) 1 Refresh 2 test build that was released to a group of 15,000 testers two weeks earlier .
A Microsoft spokesperson , perhaps weary from the months - long barrage of Vista SP1 related inquiries , said the final version of XP SP3 is still on target to be released the first half of calendar year 2008 , and the XP SP3 5503 build was a minor interim build released to address one specific issue for a subset of private beta testers .
" This build was not intended for public release , and anyone who has that build and is not part of the private beta is working with bits that Microsoft can't verify the integrity -- it 's possible the bits may have been modified with malware or other bad code that Microsoft has n't tested , " the spokesperson said in an email .
XP SP3 was originally slated for release in 2006 , but Microsoft has delayed it on numerous occasions since launching XP SP2 in August 2004 .
In February , Microsoft released XP SP3 Release Candidate 2 through its Download Center to users running PCs with XP SP2 installed .

Looking for a golden retriever , schnauzer or poodle to keep you company , but afraid of having to walk your dog in the rain or feed it while out of town ?
You 're not alone , and now there may be a solution & for a price .
A small , but growing industry now allows want - to - be pet owners across the country to experience the joys of owning a pet , without the long - term , day - to - day hassles .
Earlier this year a San Diego - based company called FlexPetz started renting man 's best friend for pet lovers who might want to take a dog on a long walk and maybe play a game of fetch , but do n't have the time to own a pet full time .
The first store opened in San Diego in April , quickly followed by a second location in Los Angeles and then a New York store in September .
FlexPetz founder Marlena Cervantes plans to expand her privately - owned company to several other cities , including San Francisco , Washington D.C. , Seattle , London and Tokyo .
Consumers have long been able to partially own condominiums through timeshares .
And in recent years , fractional jet ownership programs have ballooned and ZipCar has given city residents the opportunity to rent cars for just a few hours at a time .
Perhaps it was only a matter of time before companies like FlexPetz provided the same concept for pets .
Cervantes came up with the idea of sharing dogs when she was working with autistic children .
She first shared her own dog with the kids and then adopted two rescue dogs to share .
The cost of keeping the dogs , however , became prohibitive .
So she decided to turn the sharing idea into a business .
" In order to make this work , I would require financial contribution from the families I worked with , " she said , " I did n't want to do that -- it was meant as a service . "
FlexPetz offers different types of dogs in each location .
The company conducts surveys to find out which dogs potential customers want .
Larger breeds are popular on the west coast , while smaller dogs are in demand in New York .
FlexPetz members might as well get what they want for the hefty price they pay .
Members are charged a one - time - $ 150 initiation fee , followed by a $ 49.95 monthly membership fee for the right to limited visitation .
But the fees do n't end there .
There 's a $ 99.95 annual maintenance fee and , of course , the actual charge to rent the dog : $ 39.95 a day on weekends and $ 24.95 per day on weekdays .
The costs cover training and boarding the dogs , collar - sized GPS devices , vet bills , insurance and care kits that accompany the dog on visits to shared owners .
FlexPetz caters to consumers who live in urban areas and travel frequently .
Members may enjoy the company of a dog , but do n't have the space or time to take care of one full - time .
The service has proven itself to be a hot commodity in several urban markets .
For instance , in New York , the office attracted more than 100 members in just its first two weeks .
San Diego - resident Erika Lupercio became a member earlier this year .
Lupercio and her 12 - year - old daughter live in a condominium with a balcony , but no front yard .
They once adopted a pug , but after about five months , Lupercio had no time for the dog and could n't keep her .
" I remember how heartbroken my daughter was , " she said .
Now as a FlexPetz member , she and her daughter have fallen in love with Rupert , a black Afghan hound that they take on weekend walks in the park .
" When he sees us he knows we 're family , " Lupercio said
Seeing Rupert on the weekends has allowed her to have a dog of her own without tying up her busy schedule .
" It takes the worry out of all the things you would worry about , " she said .
Some folks have a bone to pick with the idea of dog renting .
Gale Buchwald , senior vice president of the ASPCA Pet Adoption Center and Mobile Clinic Program , said FlexPetz violates the human - animal bond .
" For an animal , a caretaker is more than a fun walk in the park , " she said .
Buchwald said it 's not healthy for dogs to live transient lifestyles and bounce between owners .
She said dogs that do n't form a strong bond with one family often end up becoming aloof and self destructive .
" I think it 's great that they understand marketing , and I think it 's great that they try to fulfill that need , but it 's not good for the dog , " Buchwald said .
Cervantes disagrees .
She said her business takes precautions to ensure the safety and happiness of FlexPetz dogs .
" They 're cared for better than a lot of dogs I 've seen , " she said .
" This is a fantastic alternative to shelter life . "
Cervantes said FlexPetz does not rent a dog to more than a couple members at a time .
She said members are screened for animal - abuse violations before getting the go - ahead to rent dogs .
New members must also complete a training session with certified dog trainers to learn how to become responsible pet owners .
Lupercio said everyone deserves a little quality time with a pet .
" It 's a little unfair for people to not have the opportunity to own a pet , and this is a nice way of doing it , " she said , " I feel like I 'm being a more responsible pet owner by doing this and not leaving a dog at home alone . "
" I was a bit leery at first , and I had my questions , " she added , " But I 'm definitely going to stay a member . "
FlexPetz members are even given the option of eventually adopting their dog of choice .
FlexPetz and other shared - ownership services tap into a market segment called the " transumer . "
These are consumers who want the taste of a certain lifestyle or experience .
People with little time or space can stake a claim in pricey , high - maintenance items such as yachts , exotic cars and small planes for occasional use .
Tony LoGrande is managing director of Fitch New York , a global retail consultancy company that first coined the term " transumer " to describe the habits of customers who shop while in a state of transit .
" We have to wake up to the fact that many consumers are transient , " LoGrande said .
" There are lots of people who have to travel a great deal for a living . "
LoGrande said transumer culture will only grow larger as the global economy expands .
And as the number of transumers grows , so will the demand for shared - ownership services .
" Transumers are the new nomadic people .
I think that is part of the future , " he said .
" People are exploring the world like they 've never done before .
And it necessitates them to be able to have the comforts and needs to be able to connect . "
LoGrande welcomes the FlexPetz movement , saying the animals are better off spending time with loving members than confined to an animal shelter .
" By sharing a pet , you saved a pet 's life , " LoGrande said .
Cervantes said FlexPetz is different and disassociates it with the " transumer " movement .
" Our members , " she said , " are n't in it for the fad or experience . "

Liberalism is more than one thing .
On any close examination , it seems to fracture into a range of related but sometimes competing visions .
In this entry we focus on debates within the liberal tradition .
( 1 ) We contrast three interpretations of liberalism ’s core commitment to liberty .
( 2 ) We contrast ‘ old ’ and ‘ new ’ liberalism .
( 3 ) We ask whether liberalism is a ‘ comprehensive ’ or a ‘ political ’ doctrine .
( 4 ) We close with questions about the ‘ reach ’ of liberalism — does it apply to all humankind ?
Must all political communities be liberal ?
Could a liberal coherently answer this question by saying No ?
Could a liberal coherently answer this question by saying Yes ?
“ By definition , ” Maurice Cranston says , “ a liberal is a man who believes in liberty ” ( 1967 : 459 ) .
In two ways , liberals accord liberty primacy as a political value .
( i) Liberals have typically maintained that humans are naturally in “ a State of perfect Freedom to order their Actions …as they think fit …without asking leave , or depending on the Will of any other Man ” ( Locke , 1960 [ 1689 ] : 287 ) .
Mill too argued that “ the burden of proof is supposed to be with those who are against liberty ; who contend for any restriction or prohibition … .
The a priori assumption is in favour of freedom … ” ( 1963 , vol. 21 : 262 ) .
Recent liberal thinkers such as as Joel Feinberg ( 1984 : 9 ) , Stanley Benn ( 1988 : 87 ) and John Rawls ( 2001 : 44 , 112 ) agree .
This might be called the Fundamental Liberal Principle ( Gaus , 1996 : 162–166 ) : freedom is normatively basic , and so the onus of justification is on those who would use coercion to limit freedom .
It follows from this that political authority and law must be justified , as they limit the liberty of citizens .
Consequently , a central question of liberal political theory is whether political authority can be justified , and if so , how .
For this reason , social contract theory , as developed by Thomas Hobbes ( 1948 [ 1651 ] ) , John Locke ( 1960 [ 1689 ] ) , Jean - Jacques Rousseau ( 1973 [ 1762 ] ) and Immanuel Kant ( 1965 [ 1797 ] ) , is usually viewed as liberal even though the actual political prescriptions of , say , Hobbes and Rousseau , have distinctly illiberal features .
Insofar as they take as their starting point a state of nature in which humans are free and equal , and so argue that any limitation of this freedom and equality must be justified ( i.e. , by the social contract ) , the social contract tradition expresses the Fundamental Liberal Principle .
The Fundamental Liberal Principle holds that restrictions on liberty must be justified .
Because he accepts this , we can understand Hobbes as part of the liberal tradition .
( ii ) That is to say , although no one classifies Hobbes as a liberal , there is reason to regard Hobbes as an instigator of liberal philosophy ( see also Waldron 2001 ) , for it was Hobbes who asked on what grounds citizens owe allegiance to the sovereign .
Implicit in Hobbes ’s question is a rejection of the presumption that citizens are the king ’s property ; on the contrary , kings are accountable to sovereign citizens .
In the culture at large , this view of the relation between citizen and king had been taking shape for centuries .
The Magna Carta was a series of agreements , beginning in 1215 , arising out of disputes between the barons and King John .
The Magna Carta eventually settled that the king is bound by the rule of law .
In 1215 , the Magna Carta was part of the beginning rather than the end of the argument , but by the mid-1300s , concepts of individual rights to trial by jury , due process , and equality before the law were more firmly established .
The Magna Carta was coming to be seen as vesting sovereignty not only in nobles but in “ the People ” as such .
By the mid-1400s , John Fortescue , England ’s Chief Justice from 1442 to 1461 , would write The Difference Between an Absolute and Limited Monarchy , a plea for limited monarchy that arguably represents the beginning of English political thought ( Schmidtz and Brennan , 2010 : chap . 2 ) .
Hobbes generally is treated as one of the first and greatest social contract thinkers .
Typically , Hobbes also is seen as an advocate of unlimited monarchy .
On Hobbes ’s theory , Leviathan ’s authority is almost absolute along a particular dimension : namely , Leviathan is authorized to do whatever it takes to keep the peace .
This special end justifies almost any means , including drastic limitations on liberty .
Yet , note the limitations implicit in the end itself .
Leviathan ’s job is to keep the peace : not to do everything worth doing , but simply to secure the peace .
Hobbes , the famed absolutist , in fact developed a model of government sharply limited in this most important way .
Paradigmatic liberals such as Locke not only advocate the Fundamental Liberal Principle , but also maintain that justified limitations on liberty are fairly modest .
Only a limited government can be justified ; indeed , the basic task of government is to protect the equal liberty of citizens .
Thus John Rawls ’s paradigmatically liberal first principle of justice : “ Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive system of equal basic liberty compatible with a similar system for all ” ( Rawls , 1999b : 220 ) .
Liberals disagree , however , about the concept of liberty , and as a result the liberal ideal of protecting individual liberty can lead to different conceptions of the task of government .
Isaiah Berlin famously advocated a negative conception of liberty :
I am normally said to be free to the degree to which no man or body of men interferes with my activity .
Political liberty in this sense is simply the area within which a man can act unobstructed by others .
If I am prevented by others from doing what I could otherwise do , I am to that degree unfree ; and if this area is contracted by other men beyond a certain minimum , I can be described as being coerced , or , it may be , enslaved .
Coercion is not , however , a term that covers every form of inability .
If I say that I am unable to jump more than ten feet in the air , or cannot read because I am blind … it would be eccentric to say that I am to that degree enslaved or coerced .
Coercion implies the deliberate interference of other human beings within the area in which I could otherwise act .
You lack political liberty or freedom only if you are prevented from attaining a goal by other human beings ( Berlin , 1969 : 122 ) .
For Berlin and those who follow him , then , the heart of liberty is the absence of coercion by others ; consequently , the liberal state ’s commitment to protecting liberty is , essentially , the job of ensuring that citizens do not coerce each other without compelling justification .
So understood , negative liberty is an opportunity - concept .
Being free is a matter of what options are left open to us , regardless of whether we exercise such options ( Taylor , 1979 ) .
Many liberals have been attracted to more ‘ positive ’ conceptions of liberty .
Although Rousseau ( 1973 [ 1762 ] ) seemed to advocate a positive conception of liberty , according to which one was free when one acted according to one ’s true will ( the general will ) , the positive conception was best developed by the British neo-Hegelians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , such as Thomas Hill Green and Bernard Bosanquet ( 2001 [ 1923 ] ) .
Green acknowledged that “ … it must be of course admitted that every usage of the term [ i.e. , ‘ freedom ’ ] to express anything but a social and political relation of one man to other involves a metaphor …
It always implies … some exemption from compulsion by another … ” ( 1986 [ 1895 ] : 229 ) .
Nevertheless , Green went on to claim that a person can be unfree if he is subject to an impulse or craving that cannot be controlled .
Such a person , Green argued , is “ … in the condition of a bondsman who is carrying out the will of another , not his own ” ( 1986 [ 1895 ] : 228 ) .
Just as a slave is not doing what he really wants to do , one who is , say , an alcoholic , is being led by a craving to look for satisfaction where it cannot , ultimately , be found .
For Green , a person is free only if she is self - directed or autonomous .
Running throughout liberal political theory is an ideal of a free person as one whose actions are in some sense her own .
In this sense , positive liberty is an exercise - concept .
One is free merely to the degree that one has effectively determined oneself and the shape of one ’s life ( Taylor , 1979 ) .
Such a person is not subject to compulsions , critically reflects on her ideals and so does not unreflectively follow custom , and does not ignore her long - term interests for short - term pleasures .
This ideal of freedom as autonomy has its roots not only in Rousseau ’s and Kant ’s political theory , but also in John Stuart Mill ’s On Liberty .
And today it is a dominant strain in liberalism , as witnessed by the work of S.I. Benn ( 1988 ) , Gerald Dworkin ( 1988 ) , and Joseph Raz ( 1986 ) ; see also the essays in Christman and Anderson ( 2005 ) .
Green ’s autonomy - based conception of positive freedom is often run together with a notion of ‘ positive ’ freedom : freedom as effective power to act or to pursue one ’s ends .
In the words of the British socialist R. H. Tawney , freedom thus understood is ‘ the ability to act ’ ( 1931 : 221 ; see also Gaus , 2000 ; ch. 5 . ) On this positive conception , a person not prohibited from being a member of a Country Club but too poor to afford membership is not free to be a member : she lacks an effective power to act .
Positive freedom qua effective power to act closely ties freedom to material resources .
( Education , for example , should be easily available so that all can develop their capacities . )
It was this conception of positive liberty that Hayek had in mind when he insisted that although “ freedom and wealth are both good things … they still remain different ” ( 1960 : 17–18 ) .
An older notion of liberty that has recently resurfaced is the republican , or neo-Roman , conception of liberty , which has roots in the writings of Cicero and Niccolo Machiavelli ( 1950 [ 1513 ] ) .
According to Philip Pettit ,
The contrary of the liber , or free , person in Roman , republican usage was the servus , or slave , and up to at least the beginning of the last century , the dominant connotation of freedom , emphasized in the long republican tradition , was not having to live in servitude to another : not being subject to the arbitrary power of another .
( Pettit , 1996 : 576 )
On this view , the opposite of freedom is domination .
To be unfree is to be “ subject to the potentially capricious will or the potentially idiosyncratic judgement of another ” ( Pettit , 1997 : 5 ) .
The ideal liberty - protecting government , then , ensures that no agent , including itself , has arbitrary power over any citizen .
This is accomplished through an equal disbursement of power .
Each person has power that offsets the power of another to arbitrarily interfere with her activities ( Pettit , 1997 : 67 ) .
The republican conception of liberty is certainly distinct from both Greenian positive and negative conceptions .
Unlike Greenian positive liberty , republican liberty is not primarily concerned with rational autonomy , realizing one ’s true nature , or becoming one ’s higher self .
When all dominating power has been dispersed , republican theorists are generally silent about these goals ( Larmore 2001 ) .
Unlike negative liberty , republican liberty is primarily focused upon “ defenseless susceptibility to interference , rather than actual interference ” ( Pettit , 1996 : 577 ) .
Thus , in contrast to the ordinary negative conception , on the republican conception the mere possibility of arbitrary interference is a limitation of liberty .
Republican liberty thus seems to involve a modal claim about the possibility of interference , and this is often cashed out in terms of complex counterfactual claims .
It is not clear whether these claims can be adequately explicated ( Gaus , 2003 ; cf. Larmore , 2004 ) .
Some republican theorists , such as Quentin Skinner ( 1998 : 113 ) , Maurizio Viroli ( 2002 : 6 ) and Pettit ( 1997 : 8 –11 ) , view republicanism as an alternative to liberalism .
When republican liberty is seen as a basis for criticizing market liberty and market society , this is plausible ( Gaus , 2003 b ) .
However , when liberalism is understood more expansively , and not so closely tied to either negative liberty or market society , republicanism becomes indistinguishable from liberalism ( Ghosh , 2008 ; Rogers , 2008 ; Larmore , 2001 ; Dagger , 1997 ) .
Liberal political theory , then , fractures over the conception of liberty .
In practice , another crucial fault line concerns the moral status of private property and the market order .
For classical liberals — ‘ old ’ liberals — liberty and private property are intimately related .
From the eighteenth century right up to today , classical liberals have insisted that an economic system based on private property is uniquely consistent with individual liberty , allowing each to live her life — including employing her labor and her capital — as she sees fit .
Indeed , classical liberals and libertarians have often asserted that in some way liberty and property are really the same thing ; it has been argued , for example , that all rights , including liberty rights , are forms of property ; others have maintained that property is itself a form of freedom ( Gaus , 1994 ; Steiner , 1994 ) .
A market order based on private property is thus seen as an embodiment of freedom ( Robbins , 1961 : 104 ) .
Unless people are free to make contracts and sell their labour , save and invest their incomes as they see fit , and free to launch enterprises as they raise the capital , they are not really free .
Classical liberals employ a second argument connecting liberty and private property .
Rather than insisting that the freedom to obtain and employ private property is simply one aspect of people ’s liberty , this second argument insists that private property effectively protects liberty , and no protection can be effective without private property .
Here the idea is that the dispersion of power that results from a free market economy based on private property protects the liberty of subjects against encroachments by the state .
As F.A. Hayek argues , “ There can be no freedom of press if the instruments of printing are under government control , no freedom of assembly if the needed rooms are so controlled , no freedom of movement if the means of transport are a government monopoly ” ( 1978 : 149 ) .
Although classical liberals agree on the fundamental importance of private property to a free society , the classical liberal tradition itself is a spectrum of views , from near - anarchist to those that attribute a significant role to the state in economic and social policy ( on this spectrum , see Mack and Gaus , 2004 ) .
Towards the extreme ‘ libertarian ’ end of the classical liberal spectrum are views of justified states as legitimate monopolies that may with justice charge for essential rights - protection services : taxation is legitimate if necessary and sufficient for effective protection of liberty and property .
Further ‘ leftward ’ we encounter classical liberal views that allow taxation for public education in particular , and more generally for public goods and social infrastructure .
Moving yet further ‘ left ’ , some classical liberal views allow for a modest social minimum .( e.g. , Hayek , 1976 : 87 ) .
Most nineteenth century classical liberal economists endorsed a variety of state policies , encompassing not only the criminal law and enforcement of contracts , but the licensing of professionals , health , safety and fire regulations , banking regulations , commercial infrastructure ( roads , harbors and canals ) and often encouraged unionization ( Gaus , 1983 b ) .
Although classical liberalism today often is associated with libertarianism , the broader classical liberal tradition was centrally concerned with bettering the lot of the working class , women , blacks , immigrants , and so on .
The aim , as Bentham put it , was to make the poor richer , not the rich poorer ( Bentham , 1952 [ 1795 ] : vol. 1 , 226n ) .
Consequently , classical liberals treat the leveling of wealth and income as outside the purview of legitimate aims of government coercion .
What has come to be known as ‘ new ’ , ‘ revisionist ’ , ‘ welfare state ’ , or perhaps best , ‘ social justice ’ , liberalism challenges this intimate connection between personal liberty and a private property based market order ( Freeden , 1978 ; Gaus , 1983 b ; Paul , Miller and Paul , 2007 ) .
Three factors help explain the rise of this revisionist theory .
First , the new liberalism arose in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , a period in which the ability of a free market to sustain what Lord Beveridge ( 1944 : 96 ) called a ‘ prosperous equilibrium ’ was being questioned .
Believing that a private property based market tended to be unstable , or could , as Keynes argued ( 1973 [ 1936 ] ) , get stuck in an equilibrium with high unemployment , new liberals came to doubt , initially in empirical grounds , that classical liberalism was an adequate foundation for a stable , free society .
Here the second factor comes into play : just as the new liberals were losing faith in the market , their faith in government as a means of supervising economic life was increasing .
This was partly due to the experiences of the First World War , in which government attempts at economic planning seemed to succeed ( Dewey , 1929 : 551–60 ) ; more importantly , this reevaluation of the state was spurred by the democratization of western states , and the conviction that , for the first time , elected officials could truly be , in J.A. Hobson ’s phrase ‘ representatives of the community ’ ( 1922 : 49 ) .
As D.G. Ritchie proclaimed :
be it observed that arguments used against ‘ government ’ action , where the government is entirely or mainly in the hands of a ruling class or caste , exercising wisely or unwisely a paternal or grandmotherly authority — such arguments lose their force just in proportion as the government becomes more and more genuinely the government of the people by the people themselves ( 1896 : 64 ) .
The third factor underlying the currency of the new liberalism was probably the most fundamental : a growing conviction that , so far from being ‘ the guardian of every other right ’ ( Ely , 1992 : 26 ) , property rights foster an unjust inequality of power .
They entrench a merely formal equality that in actual practice systematically fails to secure the kind of equal positive liberty that matters on the ground for the working class .
This theme is central to what is now called ‘ liberalism ’ in American politics , combining a strong endorsement of civil and personal liberties with indifference or even hostility to private ownership .
The seeds of this newer liberalism can be found in Mill ’s On Liberty .
Although Mill insisted that the ‘ so - called doctrine of Free Trade ’ rested on ‘ equally solid ’ grounds as did the ‘ principle of individual liberty ’ ( 1963 , vol. 18 : 293 ) , he nevertheless insisted that the justifications of personal and economic liberty were distinct .
And in his Principles of Political Economy Mill consistently emphasized that it is an open question whether personal liberty can flourish without private property ( 1963 , vol. 2 ; 203–210 ) , a view that Rawls was to reassert over a century later ( 2001 : Part IV ) .
One consequence of Rawls ’s great work , A Theory of Justice ( 1999 [ first published in 1971 ] ) is that the ‘ new liberalism ’ has become focused on developing a theory of social justice .
Since the 1960s when Rawls began to publish the elements of his emerging theory , liberal political philosophers have analyzed , and disputed , his famous ‘ difference principle ’ according to which a just basic structure of society arranges social and economic inequalities such that they are to the greatest advantage of the least well off representative group ( 1999b:266 ) .
For Rawls , the default is an equal distribution of ( basically ) income and wealth ; only inequalities that best enhance the long - term prospects of the least advantaged are just .
As Rawls sees it , the difference principle constitutes a public recognition of the principle of reciprocity : the basic structure is to be arranged such that no social group advances at the cost of another ( 2001 : 122–24 ) .
Many followers of Rawls have focused less on the ideal of reciprocity than on the commitment to equality ( Dworkin , 2000 ) .
Indeed , what was previously called ‘ welfare state ’ liberalism is now often described as liberal egalitarianism .
However , see Jan Narveson ’s essay on Hobbes ’s seeming defense of the welfare state ( in Courtland 2018 ) for historical reflections on the difference ) .
And in one way that is especially appropriate : in his later work Rawls insists that welfare - state capitalism does not constitute a just basic structure ( 2001 : 137–38 ) .
If some version of capitalism is to be just it must be a ‘ property owning democracy ’ with a wide diffusion of ownership ; a market socialist regime , in Rawls ’s view , is more just than welfare - state capitalism ( 2001 : 135-38 ) .
Not too surprisingly , classical liberals such as Hayek ( 1976 ) insist that the contemporary liberal fixation on ‘ the mirage of social justice ’ leads modern liberals to ignore the extent to which , as a matter of historical observation , freedom depends on a decentralized market based on private property , the overall results of which are unpredictable .
Thus , Robert Nozick ( 1974 : 160 ff ) famously classifies Rawls ’s difference principle as patterned but not historical : prescribing a distribution while putting no moral weight on who produced the goods being distributed .
One stark difference that emerges from this is that new liberalism ’s theory of justice is a theory about how to treat the pie while old liberalism ’s theory of justice is a theory about how to treat bakers ( Schmidtz , 2017 : 231 ) .
The problem with patterned principles is that , in Nozick ’s words , liberty upsets patterns .
“ No end - state principle or distributional patterned principle of justice can be continuously realized without continuous interference with people ’s lives . ”
To illustrate , Nozick asks you to imagine that society achieves a pattern of perfect justice by the lights of whatever principle you prefer .
Then someone offers Wilt Chamberlain a dollar for the privilege of watching Wilt play basketball .
Before we know it , thousands of people are paying
Wilt a dollar each , every time Wilt puts on a show .
Wilt gets rich .
The distribution is no longer equal , and no one complains .
Nozick ’s question :
If justice is a pattern , achievable at a given moment , what happens if you achieve perfection ?
Must you then prohibit everything — no further consuming , creating , trading , or even giving — so as not to upset the perfect pattern ?
Notice : Nozick neither argues nor presumes people can do whatever they want with their property .
Nozick , recalling the focus on connecting property rights to liberty that animated liberalism in its classical form , notes that if there is anything at all people can do , even if the only thing they are free to do is give a coin to an entertainer , then even that tiniest of liberties will , over time , disturb the favored pattern .
Nozick is right that if we focus on time slices , we focus on isolated moments , and take moments too seriously , when what matters is not the pattern of holdings at a moment but the pattern of how people treat each other over time .
Even tiny liberties must upset the pattern of a static moment .
By the same token , however , there is no reason why liberty must upset an ongoing pattern of fair treatment .
A moral principle forbidding racial discrimination , for example , prescribes no particular end - state .
Such a principle is what Nozick calls weakly patterned , sensitive to history as well as to pattern , and prescribing an ideal of how people should be treated without prescribing an end - state distribution .
It affects the pattern without prescribing a pattern .
And if a principle forbidding racial discrimination works its way into a society via cultural progress rather than legal intervention , it need not involve any interference whatsoever .
So , although Nozick sometimes speaks as if his critique applies to all patterns , we should take seriously his concession that “ weak ” patterns are compatible with liberty .
Some may promote liberty , depending on how they are introduced and maintained .
See Schmidtz and Brennan ( 2010 : chap.6 ) .
For work by modern liberals that resonates with Nozick ’s dissection of the dimensions of equality that plausibly can count as liberal , see also Anderson ( 1999 ) , Young ( 1990 ) , and Sen ( 1992 ) .
Accordingly , even granting to Nozick that time - slice principles license immense , constant , intolerable interference with everyday life , there is some reason to doubt that Rawls intended to embrace any such view .
In his first article , Rawls said , “ we cannot determine the justness of a situation by examining it at a single moment . ”
Years later , Rawls added , “ It is a mistake to focus attention on the varying relative positions of individuals and to require that every change , considered as a single transaction viewed in isolation , be in itself just .
It is the arrangement of the basic structure which is to be judged , and judged from a general point of view . ”
Thus , to Rawls , basic structure ’s job is not to make every transaction work to the working class ’s advantage , let alone to the advantage of each member of the class .
Rawls was more realistic than that .
Instead , it is the trend of a whole society over time that is supposed to benefit the working class as a class .
To be sure , Rawls was a kind of egalitarian , but the pattern Rawls meant to endorse was a pattern of equal status , applying not so much to a distribution as to an ongoing relationship .
This is not to say that Nozick ’s critique had no point .
Nozick showed what an alternative theory might look like , portraying Wilt Chamberlain as a separate person in a more robust sense ( unencumbered by nebulous debts to society ) than Rawls could countenance .
To Nozick , Wilt ’s advantages are not what Wilt finds on the table ;
Wilt ’s advantages are what Wilt brings to the table .
And respecting what Wilt brings to the table is the exact essence of respecting him as a separate person .
In part due to Nozick , today ’s egalitarians now acknowledge that any equality worthy of aspiration will focus less on justice as a property of a time - slice distribution and more on how people are treated : how they are rewarded for their contributions and enabled over time to make contributions worth rewarding .
( Schmidtz and Brennan , 2010 : chap .6 ) .
As his work evolved , Rawls ( 1996 : 5 ff ) insisted that his liberalism was not a ‘ comprehensive ’ doctrine , that is , one which includes an overall theory of value , an ethical theory , an epistemology , or a controversial metaphysics of the person and society .
Our modern societies , characterized by a ‘ reasonable pluralism ’ , are already filled with such doctrines .
The aim of ‘ political liberalism ’ is not to add yet another sectarian doctrine , but to provide a political framework that is neutral between such controversial comprehensive doctrines ( Larmore , 1996 : 121ff ) .
If it is to serve as the basis for public reasoning in our diverse western societies , liberalism must be restricted to a core set of political principles that are , or can be , the subject of consensus among all reasonable citizens .
Rawls ’s notion of a purely political conception of liberalism seems more austere than the traditional liberal political theories discussed above , being largely restricted to constitutional principles upholding basic civil liberties and the democratic process .
As Gaus ( 2004 ) has argued , the distinction between ‘ political ’ and ‘ comprehensive ’ liberalism misses a great deal .
Liberal theories form a broad continuum , from those that constitute full - blown philosophical systems , to those that rely on a full theory of value and the good , to those that rely on a theory of the right ( but not the good ) , all the way to those that seek to be purely political doctrines .
Nevertheless , it is important to appreciate that , though liberalism is primarily a political theory , it has been associated with broader theories of ethics , value , and society .
Indeed , many believe that liberalism cannot rid itself of all controversial metaphysical ( Hampton , 1989 ) or epistemological ( Raz , 1990 ) commitments .
Following Wilhelm von Humboldt ( 1993 [ 1854 ] ) , in On Liberty Mill argues that one basis for endorsing freedom ( Mill believes there are many ) , is the goodness of developing individuality and cultivating capacities :
Individuality is the same thing with development , and …it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces , or can produce , well - developed human beings … what more can be said of any condition of human affairs , than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to the best thing they can be ?
or what worse can be said of any obstruction to good , than that it prevents this ?
( Mill , 1963 , vol. 18 : 267 )
This is not just a theory about politics : it is a substantive , perfectionist , moral theory about the good .
On this view , the right thing to do is to promote development or perfection , but only a regime securing extensive liberty for each person can accomplish this ( Wall , 1998 ) .
This moral ideal of human perfection and development dominated liberal thinking in the latter part of the nineteenth century , and much of the twentieth : not only Mill , but T.H. Green , L.T. Hobhouse , Bernard Bosanquet , John Dewey and even Rawls show allegiance to variants of this perfectionist ethic and the claim that it provides a foundation for endorsing a regime of liberal rights ( Gaus , 1983a ) .
And it is fundamental to the proponents of liberal autonomy discussed above , as well as ‘ liberal virtue ’ theorists such as William Galston ( 1980 ) .
That the good life is necessarily a freely chosen one in which a person develops his unique capacities as part of a plan of life is probably the dominant liberal ethic of the past century .
The main challenge to Millian perfectionism ’s status as the distinctly liberal ethic comes from moral contractualism , which can be divided into what might very roughly be labeled ‘ Kantian ’ and ‘ Hobbesian ’ versions .
According to Kantian contractualism , “ society , being composed of a plurality of persons , each with his own aims , interests , and conceptions of the good , is best arranged when it is governed by principles that do not themselves presuppose any particular conception of the good … ” ( Sandel , 1982 : 1 ) .
On this view , respect for the personhood of others demands that we refrain from imposing our view of the good life on them .
Only principles that can be justified to all respect the personhood of each .
We thus witness the tendency of recent liberal theory ( Reiman , 1990 ; Scanlon , 1998 ) to transform the social contract from an account of the state to an overall justification of morality , or at least a social morality .
Basic to such ‘ Kantian contractualism ’ is the idea that suitably idealized individuals are motivated not by the pursuit of gain , but by a commitment or desire to publicly justify the claims they make on others ( Reiman , 1990 ; Scanlon , 1982 ) .
A moral code that could be the object of agreement among such individuals is thus a publicly justified morality .
In contrast , distinctively Hobbesian contractualism supposes only that individuals are self - interested and correctly perceive that each person ’s ability to effectively pursue her interests is enhanced by a framework of norms that structure social life and divide the fruits of social cooperation ( Gauither , 1986 ; Hampton , 1986 ; Kavka , 1986 ) .
Morality , then , is a common framework that advances the self - interest of each .
The claim of Hobbesian contractualism to be a distinctly liberal conception of morality stems from the importance of individual freedom and property in such a common framework : only systems of norms that allow each person great freedom to pursue her interests as she sees fit could , it is argued , be the object of consensus among self - interested agents ( Courtland , 2008 ; Gaus 2003a : chap .
3 ; Gaus , 2012 ; Ridge , 1998 ; Gauthier , 1995 ) .
The continuing problem for Hobbesian contractualism is the apparent rationality of free - riding : if everyone ( or enough ) complies with the terms of the contract , and so social order is achieved , it would seem rational to defect , and act immorally when one can gain by doing so .
This is essentially the argument of Hobbes ’s ‘ Foole ’ , and from Hobbes ( 1948 [ 1651 ] : 94ff ) to Gauthier ( 1986 : 160 ff ) , Hobbesians have tried to reply to it .
Turning from rightness to goodness , we can identify three main candidates for a liberal theory of value .
We have already encountered the first : perfectionism .
Insofar as perfectionism is a theory of right action , it can be understood as an account of morality .
Obviously , however , it is an account of rightness that presupposes a theory of value or the good : the ultimate human value is developed personality or an autonomous life .
Competing with this objectivist theory of value are two other liberal accounts : pluralism and subjectivism .
In his famous defence of negative liberty , Berlin insisted that values or ends are plural , and no interpersonally justifiable ranking among these many ends is to be had .
More than that , Berlin maintained that the pursuit of one end necessarily implies that other ends will not be achieved .
In this sense ends collide .
In economic terms , the pursuit of one end entails opportunity costs : foregone pursuits which cannot be impersonally shown to be less worthy .
There is no interpersonally justifiable way to rank the ends , and no way to achieve them all .
Each person must devote herself to some ends at the cost of ignoring others .
For the pluralist , then , autonomy , perfection or development are not necessarily ranked higher than hedonistic pleasures , environmental preservation or economic equality .
All compete for our allegiance , but because they are incommensurable , no choice can be interpersonally justified .
The pluralist is not a subjectivist : that values are many , competing and incommensurable does not imply that they are somehow dependent on subjective experiences .
But the claim that what a person values rests on experiences that vary from person to person has long been a part of the liberal tradition .
To Hobbes , what one values depends on what one desires ( 1948 [ 1651 ] : 48 ) .
Locke advances a ‘ taste theory of value ’ :
The Mind has a different relish , as well as the Palate ; and you will as fruitlessly endeavour to delight all Man with Riches or Glory , ( which yet some Men place their Happiness in , ) as you would satisfy all men ’s Hunger with Cheese or Lobsters ; which , though very agreeable and delicious fare to some , are to others extremely nauseous and offensive :
And many People would with reason preferr [ sic ] the griping of an hungry Belly , to those Dishes , which are a Feast to others .
Hence it was , I think , that the Philosophers of old did in vain enquire , whether the Summum bonum consisted in Riches , or bodily Delights , or Virtue , or Contemplation :
And they might have as reasonably disputed , whether the best Relish were to be found in Apples , Plumbs or Nuts ; and have divided themselves into Sects upon it .
For…pleasant
Tastes depend not on the things themselves , but their agreeableness to this or that particulare Palate , wherein there is great variety … ( 1975 [ 1706 ] : 269 ) .
The perfectionist , the pluralist and the subjectivist concur on the crucial point : the nature of value is such that reasonable people pursue different ways of living .
To the perfectionist , this is because each person has unique capacities , the development of which confers value on her life ; to the pluralist , it is because values are many and conflicting , and no one life can include them all , or make the interpersonally correct choice among them ; and to the subjectivist , it is because our ideas about what is valuable stem from our desires or tastes , and these differ from one individual to another .
All three views , then , defend the basic liberal idea that people rationally follow different ways of living .
But in themselves , such notions of the good are not full - fledged liberal ethics , for an additional argument is required linking liberal value with norms of equal liberty , and to the idea that other people command a certain respect and a certain deference simply by virtue of having values of their own .
To be sure , Berlin seems to believe this is a very quick argument : the inherent plurality of ends points to the political preeminence of liberty ( see , for example , Gray : 2006 ) .
Guaranteeing each a measure of negative liberty is , Berlin argues , the most humane ideal , as it recognizes that ‘ human goals are many ’ , and no one can make a choice that is right for all people ( 1969 : 171 ) .
It is here that subjectivists and pluralists alike sometimes rely on versions of moral contractualism .
Those who insist that liberalism is ultimately nihilistic can be interpreted as arguing that this transition cannot be made successfully : liberals , on their view , are stuck with a subjectivistic or pluralistic theory of value , and no account of the right emerges from it .
Throughout the last century , liberalism has been beset by controversies between , on the one hand , those broadly identified as ‘ individualists ’ and , on the other , ‘ collectivists ’ , ‘ communitarians ’ or ‘ organicists ’ ( for skepticism about this , though , see Bird , 1999 ) .
These vague and sweeping designations have been applied to a wide array of disputes ; we focus here on controversies concerning ( i ) the nature of society ; ( ii ) the nature of the self .
Liberalism is , of course , usually associated with individualist analyses of society .
‘ Human beings in society ’ , Mill claimed , ‘ have no properties but those which are derived from , and which may be resolved into , the laws of the nature of individual men ’ ( 1963 , Vol. 8 : 879 ; see also Bentham : 1970 [ 1823 ] : chap . I , sec. 4 ) .
Herbert Spencer agreed : “ the properties of the mass are dependent upon the attributes of its component parts ” ( 1995 [ 1851 ] : 1 ) .
In the last years of the nineteenth century this individualist view was increasingly subject to attack , especially by those who were influenced by idealist philosophy .
D. G. Ritche , criticizing Spencer ’s individualist liberalism , denies that society is simply a ‘ heap ’ of individuals , insisting that it is more akin to an organism , with a complex internal life ( 1896 : 13 ) .
Liberals such as L. T. Hobhouse and Dewey refused to adopt radically collectivist views such as those advocated by Bernard Bosanquet ( 2001 ) , but they too rejected the radical individualism of Bentham , Mill and Spencer .
Throughout most of the first half of the twentieth century such ‘ organic ’ analyses of society held sway in liberal theory , even in economics ( see A. F Mummery and J. A. Hobson , 1956 : 106 ; J.M. Keynes , 1972 : 275 ) .
During and after the Second World War the idea that liberalism was based on inherently individualist analysis of humans - in - society arose again .
Karl Popper ’s The Open Society and its Enemies ( 1945 ) presented a sustained critique of Hegelian and Marxist theory and its collectivist and historicist , and to Popper , inherently illiberal , understanding of society .
The reemergence of economic analysis in liberal theory brought to the fore a thoroughgoing methodological individualism .
Writing in the early 1960s , James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock adamantly defended the ‘ individualistic postulate ’ against all forms of ‘ organicism ’ : “ This [ organicist ] approach or theory of the collectivity ….is essentially opposed to the Western philosophical tradition in which the human individual is the primary philosophical entity ” ( 1965 : 11–12 ) .
Human beings , insisted Buchanan and Tullock , are the only real choosers and decision - makers , and their preferences determine both public and private actions .
The renascent individualism of late - twentieth century liberalism was closely bound up with the induction of Hobbes as a member of the liberal pantheon .
Hobbes ’s relentlessly individualistic account of society , and the manner in which his analysis of the state of nature lent itself to game - theoretical modeling , yielded a highly individualist , formal analysis of the liberal state and liberal morality .
Of course , as is widely known , the last twenty - five years have witnessed a renewed interest in collectivist analyses of liberal society — though the term ‘ collectivist ’ is abjured in favor of ‘ communitarian ’ .
Writing in 1985 , Amy Gutmann observed that “ we are witnessing a revival of communitarian criticisms of liberal political theory .
Like the critics of the 1960s , those of the 1980s fault liberalism for being mistakenly and irreparably individualistic ” ( 1985 : 308 ) .
Starting with Michael Sandel ’s ( 1982 ) famous criticism of Rawls , a number of critics charge that liberalism is necessarily premised on an abstract conception of individual selves as pure choosers , whose commitments , values and concerns are possessions of the self , but never constitute the self .
Although the ‘ liberal - communitarian ’ debate ultimately involved wide - ranging moral , political and sociological disputes about the nature of communities , and the rights and responsibilities of their members , the heart of the debate was about the nature of liberal selves .
For Sandel the flaw at the heart of Rawls ’s liberalism is its implausibly abstract theory of the self , the pure autonomous chooser .
Rawls , he charges , ultimately assumes that it makes sense to identify us with a pure capacity for choice , and that such pure choosers might reject any or all of their attachments and values and yet retain their identity .
From the mid-1980s onwards various liberals sought to show how liberalism may consistently advocate a theory of the self which finds room for cultural membership and other non-chosen attachments and commitments which at least partially constitute the self ( Kymlicka , 1989 ) .
Much of liberal theory has became focused on the issue as to how we can be social creatures , members of cultures and raised in various traditions , while also being autonomous choosers who employ our liberty to construct lives of our own .
In On Liberty Mill argued that “ Liberty , as a principle , has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion ” ( 1963 , vol. 18 : 224 ) .
Thus “ Despotism is a legitimate form of government in dealing with barbarians , provided the end be their improvement … ” ( 1963 , vol. 18 : 224 ) .
This passage — infused with the spirit of nineteenth century imperialism ( and perhaps , as some maintain , latent racism ) — is often ignored by defenders of Mill as an embarrassment ( Parekh , 1994 ; Parekh , 1995 ; Mehta , 1999 ; Pitts , 2005 ) .
This is not to say that such Millian passages are without thoughtful defenders .
See , for example , Inder Marawah ( 2011 ) .
Nevertheless , it raises a question that still divides liberals : are liberal political principles justified for all political communities ?
In The Law of Peoples Rawls argues that they are not .
According to Rawls there can be a ‘ decent hierarchical society ’ which is not based on the liberal conception of all persons as free and equal , but instead views persons as “ responsible and cooperating members of their respective groups ” but not inherently equal ( 1999a : 66 ) .
Given this , the full liberal conception of justice cannot be constructed out of shared ideas of this ‘ people ’ , though basic human rights , implicit in the very idea of a social cooperative structure , apply to all peoples .
David Miller ( 2002 ) develops a different defense of this anti-universalistic position , while those such as Thomas Pogge ( 2002 : ch. 4 ) and Martha Nussbaum ( 2002 ) reject Rawls ’s position , instead advocating versions of moral universalism : they claim that liberal moral principles apply to all states .
The debate about whether liberal principles apply to all political communities should not be confused with the debate as to whether liberalism is a state - centered theory , or whether , at least ideally , it is a cosmopolitan political theory for the community of all humankind .
Immanuel Kant — a moral universalist if ever there was one — argued that all states should respect the dignity of their citizens as free and equal persons , yet denied that humanity forms one political community .
Thus he rejected the ideal of a universal cosmopolitan liberal political community in favor of a world of states , all with internally just constitutions , and united in a confederation to assure peace ( 1970 [ 1795 ] ) .
On a classical liberal theory , the difference between a world of liberal communities and a world liberal community is not of fundamental importance .
Since the aim of government in a community is to assure the basic liberty and property rights of its citizens , borders are not of great moral significance in classical liberalism ( Lomasky , 2007 ) .
In contrast under the ‘ new ’ liberalism , which stresses redistributive programs to achieve social justice , it matters a great deal who is included within the political or moral community .
If liberal principles require significant redistribution , then it is crucially important whether these principles apply only within particular communities , or whether their reach is global .
Thus a fundamental debate between Rawls and many of his followers is whether the difference principle should only be applied within a liberal state such as the United States ( where the least well off are the least well off Americans ) , or whether it should be applied globally ( where the least well off are the least well off in the world ) ( Rawls , 1999a : 113 ff ; Beitz , 1973 : 143ff ; Pogge , 1989 : Part Three ) .
Liberal political theory also fractures concerning the appropriate response to groups ( cultural , religious , etc. ) which endorse illiberal policies and values .
These groups may deny education to some of their members , advocate female genital mutilation , restrict religious freedom , maintain an inequitable caste system , and so on .
When , if ever , should a liberal group interfere with the internal governance of an illiberal group ?
Suppose first that the illiberal group is another political community or state .
Can liberals intervene in the affairs of non-liberal states ?
Mill provides a complicated answer in his 1859 essay ‘ A Few Words on Non-Intervention ’ .
Reiterating his claim from On Liberty that civilized and non-civilized countries are to be treated differently , he insists that “ barbarians have no rights as a nation , except a right to such treatment as may , at the earliest possible period , fit them for becoming one .
The only moral laws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government , are the universal rules of morality between man and man ” ( 1963 , vol. 21 : 119 ) .
Although this strikes us today as simply a case for an objectionable paternalistic imperialism ( and it certainly was such a case ) , Mill ’s argument for the conclusion is more complex , including a claim that , since international morality depends on reciprocity , ‘ barbarous ’ governments that cannot be counted on to engage in reciprocal behavior have no rights qua governments .
In any event , when Mill turns to interventions among ‘ civilized ’ peoples he develops an altogether more sophisticated account as to when one state can intervene in the affairs of another to protect liberal principles .
Here Mill is generally against intervention .
“ The reason is , that there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention , even if successful , would be for the good of the people themselves .
The only test possessing any real value , of a people ’s having become fit for popular institutions , is that they , or a sufficient proportion of them to prevail in the contest , are willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation ” ( 1963 , vol. 21 : 122 ) .
In addition to questions of efficacy , to the extent that peoples or groups have rights to collective self - determination , intervention by a liberal group to induce a non-liberal community to adopt liberal principles will be morally objectionable .
As with individuals , liberals may think that peoples or groups have freedom to make mistakes in managing their collective affairs .
If people ’s self - conceptions are based on their participation in such groups , even those whose liberties are denied may object to , and perhaps in some way harmed by , the imposition of liberal principles ( Margalit and Raz , 1990 ; Tamir , 1993 ) .
Thus rather than proposing a doctrine of intervention many liberals propose various principles of toleration which specify to what extent liberals must tolerate non-liberal peoples and cultures .
As is usual , Rawls ’s discussion is subtle and enlightening .
In his account of the foreign affairs of liberal peoples , Rawls argues that liberal peoples must distinguish ‘ decent ’ non-liberal societies from ‘ outlaw ’ and other states ; the former have a claim on liberal peoples to tolerance while the latter do not ( 1999a : 59–61 ) .
Decent peoples , argues Rawls , ‘ simply do not tolerate ’ outlaw states which ignore human rights : such states may be subject to ‘ forceful sanctions and even to intervention ’ ( 1999a : 81 ) .
In contrast , Rawls insists that “ liberal peoples must try to encourage [ non- liberal ] decent peoples and not frustrate their vitality by coercively insisting that all societies be liberal ” ( 1999a : 62 ) .
Chandran Kukathas ( 2003 ) — whose liberalism derives from the classical tradition — is inclined to almost complete toleration of non-liberal peoples , with the non-trivial proviso that there must be exit rights .
The status of non-liberal groups within liberal societies has increasingly become a subject of debate , especially with respect to some citizens of faith .
We should distinguish two questions : ( i ) to what extent should non-liberal cultural and religious communities be exempt from the requirements of the liberal state ?
and , ( ii ) to what extent can they be allowed to participate in decision - making in the liberal state ?
Turning to ( i ) , liberalism has a long history of seeking to accommodate religious groups that have deep objections to certain public policies , such as the Quakers , Mennonites or Sikhs .
The most difficult issues in this regard arise in relation to children and education ( see Galston , 2003 ; Fowler , 2010 ; Andersson , 2011 ) Mill , for example , writes :
Consider … the case of education .
Is it not almost a self - evident axiom , that the State should require and compel the education , up to a certain standard , of every human being who is born its citizen ?
Yet who is there that is not afraid to recognize and assert this truth ?
Hardly any one indeed will deny that it is one of the most sacred duties of the parents ( or , as law and usage now stand , the father ) , after summoning a human being into the world , to give to that being an education fitting him to perform his part well in life towards others and towards himself … . that to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able , not only to provide food for its body , but instruction and training for its mind , is a moral crime , both against the unfortunate offspring and against society … . ( 1963 , vol . 18 )
Over the last thirty years , there has been a particular case that is at the core of this debate — Wisconsin vs. Yoder : [ 406 U.S. 205 ( 1972 ) ] .
In this case , the United States Supreme Court upheld the right of Amish parents to avoid compulsory schooling laws and remove their children from school at the age of 14 — thus , according to the Amish , avoiding secular influences that might undermine the traditional Amish way of life .
Because cultural and religious communities raise and educate children , they cannot be seen as purely voluntary opt-outs from the liberal state : they exercise coercive power over children , and so basic liberal principles about protecting the innocent from unjustified coercion come into play .
Some have maintained that liberal principles require that the state should intervene ( against groups like the Amish ) in order to [ 1 ] provide the children with an effective right of exit that would otherwise be denied via a lack of education ( Okin , 2002 ) , [ 2 ] to protect the children ’s right to an autonomous and ‘ open future ’ ( Feinberg , 1980 ) and / or [ 3 ] to insure that children will have the cognitive tools to prepare them for their future role as citizens ( Galston , 1995 : p. 529 ; Macedo , 1995 : pp. 285–6 ) .
Other liberal theorists , on the other hand , have argued that the state should not intervene because it might undermine the inculcation of certain values that are necessary for the continued existence of certain comprehensive doctrines ( Galston , 1995 : p. 533 ; Stolzenberg , 1993 : pp. 582–3 ) .
Moreover , some such as Harry Brighouse ( 1998 ) have argued that the inculcation of liberal values through compulsory education might undermine the legitimacy of liberal states because children would not ( due to possible indoctrination ) be free to consent to such institutions .
Question ( ii ) — the extent to which non-liberal beliefs and values may be employed in liberal political discussion — has become the subject of sustained debate in the years following Rawls ’s Political Liberalism .
According to Rawls ’s liberalism — and what we might call ‘ public reason liberalism ’ more generally — because our societies are characterized by ‘ reasonable pluralism ’ , coercion cannot be justified on the basis of comprehensive moral or religious systems of belief .
But many friends of religion ( e.g. , Eberle , 2002 ; Perry , 1993 ) argue that this is objectionably ‘ exclusionary ’ : conscientious believers are barred from voting on their deepest convictions .
Again liberals diverge in their responses .
Some such as Stephen Macedo take a pretty hard - nosed attitude : ‘ if some people … feel “ silenced ” or “ marginalized ” by the fact that some of us believe that it is wrong to shape basic liberties on the basis of religious or metaphysical claims , I can only say “ grow up ! ” ’ ( 2000 : 35 ) .
Rawls , in contrast , seeks to be more accommodating , allowing that arguments based on religious comprehensive doctrines may enter into liberal politics on issues of basic justice “ provided that , in due course , we give properly public reasons to support the principles and policies that our comprehensive doctrine is said to support ” ( 1999a : 144 ) .
Thus Rawls allows the legitimacy of religious - based arguments against slavery and in favor of the United States civil rights movement , because ultimately such arguments were supported by public reasons .
Others ( e.g. , Greenawalt , 1995 ) hold that even this is too restrictive : it is difficult for liberals to justify a moral prohibition on a religious citizen from voicing her view in liberal political debate .
Gaus and Vallier seek to ameliorate such tensions , in part , by acknowledging an asymmetry between the ‘ reasons to justify to another a law ’ and the ‘ reasons to reject ’ a law ( 2009 : 54 ) .
They argue that although “ a secular rationale is necessary in our society for a publicly justified law , it can be defeated by a reasonable religious conviction without secular backing ” ( 2009 : 63 ) .
Thus , citizens of faith would be able to preserve their religious integrity , all the while remaining unable to coerce others via unshared religious reasons .
Given that liberalism fractures on so many issues — the nature of liberty , the place of property and democracy in a just society , the comprehensiveness and the reach of the liberal ideal — one might wonder whether there is any point in talking of ‘ liberalism ’ at all .
It is not , though , an unimportant or trivial thing that all these theories take liberty to be the grounding political value .
Radical democrats assert the overriding value of equality , communitarians maintain that the demands of belongingness trump freedom , and conservatives complain that the liberal devotion to freedom undermines traditional values and virtues and so social order itself .
Intramural disputes aside , liberals join in rejecting these conceptions of political right .
Google 's AppEngine is being compared to Amazon 's EC2 / S3 .
But Google deserves credit here for coming up with a pretty differently - positioned product .
There may be overlap for many users of course , but it 's really operating at a whole different level of the stack .
Folks that want / need more control over the environment , ability to manually manage their own machine instances , run code other than python , etc. will stay with EC2 .
EC2 is a step above RackSpace .
But rather than thinking of AppEngine as a step above EC2 , instead I think of it somewhere around Myspace .
Or " Ning 1.0 " , as Zoho points out .
In the beginning was GeoCities ...
No , even further back , in the beginning was Hypercard .
Hypercard was a pre-web application for Macs that let you design a " stack " of pages - a website on a floppy , really .
Popular stacks got traded far and wide .
Hypercard stacks existed for every imaginable purpose - " Time Table of History " , games , crossword puzzles , the Bible , etc .
The thing about Hypercard was that it was n't just static text and images like base html .
It had a scripting language , a database , and the Apple UI built - in , so you could create mini applications .
It feels like the web has been trying to claw its way back to the simple utility of Hypercard ever since Mosaic .
GeoCities was the first massive - uptake anyone - can - build - here website haven .
But it was all static html .
Sure , you can paste javascript widgets onto your page , and have content driven by external sites .
But to make the website a first - class object - on functional partity with a " real " website - it needs to be backed by a database and programmability .
But setting up mysql , renting machine space , configuring linux , programming all the boilerplate , not to mention the scalability issues if your site gets popular -- this is all a big hurdle .
So to hide all those details behind a platform that 's easy to get started with , and lower the bar to entry to writing public application websites ...
Well that 's a big deal .
Hat 's off to Google for bringing this to market .
I 'm not alone ... somewhat similar thoughts from Nate Westheimer ...

There 's been some controversy surrounding the group Connected Nation , as some have accused it of basically being a front group for AT&T -- though the evidence on that front still seems a bit weak .
Whether or not you believe them , the group has now released a report claiming that a more comprehensive national broadband policy would boost the economy by $ 134 billion .
These types of studies are always a little questionable , as it's common for the entities putting them together ( who are obviously biased ) to pick and choose how they count the economic impact of certain actions , playing up things that help their case and ignoring those that hurt their case .
However , there is some additional evidence out there that better broadband coverage does improve the economy .
In the past , we 've pointed to a variety of municipal broadband efforts that boosted local economies in very noticeable ways .
Of course , the critics of Connected Nation will quickly point out that Connected Nation 's plans for a broadband plan could actually serve to hurt those municipal providers .
At this point , I 'm still rather agnostic on the issue .
I agree that better broadband can help the economy , but I 'm not convinced that anyone has really come up with a plan that provides that type of benefit to the entire country in a way that does n't have dangerous unintended consequences .
In some ways , it 's similar to the debate over whether you want competition at the platform level or above it , as that would influence the decisions on how to encourage broadband .
If you think it 's better to focus on competition above the platform , rather than between platforms , then a national broadband policy makes sense ( in fact , you could think of it more like the highway system ) .
If you think it 's better to have competition between platforms themselves , then a national broadband policy might not make sense .
There are compelling arguments on both sides , so maybe we can hash out some thoughts in the comments .

Marine exercise in Toledo , Ohio : an attack on democratic rights
By Charles Bogle
29 February 2008
On Friday , February 8 , a five - bus convoy transported 200 members of Company A , 1st Battalion , 24th Marines , based in Grand Rapids , Michigan , to Toledo , Ohio , for three days of patrol exercises in the central downtown area .
Using the nearly abandoned Madison Building on Madison Avenue as headquarters , the company of Marines , carrying M16 rifles and wearing camouflage uniforms , planned to drive military vehicles through the city streets and carry out foot patrols , engaging in mock gunfights and ambushes with blank ammunition .
A member of the company , Sergeant Davis , had driven ahead of the convoy , but when he arrived downtown and stepped out of his vehicle at approximately 3:20 p.m. ( when school children were being bused through the city ) , he was told by a city employee that Toledo Mayor Carty Finkbeiner wanted him and his soldiers to pack up their equipment and leave by 6 p.m .
The mayor subsequently declared that he had not even been notified of the Marine deployment , and learned of it only through Toledo ’s major newspaper , the Blade , on the day of their arrival .
Sergeant Davis agreed and , after a brief stop at a Marine base in nearby Perrysburg , Ohio , he and the rest of the company returned to their Grand Rapids , Michigan , base .
According to Brian Schwartz , the mayor ’s spokesperson , Mayor Finkbeiner took this action because armed Marines patrolling city streets “ frighten people ” ( “ Mayor to Marines , Leave downtown , ” the Blade , 9 February 2008 ) .
In 2006 , the same Marines battalion trained in downtown Toledo , and the mayor said that at that time he “ saw the military with guns drawn emulating warfare , and I observed the expressions of citizens who happened to just be coming down the sidewalk that particular Saturday noon in wonderment , asking , ‘ What have I found myself in the middle of ? ’ ”
The mayor added that he saw looks of “ wonderment ” and “ fear ” on the faces of these citizens .
In deciding not to allow the Marine Battalion to patrol the streets of Toledo , Mayor Finkbeiner was asserting the US constitutional principle of civilian authority over the military .
While the mayor has stated that he had no advance notice of the planned Marine exercise , the Toledo police knew several days in advance of the battalion ’s plans , and had issued press releases to media outlets on behalf of the Marines , urging “ Toledoans not be startled by the sight of camouflaged soldiers toting M16 rifles . ”
The only official reason given for not informing the mayor of the Marines ’ visit relates to the 2006 exercise .
At that time , the battalion ’s exercises drew protests from the downtown citizens and an order from Mayor Finkbeiner to then police chief Jack Smith ( a former Marine ) that “ he did not want the Marines back . ”
Police Chief Smith “ took his run-in with the mayor as an objection to that last visit [ 2006 ] and not future training in Toledo , ” according to a February 8 article in the Blade .
Bypassing the authority of the Toledo mayor to exercise civilian authority over the military constitutes an attack on basic democratic rights , an attack that must be understood within the context of the utilization of the “ war on terror ” as a pretext for imposing draconian economic and social conditions on American working people and erecting the institutional framework for police - state forms of rule .
The danger of police - military repression has grown apace with the economic slide into recession and the social crisis fueled by the collapse in the housing market and the growing wave of home foreclosures .
There can be little doubt that exercises such as that planned by the Marines in downtown Toledo are directed far more against the American population than against foreign or domestic terrorists .
The question posed is : are such military exercises in major US urban areas dry runs for measures to be taken in the event of widespread social unrest ?
Given its deteriorating economic environment , Toledo offers the distinct possibility of such unrest .
The official Toledo unemployment rate is 6.4 percent , 1.5 percent above the national rate .
Overall , the Toledo poverty rate , as of 2006 , is 22.7 percent , while 31 percent of Toledo Public Schools students live in poverty .
Since 2000 , the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by 22.6 percent , and , according to the Toledo homeless planning and advocacy community , 2,785 Toledoans experienced homelessness during the past year .
With several more manufacturing sites due to close this year and the city foreclosure rate among the top 20 nationally , social tensions will only worsen .
Toledo also has a history of explosive labor struggles .
The most famous , the Toledo Electric Auto - Lite strike in 1934 , was called by the workers for the right to be recognized and bargain as a union .
At one rally , hundreds of picketers and supporters were injured while two were killed by the Ohio National Guard .
Ultimately , the striking workers won reinstatement and their local won recognition as a legitimate bargaining agent .
In 2006 , the Blade ’s lengthy lockout of 650 members of the Toledo Newspaper Guild included a successful rally against the employer ’s use of a union - busting law firm , even though the locked - out employees were surrounded by police officers in riot gear and police helicopters circling overhead .
Military exercises in cities other than Toledo have been carried out as supposed anti-terrorist exercises .
The same Marines battalion that visited Toledo has engaged in similar exercises in urban areas of Florida , a state also being hit hard by the present economic crisis .
Also , the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit , Camp Pendleton , California , have taken part in “ urban assault training ” in parts of Arizona ( “ The Marines land in Arizona : Units engaged in urban assault training exercises , ” www.worldnetdaily.com), a state with a growing Mexican immigrant population that is experiencing declining economic conditions .
For 2008 , US Northern Command has announced an anti-terrorism exercise called Vigilant Shield 2008 to prepare the US for terrorist or natural disaster scenarios .
These exercises , making domestic use of the US military including the US Air Force , will take place in Portland , Oregon , Phoenix , Arizona , and the Territory of Guam .
Tellingly , part of the thinking behind these exercises is that if a terrorist incident were to take place and Iran were to be blamed for the attack , the military could be used against antiwar agitation in the US ( “ Vigilant Shield 2008 , ” www.globalresearch.ca).
One Toledo city employee told this reporter that a Homeland Security grant to the city ’s police department is rumored to be coming due .
The same employee also spoke of the growing militarism of police departments , both locally and nationally .
As an example , he noted the fact that Toledo police offices have been receiving M16s , which are then converted to semi-automatic weapons .
Political attacks on Mayor Finkbeiner underscore the increasing weight of the military on civilian affairs .
On February 13 , the Toledo City Council , composed of Democrats and Republicans , voted unanimously to go over the Democratic mayor ’s head and approve a resolution apologizing to the Marine battalion for the mayor ’s action .
Preceding the vote , one of the council members , former Marine John Schaub , stated , “ We are at war and no one seems to understand that , so we should be rolling out the red carpet for these kids so they can be trained . ”
Another council member , D. Michael Collins , called the situation “ an embarrassment for the city , ” according to the Blade .
The mainstream media ’s role in this and similar incidents is to stifle dissent .
Alongside the Toledo story , which has focused on the mayor ’s lack of patriotism and unwillingness to apologize to the Marines , print and visual media have been covering a story that began January 29 , when the City Council in Berkeley , California passed a resolution opposing US Marine Corps recruitment in the city .
A right - wing campaign ensued , including efforts by lawmakers to withdraw federal funding from the city and decisions by business reporters to boycott Berkeley .
This assault — echoed by favorable reports in the media — has been aimed at sending a clear message to the general population that a heavy price will be attached to any form of dissent .
In the face of the right - wing campaign against their actions , the City Council made a hasty and cowardly retreat .

Secret government ?
By Bruce Fein
In 2006 , House Judiciary Democrats inquired when the Justice Department initially concluded the Authorization to Use Military Force ( AUMF ) against international terrorism empowered the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance against U.S. citizens in contravention of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ( FISA ) .
President Bush had earlier publicly explained that the NSA ’s warrantless spying had commenced in October 2001 in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks ; and the department had previously volunteered that the AUMF was its primary legal rationale .
The question pertained to exposing circumventions of FISA by executive officials , which could ultimately lead to impeachment .
The statute makes FISA the “ exclusive ” means of gathering foreign intelligence by targeting American citizens on American soil , and punishes intentional violations .

There may be worse inflation to come .
Food experts say steep increases in commodity prices have not fully made their way to street stalls in the developing world or supermarkets in the West .
Governments in many poor countries have tried to respond by stepping up food subsidies , imposing or tightening price controls , restricting exports and cutting food import duties .
These temporary measures are already breaking down .
Across Southeast Asia , for example , families have been hoarding palm oil .
Smugglers have been bidding up prices as they move the oil from more subsidized markets , like Malaysia ’s , to less subsidized markets , like Singapore’s .
No category of food prices has risen as quickly this winter as so - called edible oils  with sometimes tragic results .
When a Carrefour store in Chongqing , China , announced a limited - time cooking oil promotion in November , a stampede of would - be buyers left 3 people dead and 31 injured .

Cooking oil may seem a trifling expense in the West .
But in the developing world , cooking oil is an important source of calories and represents one of the biggest cash outlays for poor families , which grow much of their own food but have to buy oil in which to cook it .
Few crops illustrate the emerging problems in the global food chain as well as palm oil , a vital commodity in much of the world and particularly Asia .
From jungles and street markets in Southeast Asia to food companies in the United States and biodiesel factories in Europe , soaring prices for the oil are drawing environmentalists , energy companies , consumers , indigenous peoples and governments into acrimonious disputes .

So here 's a fun little quiz for you !
The other night I was watching Larry King Live .
Why ?
I 'm not sure .
It probably had something to do with my testicle clamp being in the shop .
Anyway , in less than a minute worth of show , I found no fewer than 10 people or things that pissed me off .
I think that 's pretty incredible .
Here .
Why do n't you take a look at the clip and see if you can name them all before reading the answers below .
1 . Larry King .
I hate him .
I 've always hated him .
He simply does not listen to a word that comes out of his guests ' mouths .
That 's worse than being stupid or lazy .
It 's downright rude .
Oh , but he is stupid and lazy .
See number 8 below .
2 . " Is this the last year ofAmerican Idol ? "
Why are we discussing this on a news show ?
3 . Simon Cowell .
Colossal douchebag who is so easy to make fun of that I will refrain .
This was a gimme .
4 . Ryan Seacrest ( See 3 ) 5 . Randy Jackson ( See 3 ) 6 . Paula Abdul ( See 3 ) 7 . " Kidding ! "
Get it ?
He said the opposite of what he meant .
Is n't that the kind of joke 5 year olds tell ?
" The teacher said you were in trouble " " Really ? " " No. . . Kidding ! " 8 . Larry King is n't sure if Simon is joking .
Really ?
Really ?!
Where 's the confusion ?
Was it when he threw his hands up and shouted " kidding ! "
Seriously , what is wrong with you ?
9 . At least two more years of American Idol ?
Why ?
Why ?
No one has had a sustainable career coming off that show .
Let me rephrase that .
No man has had a sustainable career coming off that show .
It is not designed to create rock stars or even pop stars .
It is designed to pad the resumes of people destined to do local theater .
Clay Aiken is in Spamalot now .
Spamalot and he should count himself lucky that Eric Idle deigned to have him in his production .
In 5 years , it 's all about Carnival Cruises , opening up for Kathy Lee Gifford .
And do n't get me started on Daughtry .
Is that his name ?

This morning on CBS ' Sunday Morning Ben Stein gave his take on the Eliot Spitzer scandal and his thoughts may surprise you .
I 'm no fan of Stein , but I think he may have made some valid points .
As with many political scandals involving sex , it 's the naughtiness that gets the coverage and many important issues are often overlooked .
As Stein puts it , it sets a dangerous precedent when a handful of appointed officials brings down elected officials , seriously impacting the will of the voters .
" ... However , in Governor Spitzer 's case he got humiliated , disgraced and then the voters lost the guy they voted for .
It is deeply scary to me that a few employees of the federal executive branch can start a train rolling that has such immense effects on the electoral process .
Basically a few career civil servants have nullified the will of the voters of the Empire state , over something clearly wrong , I do n't doubt that , but it 's not a political crime , not treason , not terrorism ... "
What do you think ?
Does he have a valid point ?
Photos provide the real picture on Tibet violence
Since the protests began , the Chinese government has consistently denied the high death tolls in Tibet .
Exile groups claim as many as 100 people have died , many of them shot .
The Chinese government claims only 16 have died , and they have denied shooting anyone .
Claims from both sides are difficult to verify because reporters have been expelled from the area .
http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=4468783&page=1
But the real picture is just beginning to emerge .
These photos clearly show people have been shot and killed .
Bill Clinton directly accuses the Obama campaign of hostility to working class voters .
When you see the brutal politics the Clintons are still eagerly deploying , you have to believe this will go to the convention .
The Clintons are prepared to use any argument , any Republican tactic , and any social or cultural division to stay in the game .
By tactically morphing into Rove Republicans , they are deliberately pivoting off a myth about Obama to make him unelectable .
I think the idea that they will withdraw when Obama reaches the actual number of delegates required for the nomination is a myth .
They will insist on having their say at the convention and changing the votes of pledged delegates if they need to .
This is their party , in their minds .
Obama has no right to lead it .
Until he waits his turn and the Clintons give their blessing .
To stay in the game , the level and suicidal quality of their attacks on Obama require a similar form of tactic in response .
But Obama will not and should not go there .
The one profound difference between him and the Clintons is that he will actually not do some things for the sake of power .
God knows the Clontons have brought him to the verge of that - but pure cynicism would rebut his core message and destroy his candidacy as surely as the Clintons are trying to do .
And to say what needs to be said about the Clintons - the truth about their character and their shared pathologies - would be a horribly divisive and brutal move .
It would render the Clintons even more unelectable than they already are , undermine the Obama message and give the White House to the GOP .
What 's striking to me about this race is that it is the young insurgent who is still acting as the responsible party elder ; and the former president who is behaving like a man who will destroy his own party in order to soothe his own sense of entitlement and ego .
After this presidency , after eight years of war and debt and torture and deceit and cynicism , to see the Democratic party self - destruct is really something .
They were given a chance to remake the country and regain their soul ; and the Clintons could not bear it if they were not the vehicles for such a shift .
I do n't believe anyone in the Democratic party can or will stop them .
This is a kamikaze mission .

White House wo n't remove loophole allowing foreign contractors to ignore fraud John Byrne
Published : Thursday March 13 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The White House has indicated it will not remove a loophole quietly inserted into a budget rule which allows contractors abroad to keep silent if they observe fraud or abuse on US government contracts .
The proposed rule , put forth by the White House Office of Management and Budget last year , exempts all companies who do work overseas from a new regulation requiring US contractors to report waste , fraud or abuse they encounter while doing work for the government .
More than $ 100 billion in contracts have been awarded for work in Iraq and Afghanistan in the last five years .
" This sends the message that if you 're going to do waste , fraud and abuse , do n't do it at home , do it abroad , " Rep. Peter Welch ( D - VT ) told the Washington Post in Thursday 's papers .
" This was slipped in at the last minute .
. . .
It 's obviously something you can't justify in any way , and there 's no answer to why you 'd allow this to occur abroad any more than you 'd allow it to occur domestically .
There is a question as to how and why the change was made , and we do n't know the answer . "
Even the Bush Justice Department opposes the exemption , which was slipped into the proposed rule last November .
No one has come forward to admit the insertion .
" The exemption has riled the Justice Department , which opposes limiting the rule to domestic contracts , " the Post wrote .
" And the loophole has led members of Congress to call for an investigation amid concerns that someone inserted the exemption as a favor to the contracting lobby that has major interests because of the ongoing wars . "
In January , according to the Post , the Justice Department wrote the Office of Management and Budget requesting the exemption be struck .
The rule was added in the first place , they said , because of " worries about a drop in voluntary reporting of waste and fraud . "
Myriad cases of abuse have been linked to the wars , where policing is often slim , and the incentive to report even slimmer .
The rule has received support from US inspectors general .
Twenty - seven criminal investigations of fraud , waste and abuse took place under the Coalition Provisional Authority 's watch alone , according to a 2004 report .
The Authority failed to keep track of nearly $ 1 billion in money spent for reconstruction , the report said .
For example , the CPA paid almost $ 200,000 for police trucks without confirming they 'd actually received them .
Nor did they have records to " justify the $ 24.7 million price tag for replacing the Iraqi currency . "
“ For me , it is self - evident that the Muslims need to have a prestigious place of worship , ” said Mr. Schramma , who belongs to the center - right Christian Democratic Union .
“ But it bothers me when people have lived here for 35 years and they do n’t speak a single word of German . ”
Cologne ’s Roman Catholic leader , Cardinal Joachim Meisner , is similarly ambivalent .
Asked in a radio interview if he was afraid of the mosque , he said , “ I do n’t want to say I ’m afraid , but I have an uneasy feeling . ”
These statements rankle German - Turkish leaders , who have been working with the city since 2001 to build a mosque on the site of a converted drug factory , which now houses a far smaller mosque , a community center and the offices of the Turkish - Islamic Union for Religious Affairs .
“ The 120,000 Muslims of Cologne do n’t have a single place they can point to with pride as the symbol of our faith , ” said Bekir Alboga , leader of interreligious dialogue at the union , which is known as Ditib .
“ Christians have their churches , Jews have their synagogues . ”
Mr. Alboga , a 44 - year - old Turkish imam who immigrated here at 18 and speaks rapid - fire German , said the mosque would be a “ crowning moment for religious tolerance . ”
Given Germany ’s dark history , he added , “ German politicians need to be careful about what they say . ”
Mr. Alboga said he was particularly dismayed by Cardinal Meisner , because the Catholic Church , along with Germany ’s Protestant churches , has long supported the mosque .
Ditib , he said , is a moderate organization that acts as a “ bulwark against radicalism and terrorism . ”
It plans to finance the project , which will cost more than $ 20 million , entirely through donations .

The group must obtain a building permit before it can break ground , but Mr. Alboga said he was confident the mosque would not be blocked .
Ditib has agreed to various stipulations , including a ban on broadcasting the call to prayer over loudspeakers outside the building .
There used to be a time when baseball parks were built by private investors — usually a wealthy local family — and the stands were full of what used to be called the “ masses . ”
There used to be a time when libraries were maintained and stocked as an integral part of the neighborhood and community .
Not a single library closed in America due to the great economic depression of the nineteen thirties .
As illustrated so elaborately in Washington D.C. last week , the “ gleaming new baseball stadium ” temporarily named “ Nationals Park ” for the local major league baseball team , opened with $ 611 million dollars — mostly taxpayers money — going into its constructions .
A Washington
Post editorial crowed that the stadium was built “ on time and within budget . ”
Why not ?
The cost came in at twice the estimate five years ago and its frantic construction pace reflected the priorities of the nation ’s capital .
Consider one aspect of this “ tale of two cities ” — the depleted and disrepaired condition of the main Martin Luther King Library and its twenty six neighborhood branches .
The annual budget last year was only $ 33 million .
Four of the branches were shut down for remodeling or rebuilding three and a half years ago .
The money has been appropriated .
But with the sites being eyed by avaricious developers for “ multi-use ” complexes , among other reasons , the residents still do not have operating libraries .
“ On time and within budget ” is not even on the radar .
Now I ask you — what is the most appropriate , profound , and respectful use of tax dollars ?
A ballpark built for mega-millionaire owners who could have raised their own capital ?
Or “ gleaming new libraries ” which edify a metropolis and play a critical role in educational , civic and urban renewal ?
The question would answer itself were the decision made by local referendum .
Polls continually showed that the disenfranchised people of the District of Columbia opposed a taxpayer - funded professional ballpark .
The new mayor Adrian Fenty made this opposition a major issue in his improbable run for that office in 2006 .
There is little doubt that the people would have preferred to use that $ 611 million ( and other estimates are higher ) for library renovations and acquisitions as well as neighborhood recreational facilities for participatory sports by all ages .
Studies have shown that after school programs at libraries help children learn better and participatory sports — indoor and outdoor — keep physically exercised youngsters from getting into street trouble .
Nationals Park opened to great fanfare this past weekend , hailed by page after page of coverage in excruciating detail by the Washington Post .
Would that this major newspaper devote such attention to the details of 27 library buildings , many of them crumbling and dysfunctional , in its home town .
When Post opinion writer Marc Fisher did devote two columns to the library ’s plight in 2002 , it helped spark our D.C. Library Renaissance Project , headed by Robin Diener .
With library - minded citizens , this Project has brought more public attention , an increased budget and some improvement in the D.C. Library system , long considered to be in the bottom tier of library systems in major American cities .
When power is concentrated in the hands of the few , it ’s small wonder that priorities are inverted to the level of the grotesque .
Our national capital has been undergoing one of the biggest commercial building booms in its history .
Cranes are busy everywhere , except for building the schools , libraries , clinics and neighborhood parks .
Real estate developers and their customary allies — banks , mortgage firms , corporate law firms and trade associations — dominate .
Not the people , who cannot even have the right to vote for two Senators and a Representative having full voting power in the Congress .
In its March 28 , 2008 special , ten page section on Nationals Park , the Washington Post printed a full page “ Letter to Nats Fans ” by the team ’s owners , the Lerner family .
They profusely thanked the Mayor , the DC City Council , the corporate - welfare promoter called the DC Sports and Entertainment Commission , along with the construction firms , consultants , and workers .
Remarkably absent from their list of gratitude were the D.C. taxpayers who paid for the building that will make the Lerners and their partners even more wealthy .
( These owners are in arbitration over their demand that the taxpayers even pay for the uniforms of the multi- millionaire ball players ! )
The Lerners , in all decency , should name the stadium “ Taxpayers Stadium . ”
Instead , they are shopping around the corporate groves for a company to pay to put its name on the building instead of its present “ Nationals Park ” designation .
Once again the boosteristic Washington Post headlined “ Millions Ride on Nats ’ Naming Rights . ”
It is the Lerners who get the millions , but Mark Lerner shared a worry , during an interview with the Post reporter while looking around the Park .
“ It ’s going to be a huge and expensive task between the signs on the roadways , and all the signs in here — all these neon signs .
It ’s going to cost a fortune — when the time comes , ” he declared .
D.C. taxpayers are left to wonder who will pay for replacing these Nationals Park signs ?
They better check the fine print .
The Supreme Court of Appeal in Rome on Wednesday overturned a rape conviction , saying that the supposed victim must have agreed to sex because her jeans could not have been removed without her consent .
The instructor , aged 45 and identified only as Carmine , had been sentenced to 34 months ' jail .
His defence had argued that the young woman - identified as Rosa - had consented to sex , a version of events which the woman strongly denied .
The Supreme Court ruled that it was impossible to remove a pair of jeans " without the collaboration of the person wearing them " , and that the young woman must therefore have consented to sex .
In a judgement likely to anger women 's rights organisations , the rape conviction was reversed .
Driving instructors in Italy have a reputation , deserved or undeserved , for molesting young female pupils , and the case appeared at first to be a familiar story of sexual assault on a lonely country road .
1 Cave of Crystals ( Mexico ) : world ’s largest known natural crystals
Known as “ the Sistine Chapel of crystals , ” Mexico ’s Cueva de los Cristales ( Cave of Crystals ) contains some of the world ’s largest known natural crystals — translucent beams of gypsum as long as 36 feet ( 11 meters ) .
The cave is 950 feet ( 290 meters ) underground .
The Naica mining complex , which yields lead , zinc , copper , silver , and gold , zigzags nearly half a mile underground ( 760 meters ) .
Deep inside Naica mountain , the Cave of Crystals is a horseshoe - shaped cavity in limestone rock about 30 feet ( 10 meters ) wide and 90 feet ( 30 meters ) long .
Volcanic activity that began about 26 million years ago created Naica mountain and filled it with high - temperature anhydrite gypsum .
When magma underneath the mountain cooled and the temperature dropped , the anhydrite began to dissolve .
The anhydrite slowly enriched the waters with sulfate and calcium molecules , which for millions of years have been deposited in the caves in the form of huge selenite gypsum crystals .
2 Majlis al Jinn Cave ( Oman ) : world ’s second largest cave chamber
Majlis al Jinn is the second largest cave chamber in the world .
It is located in a remote area of the Selma Plateau at around 1600 meters altitude in The Sultanate of Oman .
It was discovered in 1983 by Don Davidson , a geologist studying water resources in the Sultanate .
Davidson presumably died some ten years later when he left Oman permanently and went hiking in the Andes .
He rented a car , drove it to a trailhead , left a note on it saying where he was going , and was never seen again .
Access is through a hole in the ground with a rope .
The inner height is between 120 and 150 metres .
The cave floor 300 by 200 metres .
To give an idea of scale , the Great pyramid of Giza of Egypt ( the largest Eygptian pyramid ) would almost exactly fit inside the cave chamber ; that is , its base is approximately the area of the chamber floor , and its height is also similar .
3 Waitomo Glowworm Cave ( New Zealand ) : a glowworms ’ paradise
The Waitomo Glowworm Cave is a cave on the North Island of New Zealand , known for its population of glowworms , Arachnocampa luminosa .
These glowworms spin a nest out of silk on the ceiling of the cave and then hang down .
Then , the larva glows to attract prey into its threads , so that the roof of a cave is covered with larva can look remarkably like the heavens at night .
A hungry larva glows brighter than one which has just eaten .
4 Eisriesenwelt Ice Caves ( Austria ) : largest Ice Caves known to man
A silicon strand is lowered from the ceiling , alongside hundreds of others .
Beautiful though these threads are , they have a sinister purpose .
To trap its prey it [ the cave glow worm ] goes fishing with a line of silk .
That ghostly blue light is the result of a chemical reaction taking place inside a special capsule in its tail …
Insects seem irresistibly drawn towards the source and then get trapped by the sticky lines .
Once stuck , there is no escape .
Now it ’s just a matter of reeling in the line and slowly consuming the catch – alive .
By ensnaring the insects that hatch in this cave , these glow worms have solved the biggest challenge that permanent cave dwellers face finding a regular and reliable source of food .
5 Cave of the Ghost ( Venezuela ) : so vast that two helicopters can comfortably fly into it
There are many ice caves throughout the world , but the Eisriesenwelt Ice Caves in Austria are some of the largest known to man .
They are located within the Tennengebirge Mountains near Salzburg and stretch for a remarkable 40 kilometers .
Only a portion of the labyrinth is open to tourists but it ’s enough to get a taste of what the remaining network is like : a truly mesmerizing palate of Mother Nature ’s handicraft .
Ice caves are very different from normal caves .
They have a strange feeling about them , as though they are not from this planet , and one has just temporarily stepped into their world when spelunking their depths .
“ Cueva del Fantasma ” — Spanish for “ Cave of the Ghost ” — is so vast that two helicopters can comfortably fly into it and land next to a towering waterfall .
A waterfall coming down one wall forms a small pond at the floor .
When it was recently discovered , researchers also discovered a new dendrobatid frog species , Colostethus breweri , named for the frog ’s identifier , Charles Brewer - Carías .
6 Fantastic Cave Pit ( USA ) : deepest known cave pit in the continental US
Fantastic
Pit is 586′ deep , which is the deepest known cave pit in the continental United States .
This pit is big enough to hold the Washington Monument ( 555 ′ ) .
It is a truly fantastic rappel , it takes almost 8 seconds for a rock to hit the bottom .
7 Dongzhong Cave ( China ) : a primary school
Not actually a fascinating cave in itself , until you consider dozens of children attend everyday to the school on it !
The Dongzhong ( literally meaning “ in cave ” ) is a primary school at a Miao village in Ziyun county , southwest China ’s Guizhou province .
The school is built in a huge , aircraft hangar - sized natural cave , carved out of a mountain over thousands of years by wind , water and seismic shifts .
Alpaca
The Alpaca is a domesticated species of South American camelid developed from the wild alpacas .
It resembles a sheep in appearance , but is larger and has a long erect neck as well as coming in many colors , whereas sheep are generally bred to be white and black .

Bald Uakari
The Bald Uakari , also known as the Red Uakari or Bald - headed Uakari , is a distinctive red-faced monkey found in swampy forests in Brazil , Peru , and Colombia .
The species is considered “ near threatened ” by the 2004 World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) Red List because of hunting and the destruction of its habitat .[ source ]
Babirusa
The Babirusa or pig-deer , Babyrousa babyrussa , is a pig - like animal native to Sulawesi and surrounding islands of Indonesia .
The babirusa has usually been classified as a single species in the genus Babyrousa , but recent work suggests that there may be several species , differentiable on the basis of geography , body size , amount of body hair , and the shape of the upper canine tooth of the male .
Most experts agree that babirusas are part of the pig family , and are one of the oldest living members of the family , representing a subfamily , Babyrousinae , that branched off from the warthog branch of the pig family ( Subfamily Phacochoerini ) during the Oligocene or early Miocene .

Binturong
The Binturong , also known as the Asian Bearcat , the Palawan Bearcat , or just simply the Bearcat , is neither a bear nor a cat but is a species of the family Viverridae , which includes the civets and genets .
The real meaning of the original name is lost , as the local language that gave it is extinct .
Its natural habitat is forest canopy , and it spends most of its time in the trees of southeast Asia , Borneo , Vietnam , Malaysia , Indonesia and Palawan Island . [ source ]
Hyraxes
A hyrax is any of four species of fairly small , thickset , herbivorous mammals in the order Hyracoidea .
They live in Africa and the Middle East .
Hyraxes are well - furred rotund creatures with a mere stump for a tail .
They are about the size of a Corgi ; most measure between about 30 and 70 cm long and weigh between 2 and 5 kg .
From a distance , a hyrax could be mistaken for a very well - fed rabbit or guinea pig . [ source ]
Naked Mole Rat
The Naked Mole Rat ( Heterocephalus glaber ) , also known as the Sand Puppy , or Desert Mole Rat , is a burrowing rodent native to parts of East Africa and the only species currently classified in genus Heterocephalus .
It is notable for its eusocial lifestyle , nearly unique among mammals , and for a highly unusual set of physical traits that enables it to thrive in a harsh , underground environment ; including a lack of pain sensation in its skin , and a nearly cold - blooded metabolism .

Single and cohabiting women are increasingly much more likely to commit suicide than married women , a Whitehall report showed yesterday .
It found that those who do not marry were killing themselves at three times the rate of wives .
This is a much higher rate than 25 years ago , when single women were twice as likely to commit suicide as those who were married .
The findings , in a study by the Government 's Office for National Statistics , suggest that cohabitation has made a high proportion of young women more vulnerable to depression .
They undermine Labour 's dogma that all family relationships are equally good .
The major difference in the lives of women since the early 1980s is the spread of unmarried cohabitation and the decline in marriage .
The ONS said that between the early 1980s and 2004 marriage rates halved , but the number of single women under 50 in live - in partnerships trebled .
In 2004 , more than a quarter of single women were cohabiting .
The study said that marriage has been seen as a protection against suicide since the Victorian era , when it was considered that being part of a couple improved the social integration of individuals .
It added that since a lot more unmarried people are now cohabiting , " we might expect relative differences in suicide rates between married and unmarried people to have become less clear cut over the last 25 years .
This has not occurred . "
Last night , independent researcher Patricia Morgan , author of the " Marriage Lite " study of the growth of cohabitation , said of the ONS report : " This is not a surprise , except to the Government .
" Cohabitation is a route to conflict , disappointment and unhappiness .
Women tend to think if they shack up with someone , that is commitment .
" Men tend to think that means they get sex and shopping , but they are still free to look elsewhere . "
Records show that overall numbers of suicides have gone down since the 1980s .
But they have fallen much less sharply among single women .
In 1983 , 18 in 100,000 single women committed suicide , and nine in 100,000 married women .
By 2004 , there were 15 suicides in 100,000 single women and five among married women .
Among men , the likelihood of suicide has remained the same - single males are around three times more likely to kill themselves than husbands .
The ONS report said that studies abroad had shown that the higher risk of suicide was a result of remaining unmarried and not of other factors .
Labour set out its view on cohabitation ten years ago , when a Green Paper on family policy said that all kinds of relationships were just as good .
Since then , ministers have stripped away tax breaks for marriage , abolishing the Married Couples Allowance and removing all reference to marriage from tax and benefit forms .
Those of you who are old enough may have noticed some worrisome similarities between the economy of the 1970s and the economy today .
If so , you 're not alone -- more than a few people are tossing the term " stagflation " around again .
There are differences , but most of the differences work against us , and the similarities -- including high oil prices -- are a little scary .
Economic policy makers today have one big advantage over those of the 1970s -- there is now a consensus about what causes inflation : growth in the money supply .
( There 's still some disagreement about what to call things , though , so let me define my terms : inflation is money becoming less valuable ; rising prices are a symptom of inflation . )
Inflation , recession , and stagflation
The link between the money supply and inflation was n't so clear back in the 1970s .
It was common in those days to hear the cause of inflation as " too much money chasing too few goods , " and to blame it on excessive government spending .
The argument was that , when the government ran a deficit , it was taking borrowed money and spending it in the marketplace , bidding up the prices of things that consumers wanted to buy .
Although it was n't really intended as an experiment , during the 1980s , the US economy ran huge deficits , and during that period , the inflation rate fell steadily , pretty much disproving the deficit / inflation link .
With that key insight , the cause of the stagflation of the 1970s is pretty clear -- the culprit was inflation .
Once you let inflation get above 3 % or 4 % , the only way to bring it back down again is to severely cut the growth in the money supply .
That inevitably leads to high interest rates , and almost always leads to a recession .
However , if you do n't bite the bullet and accept that recession , you still get the negative economic effects -- a little less severe , perhaps , but extending out indefinitely into the future .
A bit of history
All though the 1970s ( during the Nixon , Ford , and Carter administrations ) the Fed would lurch between " stimulating " the economy , trying to head off a recession , and then " restraining " the economy , trying to keep inflation from getting out of control .
But many policy makers thought that reducing government deficits was the real key .
That meant that , whatever will there was to reduce inflation , it was always split between people who wanted to restrain the money supply and those who wanted to cut the deficit .
Since neither idea was popular , neither one really got done .
Finally , in 1979 , with the inflation rate about to smash through 10 % and the value of the dollar plummeting against foreign currencies , Jimmy Carter replaced Fed chairman William Miller with Paul Volcker .
Under Volcker , the Fed cut the rate of growth of the money supply sharply enough to drive interest rates to highs never seen before or since .
( The 10 - year treasury note peaked at over 15 % in the early 1980s . )
At the same time that the Federal Reserve was driving interest rates to record highs , the government was also running record deficits .
Under president Ronald Reagan , Congress cut taxes without cutting government spending .
So , that was our experiment .
High interest rates , combined with high deficits , produced two recessions : a short one in the first half of 1980 , and then a longer one that started a year later and ran to the end of 1982 .
But that was the end of stagflation for a generation .
The current situation
So , you see that there are some frightening similarities between the current situation and that in the 1970s .
The inflation rate , although not yet approaching 10 % , is high and rising .
( And , significantly , the reported inflation rate obviously understates actual changes in the cost of living ) .
At the same time , the Federal Reserve , trying to head off a recession , is cutting interest rates , allowing the money supply to grow at rates that ensure still higher inflation rates in the future .
There is also some similarity with the deficit , although just now the situation is worse .
In 1979 we had just gone through three presidential terms during which government deficits were a constant issue -- meaning that the deficit had largely been kept under control , and the deficit had been falling since 1975 .
Deficits are much larger this time , meaning that policy makers will have less leeway to do what worked last time -- raise interest rates to high levels and then run a huge budget deficit to reduce the severity of the resulting recession .
A third similarity is high oil prices .
The shape of the spike in oil prices in the late 1970s is very similar to oil prices right now .
However , oil prices fell drastically in the early 1980s .
That , together with the cost savings from the beginnings of globalization , played a large part in bringing prices under control in the 1980s .
We do n't know if oil prices will come down this time , although in a severe recession they probably will come down some .
Very few people think they 'll come back down to the $ 10 a barrel prices that we saw in the mid-1980s .
The future
We know how to produce stagflation : lurch between raising interest rates to head off inflation and cutting interest rates when recession threatens .
That 'll get you there eventually .
Throw in high oil prices , and it gets you there right away .
Sadly , that seems to be the course we 're on .
We wo n't stay on it forever , though .
Now , unlike in the 1970s , we know what causes inflation , and we know how to stop it .
Sooner or later ( hopefully sooner ) , the Federal Reserve will bring the coming period of stagflation to an end .
Stagflation may be the hardest economic condition for ordinary people to deal with .
We know how to prepare for a recession and we know how to deal with inflation , but there just is n't much else that ordinary folks can do about stagflation except hunker down and wait for the recession that finally ends it .
Wise Bread , though , is n't a " hunker down " sort of place .

The M/S Explorer has been listing for hours
Enlarge Image
The M/S Explorer is now lying on its side close to the South Shetland Islands , in the Antarctic Ocean .
Gap Adventures , which owns the ship , said 91 passengers , nine guides and 54 crew members were safely evacuated to lifeboats and then to another ship .
After staying the night at a base on a Chilean island , they are expected to fly to Chile 's mainland on Saturday .
Gap Adventures said 23 Britons , 17 Dutch , 10 Australians , 13 Americans and 10 Canadians were among the 154 on board .
The remaining nationalities of the rescued tourists are Irish , Danish , Swiss , Belgian , Japanese , French , German and Chinese , said the Toronto - based tour company .
There was confusion earlier over crew and passenger numbers due to uncertainty at Gap Adventures .
Following the news of the incident , the specialist Lloyds List maritime publication said the 2,400 - tonne Explorer had five faults at its last inspection .
We were passing through ice as usual but this time something hit the hold and we got a little leakage downstairs

However , the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) , whose inspectors found the faults , said that they had all been rectified by the time the ship set sail again .
" These were not huge problems and were all rectified before the vessel sailed .
It would not have been allowed to depart if everything had not been sorted out , " MCA spokesman Mark Clarke told PA news .
All passengers and crew were transferred to a Norwegian cruise ship , the Nordnorge .
' In good spirits '
The passengers would be transferred to Chile before being flown home on Saturday , said Gap Adventures .
" They are all in good spirits , " company spokeswoman Marie Anne MacRae told the BBC News website .
Paola Palavecino , an ornithologist onboard the rescue ship , the Nordnorge , told the BBC that four of those rescued had suffered moderate hypothermia , but that they had later recovered , having eaten and been given additional warm clothes .
The group had embarked from Ushuaia , on Argentina 's southern tip , on 11 November for a 19 - day " Spirit of Shackleton " cruise through the Drake Passage .
The captain and the first officer abandoned the Liberian - registered Explorer after initially remaining on board to pump water .
First officer Peter Svensson told Reuters : " We were passing through ice as usual .
But this time something hit the hold and we got a little leakage downstairs .
" No one was hysterical , they were just sitting there nice and quiet , because we knew there were ships coming . "
' Deficiencies '
According to a report on Lloyds List 's website , the Explorer was found to have five " deficiencies " at an inspection in May at Greenock , Scotland , by the UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) .
Watertight doors were described as " not as required " , while lifeboat maintenance problems and missing search and rescue plans were also noted .
The hull has a hole the size of a fist and the outlook is not so positive for the ship at the moment
Susan Hayes , vice - president of marketing for Gap Adventures
Chilean port inspectors also found six deficiencies during an inspection in Puerto Natales in March , including two related to navigation matters , said Lloyds List .
Gap Adventures said the Explorer was passed as fit for sea by inspectors in October this year at a dry dock before their tourist season began .
The MCA said it became aware at 0524 GMT on Friday that the expedition ship was in distress near King George Island .
It ran into trouble approximately 120 km ( 75 miles ) north of the Antarctic Peninsula .
Susan Hayes , vice - president of marketing for Gap Adventures , said : " The hull has a hole the size of a fist and the outlook is not so positive for the ship at the moment . "
The company said the pumps had been used in an effort to stop the ship sinking .
But the vessel is now lying on one side , with its hull exposed .
The rescue operation was co-ordinated by the Ushuaia coastguard .
Prices for the 19 - day tour start from around $ 8,000 ( £ 3,900 ) per cabin .
Gap Adventures said that before Friday 's incident , the tour group had visited the Falkland Islands to spot black - browed albatrosses , before going to South Georgia to see Shackleton 's grave and the king penguin colonies .
Coastguards said the weather conditions were good for this time of year , though the average temperature is still - 5C .

Two years ago I fin­ished a book on the mind / brain , called The Three Pound Enig­ma : The Human Brain and the Quest to Unlock its Mys­ter­ies .
Each chap­ter pro­files a leader in a dif­fer­ent aspect of mind / brain research , from neu­ro­surgery to zen Bud­dhism , from cog­ni­tive neu­ro­science to phi­los­o­phy of mind .
One of my sub­jects was Dr. Robert Stick­gold , a zany , hyper - intel­li­gent men­sch of a Har­vard sleep researcher .
When I met him , I was in med­ical school and hav­ing a grand old time — I ’d exact­ed an exten­sion of my tenure beyond the cus­tom­ary four years , so I had enough time to write the book , do my course­work , and have a life .
I was busy , but still got enough sleep , had time to exer­cise dai­ly , and even went for din­ner and a movie some­times .
Although I found Stickgold ’s work inter­est­ing , there was a part of me that just did n’t get it .
Fast - for­ward to the present , when I am a res­i­dent in emer­gency med­i­cine at a busy inner-city trau­ma cen­ter ; I have two - year - old twins and a hus­band with a 60 - hour - a - week job of his own .
I do not exer­cise .
I do not eat unless I can do some­thing else pro­duc­tive at the same time , and even when I do get to sleep in my own bed , my slum­ber is frac­tured by the awak­en­ings of two cir­ca­di­an­ly dis­parate tod­dlers .
It seems to take me twice as long to “ get ” new con­cepts as it used to , and I nev­er feel like I ’m func­tion­ing at top speed .
In short , I am a mess .
And NOW I get what Stickgold ’s work is all about , and under­stand that he is both quan­ti­fy­ing and explain­ing exact­ly what I ’m feel­ing .
Sleep is so obvi­ous a phys­i­o­log­ic need ( from insects to mam­mals , all ani­mals sleep ) that it does n’t even occur to most of us to won­der why we have to do it — why in the world would we need to lie down , par­a­lyzed , for a third of our lives , with our brains in some sort of auto - pilot chaos ?
What do we get out of the process ?
It is aston­ish­ing how sparse is science ’s answer to that ques­tion , but Stick­gold and oth­ers are begin­ning to pro­vide a solu­tion , and their answer ought to make any of us who are inter­est­ed in men­tal fit­ness sit up ( or rather , lie down ) and take notice .
When I met him , Stick­gold was just hit­ting his stride in what would turn out to be his spe­cial­ized area of research — the con­nec­tion between sleep and cog­ni­tion , and in par­tic­u­lar , between sleep and mem­o­ry .
I had become inter­est­ed in his work part­ly because he was using non-tra­di­tion­al research tools : while many neu­ro­science exper­i­ments involve set­ting their sub­jects tedious made - up tasks , Stick­gold had heed­ed the sug­ges­tion of one of his under­grad­u­ate research assis­tants and was using video - games as his men­tal chal­lenges .
Using the com­put­er - game Tetris he ’d found what many of us knew anec­do­tal­ly : that just as they fall asleep after long Tetris prac­tice ses­sions , play­ers hal­lu­ci­nate images of the pecu­liar­ly - shaped Tetris tiles drift­ing down their fields of vision .
It turns out , Stick­gold found , that even sub­jects with severe amne­sia , who could n’t recall hav­ing played the game at all , had the same expe­ri­ence .
He hypoth­e­sized that those images must have some­thing to do with a par­tic­u­lar kind of skill mem­o­ry , known as pro­ce­dur­al mem­o­ry — the type of phys­i­cal mem­o­ry cre­at­ed when you prac­tice the vio­lin , or learn to play ten­nis , or write cal­lig­ra­phy .
This type of mem­o­ry is often pre­served even in peo­ple with severe amne­sia .
It seems like­ly that sleep is serv­ing to some­how orga­nize this type of mem­o­ry .
And it turns out that with­out any fur­ther prac­tice , the sub­jects showed improve­ment in their Tetris scores after they ’d “ slept on ” their new­found skill .
In a more tra­di­tion­al exper­i­ment , Stick­gold has shown that after a snooze , peo­ple per­formed much bet­ter on a recent­ly - learned fin­ger - tap­ping task than after the same amount of time with­out sleep .
Even dou­bling the amount of time spent learn­ing the task had an insignif­i­cant per­for­mance ben­e­fit com­pared to sim­ply get­ting a night ’s sleep between ses­sions .
He lat­er showed that you do n’t even need a whole night ’s sleep but that an hour ’s nap can give you the same learn­ing ben­e­fits ( thank Heav­ens , I say , from my new van­tage - point as a sleep - scav­enger ) .
Stick­gold also showed that sub­jects who were n’t allowed to sleep soon after learn­ing a new skill nev­er regained the lost ben­e­fit , and — unless giv­en more practice / sleep cycles — never got quite as good at the skill as those who ’d been allowed to sleep soon after their train­ing ses­sions .
More recent­ly , Stickgold ’s lab has shown that sleep makes a stun­ning dif­fer­ence in the abil­i­ty of a par­tic­u­lar kind of mem­o­ry known as “ declar­a­tive ” mem­o­ry to with­stand inter­fer­ence .
Declar­a­tive mem­o­ry has to do with facts : what you ate for break­fast today , where you last put your keys , what you read in this morning ’s paper — all of these are declar­a­tive mem­o­ries .
In an ele­gant exper­i­ment , Stick­gold taught a group of peo­ple a list of word - pairs .
Then one half the group was sent off to bed , while the oth­er half was asked to remain awake .
At the end of the wait­ing peri­od , half the sleep­ers and half the awake sub­jects were taught anoth­er set of “ inter­fer­ence ” words , pairs designed to con­fuse the mem­o­ry of the orig­i­nal pair­ings .
Imme­di­ate­ly after­ward , all sub­jects were test­ed on the ini­tial word - pairs .
The group that had received the inter­fer­ence teach­ing but slept before­hand aver­aged about 76 % on the test .
The group that received the inter­fer­ence train­ing but had remained awake between the two ses­sions aver­aged about 32 % .
Appar­ent­ly , just sleep­ing on the new infor­ma­tion had some­how cement­ed it into sub­jects ’ minds so that it was resis­tant to inter­fer­ence .
To those of us who are des­per­ate to retain — accurately — the new infor­ma­tion with which we are bom­bard­ed each day , such research is eye - open­ing , and poten­tial­ly life - chang­ing .
Stick­gold is not the only sci­en­tist study­ing human sleep , of course — there are oth­ers work­ing on sleep and cog­ni­tion ( most with results sim­i­lar to Stickgold ’s ) , and more researchers pro­vid­ing con­vinc­ing evi­dence that sleep boosts your immune sys­tem , improves your mood , and — oh yeah — helps you stay awake when you want to be .
There is also evi­dence that get­ting poor or insuf­fi­cient sleep rais­es your risk of obe­si­ty , heart dis­ease and dia­betes ; increas­es your blood pres­sure ; and makes you acci­dent - prone : all great rea­sons to get a good night ’s sleep ( which , accord­ing to sci­en­tists , is 8 – 9 hours of unin­ter­rupt­ed slum­ber ) .
Yet , like many Amer­i­cans , I am more moti­vat­ed by the stud­ies show­ing sleep ’s cog­ni­tive ben­e­fits .
I had been going to go hit the books when I fin­ished this piece — now I think I ’ll just hit the hay .
Maybe you should , too .

Her book on the brain ( and eight dynam­ic brain - mavens , includ­ing Robert Stick­gold ) is The Three Pound Enig­ma : The Human Brain and the Quest to Unlock its Mys­ter­ies .
Mof­fett recent­ly appeared on The Brain Fit­ness Pro­gram , which aired nation­wide on PBS .
The American West is heating up more rapidly than the rest of the world , according to a new analysis of the most recent federal government temperature figures .
The news is especially bad for some of the nation ’s fastest growing cities , which receive water from the drought - stricken Colorado River .
The average temperature rise in the Southwest ’s largest river basin was more than double the average global increase , likely spelling even more parched conditions .
“ Global warming is hitting the West hard , ” said Theo Spencer of the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) .
“ It is already taking an economic toll on the region ’s tourism , recreation , skiing , hunting and fishing activities .
The speed of warming and mounting economic damage make clear the urgent need to limit global warming pollution . ”
For the report , the Rocky Mountain Climate Organization ( RMCO ) analyzed new temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) for 11 western states .
For the five - year period 2003 - 2007 the average temperature in the Colorado River Basin , which stretches from Wyoming to Mexico , was 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the historical average for the 20th Century .
The temperature rise was more than twice the global average increase of 1.0 degree during the same period .
The average temperature increased 1.7 degrees in the entire 11 - state western region .
“ We are seeing signs of the economic impacts throughout the West , ” said study author Stephen Saunders of the Rocky Mountain Climate Organization .
“ Since 2000 we have seen $ 2.7 billion in crop loss claims due to drought .
Global warming is harming valuable commercial salmon fisheries , reducing hunting activity and revenues , and threatening shorter and less profitable seasons for ski resorts . ”
The Colorado River Basin is in the throes of a record drought , shrinking water supplies for upwards of 30 million people in fast - growing Denver , Albuquerque , Las Vegas , Phoenix , Los Angeles and San Diego .
Most of the Colorado River ’s flow comes from melting snow in the mountains of Wyoming , Utah and Wyoming .
Climate scientists predict even more and drier droughts in the future as hotter temperatures reduce the snowpack and increase evaporation .
To date , the governors of Arizona , California , Montana , New Mexico , Oregon , Utah and Washington have signed the Western Climate Initiative ( WCI ) , an agreement to reduce global warming pollution through a market - based system , such as cap - and - trade .
The WCI calls for states to reduce their global warming emissions 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 .
Conservationists say the states should commit to meeting these targets , and that there should also be a firm target of an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
A growing chorus of leaders across the political and economic spectrum says more aggressive action is needed at the national level .
Supporters say the Lieberman - Warner bill , “ America ’s Climate Security Act ” ( S. 2191 ) , is the strongest global warming bill moving through Congress .
The bipartisan bill is the first climate legislation ever to be passed out of a Senate committee .
The full Senate is expected to vote on the bill by summer , by which time supporters are optimistic about strengthening the bill even further .
“ We need strong leadership from western senators to pass America ’s Climate Security Act , ” said Spencer .
“ The longer we wait to put a concrete cap on global warming pollution , the greater the threat to all Americans . ”
The NRDC - RMCO report , “ Warming in the West , ” analyzed temperature data from Arizona , California , Colorado , Idaho , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Utah , Washington and Wyoming .
The report is available online at http://www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/west/contents.asp.
WASHINGTON  The Federal Aviation Administration proposed a record penalty of $ 10.2 million against Southwest Airlines on Thursday , saying the carrier had continued to fly 46 Boeing 737s that it said it had grounded because they had not been properly inspected for fuselage cracks .
At least one F.A.A. employee was aware of the airline ’s misrepresentation , and told the airline it could keep flying the planes but that it should inspect them as soon as possible , an agency spokeswoman said .
A supervisor at the F.A.A. who was aware of the arrangement has been removed from that job , said the spokeswoman , Diane Spitalieri .
The inspector general of the Transportation Department is investigating the F.A.A. ’s handling of the incident , which occurred over several days last March , at the request of the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee .
Four of the planes had four - inch - long cracks , requiring repairs , said Ms. Spitalieri , although no deaths or injuries resulted .

“ For fast - acting relief , try slowing down . ” – Lily Tomlin
By Leo Babauta
Last week when I wrote about things to do at work when you ’re bored out of your skull , a number of readers wrote about having the opposite problem : they ’re too busy to be bored .
Some of them seemed a bit overwhelmed by their workdays , and so I decided to share ways to create a more peaceful workday .
One where you can allow yourself to be more relaxed and happier .
The first step is the realization that you are in control of your day .
You can create the perfect workday , if you ’re willing to start from scratch .
For some people , that may mean taking some tough steps , if their boss or their workplace is very controlling about how they do their work .
For example , you might talk to your boss about restructuring your workday .
It might also mean looking for a new job that ’s more flexible , if you ’re not happy with the way things are .
Or it might just mean picking the tips below that work best for you and living with a certain amount of stress .
Do what works for you !
For me , a perfect workday incorporates many of the tips below , but never all of them at once .
I use a combination of strategies to ensure that most of my days are fairly relaxed .
Do I still get stressed ?
Undoubtedly .
But it ’s a far less frequent thing than in the past .
Here ’s how I do it .
Do less .
Those of you who know me by now saw this one coming .
It ’s very difficult to have a relaxed workday if you have too much going on .
Instead , learn to reduce what you do , but choose the most impactful tasks and projects — the ones that will mean the most over the long term .
I choose three important things to achieve each day , as I ’ve said before .
Those are the three things I can do today that will have the most impact in my life .
Create a morning routine .
And make it a relaxing one .
That could include some of the things below , such as exercise , a hot bath , or quiet working time .
For me , it means getting up earlier so I ’m not so rushed , and then doing little rituals ( like having a quiet cup of coffee and reading ) that will ensure I start the day perfectly .
Prepare the night before .
An evening routine is also essential to starting your day right .
This might include things like choosing your three Most Important Tasks for the next day , so you know what you ’re going to do when you wake up .
It might mean getting your clothes ready .
For me , it includes getting a jump start on prepping my kids ’ lunches , so it ’s just about done before my day even starts .
Start the day with a relaxing shower or bath .
I like a hot shower , but if you have time , a good bath can be a perfect way to start off the day .
It gets you in a relaxed mood , which is much better than starting the day stressed out .
Get in some morning exercise .
I do n’t get to exercise every single morning , but I do it on a majority of mornings .
A nice morning run is a wonderful thing for me .
It relaxes me , and gives me a sense of well being and accomplishment .
Work when it ’s quiet .
I like to do work early in the morning , when everyone is sleeping .
For others , that might be late at night instead .
Whatever works best for you .
When I was working in an office , I liked to get in before everyone else , so that I could get in some solid work before things got busy .
I would also work during lunch while everyone else was out — I just liked the quiet .
I would eat two smaller lunches before and after the normal lunch hour .
Getting in early also allowed me to leave early , so that I could spend time with my kids or get in some evening exercise .
Create a clutter - free environment .
This is key for me , as you might also know by now .
I like my desk clear of any clutter .
Right now , the only thing on my desk is my iMac ( I ’m paperless now ) .
But it ’s OK to have a couple family pictures or an inbox , but too much stuff it just visual distraction .
Clear your walls of everything but a nice picture or other art piece or two .
Clutter - free surroundings create a peaceful working environment .
Turn off the distractions .
That means phones , email notification , instant messaging , anything that will break into your focus and make you jump from one thing to another .
Cut back on your commitments .
Evaluate all the things you ’ve got going on in your life , and see what is n’t essential .
This means choosing 4 - 5 essential things in your life , and trying to eliminate the rest over time .
Cut out meetings .
If you have the ability to opt out of meetings , do so .
They are generally a waste of time .
Sure , it ’s possible that a meeting is the most productive way to do something , but it ’s rarely done .
Usually the point of a meeting could be accomplished with email , or an IM .
Cutting out meetings could free up a lot of time and make your workday more relaxed .
Single - task .
For me , focus is everything .
Writing this article would take twice as long , and be much less peaceful , if I was constantly interrupted , if I was constantly switching between this and email and surfing the web and other tasks I have to do .
I like to focus on one task at a time , if possible , and really lose myself in the writing .
Take breaks and stretch .
While focusing on one task at a time is important , it ’s also important to take breaks when you can .
Get up , stretch , get a glass of water .
Massage your shoulders , neck and head .
It keeps you relaxed throughout the day .
Go for a walk .
I also like to take a break and go for a walk .
It helps me get perspective , to think , to get a better overall picture on my workday and my life .
Plus it gets the blood circulating .
Eat lunch in quiet .
I ’m kind of a shy guy , and while many people do lunch meetings , I would rather eat at my desk with a good book or take my sack lunch to a park for a peaceful , meditative eating break .
Do mini-meditations .
This does n’t require a mat or a temple or soothing tapes or anything .
Just sit where you are , close your eyes , and focus on your breathing — on your breath as it comes into your body , and then goes out .
This helps me to center myself , no matter what is going on with work .
Learn to focus on the present .
Related to the mini-meditations and single - tasking .
Basically , instead of worrying about what you have to do in the future , and instead of reliving things you did in the past , focus on what you ’re doing right now .
This can be difficult , as our minds have a tendency to wander to other things , but it ’s simply a matter of practice – be aware of where your mind is , and when it drifts to other things , gently bring it back to the present .
This helps keep your mind in a peaceful place all day long .
Roll with the punches .
There will always be things that go wrong .
What is important is how we react to them — do we go all Drama Queen , and get stressed and upset ?
Or do we accept what has happened , and make a calm decision about what to do now ?
When things get overwhelming , take a step back to get some perspective , and realize that in a few months , none of this will really matter much — and then take steps to eliminate the non-essential and focus on what ’s really important .

The 68 city - funded cameras perched above San Francisco 's toughest street corners have been under fire in recent months for failing to provide evidence leading to arrests , and one of the reasons may be simple :
Choppy video .
Run on a modest budget , Mayor Gavin Newsom 's surveillance camera program has produced footage that is disjointed and less clear than the nearly seamless and sharp quality of video that the devices are capable of delivering , a Chronicle review found .
The difference can be dramatic , leaving police with less potential evidence .
A review of videos taken last year by four cameras at 16th and Mission streets found a striking problem with the cameras ' frame rate , or the number of images produced per second .
Prosecutors and defense attorneys viewed the Mission District footage , taken between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. Aug. 6 , in connection with a robbery case .
What they saw looked less like a streaming video than a series of still pictures taken several seconds apart .
In Chicago , where Newsom sampled anti-crime cameras before starting his program , police get motion - picture - quality footage shot at 30 frames per second .
But in the San Francisco footage , as many as 10 seconds pass between frames .
Some cars and bicycles going through the intersection show up on just a single frame .
" If this is a representation of the system , we 're throwing money away , " said Theresa Sparks , president of the San Francisco Police Commission , after being shown the footage .
The commission regulates use of the cameras .
The problem is only the latest for the 2 1/2 - year - old surveillance program , which has contributed to just one arrest in a city where the homicide total in 2007 hit a 12 - year high .
That lone arrest was more than 19 months ago .
San Francisco officials are also hampering the crime - fighting potential of their program by precluding police from watching video in real time , a nod to privacy concerns .
Police are not allowed to maneuver the cameras for a better shot .
In addition , a promised study of the cameras ' efficacy has repeatedly been delayed .
Under an ordinance that the Board of Supervisors approved in June 2006 , police were supposed to have provided data on the cameras ' performance to the board and the Police Commission by Jan. 17 .
City Administrator Ed Lee was given responsibility for a broader report that would include the data .
He has been negotiating for nine months with a team of University of California researchers who want to study the cameras , but officials have not worked out a deal .
Lee did not respond to several interview requests .
Newsom 's office said the report will be ready in early March , though it 's unclear who will write it .
" No study has started yet , " said Travis Richardson , the development manager for the UC group , the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society .
Newsom spokesman Nathan Ballard said the mayor planned to review the report on the cameras , which is expected to deal with the quality of the images , among many other aspects of the program .
" If there are problems that can be remedied with further investment , we 're open to that possibility , " Ballard said .
Newsom said in September , in an opinion piece published in the San Francisco Examiner , that the city had spent $ 500,000 on the cameras since 2005 .
But his office gave a much higher cost estimate earlier this month .
The true cost of the cameras has amounted to $ 900,000 , Newsom aides said , and the city has budgeted an additional $ 200,000 for 25 more cameras that the mayor intends to ask the Police Commission to approve .
After being shown the footage from the Mission District intersection , Ballard said , " ' Citizen Kane ' it 's not , " a reference to the revered 1941 film by Orson Welles .
But Ballard also said , " We believe these cameras have a deterrent effect on crime .
The neighbors appreciate them . "
Officials with the city 's Department of Telecommunications and Information Services , which operates the cameras , said the ones in the Mission intersection are not representative of the program as a whole .
They said that the Mission cameras were hamstrung for more than six months by a poor wireless connection , and that the connection was only recently upgraded .
But they acknowledged that most of the city 's cameras achieve only 80 percent of the resolution they are capable of , and that they generate , at best , two to four frames per second because the city lacks the data storage space to accommodate more footage .
Motion pictures and television programs are shown with a frame rate of at least 24 frames per second .
Las Vegas casinos are required by regulators to film many gaming areas at 30 frames per second .
That is also the rate generated by more than 550 cameras installed and maintained by the city of Chicago , which has spent millions on the nation 's most robust government surveillance of streets and other public places .
Anti-crime cameras in the Contra Costa County city of Pittsburg are typically set at eight to 10 frames per second , officials there said .
A BART spokeswoman said her agency 's cameras capture from two to 15 frames per second .
The cameras in the Mission , made by IQinVision of San Clemente ( Orange County ) , provide optimal footage at 12 frames per second , said Peter DeAngelis , the company 's president .
Officials with San Francisco 's telecommunications office said they were doing their best with limited funds .
They said they needed hundreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of additional data storage space for the footage , which is kept for a week before being erased .
The officials also said they were nearly $ 200,000 short on cash needed for camera maintenance and would have to tap into their own budget to cover the costs .
" Given the resources we have , I think we 've done a remarkable job putting in a system that 's useful , " said the agency 's chief operations officer , Richard Robinson .
Even at their best , surveillance cameras have delivered mixed results in studies of their effectiveness at decreasing violent crime .
Under city law , surveillance footage is stored by the city 's Department of Emergency Management and may be turned over only to police .
The Chronicle obtained the footage from the Mission intersection from the public defender 's office , which got it from police while seeking to establish an alibi for two suspects in a robbery case .
The Mission cameras failed to produce even a single frame per second , on average , based on a review of four hours of footage .
And there was little consistency to the cameras ' frame rate .
There were gaps of less than a second and gaps of several seconds .
Over an hour , the most active camera at the intersection delivered one frame every 1.7 seconds , while the least active delivered one frame every 2.9 seconds .
The footage does not show the actual robbery , which occurred two blocks away .
Prosecutors dropped charges against the two suspects but said the decision had nothing to do with the footage .
Sparks and Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi , who chairs the board 's Public Safety Committee and drafted the ordinance regulating the cameras , both viewed the footage and said the resolution appeared to be sharp enough to make the cameras effective .
But of the frame rate , Mirkarimi said , " If you 're going to go through the trouble of installing cameras , at least have the best technology to work with , or let 's reroute our dollars . "
Newsom , inspired by Chicago 's efforts , began his surveillance program in mid-2005 in an attempt to cool violent crime in neighborhoods , including the Western Addition and Bayview - Hunters Point .
City records show that police asked to see footage last year about once a week .
Chicago and Pittsburg police watch footage almost constantly .
Ballard said Newsom 's request for 25 additional cameras would not go to the Police Commission until the report on the cameras ' performance is completed .
But the mayor faces an increasingly skeptical commission , whose members have the authority to approve - or remove - cameras .

“ All your groceries are belong to us . ”
According to a ComputerWorld article , the Hannaford Breach was not just a single keylogger installed at a critical point in the enterprise .
Malware was installed on each and every server that handled the credit card processing at their stores in New England , Florida and New York .
That ’s a lot of breaches .
From CW here :
Hannaford Bros. Co. disclosed this week that the intruders who stole up to 4.2 million credit and debit card numbers from the grocer ’s systems did so by planting malware programs on servers at each of its stores in New England , New York and Florida .
The malicious software was used to intercept the payment card data as the information was being transmitted from Hannaford ’s point - of - sale systems to authorize transactions .
The malware then forwarded the stolen card numbers as well as their expiration dates to an overseas destination .
The discovery of the mass malware installation prompted a wholesale replacement of Hannaford ’s store servers .
In addition to disclosing that the malware had been installed on all of Hannaford ’s store servers it was designed to intercept the so - called Track 2 data that is stored in the magnetic stripe on the back of payment cards .
The malware then batched the card numbers and expiration dates and “ periodically transmitted the data to an offshore ISP .
The article goes on to note that Hannaford is still not sure how someone broke into the system , and laughably , they even think maybe an insider was to blame .
But a network so poorly protected to allow hundreds of servers to be breached without notice and to allow data to be exfiltrated for months points more readily to poor design , poor management , and poor security .
The most likely scenario was a simple breach of a workstation by a trojan horse program installed by an unwitting employee .
The operator of the trojan then simply scanned the internal network and realized that there were no safeguards in place and proceeded to backdoor each server .
At least Hannaford is proceeding with recovery in accordance with best practices .
They are replacing the breached servers with new fully patched systems to avoid any lingering malware that may reside on a system that was simply “ cleaned . ”
The old hard drives are likely in the hands of the FBI and Secret Service for forensic analysis .

This is not an " update query " it is a select query .
What do you want to simplify ?

It appears to be for a Dairy or Bakery The following is simplified by separating into SQL Server views .
Based on your SQL , I made assumptions for the following tables :

PS : None of the queries beginning with " qryMIS_ACDM_ " appear to be used in the final calculations .
That means about half of the original SQL ( everything after the three blank lines ) could probably be removed and it would still run the same . [/ code ] mysterystar

Yeah
I never understood why I made 50 k as a database anaylst and later more as an administrator playing with select , update , insert , and delete .
This reminds me that the work is stressful and usually actually done by consultants .
I do n't know if the helpful or humorous either after 12 years in the database industry , I have spent 5 mentally disabled .
btw , if you do use an update query always update the base tables and not your new views and once you have views you can grant security better too !
meanwhile i am going to trust my social security check.
cuz yeah you might get fired if you dont get that done unless of courseyou take over securityharrybowyer@aol.com bbinsj

1 Post Posted - 2008-03-19 : 13:38:05 willpost - I 'm extremely impressed with your response .
I hope you are checking the message boards and will respond the next time I have a problem with SQL code !
ismailc - have you thought about creating a stored procedure and calling functions and views ( which willpost helpfully defined ) ?
I can see a few areas , such as the coalesce statements that might work well in a function - mostly from a readability standpoint .
Have n't we seen this movie before ?
Barack Obama has just proved his chasm - wide appeal again by conquering another Republican - red state – Mississippi – yet the battle for the Democratic nomination is set to stretch out on to the far horizon .
As the comedian Bill Maher says , in a reference to John McCain 's age , " It 's a bad sign when the Democratic campaign is set to last longer than the Republican nominee . "
But the looming ending to this story feels flatly familiar – like a slo - mo remake of Florida in the year 2000 .
It is clear the Clintons are determined to get this nomination , any way , any how .
If they have to do it by falsely claiming to have won states like Florida and Michigan – where Obama 's name was n't even on the ballot , because there was an agreement by all the candidates to punish the states for holding early primaries – then they will .
If they have to do it by overturning the will of the Democratic electorate by appealing to the unelected super - delegates – a group of party functionaries who seem likely to hold the balance – then they will .
If they have to do it by pandering to racist sentiments – dismissing Obama as akin to the black firebrand Jesse Jackson , or by leaking images of Obama in African tribal dress – then they will do it .
Some American liberals have been suddenly , violently disillusioned by the Clintons ' tactics over the past few months .
But in reality , for people who could see beyond political tribalism , the nature of the Clintons has been plain for a long time .

The idea that Clinton was " the first black President " was always implicitly racist : so screwing around , riffing well in speeches and liking fried chicken makes you black now ?
In fact , Bill Clinton was prepared to lash black people whenever it was politically convenient , with the quiescence of Hillary .
Just after receiving the Democratic nomination for President , Governor Clinton returned to Arkansas to authorise the execution of a black man , Ricky Ray Rector , who was so profoundly mentally disabled that he told the guards to keep his last meal so he could have it tomorrow .
Attacking blacks when an election neared became a habit : in 1996 , Clinton signed a package of welfare reform that effectively abolished benefits for poor women after a two - year time - limit .
They are disproportionately black – and as a recession hits now , they will suffer severely .
Of course you have to make compromises to achieve power .
But at some point , on some issues , you have to say – no , I can't .
I can't execute this mentally disabled black guy .
I can't plunge millions of kids into poverty .
I can't still insist I was right to back the war in Iraq , when it has killed more than 650,000 Iraqis .
The Clintons do n't have that gagging reflex .
Instead , they chose to turn themselves into weathervanes , pointing whichever way the winds of mega - power blow them .
This meant that on all the great issues of their time – global warming , spiralling inequality , the foolish " war on drugs " – the Clintons fed and fuelled the right .
Hillary is following this approach to the letter .
While promising in public to " take on the oil companies , the pharmaceutical companies " , she is in fact shovelling more of their cash into her campaign than any other candidate , Democrat or Republican .
Fortune magazine recently ran an adoring cover story calling her " the candidate of business " .
Why did it take us so long to see them for what they are ?
Partly , it is because the Clintons were blessed with a parade of even greater grotesques as enemies .
The right could n't attack the Clintons on their genuine scandalous behaviour , because they supported it all : the executions , the abolition of benefits , the crackdowns .
So they contrived nonsense scandals , like Whitewater and Monicagate .
Today , many of them are serving up stale sexism against Hillary : right - wing host Tucker Carlson has announced , " There 's something about her that feels castrating , overbearing and scary . "
And partly , it is because the nightmare of the Bush years has made even the Clinton years seem like a halcyon heyday .
Think about the symbolism for the watching world if the Clintons manage to snatch this nomination .
The people in a majority of states in America will have shown they are ready to embrace a black man as President – only for some white guys in suits to hand it to the wife of the ex-President .
Their arguments in their own defence will seem feeble .
The idea that Hillary is more " experienced " seems to me both anti-feminist and untrue .
How does being married to a man make you " experienced " in his job ?
As the stand - up comedian Chris Rock said in a recent gig , " I do n't get it .
I 've been married for 10 years – but if my wife came out here on stage now , you would n't laugh . "
I am not starry - eyed about Barack Obama .
He would n't have been my choice for nominee – I was a John Edwards man – and he has made plenty of ugly compromises himself .
To give just one example : in 2005 , he voted for the Class Action Fairness Act , which stripped away the ability of ordinary citizens to seek compensation from huge corporations .
There was only one group who wanted this : the CEOs of the very Wall Street mega - firms that Obama takes millions from in practice today .
But there is considerable evidence that President Obama would be more susceptible to pressure from progressives than Hillary .
To pluck one policy area : Bill Clinton increased jail terms for drug possession , creating a situation where one in nine black men between the age of 20 and 35 is now in prison at any given time .
Obama , by contrast , was arguing for the full decriminalisation of marijuana as recently as 2004 , and has refused to indulge in this deranged tough - on - crime escalation .
If the Clintons prevail , there will be a worse effect still : the US will be much more likely to have another Republican President .
Most major polls show Obama is more likely to beat John McCain .
The Republicans are desperate for a Hillary candidacy , knowing it is the one thing that can unite their base behind McCain .
The far - right radio hosts Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham have begged their listeners to go out and vote for her in the Democratic primaries ; the National Review ran a front - page pleading , " Please vote for this woman " .
Hillary would be unable to make an election issue out of McCain 's greatest weakness – his support for the invasion of Iraq – because she ( like me ) made the same dumb mistake .
She would have to fall back on reinforcing right - wing ideas by bragging about her " toughness " .
The enthusiasm Obama has stirred among first - time voters would leech away .
With their latest lunge at power , the Clintons have shown us how they should be remembered when the end credits roll – as a greasy stain on the bright blue dress of the Democratic Party .

Neighbours complained about the smell from the flat
The remains of Denis Pring were discovered on a sofa in the lounge after neighbours reported a foul smell .
Mr Pring , who would have been 73 , was a lodger at the flat in Bedminster .
It is thought the flat 's tenant failed to report the death because he suffers from mental health problems .
An inquest has been opened and adjourned .
The tenant , named locally as Alan Derrick , and also in his 70s , was initially arrested in connection with the discovery , but was later bailed .
Police are no longer treating the death as suspicious .
Bristol City Council has launched an internal inquiry to establish how the corpse went unnoticed for so long .
A spokesman said : " We were alerted to the body after we received reports of a smell .
" We are shocked and concerned by this discovery and are carrying out an urgent internal review of the circumstances of the tenant .
" A police investigation is ongoing , and it would be inappropriate to comment further while this is taking place . "
The Validity of Belief in a Personal God C. D. Broad
In order to discuss the question whether there is any ground for believing in the existence of a personal God it is necessary to begin by defining our terms .
For the word ' personal ' and the word ' God ' are both highly ambiguous .
I will begin with the word ' personal ' .
The natural interpretation of the phrase ' a personal God ' would be ' a God who is a person ' .
But , if this were the only meaning that could be attached to the phrase , we should have to say that orthodox Christians deny the existence of a personal God .
For the Christian God is the Trinity ; and the Trinity is not a person , though its members are persons .
Now it would be extremely inconvenient to define the phrase ' personal God ' in such a way that we should have to hold that all orthodox Christians deny the existence of a personal God .
And , as we have seen , this inconvenient result would follow if we defined a ' personal God ' to mean ' a God who is a person ' .
We must therefore adopt a some what wider definition of ' personal ' .
Now we notice that , whilst the Trinity is denied to be a person , it is asserted to be a complex unity composed of three intimately related constituents , each of which is a person .
And I think that we should deny that a man believed in a personal God unless he believed that God either is a person or is a complex whole composed of nothing but interrelated persons .
I therefore suggest that the phrase ' a personal God ' means 'a God which either is a person or is a whole composed of nothing but interrelated persons ' .
This definition is certainly wide enough , whilst the first suggested definition was certainly too narrow .
It might perhaps be objected that the proposed definition is now too wide .
Would any and every God which is composed of nothing but interrelated persons be counted as a personal God ?
Or must the relations be of a specially intimate kind before we can apply the adjective ' personal ' to a whole composed of nothing but persons ?
It is admitted that , according to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity , the relations between the constituent persons are extremely intimate ; so much so that there is a constant danger of making statements about the Trinity which are true only of its constituents , and of making statements about its constituents which are true only of the Trinity as a whole .
But I think that this question really arises rather under the definition of ' God ' than under the definition of ' personal ' .
It is quite certain that we should not apply the name ' God ' to any and every whole composed of interrelated persons ; we should apply this name only if the relations were peculiarly intimate .
I shall assume , therefore , that any whole composed of nothing but persons may be called ' personal ' provided that the relations between the constituent persons are intimate enough for this whole to be called a ' God ' .
We have not , however , finished with the definition of the adjective ' personal ' .
We have said that ' a personal God ' means 'a God which either is a person or is a whole composed of nothing but interrelated persons ' .
But what do we mean by a ' person ' ?
I do not know that we can define the term ; but , by considering examples of what we should call ' persons ' and by contrasting them with examples of what we should refuse to call ' persons ' , we can see pretty well what is involved in being a person .
We call a sane grown man a ' person ' .
We refuse to call any inanimate object , such as a chair , a ' person ' .
We also refuse to call a cat or a dog or a horse a ' person ' , though we admit that they have feelings , impulses , instincts , habits , etc .
And I think that it would be felt to be a strained and metaphorical use of language to call a very young baby a ' person ' .
If we reflect on these examples I think we shall see that we apply the name ' person ' literally to a substance if , and only if , it fulfils the following conditions :
It must think , feel , will , etc .
Its various contemporary states must have that peculiar kind of unity which we express by saying that they ' together make up a single total state of mind ' .
Its successive total states must have that peculiar kind of unity with each other which we express by saying that they are ' so many different stages in the history of a single mind ' .
These two kinds of unity must be recognized by itself , and not only by some external observer , i.e. it must not only be in fact a mind , but must also know that it is a mind .
And this knowledge must be , in part at least , immediate and not merely inferential ; though its knowledge of many details about itself may , of course , be inferential and not immediate .
If we accept this as an adequate description of ' being a person ' there are certain further remarks to be made .
(1) There are , presumably , different degrees of personality .
These differences may arise in two different ways , which must be distinguished in theory even if in fact they be causally connected so that variations in one respect causally determine variations in the other respect .
A mind will be more fully personal the more completely its contemporary states are united with each other to form a single total state , and the more completely its successive total states are united with each other to form the history of a single mind .
In every human mind there are conflicting desires , inconsistent beliefs , and contemporary mental processes which have very little connexion with each other .
And the history of every human mind is broken by gaps of dreamless sleep , fainting fits , drunkenness , and so on .
A mind will be more fully personal the more fully and immediately it recognizes such unity as it in fact possesses .
We have all forgotten a great many states which have in fact been experienced by us , and we can not recall them at will .
And , on the other hand , we are liable to ' remember ' events that never happened , and to believe falsely that they formed parts of our mental history .
(2) There are certain judgments which we make only about persons , and certain emotions which we feel only towards what we take to be persons .
We should not literally ascribe moral goodness or badness to anything which we did not believe to be a person .
No one seriously talks of a virtuous baby , or regards a cat as being morally responsible for its actions .
And no one can strictly feel the emotions of love or gratitude to anything which he does not at the time regard as a person .
It is true , I think , that a man may quite literally love his cat or dog , though he would admit , if questioned , that it is not a person .
But an intelligent domestic animal probably has , in fact , the rudiments of personality , and , whether it has or not , its master almost certainly treats it in practice as a person whatever his theoretical beliefs on the subject may be .
Again , it is certainly possible to feel emotions which are analogous to love and to gratitude towards certain wholes composed of interrelated persons , though we should admit that these wholes are not themselves persons .
E.g. there is an emotion which we call ' love ' for a public school , a college , or a country .
And there is an emotion which we call ' gratitude ' towards these institutions for the benefits which we believe them to have bestowed on us .
But , in the first place , it is plain that we tend in practice to personify such a group of persons , although we know that it is not really a person .
We tend , e.g. to substitute for Trinity College , which is a Society and not a person , a kind of idealized man who combines all the best qualities of all the nicest Trinity men that we have known .
And , if we literally love certain actual Trinity men , we shall tend to feel an analogous emotion at the thought of this idealized Trinity man who represents Trinity College to us .
Moreover , I think it is plain that , although some of the emotions which we feel towards certain groups of interrelated persons are analogous to love and to gratitude , they are not strictly the same emotions as love and gratitude .
Love , in the strict sense , can be felt only towards something which we believe to be capable of loving us in return ; it is always accompanied by a desire to be loved in return , and in the absence of such a response it tends at length to fade away .
But we know perfectly well that a college or a public school cannot literally love us , though some of its members may do so .
Yet this does not prevent us from feeling for it the emotion which I have described .
Hence this emotion cannot be the same as love , in the strict sense .
I conclude , then , that we cannot strictly love anything unless we believe it to be a person at the time when we are feeling the emotion .
I have now , I hope , made clear what is meant by ' being a person ' , and have stated some important additional facts about this characteristic .
The next point to be considered is what is meant by being a ' God ' .
I think it is quite certain that the word ' God ' is extremely ambiguous , and that it has commonly been used in at least three different , though connected , senses .
I distinguish these as the popular sense , the theological sense , and the philosophical sense .
In the popular sense of the word ' God ' a God is ipso facto a person .
This person is supposed to be analogous to a human being , but to be much more powerful .
It is supposed to be able to do things of a different kind from those which human beings can do , and I think that it is generally conceived as not subject to death and as exercising an important influence on the weal or woe of human beings .
This is all that is involved in the notion of a God in the popular sense .
It is not supposed to be necessarily unique ; it is not supposed to be infinitely powerful or perfectly wise , but merely to be a great deal more powerful and a great deal wiser than any living human being .
And it is not supposed of necessity to have created men or to have created the material world , nor is the continued existence of nature and of men supposed necessarily to be dependent on the continued support of a God in this sense .
Lastly , a God , in the popular sense , need not be morally superior to the best human beings , though he must be wiser than the wisest and stronger than the strongest human beings .
Jehovah and Apollo are Gods in the popular sense ; but Jehovah inculcated a high moral tone by precept rather than by example ; and Apollo , in view of his relations with Cassandra and with Hyacinthus , might have had difficulty in obtaining the College testimonial for deacon 's orders , which has never been held to require a superhuman level of moral achievement .
The word ' God ' , in the theological sense , has in one respect a wider meaning , and in other respects a narrower meaning , than the same word when used in the popular sense .
A God , in the theological sense , need not be a person .
According to orthodox Christian theology nothing can strictly be called ' God ' except the Trinity as a whole .
And the Trinity is certainly not a person .
It is true that the Athanasian Creed says that the Father is God , and the Son is God , and the Holy Ghost is God ; but it immediately adds that nevertheless there are not three Gods , but one God .
If these statements are to be rendered consistent it is plain that the word ' God ' must be used in different senses in the two .
Nor is there the least difficulty in seeing what these senses are .
The creed means that there is only one being that can with strict theological correctness be called ' God ' , viz .
the Trinity as a whole .
But each of the three persons can be called ' God ' in a looser sense , because they are divine persons and essential constituents of the Trinity , which is God in the strict sense .
Thus we might say loosely : ' The King is the sovereign of England , and the House of Lords is the sovereign of England , and the House of Commons is the sovereign of England . '
But we should immediately add , in order to ward off possible errors , ' Of course , strictly speaking , there is only one sovereign of England , viz .
the whole composed of King , Lords , and Commons in their proper constitutional relations to each other ' .
In the popular sense of ' God ' each person of the Trinity is a God , and the Trinity as a whole is not a God ; but , in the theological sense of the word , the persons are not Gods , whilst the whole composed of them is a God , and is the only God that there is .
The theological sense of the word ' God ' is thus wider than the popular sense , in so far as the former can be applied either to a person or to certain wholes composed of interrelated persons , whilst the latter can be applied only to a person .
In all other respects , however , the theological conception of God is narrower and more rigid than the popular conception .
Theologians push all the attributes of God to extremes .
A God , in the theological sense , must be not merely very wise and very strong ; he must be perfectly wise , and capable of doing anything which does not involve some internal logical inconsistency .
It is an essential part of the theological conception of God that he shall be morally perfect .
It is also part of the theological conception of God that he shall be unique .
By this I mean that theologians are not content to hold that there happens to be only one thing answering to the definition of ' God ' , just as there happens to be only one thing answering to the description of ' the brother of Romulus ' .
They hold that , from the nature of the case , there could only be one God , just as , from the nature of the case , there could only be one individual answering to the description ' the most virtuous undergraduate in Trinity ' .
I think that this is one reason why theologians refuse to call the persons of the Trinity ' Gods ' , and confine the name ' God ' to the Trinity as a whole .
For , in all other respects but uniqueness , the persons of the Trinity would seem to be ' Gods ' in the strict theological sense .
Finally , it is , I think , part of the theological conception of God that he cannot be identified with the universe .
There has to be some asymmetrical relation between God and the rest of the universe , so that there is a sense in which we can say that the latter is existentially dependent on the former whilst the former is not existentially dependent on the latter .
I will make a few explanatory comments on the theological conception of God before passing to the philosophical conception .
(1) I do not know how far the statements of theologians about the omniscience , omnipotence , and moral perfection of God are to be taken literally .
It may be that this pushing of God 's attributes to extremes is only intended as a compliment ; and that when God is said to be perfectly wise , and good , and powerful , these phrases are to be regarded as analogous to ' Your Serene Transparency ' when applied to German princes or ' His Most Religious Majesty ' when applied to Charles II .
Persons who used the latter phrases plainly did not intend to deny that German princes are opaque to light , or that Charles II was sometimes inclined to be a little careless about the higher spiritual values .
And it may be that theologians do not intend their statements about God 's attributes to be interpreted too literally .
On that hypothesis the theological conception of God may not really differ so much from the popular conception as it seems to do .
(2) We must clearly understand that not any and every group of interrelated persons would be regarded as a God even in the theological sense .
It is necessary that the persons should be of a certain kind , and that their relations should have a certain high degree of intimacy .
I think that the component persons must be such that each would be a God in the popular sense .
And I think that the relations must be so intimate that none of the persons could exist apart from each other and outside the whole which they together form .
We can see the necessity of both these conditions by taking cases where one is fulfilled and the other fails .
The society of Olympus was a whole composed of interrelated persons , each of which was a God in the popular sense .
But no one ever thought of regarding this whole as a God .
And the reason is that the relations were not intimate enough .
Zeus could have existed without Hera , and Hera could have existed without Zeus .
Again , on Dr. McTaggart 's view , the universe is a whole composed of persons so intimately related that none could have existed without the rest and apart from this whole .
But no one would call the universe , as conceived by McTaggart , a ' God ' .
For its components are ourselves and other persons like us .
And we are not Gods .
I pass now to the philosophical sense of the word ' God ' .
This is very much wider in either the theological or the popular sense of the word .
A ' God ' , in the philosophical sense , need not be a person or a whole composed of nothing but interrelated persons .
It therefore need not be wise or good , for these epithets apply only to persons .
The name ' God ' has been applied by certain philosophers to the Universe as a whole .
Thus Hegel calls the Absolute ' God ' , and Spinoza talks of ' God or Nature ' as synonymous terms like Augustus and Octavius .
I think , however , that even in philosophy the name ' God ' would be applied to the Universe only on the supposition that the Universe has a much more intimate internal unity than it appears to have at first sight , and that this unity is of a special kind .
I think that all philosophers who have asserted the existence of God have held one of three views about the internal structure of the Universe :
(1) That there is a certain part of the Universe which is not existentially dependent on any thing else , and that all the rest of the Universe is existentially dependent on this part of it .
This substance is then called ' God ' , whatever its other characteristics may be .
This is the doctrine which is known as Deism .
It is held by those philosophers who talk of God as ' the great First Cause ' .
(2) That there are certain characteristics of the Universe from which all its other characteristics necessarily follow .
In that case the name ' God ' will often be applied by philosophers to the Universe in virtue of its having this peculiar internal structure .
Thus Spinoza distinguishes between Natura Naturans and Natura Naturata .
Natura Naturans is the Universe , regarded as having certain fundamental characteristics from which all the rest follow .
And Natura Naturata is the Universe , regarded as having all the characteristics which follow from these fundamental ones and as having no others .
The Universe in its completeness is thus Natura Naturans and Natura Naturata ; and Spinoza calls it ' God ' in virtue of its having this kind of internal structure .
This doctrine is one form of Pantheism .
(3) That many of the features which seem to characterize the Universe or parts of it do not really belong to it , but are distorted and partly illusory appearances of characteristics which really do belong to it ; in particular , that the Universe is in reality purely mental ( i.e. that it is a mind or a society of minds ) , and that matter , space , and motion are distorted appearances of this mind and its states or of these minds and their mutual relations .
The name ' God ' is then often applied by philosophers to the Universe as it really is on this view , as distinct from the Universe as it appears to be .
This , I suppose , is why Hegel called the Universe ' God ' .
I think we may say that no philosopher asserts the existence of God unless he holds one of these three views about the nature of the Universe .
On the other hand , many philosophers who do hold one of these three views would refuse to assert the existence of God , on the ground that the word has much more definite implications in theology and in ordinary life and that the use of it in the philosophic sense is misleading .
E.g. , the Universe , as Dr. McTaggart believed it to be , is a God in the third philosophic sense of the term .
But McTaggart always refused to call it ' God ' and blamed Hegel for doing so , on the ground that the phrase ' The Absolute ' completely conveys his meaning whilst the word ' God ' inevitably has associations and arouses emotions which are not justified by what he believed to be the facts .
Here I agree with him .
I think that we ought to confine the word ' God ' to the theological and the popular senses of it ; and that , unless we have reason to believe in the existence of a God or Gods in one of these senses , we ought not to say that we believe in the existence of God at all .
Now , in these senses of the word , a God is necessarily a personal God .
It is either a divine person , or it is a whole composed of nothing but divine persons so intimately related that none of them could exist apart from the rest and outside this whole .
And I have defined what I mean by a ' person ' and what I mean by ' divine ' .
The question then is :
What reason , if any , have we to believe in the existence of divine persons ?
For it is plain that we can have no reason to believe in wholes composed of nothing but divine persons related in certain ways unless we have reason to believe in divine persons .
And we might have reason to believe in the existence of divine persons whilst we had no means of deciding whether there was one or a dozen , and no means of deciding whether they stood in such and such relations to each other or not .
A man who believes in the existence of a divine person might try to justify his belief in one of three ways :
He might claim to know directly that such a being exists ; or he might claim to be able to prove the existence of such a being , or to make it very probable , by argument ; or he might believe it on the authority of others .
(1) A claim to direct knowledge of God 's existence might take two different forms :
A man might find the proposition ' God exists ' self - evident , as most men find the proposition 2+2=4 .
Or he might claim to know that God exists because he has in some supersensible way perceived God ; just as most people claim to know that their chairs and tables exist because they have perceived these objects with their senses .
Let us now consider the claim to know directly that God exists because one has perceived him in some supersensible way .
Perception may roughly be defined as being in direct cognitive contact with an existent something which manifests certain qualities to the percipient , and is instinctively regarded by him as a part or an appearance of a more extended and more enduring object which has certain other qualities that are not manifested to the percipient at the moment .
E.g. , when I say that I see a penny , I am in direct cognitive contact with something which manifests the qualities of brownness and approximately circular shape ; and I instinctively regard this as a part or an appearance of something which is permanent , which has an inside as well as an outside , and which has qualities like hardness and coldness that are not at present being manifested to me .
If this belief be mistaken , I am not perceiving what would commonly be called a ' penny ' .
Now it is notorious that in ordinary sense - perception we are often deluded and sometimes wildly deluded .
A simple example is mistaking a mere mirror - image for a physical object , and a still more striking example is perceiving snakes or pink rats when one is suffering from delirium tremens .
It is quite certain , then , that there are delusive sense - perceptions .
Now , in the case of sense - perception there are several tests which we can use to tell whether a perception is delusive or not .
We can check one sense by another , e.g. , sight by touch .
We can appeal to the testimony of others and find out whether they see anything that corresponds to what we see .
Finally , we can make inferences from what we think we perceive , and find whether they are verified .
We can say : ' If there are really rats running about my bed my dog will be excited , bread and cheese will disappear , and so on . '
And then we can see whether anything of the kind happens .
Now it does not seem to be possible to test the alleged supersensible perception which some people claim to have of God by any of these means .
Very few people have had the experiences at all ; they are very difficult to describe , and therefore to compare ; and it is very hard to point to any verifiable consequences which would follow if , and only if , these perceptions were not delusive .
And , so far as I can see , nothing comparable to supporting the testimony of one sense by that of another is here possible .
This does not , of course , prove that such supersensible perceptions are delusive ; but it does show that we have no means of telling whether they are or are not .
And , as we already know that many perceptions are delusive , this is a serious matter .
As Hobbes says : ' When a man tells me that God spoke to him in a dream all that I can be sure of is that he dreamed that God spoke to him . '
Even if we waive this objection , and take at their face value the statements of people who say that they have perceived God , they give no support whatever to the existence of a single perfectly wise , good , and powerful being , on whom all the rest of the Universe depends .
They would tend rather to support the view that there is a bewildering variety of Gods in the popular sense , many of whom possess the oddest personal peculiarities .
(2) I pass now to arguments for the existence of God .
These may be divided into deductive and inductive arguments .
There are two of the former .
One professes to prove from the definition of God that such a being must exist .
This argument , if it were valid , would have the advantage of proving the existence of an unique individual possessed of all possible perfections , i.e. of God , in the theological sense .
But it is universally admitted by philosophers and theologians that the argument is logically fallacious .
It is called the Ontological Argument .
The second deductive argument starts from the premiss that no thing or event in nature exists of intrinsic necessity .
Such necessity as we find within nature is purely relative and hypothetical .
We can say that , given A , B necessarily follows .
But we cannot say that A's existence or B's existence is intrinsically necessary if A and B be things or events in nature .
It is then argued that , since nature as a whole has this contingent character , its existence must depend on something else whose existence is intrinsically necessary .
This something is called ' God ' .
The argument is known as the Cosmological Argument .
It is not so obviously fallacious as the Ontological Argument , and it has been accepted by some very able theologians and philosophers , such as St. Thomas Aquinas and Locke .
Nevertheless , I agree with Kant and Hume that it is fallacious .
Fortunately it is not necessary for me to prove this here , because the argument is irrelevant for our present purpose .
For it is certain that , even if it be valid , it has no tendency to prove the existence of a personal God .
At best it would prove the existence of God only in one of the three philosophical senses of that term , and not in the theological or the popular sense .
We may therefore dismiss the deductive arguments and consider the inductive ones .
These start with certain admitted facts about nature and man , and argue back to the existence of God as the hypothesis which best explains these facts .
Of course , the conclusions of such arguments could never be more than highly probable .
But I do not think that this is a serious objection .
We could quite reasonably say that the existence of God was ' proved ' if it could be rendered as probable as the existence of Julius Caesar .
Such arguments may be classified according to their premisses .
They may start from certain facts about inorganic nature and living organisms .
They may start from the fact that nature contains minds which are capable of distinguishing good and evil and of guiding their actions by ideals .
They may start from the fact that certain minds have , in addition , specifically religious emotions and other experiences .
(a) The first set of facts forms the basis of the famous Design Argument .
This has been so thoroughly discussed by Hume in his Dialogues on Natural Religion that there is little left to say about it .
I will content myself with the following remarks :
( i) We must distinguish between the adaptation of inorganic nature to life in general , and the peculiarities of organisms as such .
Let us begin with the former .
It is certain that the condition of inorganic nature on the earth is , and has long been , extremely well adapted to the existence and growth of living organisms .
So far as we know , the conditions under which organisms can exist are very peculiar , so that it is antecedently improbable that they should be fulfilled .
Hence it is argued that they must have been deliberately brought about by a mind which wanted organisms to exist and flourish .
This , I think , is a fallacious argument .
It seems certain that the fulfilment of these conditions is really very local and temporary .
They are probably not fulfilled now in the greater part of the Universe ; they certainly were not fulfilled formerly on the earth , and they almost certainly will cease to be fulfilled there in the distant future .
Now it is not antecedently improbable that even very peculiar conditions shall be fulfilled for a comparatively short time in a comparatively small region of a universe which is indefinitely extended in both Space and Time .
( ii ) The position about organisms themselves is as follows .
An organism is an extremely intricate system which appears , even to the most superficial view , to be extraordinarily well adapted to preserve itself in face of varying conditions and to produce things like itself .
And the more minutely we examine it the more accurately true do we find this to be .
Now the only other things that we know of which have the least analogy to this are artificial machines .
We know that these have been designed by minds , and we have not the least reason to think that they could have existed unless there had been minds which designed them and arranged their parts in such a way as to carry out these designs .
Of course organisms are now produced by other organisms , just as typewriters are produced by other machines .
But in the history of any artificial machine we eventually come back to a mind which had designs and arranged matter in such a way as to carry them out .
We may assume , by analogy , that if we went far enough back in the history of organisms we should come on a mind which designed them and arranged matter accordingly .
This mind was certainly not human , and it must certainly have been of superhuman wisdom and power to produce such results .
It may therefore fairly be called ' God ' .
I may say at once that I consider this to be an extremely strong argument if we grant two assumptions which are commonly made .
The first is that organisms originated from inorganic matter .
The second is that an organism really is nothing but a complicated machine , i.e. that its characteristic behaviour is wholly due to the peculiar arrangement of its parts , and is not due to entirely new properties of matter which first appear at the organic level .
If we reject either of these assumptions the argument loses much of its force .
If there have always been organisms of some kind , and no organism has ever originated from inorganic matter , there is no need to postulate a designing mind even though organisms be nothing but machines .
And if organisms be not merely machines , there is no need to postulate a designing mind even though organisms did originate out of inorganic matter .
Now , I do not see the least reason to believe that the characteristic behaviour of organisms can be wholly explained by the peculiar arrangement of their parts and the laws and properties of inorganic matter .
Hence the argument for the existence of a designing mind from the peculiarities of organisms does not convince me , though I think it ought to have great weight with a purely mechanistic biologist .
( iii ) Even if we accept the argument it will not prove the existence of God , in the theological sense .
In the first place , it would prove only that a designing mind had existed in the past , not that it does exist now .
It is quite compatible with this argument that God should have died long ago , or that he should have turned his attention to other parts of the Universe .
Again , so far from proving the existence of a being on whom the rest of the Universe is existentially dependent , it negatives this supposition .
It proves the existence of a superhuman workman faced with material whose properties he has to recognize and make use of , and not of a creative being .
Thirdly , there is nothing in the facts to suggest that there is only one such being .
And lastly , there is nothing to suggest that he is morally perfect .
We must grant him superhuman skill and power , but the actual state of the world forces us to limit either his power or his goodness , or his wisdom , or all three .
So , at the very best , the argument would prove only that at some time in the remote past there had been one or more Gods in the popular sense of the word .
( b) I will now consider the argument for the existence of God from the existence of minds like ours which can look before and after , make judgments of good and evil , and guide their conduct by them .
It may be admitted that we cannot conceive of any natural process by which minds could have arisen spontaneously from mere matter .
So it has been suggested that we must postulate the existence of God to account for the facts .
But , in the first place , there is no reason to accept the alleged facts ; and secondly , the hypothesis of a God would provide no explanation of them .
It is quite possible that there have always been minds , and that no mind has ever originated from anything but another mind by a natural process .
In that case the hypothesis of God is needless for the present purpose .
If we make the hypothesis we have explained absolutely nothing .
We are still obliged to suppose that there have always been minds , though not always non-divine minds .
And the production of non-divine minds from mere matter remains just as unintelligible whether we say that it happens spontaneously or that it is miraculously accomplished by God .
The fact is that the Argument from Design and the argument which I have just been discussing illustrate an important general principle .
If you start with a sufficiently narrow and inadequate view of nature you will have to postulate a God to get you out of the difficulties in which it lands you .
E.g. , if you insist that living organisms are mere machines , you have to postulate God to construct them out of unorganized matter .
And if you insist that nature is fundamentally material and that mind is a kind of afterthought , you have to postulate God to account for the origin of mind , though , as I have pointed out , the hypothesis does not here really help you .
But why should you start with these narrow and inadequate views of nature ?
They have no trace of self - evidence and they conflict with the observable facts in every direction .
And , unless you make this mistake at the outset , I do not think you will be able to find any inductive proof of the existence of God .
( c) Finally , I come to the argument for the existence of God which is based on the occurrence of specifically mystical and religious experiences .
I am prepared to admit that such experiences occur among people of different races and social traditions , and that they have occurred at all periods of history .
I am prepared to admit that , although the experiences have differed considerably at different times and places , and although the interpretations which have been put on them have differed still more , there are probably certain characteristics which are common to all of them and which suffice to distinguish them from all other kinds of experience .
In view of this I think it more likely than not that in religious and mystical experience men come into contact with some Reality or some aspect of Reality which they do not come into contact with in any other way .
But I do not think that there is any good reason to suppose that this Reality which manifests itself to certain men in religious and mystical experiences is personal .
I think that we are inclined to believe this because we are most familiar with the religious experiences of Western Europeans and of Jews , most of whom have put this interpretation upon them .
We do not know , or we forget , that the mystics and religious teachers of the Far East on the whole definitely reject this interpretation .
And we are inclined to forget that certain Europeans , such as Plotinus and Spinoza , who have had these experiences also reject this interpretation of them .
I think on the whole , then , that there is no inductive argument which makes it at all highly probable that there is a personal God .
(3) It only remains to consider whether it is reasonable to believe in the existence of a personal God on the authority of other men .
We all believe many propositions on authority , and in many cases it would be most irrational not to do so .
It is rational to believe a proposition on authority if one of two conditions is fulfilled .
( i) If experts agree that it can be proved , but the argument is too difficult or unfamiliar for me to follow it myself .
( ii ) If persons whom I know to be competent and trustworthy tell me that they have perceived certain things which I have not perceived myself .
I accept many propositions in mathematics on the authority of Professor Hardy , who tells me that they can be proved ; and I accept many propositions in physics on the authority of Professor Rutherford , whom I know to be a trustworthy person and a highly skilled experimenter and observer .
But neither of these conditions is fulfilled in the case of the proposition that there exists a personal God .
There is no consensus of experts about the alleged proofs , and I can see for myself that these arguments are fallacious .
And I have tried to show that the claims of certain persons to have perceived God in some supersensible way are to be regarded with grave suspicion even if we accept their bona fides .
Hence it would be irrational for me to believe in the existence of a personal God on the authority of others .
To conclude .
Whether there be in fact a personal God or not , it seems to me that we have no good reason to believe in the existence of such a being .
I think that there are such grave difficulties in the notion of a God in the theological sense that there are strong reasons against believing that such a being exists .
These objections do not apply to the notion of Gods in the popular sense .
For all I can see there may be dozens of such Gods ; and the only reason against being a polytheist is that there is no reason for being one .

STEPHEN COLBERT : Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
Before I begin , I 've been asked to make an announcement .
Whoever parked 14 black bulletproof S.U.V.'s out front , could you please move them ?
They are blocking in 14 other black bulletproof S.U.V.'s and they need to get out .
Wow .
Wow , what an honor .
The White House correspondents ' dinner .
To actually sit here , at the same table with my hero , George W. Bush , to be this close to the man .
I feel like I 'm dreaming .
Somebody pinch me .
You know what ?
I 'm a pretty sound sleeper -- that may not be enough .
Somebody shoot me in the face .
Is he really not here tonight ?
Dammit .
The one guy who could have helped .
By the way , before I get started , if anybody needs anything else at their tables , just speak slowly and clearly into your table numbers .
Somebody from the NSA will be right over with a cocktail .
Mark Smith , ladies and gentlemen of the press corps , Madame First Lady , Mr. President , my name is Stephen Colbert and tonight it 's my privilege to celebrate this president .
We 're not so different , he and I .
We get it .
We 're not brainiacs on the nerd patrol .
We 're not members of the factinista .
We go straight from the gut , right sir ?
That 's where the truth lies , right down here in the gut .
Do you know you have more nerve endings in your gut than you have in your head ?
You can look it up .
I know some of you are going to say " I did look it up , and that 's not true . "
That 's ' cause you looked it up in a book .
Next time , look it up in your gut .
I did .
My gut tells me that 's how our nervous system works .
Every night on my show , the Colbert Report , I speak straight from the gut , OK ?
I give people the truth , unfiltered by rational argument .
I call it the " No Fact Zone . "
Fox News , I hold a copyright on that term .
I 'm a simple man with a simple mind .
I hold a simple set of beliefs that I live by .
Number one , I believe in America .
I believe it exists .
My gut tells me I live there .
I feel that it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific , and I strongly believe it has 50 states .
And I cannot wait to see how the Washington Post spins that one tomorrow .
I believe in democracy .
I believe democracy is our greatest export .
At least until China figures out a way to stamp it out of plastic for three cents a unit .
In fact , Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong , welcome .
Your great country makes our Happy Meals possible .
I said it 's a celebration .
I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least .
And by these standards , we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq .
I believe in pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps .
I believe it is possible -- I saw this guy do it once in Cirque du Soleil .
It was magical .
And though I am a committed Christian , I believe that everyone has the right to their own religion , be you Hindu , Jewish or Muslim .
I believe there are infinite paths to accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior .
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe it 's yogurt .
But I refuse to believe it 's not butter .
Most of all , I believe in this president .
Now , I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32 % approval rating .
But guys like us , we do n't pay attention to the polls .
We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in " reality . "
And reality has a well - known liberal bias .
So , Mr. President , please , pay no attention to the people that say the glass is half full .
32 % means the glass -- it 's important to set up your jokes properly , sir .
Sir , pay no attention to the people who say the glass is half empty , because 32 % means it 's 2/3 empty .
There 's still some liquid in that glass is my point , but I would n't drink it .
The last third is usually backwash .
Okay , look , folks , my point is that I do n't believe this is a low point in this presidency .
I believe it is just a lull before a comeback .
I mean , it 's like the movie " Rocky . "
All right .
The president in this case is Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed is -- everything else in the world .
It 's the tenth round .
He 's bloodied .
His corner man , Mick , who in this case I guess would be the vice president , he 's yelling , " Cut me , Dick , cut me ! , " and every time he falls everyone says , " Stay down !
Stay down ! "
Does he stay down ?
No. Like Rocky , he gets back up , and in the end he -- actually , he loses in the first movie .
OK .
Does n't matter .
The point is it is the heart - warming story of a man who was repeatedly punched in the face .
So do n't pay attention to the approval ratings that say 68 % of Americans disapprove of the job this man is doing .
I ask you this , does that not also logically mean that 68 % approve of the job he 's not doing ?
Think about it .
I have n't .
I stand by this man .
I stand by this man because he stands for things .
Not only for things , he stands on things .
Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares .
And that sends a strong message : that no matter what happens to America , she will always rebound -- with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world .
Now , there may be an energy crisis .
This president has a very forward - thinking energy policy .
Why do you think he 's down on the ranch cutting that brush all the time ?
He 's trying to create an alternative energy source .
By 2008 we will have a mesquite - powered car !
And I just like the guy .
He 's a good Joe .
Obviously loves his wife , calls her his better half .
And polls show America agrees .
She 's a true lady and a wonderful woman .
But I just have one beef , ma'am .
I 'm sorry , but this reading initiative .
I 'm sorry , I 've never been a fan of books .
I do n't trust them .
They 're all fact , no heart .
I mean , they 're elitist , telling us what is or is n't true , or what did or did n't happen .
Who 's Britannica to tell me the Panama Canal was built in 1914 ?
If I want to say it was built in 1941 , that 's my right as an American !
I 'm with the president , let history decide what did or did not happen .
The greatest thing about this man is he 's steady .
You know where he stands .
He believes the same thing Wednesday that he believed on Monday , no matter what happened Tuesday .
Events can change ; this man 's beliefs never will .
As excited as I am to be here with the president , I am appalled to be surrounded by the liberal media that is destroying America , with the exception of Fox News .
Fox
News gives you both sides of every story : the president 's side , and the vice president 's side .
But the rest of you , what are you thinking , reporting on NSA wiretapping or secret prisons in eastern Europe ?
Those things are secret for a very important reason : they 're super - depressing .
And if that 's your goal , well , misery accomplished .
Over the last five years you people were so good -- over tax cuts , WMD intelligence , the effect of global warming .
We Americans did n't want to know , and you had the courtesy not to try to find out .
Those were good times , as far as we knew .
But , listen , let 's review the rules .
Here 's how it works : the president makes decisions .
He 's the Decider .
The press secretary announces those decisions , and you people of the press type those decisions down .
Make , announce , type .
Just put 'em through a spell check and go home .
Get to know your family again .
Make love to your wife .
Write that novel you got kicking around in your head .
You know , the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration .
You know - fiction !
Because really , what incentive do these people have to answer your questions , after all ?
I mean , nothing satisfies you .
Everybody asks for personnel changes .
So the White House has personnel changes .
Then you write , " Oh , they 're just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic . "
First of all , that is a terrible metaphor .
This administration is not sinking .
This administration is soaring .
If anything , they are rearranging the deck chairs on the Hindenburg !
Now , it 's not all bad guys out there .
Some are heroes : Christopher Buckley , Jeff Sacks , Ken Burns , Bob Schieffer .
They 've all been on my show .
By the way , Mr. President , thank you for agreeing to be on my show .
I was just as shocked as everyone here is , I promise you .
How 's Tuesday for you ?
I 've got Frank Rich , but we can bump him .
And I mean bump him .
I know a guy .
Say the word .
See who we 've got here tonight .
General Moseley , Air Force Chief of Staff .
General Peter Pace , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
They still support Rumsfeld .
Right , you guys are n't retired yet , right ?
Right , they still support Rumsfeld .
Look , by the way , I 've got a theory about how to handle these retired generals causing all this trouble : do n't let them retire !
Come on , we 've got a stop - loss program ; let 's use it on these guys .
I 've seen Zinni and that crowd on Wolf Blitzer .
If you 're strong enough to go on one of those pundit shows , you can stand on a bank of computers and order men into battle .
Come on .
Jesse Jackson is here , the Reverend .
Have n't heard from the Reverend in a little while .
I had him on the show .
Very interesting and challenging interview .
You can ask him anything , but he 's going to say what he wants , at the pace that he wants .
It 's like boxing a glacier .
Enjoy that metaphor , by the way , because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is .
Justice Scalia is here .
Welcome , sir .
May I be the first to say , you look fantastic .
How are you ?
[ After each sentence , Colbert makes a hand gesture , an allusion to Scalia 's recent use of an obscene Sicilian hand gesture in speaking to a reporter about Scalia 's critics .
Scalia is seen laughing hysterically . ]
Just talking some Sicilian with my paisan .
John McCain is here .
John McCain , John McCain , what a maverick !
Somebody find out what fork he used on his salad , because I guarantee you it was n't a salad fork .
This guy could have used a spoon !
There 's no predicting him .
By the way , Senator McCain , it 's so wonderful to see you coming back into the Republican fold .
I have a summer house in South Carolina ; look me up when you go to speak at Bob Jones University .
So glad you 've seen the light , sir .
Mayor Nagin !
Mayor Nagin is here from New Orleans , the chocolate city !
Yeah , give it up .
Mayor Nagin , I 'd like to welcome you to Washington , D.C. , the chocolate city with a marshmallow center .
And a graham cracker crust of corruption .
It 's a Mallomar , I guess is what I 'm describing , a seasonal cookie .
Joe Wilson is here , Joe Wilson right down here in front , the most famous husband since Desi Arnaz .
And of course he brought along his lovely wife Valerie Plame .
Oh , my god .
[ looks horrified ]
Oh , what have I said ?
I -- Je- minetti ( sp ? ) .
I am sorry , Mr. President , I meant to say he brought along his lovely wife Joe Wilson 's wife .
Patrick Fitzgerald is not here tonight ?
OK .
Dodged a bullet .
And , of course , we can't forget the man of the hour , new press secretary , Tony Snow .
Secret Service name , " Snow Job . "
Toughest job .
What a hero .
Took the second toughest job in government , next to , of course , the ambassador to Iraq .
Got some big shoes to fill , Tony .
Big shoes to fill .
Scott McClellan could say nothing like nobody else .
McClellan , of course , eager to retire .
Really felt like he needed to spend more time with Andrew Card 's children .
Mr. President , I wish you had n't made the decision so quickly , sir .
I was vying for the job myself .
I think I would have made a fabulous press secretary .
I have nothing but contempt for these people .
I know how to handle these clowns .
In fact , sir , I brought along an audition tape and with your indulgence , I 'd like to at least give it a shot .
So , ladies and gentlemen , my press conference .
BEGINNING OF " AUDITION TAPE "
Colbert shows a video of a mock press conference .
It opens with an empty podium .
Colbert 's head rises from behind the podium until Colbert is standing at the podium .
He addresses the assembled Washington press corps .
COLBERT : I have a brief statement : the press is destroying America .
OK , let 's see who we 've got here today .
COLBERT ( acknowledging various reporters ) : Stretch !
( David Gregory nods )
Sir Nerdlington !
( reporter nods )
Sloppy Joe! ( reporter nods )
Terry Lemon Moran Pie! ( Terry Moran nods )
Oh , Doubting Thomas , always a pleasure .
( Helen Thomas smiles )
And Suzanne Mal -- hello!!
( Suzanne Malveaux stares at Colbert , looking unhappy .
Colbert mimics putting a phone to his ear and mouths " call me . " )
REPORTER : Will the Vice President be available soon to answer all questions himself ?
COLBERT : I 've already addressed that question .
You ( pointing to another reporter ) .
REPORTER : Walter Cronkite , the noted CBS anchor , . . .
COLBERT ( interrupting ) : Ah , no , he 's the former CBS anchor .
Katie Couric is the new anchor of the CBS Evening News .
Well , well , how do you guys feel about that ?
You , tousle - haired guy in the back .
Are you happy about Katie Couric taking over the CBS Evening News ?
DAN RATHER : No , sir , Mr. Colbert .
Are you ?
( Laughter )
COLBERT : Boom !
Oh , look , we woke David Gregory up .
Question ?
DAVID GREGORY : Did Karl Rove commit a crime ?
COLBERT : I do n't know .
I 'll ask him .
( Colbert turns to Rove ) Karl , pay attention please !
( Rove is seen drawing a heart with " Karl + Stephen " written on it . )
GREGORY : Do you stand by your statement from the fall of 2003 when you were asked specifically about Karl , and Elliott Abrams , and Scooter Libby , and you said " I 've gone to each of those gentlemen , and they have told me that they are not involved in this . "
Do you stand by that statement ?
COLBERT : Nah , I was just kidding !
GREGORY : No , you 're not finishing .
You 're not saying anything !
You stood at that podium and said . . .
COLBERT ( interrupting ) : Ah , that 's where you 're wrong .
New podium !
Just had it delivered today .
Get your facts straight , David .
GREGORY : This is ridiculous .
The notion that you 're going to stand before us after having commented with that level of detail and tell the people watching this that somehow you 've decided not to talk .
You 've got to . . .
( Colbert is seen looking at three buttons on the podium , labeled " EJECT , " " GANNON " and " VOLUME . "
He selects the " VOLUME " button and turns it .
We see Gregory 's lips continue moving , but can't hear any sound coming out . )
COLBERT : If I can't hear you , I can't answer your question .
I 'm sorry !
I have to move on .
Terry .
TERRY MORAN : After the investigation began , after the criminal investigation was underway , you said . . .
( Colbert presses a button on the podium and fast - forwards through most of Moran 's question . )
MORAN ( continuing ) :
All of a sudden , you have respect for the sanctity of a criminal investigation ?
COLBERT ( seen playing with rubber ball , which he is bouncing off attached paddle ) :
No , I never had any respect for the sanctity of a criminal investigation .
Activist judges !
Yes , Helen .
HELEN THOMAS : You 're going to be sorry .
( Laughter )
COLBERT ( looking vastly amused , mockingly ) :
What are you going to do , Helen , ask me for a recipe ?
THOMAS : Your decision to invade Iraq has caused the deaths of thousands ( Colbert 's smile fades ) of Americans and Iraqis , wounds of Americans and Iraqis for a lifetime .
COLBERT ( interrupting ) : OK , hold on Helen , look . . .
THOMAS ( continuing ) : Every reason given , publicly at least , has turned out not to be true .
My question is , why did you really want to go to war ?
COLBERT ( again interrupting ) : Helen , I 'm going to stop you right there .
( Thomas keeps talking . )
That 's enough !
No !
Sorry , Helen , I 'm moving on .
( Colbert tries to turn her volume off , but the knob falls off his controls . )
( Various reporters start shouting questions at Colbert . )
COLBERT ( agitated ) : Guys , guys , please do n't let Helen do this to what was a lovely day .
( Reporters keep shouting at him . )
COLBERT ( putting his fingers over his ears and shouting in a high - pitched voice ) : Bllrrtt !
No , no , no , no , no .
I 'm not listening to you !
Look what you did , Helen !
I hate you !
( Helen Thomas glowers at Colbert . )
COLBERT ( frantic ) : I 'm out of here !
( Colbert pulls back the curtain behind him , desperately trying to flee .
He says , " There is a wall here ! "
The press corps laughs .
Colbert has difficulty finding a door from which to exit the room , echoing Bush 's experience in China .
He finally finds the door and hurries through it . )
COLBERT : It reeks in there !
Ridiculous !
I 've never been so insulted in my life !
Stupid job .
( Colbert continues walking away .
We hear sinister - sounding music playing .
We see Helen Thomas walking behind Colbert . )
( Colbert looks behind him , sees Thomas , and starts running . )
( Colbert trips over a roller skate .
He yells " Condi ! "
We see a close - up of Helen Thomas ' face , looking determined and angry .
Colbert , increasingly panicked , gets up and continues running , running into a parking garage .
He reaches an emergency call box , and yells into it . )
COLBERT : Oh , thank God .
Help me !
ATTENDANT : What seems to be the problem , sir ?
COLBERT : She wo n't stop asking why we invaded Iraq !
ATTENDANT : Hey , why did we invade Iraq ?
COLBERT : NO !!!
( runs toward his car )
( We see Helen Thomas , still walking toward him . )
( Colbert reaches his car , and fumblingly attempts to open it with his key .
He is in such a desperate hurry that he fumbles with the keys and drops them .
When he picks them up , he looks back and Helen is even closer .
In his frantic rush , Colbert just can't get the key into the lock . )
( Just as his anxiety is getting completely out of control he suddenly remembers that he has a keyless remote -- so he just pushes the button on the keychain and the car unlocks immediately with the usual double squeak noise .
Colbert jumps in and locks the door , and continues to fumble trying to start the car .
He finally succeeds , and looks up to see Helen standing in front of the car , notepad in hand . )
COLBERT : NO !!!
NO !!!
( Colbert puts the car into reverse and drives off , tires squealing .
Thomas smiles . )
( Colbert is shown taking the shuttle from Washington , D.C. to New York .
A car and driver are waiting for him at Penn Station .
The uniformed man standing alongside the car opens the door and lets Colbert in . )
COLBERT : What a terrible trip , Danny .
Take me home .
( The driver locks the doors , turns around , and says , " Buckle up , hon . "
IT 'S HELEN THOMAS !!!)
COLBERT ( horrified face pressed against car window ) : NO !!!
END OF " AUDITION TAPE "
STEPHEN COLBERT : Helen Thomas , ladies and gentlemen .
Mr. Smith , members of the White House Correspondents Association , Madame First Lady , Mr. President , it 's been a true honor .
Thank you very much .
Good night !
