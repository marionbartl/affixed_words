As Israeli forces pushed into Gaza on Sunday in fierce fighting , Minnesotans half a globe away weighed in with fierce opinions .
About 750 supporters of Israel 's action crammed inside the Sabes Jewish Community Center in St. Louis Park to show their support of Israel in the deadly conflict .
And outside , 250 protesters gathered to show their dismay .
A group of elected officials of all political persuasion -- ranging from Gov. Tim Pawlenty to archrivals and U.S. Senate wannabes Norm Coleman and Al Franken -- were united , if only for an afternoon , in supporting Israel as it battles Hamas .
" I 'm glad to be a friend of Israel , '' Pawlenty said to a raucous standing ovation .
Roughly a dozen speakers followed , all voicing a similar theme of support and solidarity .
The show of unity seemed a bit odd for Coleman , the Republican incumbent , and his Democratic foe , Franken .
The two are engaged in a bitter recount battle for a Senate seat that has winnowed down to several hundred votes , and is now being contested by Coleman in court .
The two appeared cordial at the rally Sunday , but kept their distance .
Both drew an enthusiastic response from the standing - room - only crowd .
" Our support has always been part of the miracle of Israel , and that must continue , " Coleman said .
Franken politely applauded .
Outside the rally , protesters from a variety of local organizations hoisted signs and shouted slogans opposing Israel 's action in Gaza .
" Just as it is not anti-American to criticize the U.S. government , it does not signify hatred of Jews who criticize Israeli government policy , '' said Lisa Albrecht , of the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network of the Twin Cities .
The group called for an immediate ceasefire and opening of Gaza 's borders , and also called for the Minnesota state pension fund to sever its investment ties with Israel .

Not everyone likes fish .
In fact , the majority of people in the world prefer to eat chicken , beef , or even tofu .
Fish are often thought of as horrible , slippery creatures that taste like ass .
We hope to change that by encouraging people to refer to fish by a different name : " Sea Bacon . "
Everyone loves bacon , and by calling fish sea bacon we can help the world see these misunderstood creatures for what they really are : enchanting , delicious treats .
Do your part : Pretend that sushi is actually bacon
How can I help ?
Never say fish , always say " Sea Bacon . "
Trick your friends by frying up some halibut for breakfast , but saying " the bacon is on ! "
Do this a few times and soon they 'll be eating sea bacon like it 's made of cocaine and snickers bars .

The United Nations ' most senior human rights official said last night that the Israeli military may have committed war crimes in Gaza .
The warning came as Israeli troops pressed on with the deadly offensive in defiance of a UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire .
Navi Pillay , the UN high commissioner for human rights , has called for " credible , independent and transparent " investigations into possible violations of humanitarian law , and singled out an incident this week in Zeitoun , south - east of Gaza City , where up to 30 Palestinians in one house were killed by Israeli shelling .
Pillay , a former international criminal court judge from South Africa , told the BBC the incident " appears to have all the elements of war crimes " .
The accusation came as Israel kept up its two - week - old air and ground offensive in Gaza and dismissed as " unworkable " the UN security council resolution which had called for " an immediate , durable and fully respected ceasefire " .
Protests against the offensive were held across the world yesterday just as diplomacy to halt the conflict appeared to falter .
With the Palestinian casualty toll rising to around 800 dead , including 265 children , and more than 3,000 injured , fresh evidence emerged yesterday of the killings in Zeitoun .
It was " one of the gravest incidents " since Israel 's offensive began two weeks ago , the UN office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs said yesterday .
" There is an international obligation on the part of soldiers in their position to protect civilians , not to kill civilians indiscriminately in the first place , and when they do , to make sure that they help the wounded , " Pillay told Reuters .
" In this particular case these children were helpless and the soldiers were close by , " she added .
An Israeli military spokeswoman , Avital Leibovich , said the incident was still being examined .
" We do n't warn people to go to other buildings , this is not something we do , " she said .
" We do n't know this case , we do n't know that we attacked it . "
Despite the intense bombardment , militants in Gaza fired at least 30 rockets into southern Israel yesterday .
Sami Abu Zuhri , a Hamas spokesman , told al - Jazeera TV : " This resolution does n't mean that the war is over .
We call on Palestinian fighters to mobilise and be ready to face the offensive , and we urge the Arab masses to carry on with their angry protests . "
Israeli officials said they could not be expected to halt their military operation while the rockets continued and said they first wanted an end to the rocket fire and a " mechanism " to prevent Hamas rearming in future .
" The whole idea that Israel will unilaterally stop protecting our people when Hamas is sending rockets into our cities to kill our people is not a reasonable request of Israel , " said Mark Regev , spokesman for prime minister Ehud Olmert .
Israel wanted security for its people in southern Israel , he said , and dismissed suggestions his military might seek to topple Hamas , saying they were " not in the regime - change business " .
Israeli public opinion still strongly favours the war .
One poll of Jewish Israelis yesterday , by the War and Peace Index , said 90 % of the population supported continuing the operation until Israel achieved all its goals .
Olmert held a meeting of his security cabinet , and on the agenda was discussion about whether to intensify the offensive by launching a fresh stage of attacks in which Israeli troops would invade the major urban areas of Gaza as more reservists were called up .
There was no word on the outcome .
So far 13 Israelis have been killed in this conflict , of whom three were civilians .
Another 23 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military yesterday .
Seven from one family , including an infant , died when Israeli jets bombed a five - storey building in Beit Lahiya , in northern Gaza .
There was heavy aerial bombing and artillery fire across the territory .
More than 20,000 Gazans have fled their homes in the north of the strip and thousands more in the south .
In some cases Israeli troops have told them to leave , or dropped leaflets warning them to evacuate their homes .
Some are even dividing their families between different addresses for fear of losing them all in a single air strike .
" Many people are leaving their homes and moving to the centre of the cities , " said Abdel Karim Ashour , 53 , who works with a local aid agency , the Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committee .
He , his wife and their four children fled their house on the coastal road in northern Gaza on the third day of the conflict .
He sent the four children to stay with his brother while he and his wife are staying at a friend 's house .
" We were in an area of heavy shelling , so we left and I divided the family to try to reduce the victims if we face any trouble .
We try and keep in touch by telephone but there are problems with the network , " he said .
" We 're just hoping for a ceasefire .
If the fighting goes on there will be more victims . "
The Congo rainforest , the second largest tropical forest in the world , has been handed a temporary lifeline after two - thirds of timber concessions were cancelled this week .
The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo has ripped up 91 contracts after a review of the notoriously corrupt and damaging logging sector in a country the size of Western Europe .
Greenpeace 's Africa forest expert Rene Ngongo gave a cautious welcome to the decision : " This is good news , " he said by telephone from Kinshasa .
" The contract cancellations now need to be implemented .
We hope that the Congolese government will focus on protecting our forests . "

Congo 's immense tropical forest , second only to the Amazon in size and importance , has come under increasing pressure from loggers , farmers and mining operations in recent years .
Huge concessions covering tens of millions of hectares in the war - torn country have been parcelled out to international companies during the numerous conflicts that have beset the country .
Most of these concessions adhere to no basic environmental standards and pay little or no tax to the central government , the review found .
Due to its remoteness , lack of roads and regular conflicts Congo 's rainforest had previously escaped the wanton destruction seen in countries such as Brazil and Indonesia .
However , in the last 15 years mature hard and softwoods from Congo have found their way into markets from the US to China and the EU , taking large bites out of the forest in the process .
The World Bank which has been heavily criticised for backing development policies that encouraged deforestation funded a six month review of existing concessions to establish whether they conform with basic standards .
Only 65 of some 156 deals made the grade .
DRC 's Environment Minister Jose Endundo said on Monday that those who had failed to make the grade would have to stop logging within 48 hours .
" Upon notification of the cancellation decision , the operator must immediately stop cutting timber , " he told Reuters .
The minister also said that the government would respect a moratorium put in place during the 1998 - 2003 war on new logging deals .
The world 's tropical forests form a precious cooling band around the equator which has been likened to a thermostat that helps to moderate temperatures .

Much of that forested band is under threat from changes in land use and deforestation has been identified as the second largest contributor of greenhouse gases .
In his landmark climate review , Sir Nicholas Stern identified halting deforestation as the most cost effective means of combating climate change .
Making forests worth more standing than they are cut is complicated in unstable country 's such as DRC which are beset by conflicts and a weak central government .
According to Andrew Mitchell from the UK - based Global Canopy Programme the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs and complications : " Paying African countries to keep their forests intact is like investing in a pension fund for all of us .
What 's needed is a fraction of what banks are losing every day , " he added .
Greenpeace remains concerned that fine words in Kinshasa will translate into little meaningful change in the remote interior .
" It is unclear how the government will enforce the cancellations of contracts in the field , and how the operations of the approved logging concessions will be controlled , " explained Mr Ngongo .
Even after the cancellation of licenses to scores of timber operations , more than 10 million hectares will be open to commercial logging .
This is despite recommendations to the DRC administration from their own technical working group to reduce the area to 4.4 m hectares .
In common with all the world 's great rainforests , Congo provides shelter , food and livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of the world 's poorest people .
" Local communities are angry because giant trees are taken from their forests and nothing but destruction is left behind , " Greenpeace said in a statement .
" The people of Africa stand to lose the most from climate impacts .
The government needs to save the Congo forest not only for the sake of the global climate , but for the benefit of the Congolese people who depend on it . "
The Republican Party paid a steep price for race - baiting in the presidential campaign .
Remember the ferocious backlash against the California Republican group that produced a racist newsletter depicting Barack Obama on a food stamp , surrounded by images of fried chicken and watermelon ?
Then there were those two congressmen who were rightly excoriated for condemning Mr. Obama ’s candidacy in the language of the Jim Crow South  one describing him as a “ boy ” and the other as “ uppity . ”
We thought after all that  and , oh yes , losing the election  everyone in the Republican Party leadership would have figured out that race - baiting alienates young , minority and all reasonable voters .
Clearly , not everyone has .
Chip Saltsman , a veteran political operative , is pushing his candidacy for chairman of the Republican National Committee .
He distributed a compact disc containing a parody questioning President - elect Barack Obama ’s racial authenticity .
Marisa Papen is Naked in Saint - Tropez and other Daily Links
Moral relativism , political double talk , and a military juggernaut blind to its violence against an occupied people highlight the most recent , tragic conflagration in Israel and Palestine .
In justifying Israel ’s most brutal and bloody salvo against Gaza in decades  which has so far killed nearly 400 Palestinians and wounded more than 1800  Israel ’s UN ambassador stated that Israel was “ rightfully defending itself from continued Hamas rocket attacks within her borders . ”
Furthermore , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert forewarned that the offensive “ is liable to continue for some time " and Defense Minister Ehud Barak declared it as an “ all - out war against Hamas and its branches . ”
By affirming Israel ’s " right to self defense " and supporting Israel ’s contention that the onus is on Hamas to renew the truce , President Bush ’s waning administration highlighted its remarkably predictable political incompetence and tone - deaf moral vacancy by squandering yet another precious opportunity to remedy  at least rhetorically  the festering , radioactive sore that is the Palestinian human rights crisis in Gaza and the West Bank .
Continuing to spin a broken record , his administration condones Israel ’s brazen and repeated violations of international law while simultaneously denying Palestinian human rights , at the precarious risk of destabilizing a hostile and volatile Middle East region .
It goes without saying that this sad reality fails to absolve the illegality of Palestinian violence directed against Israel and her civilians .
Hamas ’ infractions of international law should be strongly condemned by both the United States and the international community , including Arab countries , many of which espouse reactionary , anti-Semitic rhetoric .
But such actions do not justify an escalation into outright war  one in which civilian causalities are almost a certainty due to the density of Gaza  any more than the Israeli blockade of Gaza would justify suicide bombings against Israeli civilians .
The answer to a festering conflict is to take steps towards resolution , not spiral the conflict into madness .
President - elect Obama conveniently remains silent on the current hostilities ( for now ) and has thus deferred to President Bush .
Nonetheless , earlier this summer he endorsed Israel ’s right to defend itself against Qassam rockets by stating , “ If someone were sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , I would do anything to stop it . "
One wonders , however , if President elect Obama ’s principles of safety , dignity and self defense apply to Palestinians as well ?
If Obama and President Bush ’s daughters were forced to suspend their emergency hospital operations due to fuel shortages , beg for 300 essential medicines , drink contaminated water that causes malnutrition and anemia in children , eat bread made of animal feed , and renounce electricity because their main power plant was forced to shut down , what would they do ?
That hypothesis tragically exists as a reality for Gaza residents , some of the poorest people on Earth , who have survived Israel ’s nearly two - month embargo and blockade that followed another two years of frequent and devastating closures .
Chris Gunness , a spokesman for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees ( UNRWA ) , called the Gaza humanitarian crisis " disastrous " and said the agency has been unable to get needed medical supplies into Gaza for more than a year due to Israel ’s blockade of border crossings .
At AIPAC ’s annual conference last summer , in what devolved into an embarrassing competition of one - upmanship , both President - elect Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton pledged unyielding support for Israel .
Obama promised he would " never compromise when it comes to Israel ’s security " ; meanwhile , Clinton affirmed " the United States stands with Israel now and forever . ”
In order to truly act upon his promise of " change , " President - elect Obama needs to quickly revoke Israel ’s perennial carte blanche and " get out of international jail " Monopoly card for the sake of ensuring long - term American and Israeli security and eventually winning the " war on terror . "
It would bear reminding that the current US policy in Israel and Palestine is one of bin Laden ’s main justifications for his global , violent jihad against Americans and sadly remains a highly successful recruitment ploy for al - Qaeda amongst disenfranchised Muslims .
It warrants a mention that the brutality of Israel ’s policies towards Palestinians has transcended the bipolar framework of an " Arab vs. Jewish thing " and is now recognized internationally as a shameful example of human rights violations .
After visiting Israel , Archbishop Desmond Tutu , who opposed apartheid in South Africa , stated he saw " the humiliation of the Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks , suffering like us when young white police officers prevented us from moving about . "
He offered Israel would " never get true security and safety through oppressing another people . "
Commenting on Israel ’s policies in Gaza and West Bank , President Jimmy Carter controversially declared that it existed as " a system of apartheid , with two peoples occupying the same land but completely separated from each other , with Israelis totally dominant and suppressing violence by depriving Palestinians of their basic human rights . "
The United States could publicly acknowledge the lopsided and oppressive relationship existing between the nation of Israel and its Palestinian refugees by refusing to implicitly or explicitly endorse and rationalize Israel ’s latest offensive incursion as simply a “ defensive security measure . "
Yet , by continuing to vocally defend Israel as the only advocate and partner of peace while perpetually blaming Palestinians as the sole aggressor , the United States recklessly obfuscates the reality of an Israeli blitzkrieg that repeatedly bombards a beleaguered Palestinian refugee population with an inordinately superior and sophisticated military might .
This changed tone , which would reflect fairness and nuance , would also signal to the Muslim world that the US does not blindly and unconditionally endorse Israel ’s prejudicial treatment of Palestinian refugees , its building of illegal settlements on West Bank and Gaza lands , its illegal , extra judicial killings and kidnappings , and it ’s most recent gratuitous violence unleashed on Gaza civilians .
Finally , the loss of innocent Palestinian life in relation to Israeli life should not merely be treated as tragic , but necessary , " collateral damage . "
Both need to be afforded dignity and value as human beings , who are neither favored nor condemned for sake of advancing narrow - minded foreign policy initiatives and strengthening expedient political alliances .
Slumdog Millionaire Child actor beaten by father for refusing to leave shack : Realty Check ... Very Sad and shameful Act ..... From Slumdog to slapdog :
Via Daily Mail
The brutality of his slum life came back with a vengeance today for Slumdog Millionaire actor Azharuddin Mohammed when he was beaten by his father , Ismail Usnay .
The ten - year - old boy who was tired from yesterday 's long - haul flight from Los Angeles and had wanted to be left alone refused his father 's request to leave the shack and face curious onlookers .
Just days ago as one of the movie 's child stars he'd walked the Oscars red carpet in glamorous clothes but now back in the slums he was being slapped around the face .
It 's hard to imagine a future where people are nostalgic for polyester but it may be just a thing of the past .
38 million tons of synthetic fibers are made each year and some new advancements in regenerated protein make it possible to use environmentally sustainable clothing fiber instead .
So one day you may snuggle up in warm , cozy sweats made of chicken feathers or pants made of wheat - your blue jeans could be " green .
" Researchers in Australia are reporting that their new advances are paving the way for such exotic new materials made from agricultural waste or byproducts to hit store shelves as environmentally - friendly alternatives to the synthetic fabrics we now use .
They review research on the development of these next generation eco-friendly fibers , which will produce fabrics with a conventional feel , in Biomacromolecules .
Eco-friendly fabrics from renewable materials , such as chicken feathers .
Photo : American Chemical SocietyIn the article , Andrew Poole , Jeffrey Church and Mickey Huson note that scientists first produced commercial fabrics made of nontraditional materials — including milk proteins , peanuts , and corn — almost 50 years ago .
Although these so - called " regenerated " fabrics had the look and feel of conventional protein - based fabrics such as wool and silk , they tended to perform poorly when wet .
This problem , combined with the advent of petroleum - based synthetic fibers , caused the production of these unusual fabrics to stop , the researchers say .
Amid concerns about the environment and consumer demand for eco-friendly products , renewable fabrics made from nontraditional agricultural materials are now poised to make a comeback , the scientists say .
Promising fabric sources include agricultural proteins , such as keratin from scrap chicken feathers and gluten from wheat , they say .
The scientists describe advances in nanotechnology and chemical cross-linking that can improve the strength and biodegradability of these fabrics , paving the way for commercial production of eco-friendly clothing , furniture upholstery and other products .
In fiscal year 2019 , the federal government spent $ 4.4 trillion , amounting to 21 percent of the nation ’s gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
Of that $ 4.4 trillion , over $ 3.5 trillion was financed by federal revenues .
The remaining amount ( $ 984 billion ) was financed by borrowing .
As the chart below shows , three major areas of spending make up the majority of the budget :
Social Security : In 2019 , 23 percent of the budget , or $ 1 trillion , paid for Social Security , which provided monthly retirement benefits averaging $ 1,503 to 45 million retired workers in December 2019 .
Social Security also provided benefits to 3 million spouses and children of retired workers , 6 million surviving children and spouses of deceased workers , and 10 million disabled workers and their eligible dependents in December 2019 .

Social Security also provided benefits to 3 million spouses and children of retired workers , 6 million surviving children and spouses of deceased workers , and 10 million disabled workers and their eligible dependents in December 2019 .
Medicare , Medicaid , CHIP , and marketplace subsidies :
Four health insurance programs — Medicare , Medicaid , the Children ’s Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) , and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) marketplace subsidies — together accounted for 25 percent of the budget in 2019 , or $ 1.1 trillion .
Nearly three - fifths of this amount , or $ 651 billion , went to Medicare , which provides health coverage to around 61 million people who are over age 65 or have disabilities .
The rest of this category funds Medicaid , CHIP , and ACA subsidy and marketplace costs .
In a typical month , Medicaid and CHIP provide health care or long - term care to about 82 million low - income children , parents , elderly people , and people with disabilities .
( Both Medicaid and CHIP require matching payments from the states . )
In 2019 , 9.6 million of the 11.4 million people enrolled in health insurance through the ACA marketplace received subsidies that lower premiums and out - of - pocket costs , at an estimated cost of about $ 56 billion .

Defense and international security assistance : Another 16 percent of the budget , or $ 697 billion , paid for defense and security - related international activities .
The bulk of the spending in this category reflects the underlying costs of the Defense Department .
The total also includes the cost of supporting operations in Afghanistan and other related activities , described as Overseas Contingency Operations in the budget , funding for which totaled $ 77 billion in 2019 .
Two other categories together account for less than a fifth of spending :
Safety net programs : About 8 percent of the federal budget in 2019 , or $ 361 billion , supported programs that provide aid ( other than health insurance or Social Security benefits ) to individuals and families facing hardship .
Safety net programs include : the refundable portions of the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit , which assist low - and moderate - income working families ; programs that provide cash payments to eligible individuals or households , including Supplemental Security Income for the elderly or disabled poor and unemployment insurance ; various forms of in - kind assistance for low - income people , including SNAP ( food stamps ) , school meals , low - income housing assistance , child care assistance , and help meeting home energy bills ; and various other programs such as those that aid abused or neglected children .
Such programs keep millions of people out of poverty each year .
A CBPP analysis using Census ’ Supplemental Poverty Measure shows that government safety net programs kept 37 million people out of poverty in calendar year 2018 .
Without any government income assistance , either from safety net programs or other income supports like Social Security , the poverty rate would have been 24.0 percent in 2018 , nearly double the actual 12.8 percent .
And these programs reduced the depth of poverty for millions more , even when not bringing them above the poverty line .
Interest on debt :
The federal government must make regular interest payments on the money it borrowed to finance past deficits — that is , on the federal debt held by the public , which reached $ 16.8 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2019 .
In 2019 , these interest payments claimed $ 375 billion , or about 8 percent of the budget .
As the chart shows , the remaining fifth of federal spending supports a variety of other public services .
These include providing health care and other benefits to veterans and retirement benefits to retired federal employees , ensuring safe food and drugs , protecting the environment , and investing in education , scientific and medical research , and basic infrastructure such as roads , bridges , and airports .
A very small slice — less than 1 percent of the budget — goes to non-security programs that operate internationally , including programs providing humanitarian aid .
While critics often decry “ government spending , ” it is important to look beyond the rhetoric and determine whether the actual public services that government provides are valuable .
To the extent that such services are worth paying for , the only way to do so is ultimately with tax revenue .
Consequently , when thinking about the costs that taxes impose , it is essential to balance those costs against the benefits the nation receives from public services .
Appendix
Because we discuss total federal spending , we do not distinguish programs financed by general revenues from those financed by dedicated revenues ( e.g. , Social Security ) .
For more information , see Policy Basics : Federal Payroll Taxes .
We based our estimates of spending in fiscal year 2019 on the most recent historical data released by the Office of Management and Budget .
( Federal fiscal year 2019 ran from October 1 , 2018 , to September 30 , 2019 . )
The broad expenditure categories presented in this paper were constructed on the basis of classifications commonly used by budget agencies .
The categories are constructed by grouping related programs and activities into broad functions , which are further broken down into subfunctions .
The details of how the categories used in this paper were constructed from those functions and subfunctions are described below .
Social Security :
This category consists of all expenditures in the Social Security function ( 650 ) , including benefits and administrative costs .
Medicare , Medicaid , CHIP , and marketplace subsidies :
This category consists of the Medicare function ( 570 ) , including benefits , administrative costs , and premiums , as well as the “ Grants to States for Medicaid ” account , the “ Children ’s health insurance fund ” account , the “ Refundable Premium Tax Credit and Cost Sharing Reductions , ” and two other small accounts supporting the Affordable Care Act ’s marketplace subsidies ( all in function 550 ) .
Defense and international security assistance :
The largest component of this category is the national defense function ( 050 ) .
In addition , this category includes the international security assistance subfunction ( 152 ) of the international affairs function .
Safety net programs :
This category includes all programs in the income security function ( 600 ) except those in the following two subfunctions : federal employees ’ retirement and disability ( 602 ) and general retirement and disability insurance ( 601 ) .
The latter contains the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and also covers programs that provide pension and disability benefits to certain small groups of private - sector workers .
Interest on debt :
This category contains the net interest function ( 900 ) .
Remaining program areas :
This category includes all federal expenditures not included in one of the five categories defined above .
The subcomponents of this category that are displayed in the graph are defined as follows :
The Anderson Report CHAPTER 30 :
CONCLUSIONS
Its founder , with the merest smattering of knowledge in various sciences , has built upon the scintilla of his learning a crazy and dangerous edifice .
The HASI claims to be " the world 's largest mental health organization " .
What it really is however , is the world 's largest organization of unqualified persons engaged in the practice of dangerous techniques which masquerade as mental therapy .
No acceptable or recognized standards are prescribed for its practitioners , whose ignorance of orthodox medicine and psychology make them each a menace to the health of the community .
They are the more dangerous because of their spurious air of competence and the tremendous amount of mis-directed energy which has gone into promoting the organization and devising techniques , the mentally crippling qualities of which are cleverly concealed .
That many scientologists sincerely believe in the virtues and the efficacy of scientology is apparent from the evidence .
Some have become so dedicated to it and have served it so faithfully that their sacrifices cannot but excite compassion .
These ardent devotees , though quite rational and intelligent on other subjects , are possessed of an invincible impediment to reason where scientology is concerned .
If one considers self - dedication a criterion , those persons deeply involved in scientology are broadly of two kinds .
In the first place , there are professional scientologists who have forsaken many careers , interests and comforts in order to " live " scientology in every sense of the word .
Of such a kind were many of the officials of the HASI and the proprietors of the Geelong and Hawthorn centres .
~ many instances they are husband and wife teams , occasionally with young families .
Their dedication to scientology has involved great sacrifices , which , however , they were prepared to make to reach and maintain their role as the elite of a New Order .
Though they were egregiously wrong in their reasoning and outlook , though they suffered and are suffering the ignominy of exposure and ridicule , many of them are still as fanatically adherent as they were when the Inquiry began , and they are still prepared to immolate themselves for their ideals .
They spurn the pity one feels for them ; the prospect of their rescue from their deluded state is problematical , since their continued intimate association with others of a like mind will probably result in their being permanently conditioned by auditing , co-auditing and other oppressive and compelling features of the HASI machine .
Few , if any , of these dedicated scientologists whom the Board heard and saw seemed to be conscious that they were perpetrating a fraud masterminded by Hubbard .
They seemed to be deluded , mistaken and almost innocent tools .
The other class of people who have been dedicated to scientology are those who have undertaken long courses of processing and training but who have not taken up scientology as a profession , though from time to time they may have been on the HASI staff and they may have done some auditing .
While they have continued to be in communication with the HASI , their delusions and subjection to the HASI have been maintained .
Their awakening will be distressing , for they once more must face the realities of life .
As they emerge from the miasma of scientology there may be some residual effects , for Hubbard 's ideas may be so entrenched in their minds that they will still feel compelled to shun the proper medical and other treatment which they may well require .
The overall picture of scientology is thus one of grave disquiet .
In the foregoing Chapters of this Report , the Board has sought to deal as fully as the circumstances required with all relevant aspects of scientology in Victoria , and , with one exception , the matters raised in the twelve numbered paragraphs of the terms of reference have been already sufficiently discussed to make unnecessary anything more than a final comment and reference to those parts of the Report where the particular subject matter has been dealt with more extensively .
The one exception is in relation to paragraph 11 of the terms of reference which deals with scientology and children .
This aspect is not dealt with in detail earlier in the Report because no extensive evidence was forthcoming in relation to it .
Having regard to the effects which scientology processing has produced , not only on mentally disturbed adults but also on persons who were well within the range of normality , the potential danger of scientology processes to children has merely to be mentioned to be appreciated .
It remains now to comment briefly on the subject matter of the twelve numbered paragraphs of the terms of reference .
1 . The aims , objects and purposes thereof and whether it is capable of achieving to any and what extent such aims , objects and purposes .
( a) Aims , Objects and Purposes .
The professed aims , objects and purposes have about them a laudable quality .
In essence it may be said that the aim of scientology is to make the able more able .
( i) The stated purpose of the Hubbard Association of Scientologists International is " To disseminate scientology , to advance and profit its membership .
To hold the lines of data of scientology clean and clear .
To educate and process people towards the goal of a civilized age on earth second to none , and to survive on all dynamics . "
In respect of Australia , the object is to make Australia the first scientology continent or nation , but the broad objective of scientology is to clear the whole world .
( ii )
The more immediate aim of scientology is said to be to make the able more able .
This aim is variously described and presented to the public as a worthy method of improving personal efficiency ; in reality this supposed aim is the means whereby unsuspecting persons are lured into the organization to be exploited by fraudulent practices and subjected to techniques dangerous to mental health .
( iii )
In a covert way , scientology and its companion science " , dianetics , claim the ability to cure a great number of physical and mental ailments .
( i) The state of " clear " is a condition variously described and defined but may be simply expressed as free of all aberrations .
It is a condition said to be capable of being produced by scientology auditing , but it is a fanciful and imagined state of ecstacy or exhilaration .
During and for a short period after scientology auditing some few people have claimed to be clear , but the state is an illusory one .
A concomitant of this illusory state is a large measure of detachment from reality .
The state of " clear " is not attainable by scientology practices .
What is claimed to be the state of clear is an euphoric state , where the mind of the " clear " is divorced from reality .
( ii ) As to the more immediate objective of making the able more able , it must be said that scientology achieves no real success in this respect .
All but the most elementary of scientology processes are of a hypnotic nature and they are conducted in a manner calculated to have harmful effects on those subjected to them .
The effect of such processes may be to give to the individual on whom they are practised a temporary and subjective feeling of elation , but no permanent benefit is obtained and no increased abilities result .
Some claim is made that persons who have been processed obtain , in effect , a better understanding of themselves and are more able to cope with their problems , but the Board found such evidence unconvincing .
Many of the individuals who claimed to have benefited were still under the influence of processing which they had recently undergone .
At the lowest level of scientology , on what was called the personal efficiency course , the HASI conducts free lectures from which a number of individuals claimed to have benefited .
The elementary techniques practised at this stage are not exclusive to scientology , but are comparable to methods available to and used in schools , clubs and welfare and social organizations for the benefit of members and others who need and find help and comfort from companionship and friendship .
Such benefits as resulted from the personal efficiency department were not attributable to scientology processes , but to the application of well known and well understood psychological principles .
( iii ) Neither scientology nor dianetics is capable of making good the claims they make for curing physical or mental ailments .
( iv ) Far from being the boon to mankind which it claims to be , scientology and its practices are harmful .
The aims , objects and purposes are not capable of attainment .
They are fictitious aims based on fantastic and illusory theories and on techniques which are potentially , and in many cases positively , harmful to the mental health of the community .
2 . The persons and organizations by whom and the place or places at which the same is so carried on , practised , or applied .
( a) The Hubbard Association of Scientologists International , a company incorporated in Phoenix , Arizona , U.S.A. and registered in Victoria as a foreign company , has carried on , practised and applied scientology at 157- 159 Spring - street , Melbourne since about 1957 , and is still currently so engaged .
For a few years prior to 1964 , until a date in the latter part of 1964 , this company also carried on , practised and applied scientology at 2 Coates Lane , Melbourne .
161
( b) Several business names have been registered which relate to scientology activities in Victoria .
As the names of their proprietors and their addresses indicate , they are connected with the HASI .
They are :
Melbourne Test Centre , proprietor , Peter Rogers Williams Test Bureau of Australia , proprietor , Peter Rogers Williams Academy of Personal Efficiency , proprietor , Lafayette Ronald Hubbard Hubbard Guidance Centre , proprietor , Lafayette Ronald Hubbard Academy of Scientology , proprietor , Lafayette Ronald Hubbard Hubbard Communications Office , proprietor , Lafayette Ronald Hubbard .
On the 15th February , 1965 , the College of Applied Philosophy was registered , the proprietor being the Hubbard Association of Scientologists International , and the address 157- 159 Spring Street , Melbourne .
( c) Mrs Katherine Steele , formerly the proprietress of a private school at S Mount Street , Heidelberg , called " The Sylvester Co-Educational College " , practised or applied scientology on pupils in the school from about 1955 ; to what extent could not be determined .
The school subsequently closed about 1959 .
Mrs. Steele practised scientology at the above address in respect of a few children in 1960 - 61 .
Though still an ardent scientologist , she did not appear to be in practice as an auditor at the time she gave evidence in September , 1964 .
( d) Eric Bruce Lake and June Margaret Lake conducted at 68 Yarra Street , Geelong , The Australian College of Personnel Efficiency from September , 1959 .
They originally held a franchise from the HASI to practise scientology and later had the status of a district office .
They were still in practice as scientologists when they gave evidence before the Board in October , 1964 .
Prior to September , 1959 , Peter John Crundall and Phyllis Dawn Crundall had been in partnership with the Lakes in this venture .
(e) Peter Francis Gillham and Yvonne Doreen GilIham have practised scientology in partnership since the 17th February , 1959 .
They formerly carried on business under the business name of The Melbourne College of Personnel Efficiency , but since the 1st June , 1961 , the name has been The Melbourne College of Personal Efficiency .
For several years until about the 12th December , 1964 , they carried on business at 39 Riversdale Road , Hawthorn .
Thereafter , they have carried on business at 235 Camberwell Road , Hawthorn .
From the 1st June , 1961 , Peter Francis Gillham has also traded as the Hawthorn Test Centre .
( f) James Hamilton Momsen traded under the business names of The Momsen School for Marriage Education and Momsen School of Personal Efficiency at 2 Hartley Avenue , Caulfield , from the 12th April , 1960 , and the 1st July , 1960 , respectively to the 1st December , 1961 .
Thereafter he conducted and still conducts the Brahma School of Yoga at 407 Nepean Highway , Frankston .
He describes himself as a hypno- therapist and psychologist .
He studied scientology at the Hubbard organization in London in 1957 , and obtained his HPA certificate .
He does not hold a franchise from the HASI and denies that he currently practises scientology and claims to have evolved his own techniques .
He has , however , practised scientology , which has influenced the techniques he now uses .
( g ) D'Arcy Swain Hunt , of 526 St. Kilda Road , Melbourne , who advertises as a psychologist and ability consultant , claims to have obtained in 1929 the degree of Bachelor of Arts or an equivalent degree at the Stamford University , U.S.A .
His study in psychology was limited to his first year .
He qualified for the HPA certificate and was intimately associated with dianetics and scientology for several years .
He was admittedly a dianeticist and / or scientologist from about 1951 , when he arrived in Australia , until at least 1956 .
In his present business he does not now use an E - meter though he did use an E - meter up to 1956 .
His charges are £ 3 per hour .
He denies that he is now a scientologist ; however , some at least of his present procedures possess features which are found in dianetics and scientology .
For the purpose of treating some mental conditions he still considers that it would be immaterial whether the treatment be given by a scientologist or a psychologist .
(h) Roger David Meadmore and Helen McKinnell Meadmore conducted from the 1st February , 1960 , to the 26th February , 1961 , the business of Roger Meadmore and Associates , personal efficiency consultants , at 39 Riversdale Road , Hawthorn .
Thereafter , they conducted the business successively at 505 St. Kilda Road , Melbourne , and 474 St. Kilda Road , Melbourne .
They appear to have been inactive since about 1962 .
They held a franchise from the HCO and part at least of their activities was the practice of scientology , the fees for which ranged from £ 2 2s. to £ 10 10 s .
per hour .
( i) Clifford Edward John Hardy , by occupation a boilermaker , conducted at 336 Victoria - parade , East Melbourne , from the 7th April , 1960 , the business of applying and teaching scientology .
For this purpose he traded under the names of College of Ability Development arid Problem Clinic .
He appears to have had very few clients .
( j) Between 1957 and 1958 , a few people - the precise number is uncertain - endeavoured to set up in business as professional scientologists .
They do not appear to have succeeded .
162
( k) David Maxwell Tooley conducts at 21 Bourke Street , Melbourne , The American College and the Australian Centre of Applied Psychology .
This man and his businesses are dealt with at length in Chapter 29 .
3 . The methods , processes , practices , techniques , principles and treatment involved or used or applied in the carrying on , practice , or application thereof .
These aspects are dealt with extensively in preceding Chapters of this Report .
Particular reference is made to Chapter 12 , dealing with the teaching of scientology ; Chapter 13 , dealing with scientology auditing processes ; Chapter 14 , dealing with the E-meter , and Chapter 18 , dealing with the parallel between scientology and hypnotic techniques .
4 . The circumstances in which and the conditions under or in accordance with which the same is carried on , practised or applied .
Scientology is carried on , practised and applied
( a ) in lectures ; ( b ) in private session with only the student or preclear and the coach or auditor present ; ( c ) in co-auditing sessions wherein one student audits another .
A strict routine is followed in auditing sessions and frequently hypnotic techniques are employed .
The matters mentioned under this heading are dealt with extensively in Chapters 12 , 13 , 14 and 18 .
A distinction is to be drawn between -
( a ) the giving or receiving of scientology processing and ( b ) the teaching of scientology principles and practices to enable students to attain scientology qualifications and so practise on others .
The teaching of scientology is dealt with at length in Chapter 12 .
6 . The nature and amount of fees charged or remuneration received by persons or organizations engaged in the carrying on , practice , application and teaching thereof .
Fees are charged both for administering processing and training students in scientology theory and techniques .
At the HASI processing fees have varied from time to time .
The ordinary rate was £ 4 14s .
6d . per hour for processing , but in various ways concessions were available because of various memberships , &c. and also where a " package deal " was done for a course of auditing for a specified period .
For instance , an " intensive " of 25 hours was available for amounts ranging around £ 100 ; where long courses of processing were undertaken , e.g. , for 250 or 300 hours , the rate was lower , in the region of about £ 2 per hour for the hours of processing actually given .
For processing , the Geelong organization has charged fees generally ranging from 3 to 4½ guineas per hour .
For processing , the Hawthorn organization has charged up to 4½ guineas .
Other smaller charges were made for co-auditing and particular courses .
Individual auditors in " private practice " have charged various fees ranging around £ 2 2s .
per hour .
One such practitioner for a short period charged £ 10 10s .
per hour .
For training , specific charges were made for individual courses .
At the HASI , the following were the fees charged up to November , 1964
Hubbard Qualified Scientologist Course ( HQS ) £ 40 cash or £ 44 on terms Hubbard Professional Auditor Course ( HPA ) £ 140 cash or £ 160 on terms
From November , 1964 , the scale was
Hubbard Qualified Scientologist £ 75 Hubbard Certificated Scientologist £ 75 Hubbard Professional Auditor £ 75 Hubbard Clearing Scientologist ( a course in contemplation ) £ 100
163
The actual amounts charged for processing and training were infinitely variable , the figures given being either the advertised , standard or normal figures .
A negligible amount of training was done at the Geelong and Hawthorn organizations .
For six years to the 30th June , 1963 , the income of the HASI was £ 273,373 .
Full details of the financial position of the HASI and of the Geelong and Hawthorn organizations appear in Chapter 5 .
7 . The instruments , machines , devices or other apparatus used in the carrying on , practice , or application thereof and the manner of use of and the effectiveness of the same .
The only instrument , device or apparatus used is an electrical instrument called an E - meter , for which fantastic claims are made that it records the reaction of the thetan to questions asked .
In practice , the preclear holds two electrodes attached to the meter and is thus part of the circuit the auditor asks the preclear questions and the claim is made that the meter records the reaction of the preclear 's reactive mind .
A variety of deductions are then drawn from the reading of the meter .
In reality , the E - meter is akin to a lie detector and is an efficient instrument for recording electrical resistance , and nothing more .
The claims made for the E- meter are entirely unjustified .
This subject is dealt with at length in Chapter 14 .
8 . The illnesses or ailments , mental or physical , treated in the course of the carrying on , practice or application thereof , the effectiveness of such treatment , and whether such treatment is in any way harmful or beneficial or likely to be harmful or beneficial to the persons treated .
(a) The claim is made for dianetics , which is part of scientology , and inferentially for the whole of scientology , that between them they can positively cure all psychosomatic ailments , which it is claimed represent 70 per cent .
of man 's illnesses .
( b) These claims are entirely unjustified .
( c) On the contrary , scientology techniques , beyond the elementary stages , are potentially and , in some instances , positively harmful to mental health .
(d) Scientology is practised by " auditors " who have no medical training ; they use dangerous techniques ; they are unable to recognize symptoms and diagnose particular mental and physical conditions of ill health ; they indiscriminately apply dangerous techniques irrespective of the circumstances ; they not only administer the wrong treatment , but also poison their patients ' minds against orthodox medicine and thus prevent them from obtaining proper medical treatment which they may require .
These aspects are dealt with in Chapters 19 , 22 and 23 .
9 . The advertisements used in the carrying on , practice , or application thereof and whether the same have been in any and what manner false or misleading , and whether the same should be prohibited , regulated , or restricted in any and what way .
With few exceptions , in recent years the advertisements addressed to the public generally in the press , pamphlet and preliminary brochure have been confined to offering free lectures , with " no obligation " and " no financial obligation " , and promising to make the able more able , to increase confidence , improve IQ and personality , &c .
These advertisements have not mentioned advanced scientology theory or techniques , but have been of the " personal efficiency " kind , appealing to the anxious , worried , lonely and ambitious .
Such advertisements are part of a large scale deception , and are designed to inveigle unsuspecting persons into the organization , where high pressure techniques are designed to coerce the gullible ..
In advertisements with a more limited distribution addressed to scientologists and to persons on mailing lists , reference is made to scientology processing and courses , and extravagant claims for scientology and dianetics in relation to healing and to attaining the states of clear and OT are common .
These advertisements appear in such documents as the monthly Melbourne HASI magazine Communication , which frequently contains articles by Hubbard .
The advertisements are false in that they offer the impossible and unattainable goals of scientology , promising attainment through scientology processing .
Books by Hubbard and others on scientology and dianetics are available at the HASI and at some booksellers for purchase by the general public .
These books are , of course , a form of advertising of Hubbard 's " sciences " .
Several of these books deal with advanced features of scientology and dianetics .
Advertising by the HASI is dealt with in Chapter 15 .
The question of prohibition , regulation or restriction of such advertisements is dealt with in Chapter 31 , where the broad topic of advertising generally is considered .
164
10 .
Whether persons or organizations engaged in the carrying on , practice , or application thereof have indulged in any and what unlawful , improper , harmful or prejudicial practices or activities .
This term of reference was taken to refer to the practices of scientology and the activities of scientologists qua scientologists .
In scientology there is a very great scope for coercion .
Very intimate matters are revealed by preclears in the course of auditing and records are kept by the organization of such revelations .
There was no evidence that blackmail in the legal sense had been practised ; but the basis for such criminal activity exists in the files of the organization and preclears could readily be criminally exploited , though at this stage there is no evidence that it has happened .
However , that coercive use is made of the incriminating confessions contained in the HASI records is undoubted .
These confessions , which are often of secret weaknesses and feelings , misconduct and prurient ambitions , are made in such circumstances that the organization develops domination over preclears .
The nature of the coercive use to which the HASI records could be put is dealt with in Chapter 24 .
Though the practice of scientology has many undesirable features , such is the novelty of many of its activities that it is difficult to classify them precisely as being in breach of existing laws .
That scientology practices and activities are improper and are harmful and prejudicial to mental health is evident .
This is the most important and most serious feature of the practice of scientology .
It is a large subject , and is the burden of most of this Report ; it is dealt with especially in Chapter 23 .
11 . Whether children under the age of sixteen years have been treated by any and what persons or organizations in the carrying on , practice , or application thereof the circumstances and conditions under which such children have been treated and whether such treatment has been or was likely to be in any and what manner harmful or beneficial .
The application of scientology processing to children does not appear to have developed in Victoria to any substantial extent .
What seemed to be half - hearted attempts were made to establish Saturday morning classes for children both at the HASI in Melbourne and at Geelong .
These classes dealt with only the most elementary procedures , which were not novel or exclusive to scientology and were designed to do little more than teach children to mix and play games ; they were psychological techniques and were of a kindergarten nature .
At the Melbourne HASI , Saturday morning classes were conducted from 1961 to late 1962 about 15 to 20 children at a time , aged 8 to 14 years , attended .
Saturday morning shoppers rather used the HASI as a creche .
These classes were not successful ; the children exhausted the auditors and the classes were discontinued .
The evidence showed that in a few instances children with one or both parents in scientology received scientology processing .
They received such processing with the approval of at least one parent .
The number of children involved was small , the techniques do not appear to have been advanced and the Board did not hear evidence that in fact harm did result from such processing .
It appeared from the evidence that one scientologist , Mrs. Katherine Steele , who conducted a private school , introduced scientology techniques into her establishment .
Some of these techniques were potentially harmful , though the Board heard no evidence that lasting harm was done to any student at the school .
Parents of students became aware of and apparently alarmed by the practices being engaged in , and the school closed .
Mrs. Steele also had as private clients a few children to whom she applied scientology techniques .
Mrs. Steele was herself " addicted " to past experiences involving extraordinary encounters with electrical phenomena ; she claimed , amongst other things , to have been struck by lightning at least twice ; her peculiar acquaintance with electricity was reflected in past experiences which her suggestible child preclears revealed when she processed them .
The Board did not hear any evidence of permanent harm to these particular preclears .
The Board heard evidence from a school teacher from South Australia , a woman dedicated to her task of teaching brain - damaged children , who gave evidence of some success she had at such work by the use of what she claimed were scientology techniques .
However , from the evidence of an expert psychologist of wide experience both in Australia and abroad , it is evident that the methods claimed to be scientological are well known and commonly practised in various parts of the world .
They are not in any way the discovery of scientology , but are virtually identical with principles and methods which were known and developed before scientology existed .
As already mentioned , the alleged scientology methods of handling young children are those of school and kindergarten psychology .
The Board heard no evidence of alleged scientology treatment being applied to brain - damaged children in Victoria .
165
As to older children under sixteen years , the Board heard very little evidence .
Though the public was invited to come forward with any helpful evidence , there was no public response as to the teaching of scientology to children , and the Board on this aspect had to rely , in the main , on evidence of scientologists and the contents of a very few files .
However , there seems to be no reason to suppose that the application of scientology to children in Victoria assumed any substantial proportions ; and , except in cases where a parent is a scientologist , it is probable that children are not now being brought into contact with scientology .
However , scientology is potentially the same danger to children as to adults , and the absence of positive evidence may well be due to the fact that the practice of scientology in relation to children has been desultory and negligible in Victoria .
There is no reason to suppose that its application to children has been in any way beneficial .
A former Chief Probation Officer of the Children 's Court , about eight years ago , investigated scientology sufficiently to satisfy himself that it was of no value in treating child delinquents .
Of four delinquent children who had some treatment by scientologists , one appeared to obtain some benefit , one lapsed into criminal habits and no information was available as to the other two .
The techniques applied were elementary and were not novel to scientology .
12 . The terms and conditions under which and the circumstances in which persons are engaged for employment and employed by persons or organizations carrying on , practising or applying the same .
In Victoria , the Melbourne HASI at 157- 159 Spring Street , Melbourne , was the only substantial employer of labour .
The Geelong and Hawthorn organizations were each a husband - and - wife partnership whose staff establishments were very small ; on the occasions when staff was employed , generally only nominal payments were made ; some of the help was even voluntary .
At the Melbourne HASI , the staff was remunerated on a unit basis , each member being allotted a particular number of units according to the position which he or she held .
Staff was paid each week according to the number of units held .
The amount available for distribution amongst the unit holders was a fixed percentage of each week 's receipts .
it was a variable amount and the unit value varied accordingly .
There were thus good and bad weeks .
At the beginning of the Inquiry the staff of the HASI numbered approximately 70 , some full - time and others part - time .
The most senior and highest ranking in the organization were receiving an average of about £ 17 per week , and other full - time employees were receiving about £ 11 per week .
Part - time employees were , of course , receiving less .
A few appear to have been voluntary .
Frequently , the weekly wage of an individual staff member fell far below the basic wage .
By mid-November , 1964 , the staff of the HASI was only about one third of what it had been at the beginning of the Inquiry , and the unit had fallen to 1s .
9d .
At that time the chief executive officers of the HASI were averaging about £ 5 per week or less .
Some may have been receiving slightly in excess of this amount by performing the duties of more than one position .
The remuneration of the HASI staff was not liberal .
Long hours were frequently worked weekend work was common .
Hubbard appears to have made it a practice to increase staff whenever the financial position of the HASI improved , thereby perpetuating the depressed rate of remuneration .
Further details of remuneration appear in Chapters 5 and 17 .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
If you believe our leaders , we can't find anyone to reform the financial system other than tax evaders and undistinguished and overpaid career regulators .
When Robert Rubin explains away the financial crisis by saying " nobody was prepared for this " we have to just shrug and accept it .
See full story .
How else could we end up getting such yawn - inducing candidates as Tim Geithner , who was confirmed as Treasury Secretary late Monday , Mary Schapiro for the Securities and Exchange Commission , Dick Parsons as chairman of Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % and Neel Kashkari holding the keys to the bailout vault ?
Neither the old or new administration has inspired much confidence with its picks for top jobs .
They are flawed candidates , each with a history that requires the public to grit its teeth , hold its nose and hope for the best .
Maybe in four years we 'll be tipping our hats , wondering why we did n't buy brokerage ETFs KCE , - 0.42 % , but until then we are left to wonder why President Obama has overlooked bankers with far better pedigrees for top jobs .
No , we 're not just talking pie - in - the - sky candidates such as Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM , - 0.84 % , but real candidates who would be willing to take reform roles .
What follows is an admittedly incomplete list .
No massive search was done to come up with these three names .
But if I can come up with these people off the top of my head , why can't anyone in Washington find these guys ?
John Allison
The chairman of BB&T Corp. BBT , not only led his bank through the dicey mortgage waters , but has been drafted as a populist hero for his stand against the government 's banking bailout .
It was Allison who wrote a stinging letter to Congress on Sept. 23 , arguing that the contemplated bailout would reward poorly managed banks at the expense of properly managed banks like Winston - Salem , N.C. - based BB&T .
Allison , 58 , urged some controversial reforms like the elimination of " fair value " accounting , but as someone who built BB&T into one of the top 15 - biggest banks by assets in the U.S. market during the last 30 years , and largely avoided the toxic mortgage mess , his record is hard to debate .
Plus , he does n't mince words .
" The primary beneficiaries of the proposed rescue are Goldman Sachs GS , - 1.14 % and Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % , " Allison wrote .
" The Treasury has a number of smart individuals , including Hank Paulson .
However , Treasury is totally dominated by investment bankers .
They do not have knowledge of the commercial banking industry . "
Allison retired as chief executive at yearend .
The bank is in the capable hands of Kelly King , whom Allison groomed for years as his successor .
The only question I 'd have for Allison is if he wanted to run the Treasury or the Fed .
Dick Kovacevich
Once Allison has picked his job , the smart thing to do would be to bring in Kovacevich , who like Allison has relinquished day - to - day control at Wells Fargo Corp .
WFC , - 2.35 % , in San Francisco , and has settled into a role as chairman .
Wells made its big splash by agreeing to acquire a near - failed Wachovia Corp. last year .
A lot of people made much of the fact Wells Fargo avoided the need of government backing and was willing to pay a decent premium , $ 15.1 billion when announced in October .
I like Wells and Kovacevich , 65 , for other reasons .
For one , Wells has reported a $ 6.7 billion profit during the last four quarters ending Sept. 30 .
Wells has improved its Tier 1 Capital levels .
It 's avoided toxic paper .
It 's getting its message across : customers who have fled troubled competitors are putting their cash with Wells .
This success is largely due to Kovacevich who served as CEO from 1998 to 2007 , and did n't bow to pressure even though rivals such as Countrywide and Washington Mutual were growing their mortgage operations faster than Wells Fargo earlier in the decade .
Ralph Babb
Finally , a nod to Ralph Babb , the 60 - year - old chairman and chief executive of Dallas - based Comerica Inc. CMA , - 2.12 % .
Babb is n't even as well known as the other banking executives , and to be honest , he 's a mystery to us who follow Wall Street in the Northeast .
But if there 's anything that recommends him , it is this : Comerica is the biggest bank in Michigan .
Knowing what 's happening to the auto industry , how it lost tens of thousands of jobs , is there anyone who is n't impressed that Comerica made nearly $ 200 million during the last 12 months ?
Here 's another reason to bring him to Washington : the bank only had $ 133 million in charge offs in the fourth quarter on a balance sheet of more than $ 65 billion , and that was double the rate of a year ago .
Analysts , such as Peter Winter at Bank of Montreal , note with a hint of astonishment that credit has held better at Comerica than many of its competitors .
Consider that unemployment in Michigan is now about 10 % and the state lost 30,000 jobs in October and November alone , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Sure , Comerica has had trouble .
Babb had to cut jobs .
Profits fell to just $ 3 million in the fourth quarter .
He 's been criticized for abandoning Detroit , where the bank had been based for more than 150 years .
And given economic conditions , Babb and Comerica are definitely going to have a tough 2009 .
Popular or not , Babb has done enough that he would merit an interview in my book .
Smart , or look smart
Though they did n't have the senior positions our three top candidates had , there are some other people out there who saw this financial crisis coming and ought to be rewarded by getting a chance to lead us out of the woods .
It 's a group that includes people like Christopher Wood , a chief strategist a Credit Lyonaisse 's Asia brokerage who told investors to get out of the U.S. mortgage securities market in 2005 and to sell U.S. and European banks in 2007 .
It includes Peter Schiff , a regular on business TV shows , who warned against a real estate collapse .
Alone , that prediction was hardly unique , but what set Schiff apart was what he forecast as the fallout : deep recession , credit crunch and bank failures .
Yes , that sounds familiar .
Charles Schwab has n't done too badly either .
His firm has prospered even though it did n't build and package mortgage , asset or commercial mortgage - backed securities .
Charles Schwab Co. SCHW , - 1.16 % simply is a retail brokerage .
Imagine that .
And how about Paris Welch ?
She was the mortgage lender who wrote U.S. regulators in 2006 warning them about lax lending standards .
" Expect fallout , expect foreclosures , expect horror stories . "
There is one knock on all of these candidates : none has any significant government experience .
Of course , judging by the government 's performance , you already knew that .
After seeing countless “ worst - mom ” pictures on the Internet , I feel this book is a must have for any new parent .

The pope has sparked controversy by saying defending heterosexuality is as important as saving the world 's rainforests from destruction .
Speaking in a holiday address to the Curia , the Vatican 's central administration , Benedict said yesterday the church viewed the distinction between men and women as central to human nature , and " asks that this order , set down by creation , be respected " .
The church , he said , " should protect man from the destruction of himself .
A sort of ecology of man was needed , he said , " adding : " The tropical forests do deserve our protection ; but man , as a creature , does not deserve any less . "
Benedict focused his attack on what he described as " gender " theories , " which lead towards the definitive emancipation of man from creation and the creator " .
Homosexual groups in Italy called the speech an unfounded attack on homosexuality and , more specifically , on people who undergo sex changes .
" What keeps the pope awake at night is the idea that human beings might be able to seek out their own sexual identity in a bid to have a happy life , " said Franco Grillini , head of Gaynet .
" The speech has no scientific basis , " said Aurelio Mancuso , head of Arcigay .
" A divine programme for men and women is out of line with nature , where the roles are not so clear . "
The Catholic church teaches that while homosexuality is not sinful , homosexual acts are .
It opposes gay marriage , and in October a leading Vatican official called homosexuality " a deviation , an irregularity , a wound " .
Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said today that the pope had not wished specifically to attack homosexuality or sex change operations in his speech .
" He was speaking more generally about gender theories which overlook the fundamental difference in creation between men and women and focus instead on the role of cultural conditioning , " he said .
Mike Egan , chair of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement , said : " It 's all part of a fundamental mistake , to say that there 's something abnormal about homosexuality .
It 's like being left - handed .
There are much greater threats to marriage and family life .
" There are people among bishops and clergy who think the official line on homosexuality is not true and the more official pronouncements there are , the deeper the hole the church is digging for itself .
I would say to gay Catholics , the man is right on lots of other things and hang on in there . "
Catholic bishops in England and Wales are encouraging a more pastoral approach to homosexuals .
Last month they issued a leaflet urging clergy and parishioners to welcome and respectful of gay men and lesbians .
Its reading list did not include Vatican statements and omitted papal documents denouncing homosexuality .
The leaflet was called , " What is life like if you or someone in your family is gay or lesbian in their sexual orientation ?
... and what can your parish family do to make a difference ? "
It acknowledged the " oppression " suffered by homosexuals .
" As a group that has suffered more than its share of oppression and contempt , the homosexual community has a particular claim on the concern of the church , " it said .
The leaflet cited comments received during a survey suggesting that the church acknowledged it may have played a role in victimising and marginalising gay and lesbian Catholics .

The Kiwi dominance is set to be cemented this year , with consumers to benefit from more discounting , fuelled by a grape glut across the Tasman .
Quality whites that once cost nearly $ 20 will sell for less than $ 10 .
New AC Nielsen data , due out this week , is expected to show that by value , sauvignon blanc sales soared above $ 300 million , pipping chardonnay .
Retail sales figures reveal that 23.5 million litres of sauvignon blanc and sauvignon blanc mixes were sold to September last year , compared to chardonnay 's 22.5 million .
The surge in sav blanc follows a 40 per cent increase in demand for the wine last year , and a 10 per cent decrease for chardonnay .
The speed at which sav blanc has sneaked up has surprised everyone , except the New Zealanders .
Their Marlborough region sauvignon blanc — so fresh and herbaceous — dominates sales of the variety in this country , leaving local producers in the shade .
Three of the five top - selling white wines in this country ( of any grape variety ) hail from the region .
The biggest selling white wine in Australia is Oyster Bay Marlborough sauvignon blanc , which has come from nowhere six years ago to about $ 40 million in retail sales , with 1.7 million litres of the wine poured down Australian throats last year .
Unable to compete , Australian makers of sav blanc are now in the invidious position of watching another country change our national taste in white wine .
Some , such as winemaker Phillip Casella of Casella Wines ( makers of the mega - successful yellow tail ) , believe it 's a case of generational change .
What can you do ?
" People today do n't want to drink what their parents drank and their parents drank chardonnay , " he says .
Others believe that chardonnay has dropped its guard — and its quality — and let sav blanc pinch its turf .
All that oaky flavour , that richness , that tropical peachiness , has become so boring .
" Sauvignon blanc is such a refreshing drink and a lot of standard price chardonnay does n't deliver that fresh and zing , " explains wine buyer Grant Ramage .
The highly influential Mr Ramage , national business manager of wine for the Coles group of wine retailers , including Liquorland , Vintage Cellars and First Choice , has seen sales of sauvignon blanc skyrocket in the past four years but predicts the show is far from over .
Mr Ramage sees no reason why a $ 5 cleanskin could not be far away .
Expect Marlborough sauvignon blanc to also start popping up in litre bottles and even by the wine cask .
" Last year the average price was around $ 13 a bottle ; this year it will be $ 8 to $ 9 a bottle on average , " he says .
The Marlborough 2008 harvest was 195,000 tonnes , up from 121,000 tonnes the previous year .
The '09 vintage is on track to set another record .

( CNN ) --
An 11 - year - old boy is facing adult charges in the shooting death of his father 's pregnant girlfriend , authorities said Saturday .
Police say Kenzie Marie
Houk 's daughter found her shot to death in her bed on Friday .
Police say the boy shot Kenzie Marie Houk , who was eight months pregnant , once at point - blank range in her farmhouse in western Pennsylvania .
The boy , whose name was withheld by CNN because he is a juvenile , was charged with one count each of criminal homicide and homicide of an unborn child in the death of Houk , 26 , Lawrence County District Attorney John Bongivengo told CNN .
Houk 's 4 - year - old daughter found her in her bed Friday , according to police .
The child alerted landscapers working near the home , who then called authorities .
Watch a community in shock »
" This is something that you would n't even think of in your worst nightmare , that you 'd have to charge an 11 - year - old with homicide , " Bongivengo said , according to CNN affiliate WTAE .
" It 's heinous , the whole situation . "
Under Pennsylvania law , anyone over the age of 10 accused of murder or homicide is charged as an adult .
If convicted , the boy faces a maximum sentence of life in prison , Bongivengo said .
Authorities said the boy is the son of the victim 's live - in boyfriend at the home in Wampum , about 35 miles northwest of Pittsburgh .
" At this point , we do n't believe it 's accidental , " Bongivengo said .
The weapon was a youth model 20 - gauge shotgun , designed for use by children , that belonged to the boy , according to investigators .
Bongivengo told reporters the household has no history of child abuse , but that an investigation is ongoing .
Calls to the boy 's public defender , Dennis Elisco , went unanswered Saturday .
CNN 's Chloe Melas and Kristin Hamill contributed to this report .
To kickstart some new levels for Yo - Frankie I have decided to run a six week competition to create new levels for the game .
These can then be included in a future release of YoFrankie , which will include updates for the next blender release and bugfixes .
Goal : Create a great new level for YoFrankie based on the following criteria …
Level design ( the level should be fun to run around , explore , and play in )
Game play ( playing the level from start to finish should be engaging )
Good graphics quality ( nice textures / materials / scenery )
Bonus Points for …
Efficiency – Creative use of existing Yo Frankie assets ( textures / materials / models / sounds ) .
Replay value – Come up with a way that makes your level fun to play again and again !
Puzzles –
Its possible to create puzzles with no programming ( pushing blocks about , spring boxes , moving platforms )
2 player features ( when the level is extra fun to play with or against a friend )
No Bonus Points for …
Slow level logic / python scripts
Level running slower then existing YoFrakie levels ( level_1_home )
Starting Date : January 16th , 2009
Deadline : February 28th , 2009
First Prize 250 Euro
Second Prize 150 Euro
Third Prize 100 Euro
( Payment via PayPal )
Notes
You may focus mostly on one area , awesome graphics , great puzzles , fun 2 player , challenging platforms to glide between etc .
This project should be something a non technical artist can finish .
You can make a level without adding any logic bricks or scripts , the players have their own logic , so you can get by with knowing 3 - 4 property names to assign to different level objects – see the wiki for details .
Your level does n’t need to use GLSL materials ( old texface materials are ok too ) .
This level will eventually be included with other levels , start by adding your level to the “ levels ” directory , and reuse existing groups where possible .
Even if you do n’t win , your level can still be included in the next release of YoFrankie .
This is not an official Blender Foundation competition , see my contact details below .
To get updated YoFrankie files from Subversion see projects.blender.org / projects/yofrankie
( includes some texture updates but not a requirement for making your level )
Your not limited to a woodland theme , however if you want to add a new world type ( space , ice , underground etc ) , your giving yourself a bigger project .
No age limit on participating .
Judging
I ’ll run a community vote on blender artists , however I ’ll decide on the final outcome if it seems biased in some way or if people are not able to test levels .
Rules
Collaboration is fine , but I ’ll only accept an entry from a single person .
Final level must be under 100 mb compressed ( excluding existing assets ) .
No modifications to the player logic ( jump height , glide distance etc ) – bug fixes are an exception .
Your level must be under the same creative commons license as all existing YoFrankie levels .
No node based materials ( just use material - textures for more efficient shaders )
You can enter more then one level
Level cannot have been entered into a previous competition
Guidelines
Texture dimensions should be one of 1024 , 512 , 256 , 128 etc .
With a maximum of 1024 ×1024 , ( Animated textures and shadowmaps are an exception , can be 2048 × 2048 )
I ’m purposefully leaving the poly count undefined , use the existing levels as a reference for polygon density and try to minimize the use of alpha sorted faces .
Level size should be somewhere between the lava level and level_1 _home – 20 ×20 to 120 ×120 blender units .
Uploading
There is an open ftp space on blender.org .
It works like this :
ftp to : download.blender.org
user : anonymous
password : your email address
When logged in , go to the directory ‘ incoming ’ .
What you put there is visible here :
http://download.blender.org/ftp/incoming/
This upload space deletes all old files after a couple of weeks , so do n’t use it for permanent storage .
Once you have uploaded your level email me and I ’ll move it to a permanent location .
Useful resources for level editing
An overview of the game logic used in Yo Frankie ! can be found on the wiki , which describes in detail things like properties in the game , character and level logic , camera , splash effects and more .
Video tutorial on how to create your own level using the level template ( library .
blend found in the levels folder )
I ’ll answer questions on the thread , but you can mail me personally too .

* Update * the most useful feedback is taking place on the blenderartist thread
* Update * Competition starts today , added ftp upload information , good luck !
Clyde Nishimura got these great shots of Vlad the sloth being tormented by a curious baby golden lion tamarind .
The confrontation went down a little over a month ago at the National Zoo .
The Golden Lion Tamarin ( Leontopithecus rosalia ) also known as Golden Marmoset , is a small New World monkey of the family Cebidae .
Native to the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil , the Golden Lion Tamarin is an endangered species with an estimated wild population of " more than 1,000 individuals " and a captive population maintained at approximately 490 individuals .
And at the end of five years after all those hours , I felt I had acquired the kind of clinical confidence that comes from having done all the required major and minor operations of my field , and from having participated in the pre-operative and post - operative care of those patients .
I finished my residency as a fully trained surgeon comfortable not only with taking out a gallbladder and removing a tumor , but also with operating on the wide range of individuals who might walk through my office door and caring for almost any of their complications or complexities .
That level of comfort came from the hours I put into my training and the experiences I acquired .
I agree that exhaustion is not good for residents , or for patients , and that an increased emphasis on patient safety and the importance of sleep is clearly needed in the medical profession .
But I ca n’t help but wonder if we may also risk losing something by trying , prematurely perhaps , to fit the unpredictability of the illness experience and the individuality of human relationships into a scheduling grid that has little proven efficacy .
Some of the Institute of Medicine ’s recommendations are simply part of good patient care .
Supervision by experienced physicians is always critical , and the more supervision , the better .
It makes sense , too , that we need to pay close attention to the process of transferring patient responsibility , the “ handover , ” and that residents should spend less time with non-educational work , such as retrieving X - rays and scheduling tests .
But it ’s unclear to me that we are doing the best by our patients , and ourselves , by reaffirming the 80 - hour cap , as the Institute of Medicine committee report has done .
Yes , fewer hours overall and a mandatory five - hour sleep break during long shifts would likely be helpful , but we are not even completely sure that setting a weekly limit of 80 hours will do what we think or hope it might do .
Instead , perhaps we should put the $ 1.7 billion dollars per year that would be required for the institute ’s recommendations into research first on our current situation .
There is , as the expert panel was quick to concede , little conclusive data on the effects of the current residency duty hour limits .
In fact , there have been few , if any , large - scale studies on how strictly residency programs have followed the 2003 mandate ; which scheduling adjustments have worked , or have not ; how the quality of resident education might have been affected ; and , most importantly , exactly how patient safety may or may not have been compromised .
As Dr. Michael M. E. Johns , chairman of the expert panel , remarked at a public briefing on the report on Tuesday , “ While the science on sleep and human performance provided a rich evidence base for duty hour adjustment , there was limited data on the impact of the 2003 limits on actual hours worked , scheduling practices , education and patient safety . ”
In other words , in the realm of resident duty hours reform , there is n’t really enough information to make solid evidence - based recommendations .
In fact , the much - touted cap of 80 hours is hardly based on scientific evidence or extensive testing .
In a letter last year to The Journal of the American Medical Association , Dr. Bertrand Bell , who was crucial in getting residency reforms passed in the 1980s , wrote , “ The specific ’ 80 - hour week ’ was actually determined by a colleague on my porch and was based on the following informal reasoning .... ”
That reasoning included , as Dr. Bell continued in the letter , the idea that “ it is reasonable for residents to work a 10 - hour day for 5 days a week [ and ] it is humane for people to work every fourth night . ”
After a series of mathematical calculations , his colleague came up with the now hallowed figure .
And “ eureka , ” Dr. Bell wrote , “ that equals an 80 - hour week . ”
First off , I ’d like to congratulate noel and everyone else who has gotten into graduate schools thus far .
Considering the economy , applications are up and it ’s even more competitive than ever .
However , I have had some friends get rejected and start to freak out , which is of course , natural , and I asked , why do you want to go to graduate school ?
I got the response : I want to be a professor .
Okay , I said , of what ?
Um ..a research professor , she said .
Okay …why ?
The pause really didnt come to me as a surprise .
Yes , the economy is bad right now .
However , graduate school should not be looked at as a way of escaping the real world .
Grad school is hard , you will feel stupid , you will be frustrated and there will be multiple times you want to quit .
But , but .. Boyie , I < 3 chemistry .
Bull .
Crap .
Maybe 1 % of the people in graduate school love chemistry .
People have multiple reasons for doing it , and most dont involve loving chemistry , but the thing is , most people who eventually succeed have / STRONG / motivations to do it .
But , but …Boyie , I ’m smart , isnt graduate school the next logical step ?
Again , I have seen LOTS of smart people drop out .
Why ?
Various reasons such as “ I just didnt think it was right for me ” , “ I felt stupid ” , “ I dont want to spend 5 years working on the same problem ” , and “ I just dont like research . ”
All those answers are things that could have been avoided .
I am fortunate enough to attend a prestigious program and I know people would kill for the slots that have just opened up as a result of people dropping out .
So really , think about why you want to go to graduate school .
When I was applying , my father and my undergraduate research advisors asked me the following questions as a reflection of sorts to see if I had the strength of will to make it .
So , I present to you , the questions I was asked .
1 ) Why chemistry ?
2 ) Why graduate school ?
3 ) What do you see yourself doing in 5 , 10 , 15 years ?
4 ) Is a PhD really required for that ?
5 ) Again , why graduate school ?
6 ) What do you like about research ?
7 ) Name five influential people in your chosen field .
8 ) What did they do ?
9 ) What do you want to contribute to science ?
10 ) What do you want to contribute to chemistry ?
11 ) Are you okay with feeling stupid ?
12 ) Are you okay with slamming your head against a wall ?
13 ) Finally , why graduate school in chemistry ?
Yes , there were 13 questions , three repeat , but looking back on it it ’s a very important question .
So , for those of you about to enter , I highly recommend doing this exercise .
Be honest with yourself for the answers , and g’luck !
The talk is all of stimuli and other matters economic  how do we re-inflate the balloon of American prosperity ?
Reality has taken a hat - pin to it , and trillions have gone up in the smoke of foreclosed mortgages and credit - default swaps .
Panaceas are not lacking .
Paul Krugman says it does n’t matter what we spend our money on , as long as we throw it away rapidly and without forethought .
I have no doubt that soon we ’ll be hearing the ghost of Huey Long promising " Every man a king ! "
I fully expect the Townsend Plan to come back at some point , along , perhaps , with a revival of interest in pre-Leninist forms of Marxism .
Along these lines , President Obama and his party have come up with a " stimulus package , " and I must pause to remark how important language is to these people .
It ’s a " package , " you see , just like a Christmas gift , only better , because they , the politicians , get to play Santa Claus and shower their constituents with presents .
This legislative larceny is predicated on the oddly counterintuitive notion that we can and should spend our way out of poverty  that the sins of our profligacy can be forgiven if only we indulge in yet more ravenous forms of gluttony .
To ordinary Americans , this kind of Washington - think is wholly alien : it is Bizarro economics .
After all , when normal human beings are in financial trouble they cut back on their spending , as they are doing now .
The American polity , in its younger days , would naturally apply the same logic to government , but , in our dotage , we impart magical powers to the organs of the state , which can produce wealth out of thin air , with only the aid of a printing press .
Oh , yes , we understand  albeit vaguely  that this is debt for future generations to pay .
Yet we recall  even more vaguely  old bromides like " We owe it to ourselves , " which are embedded in our collective memory like flies in amber , and we are reassured .
Putting aside Bizarro economics , for now , and my wholesale rejection of same , there is one way we can stimulate the economy with a mighty injection of cash into the hands of one and all .
No , not another government subsidy , but the cutting of the single largest federal expenditure down to a manageable size : the U.S. military budget .
Larger than all the other " defense " budgets in the world combined , this unimaginable sum is not even known , for sure , but of one thing we can be certain : the hidden costs are much more than anyone suspects .
Covert " black operations " are run on an off - the - books budget that we peons are not entitled to see .
Consuming nearly half of all government spending , the military budget maintains an overseas empire unrivaled in the history of the world .
The U.S. operates a network of bases in dozens of countries , on every continent .
The Pentagon is the biggest landowner on earth .
This is not only tremendously expensive , but also completely unnecessary and even harmful to our national interests .
Why , for example , do we need bases in Germany , of all places ?
They are there on account of a war fought a generation ago , and they stayed because of a perceived threat from the Soviets that vanished into history along with Stalin ’s ghost .
The hidden costs of empire are not limited to the CIA ’s secret slush funds  a much greater proportion of this sum amounts to invisible yet all too real opportunity costs , lost avenues of investment that were , instead , diverted to the military - industrial complex .
Militarism distorts not only the economy , but also the progress of science , which is channeled in directions that are wholly destructive , rather than productive .
Yes , it ’s true that military applications have often spun off useful byproducts , but if the original aim and intent of scientific research were directly applied to productive and pacific civilian projects , it ‘s reasonable to expect the results would have been far more fruitful .
The reason for the huge outlay in military expenditures has nothing to do with America ’s national security : after all , we do n’t even inspect all the cargo coming into our ports .
How concerned with real security are we , anyway ?
Not very .
What matters , in this game , is the financial security of certain economic interests , as well as the ideological agendas of pressure groups within U.S. society .
The Pentagon establishment wants to start building a new generation of nuclear weapons , over some opposition in the Obama administration .
That these weapons only add to the danger of global annihilation , and therefore reduce our security , is irrelevant : what matters is that a powerful political constituency exists for the pattern of our military spending , with a very organized and well - funded lobby to continually push for bigger , better , and progressively more expensive weaponry .
In making a point about how a complete fraud like Mikheil Saakashvili , the despotic president of Georgia , managed to make such headway in Washington circles , Professor Stephen Walt trenchantly observes :
" The United States has a uniquely permeable political system .
If a foreign diplomat ca n’t persuade the State Department , Treasury , or Defense , there are 435 congressmen and 100 different senators for them to go to work on .
As Ken Silverstein shows in his fascinating and funny book Turkmeniscam , there are also a host of lobbying and PR firms who are happy to help foreign governments sell their story here too . "
This permeability is even more conducive to domestic lobbies , such as those deployed by the arms manufacturers and the ancillary industries that piggyback on America ’s overseas presence .
A good example is Halliburton and its offshoots , which provide all the comforts of home to our centurions at the far frontiers of the empire .
Add to this corporate factor the foreign lobbyists and their domestic fellow travelers , and you have the broad outlines of the War Party ’s political coalition , the means by which they retain their iron grip on policymaking .
Up against this colossus stands  what ?
Or , rather , whom ?
Well , it ’s just you and me , folks , and a few other scattered , badly disorganized and under - funded peace groups .
And that ’s it .
There ’s no pro-peace lobbying organization with any heft , and certainly not with any funding .
The anti-interventionist blogger Professor Juan Cole recently noted this vital lack , and he ’s absolutely right when he says :
" The reason AIPAC and its constituencies among the Evangelicals and American Likudniks has been so successful is that there is virtually no countervailing political force .
Madison and other Founding Fathers set up the U.S. , as Ian Lustick has argued , on the assumption that on most important issues there would be opposing factions who would check each other in the legislature .
The drawback of their system is that when there is only one effective faction on an issue , it completely dominates politically .
Madison ’s system worked to prolong the heyday of Big Tobacco far beyond what was reasonable .
Anti-smoking campaigners who knew that smoking kills you dead could not make headway with Congress because the tobacco - growing and cigarette industries would counter - lobby .
" But on some issues there is no one on the other side of it to lobby and threaten congressmen .
Thus , there was not much percentage until recently in pushing for an end to the boycott on Communist Cuba , since the Florida Cuba lobby would punish you politically and virtually no one would reward you . "
Putting aside the choice of " Big Tobacco "  as a libertarian , and a smoker , I say leave them the heck alone  Professor Cole is quite correct : there is virtually no opposition to the War Party in the halls of government .
The enemies of peace are organized , they coordinate their efforts , and they have plenty of money to throw around .
The peacemakers , on the other hand , are disorganized , divided , and poor .
This imbalance is what  more than any other single factor  has given the War Party so many victories in recent years .
We will not defeat them until we out - organize them on the ground .
The potential is there , but it is  so far  tragically unrecognized .
Such a Peace Lobby , if you will , would seize this moment in our history , when there really is a good chance that a mass movement to cut the " defense " budget could get off the ground .
By arguing for a " peace stimulus , " one that would allow bigger tax cuts for all and put more money in the hands of oppressed taxpayers , the organizers of such a campaign could make a larger point : that an empire is bad economics , as well as bad foreign policy .
You want a " stimulus " ?
Forget all those condoms and start cutting back the Pentagon .
We could cut our military budget by 30 percent without even feeling it , although I would suggest a 50 percent reduction  to start .
Sound radical ?
Well , as Ron Paul remarked more than once , you ’d be surprised how much of our military expenditures amount to maintaining our overseas empire and really have nothing to do with the defense of the continental United States .
Get rid of the empire , and we can finance the rebuilding of the American economy  or , at the very least , our decayed infrastructure  several times over .

That is very interesting to me , actually ...
Mostly because I did n't realize that there were real estate bubbles forming outside the US ( I 'm in the US , and those of us here have a hard time seeing past our borders - as the rest of the world is well aware ) .
My impression was that the UK was getting hit because a significant quantity of US debt was being held by those outside the US - so the bursting of our housing bubble - and the resulting bankruptcies and foreclosures - were creating problems mostly within the financial sector abroad .
Ends up my impression was wrong .
Another interesting point - it looks like the UK housing bubble really took off a bit before the US one did .
Interesting ...
Those points aside , I think you 're right .
This is probably a mean - reverting process - which means that property values are going to have to keep falling for a bit .

The holding of toxic debt is indeed a large part of the problem and if you look at Germany for example I think their property prices remained stable but the toxic debt has still caused bank failures ( or government intervention to prevent failures ) .
Then you have another group of countries where property prices did enter bubble territory - with the anglo saxon countries such as the UK , Oz and NZ being notable bubbles ; but all with different magnitudes and more interestingly timescales , e.g. US prices started to fall about a year before the UK where prices hovered ( teetered ) at the peak .
Spain I 've heard is in the midst of a property price crash as well .
What is the common factor behind the bubble nations ?
It 's largely a cultural thing , anglo - saxons love to own property so there was perhaps some form of crowd / bubble dynamic forming independent of the other big factors - low interest rates and lightly regulated credit .
E.g. in the UK you had Northern Rock who were borrowing from the short term low interest rate credit markets and rolling over the debt so they could sell long term mortgages .
This kind of ' innovation ' drove property prices in the countries where it was being used extensively .
It 's supply and demand - add billions of pounds / dollars into the mortgage market and the price of the relatively fixed amount of property goes up .

Thanks for posting this .
I would really like to see the same graphs redone with a differentiation between land price and building price as well .
I think it would be illuminating .
From : redcalx
2009-01 - 25 10:41 am ( UTC )
No problem .
The problem with the land / property price ratio is that ( A ) there is a feedack mechanism , in that the land price changes to reflect the amount of profit a builder could make with it , and ( B ) Restricted supply of land in the UK is potentially part of the problem ; although that 's through planning regulations rather than lack of land .

This is something I 've wished to see an updated version of ever since house values took a plunge .
The Economist ( unfortunately can't remember when , though was BCC [ Before Credit Crunch ] ) produced a version where ratio of house prices to earnings was displayed as an index of its ( I think ) 30 year average value .
If the P: E value is significantly above its historical average , it suggested , houses are over - valued from the perspective of the ' fundamentals ' ( they were right there ) .
It continued by suggesting there was n't a great reason to worry , however , because house prices tend not to go down in value , just ' stick ' at a particular value long enough for the earnings to increase reduce the ratio to a more normal level ( not so right there ) .
The graph suggests house prices still have some way to fall ...
From : redcalx
2009-01 -25 10:16 pm ( UTC )
Yes the Economist do have a tendency to put a positive spin on things .
While it 's true that a rise in earnings have accounted for some or even most of the correction in the past , it 's clear from the above graph that nominal property prices did fall quite substantially in the first half of the 90's .
From the 'it 's not there yet ' files :
In my opinion , one of the greatest innovations of the Firefox 2 release was the inclusion of Tab Overflow .
For the first time I could actually handle as many open browser tabs as I wanted .
While Mozilla introduced Tab overflow in 2006 , here we are in 2009 and Google Chrome does n't have that feature .
For someone like me that often keeps 10 + tabs open at any one time this is a ( minor ) problem .
With the latest stable Chrome build 1.0.154.36 running at a screen resolution of 1024x768 , I actually lose any tab identification ( favicons included ) at the 29th open tab .
( check out the screenshot to see what i mean ) .
In practical terms this means that Chrome is only really usable for less than 29 tabs .
Both Firefox and IE have Tab Overflow so users can get more than 29 tabs .
It 's a situation that Google is aware of and is apparently working on .
In fact Google has Ben Goodger formerly of Mozilla Firefox fame , working on the issue .
" We do n't have a complete system for handling many open tabs right now .
We let tabs grow infinitely smaller , " Goodger wrote in a blog posting .
" This ends up looking bad when there are a very large number of tabs open .
We chose not to go with an overflow menu or scrolling tab strip like in some other browsers because we think there are other usability problems with those approaches . "
What Firefox does ( and what I personally really like ) is a Tab strip where you can scroll left or right to see overflow tabs .
There is also a Tab pulldown to vertically scroll through all your open tabs .
I personally do n't understand Goodger 's objection to replicating the Firefox approach for Chrome .
Here 's what he said about it :
" We also do n't really like the drop - down menu approach as it has a
spatial disconnect ( vertical scanning vs. horizontal tabs ) that makes
it clumsy to use quickly , " Goodger commented .
" In the end , we would like a system that
does n't over - zealously clip tabs out of the tab strip so that people
with many tabs can still access their tabs with one click . "
I will be keenly looking on the dev tree to see how Google ultimately decides to implement Tab Overflow .
If in fact they succeed in doing something better than Firefox 's approach that would be a tremendous thing for users like me that just can't get enough of Tabs .

It was Taneka Talley 's greatest wish to see her son head off to college .
It was why she took extra shifts at work and set her sights on promotions .
But she was stabbed to death in the Fairfield , Calif. , Dollar Tree where she worked in March 2006 , by a white man who reportedly attacked her simply because she was black .
Now , Talley 's mother is fighting to get her daughter 's workers compensation death benefits , which , according to the family 's lawyer , have been denied because the killer 's targeting her as a black person established a " personal connection " that the company says releases them from having to pay .
" For them to deny her , it 's just outrage , " Carol Frazier , Talley 's mother , told ABCNews.com .
" She worked hard for them at their store so her son could have the best . "
California law states an employer must pay death benefits if the employee was killed on the job and if the death was a result of the person 's employment , said Moira Stagliano of Boxer & Gerson in Oakland , Calif. , who is Frazier 's attorney .
But the law also allows benefits to be denied if the death stemmed from a personal connection between the victim and the attacker , such as a husband who kills his wife on company grounds .
According to Stagliano , the benefits were denied on the basis that the suspect in Talley 's slaying , 45 - year - old Tommy Thompson , allegedly made the relationship with Talley personal by choosing to attack her specifically based on the color of her skin .
Thompson and Talley had no previous known interaction with each other .
Dollar
Tree did not respond to repeated messages seeking comment .
Specialty Risk Services , which is owned by The Hartford Financial Services Group , did not comment on the specific case in a statement issued to ABCNews.com , only saying that the company was Dollar Tree 's claim administrator .
In a letter to Stagliano dated Sept. 12 , the law firm Gray & Prouty wrote that Talley 's stabbing was " purely racially motivated .
As such , it is our belief that our denial in this matter is proper . "
However , when contacted for comment , a spokesman for Gray & Prouty declined to comment on the case or say whether the firm 's client was Dollar Tree , SRS or both .
' Miscarriage of Justice '
The basis for the denial was " ridiculous , " said Edgar Romano , president of the Washington , D.C. - based Workers Injury Law and Advocacy Group .
" It 's a completely implausible reason to deny benefits . "
Romano , an attorney in New York City , said that even though workers compensation law varies by state , the common thread is that a death on the job is compensable .
The denial of Talley 's benefits , he said , moves away from that foundation .
Romano said that he believes Frazier has a good chance of getting benefits upon appeal , but it 's a " miscarriage of justice " that the case has gotten this far .
Talley , 26 , was the middle of Frazier 's three daughters .
" She was the independent daughter , " Frazier said , " the daughter who kept the family together . "
Frazier said Talley went into work on the morning of March 29 , as she often did to help get the store open in the morning .
A short time later , Talley 's cousin who worked down the road noticed police surrounding the store .
When the cousin went over to investigate she saw that Talley had been attacked and immediately summoned friends and family .
" She struggled ... to the back to the office and they called the ambulance , " Frazier said .
By the time Frazier made it to the hospital Talley was dead from a stab wound to the heart .
Thompson remains in jail , charged with murder .
The trial starts next week .
A woman who was with Thompson that morning was not charged in exchange for her testimony against him .
Though Thompson has not been charged with a hate crime , a psychologist reportedly testified , according to Stagliano , that Thompson had set out to kill a black person that morning and Talley was the first he saw .
Going to Court
Frazier , stunned by the death of her daughter , set about winning custody of then - 8 - year - old Larry Olden III , fighting his father along the way .
Then she started the process to collect Talley 's death benefits to use for Larry 's college education .
The quest has dragged on for more than two years .
After filling out mounds of paperwork and finally being able to prove to the workers compensation board that she was Larry 's guardian and , therefore , eligible to receive Talley 's death benefits , a judge suggested she get a lawyer -- her claim had been denied .
Romano said he could n't think of another case nationwide where workers compensation benefits were denied in a racially - motivated , work - related death .
Likewise , Stagliano said she has been unable to find another worker 's compensation claim like this one .
In all the cases she found where benefits had been denied because of a personal connection , the victim and the attacker had met beforehand , even for a brief moment .
She said SRS sent her a letter offering a " nominal settlement " of less than $ 5,000 , but Stagliano said Talley 's family is fully entitled to the full amount , which could be $ 250,000 or more .
Under state law , a judge is authorized to mediate the case or send it to trial if an agreement can't be reached .
Frazier said Larry , now 11 , and in sixth grade , asks about his mother " all the time . "
He loves sports and runs track , but also has an interest in business and math .
" He 's a good little kid , " Frazier said .
Frazier said that as much as she wants Talley 's death benefits to put in Larry 's college fund , it 's not even so much about the money anymore .
For Frazier , it 's about making her daughter 's employer realize that the denial is discriminatory and unfair .

It made the headlines in the San Jose Mercury when we received a dusting of snow on the local foothills , but none of it actually descended into Silicon Valley .
We did have a fair number of cloudy , rainy days , which is good for our water supply and for winter sports aficionados in the Sierra Nevada Mountains .
It also means that the sun is lower in the sky , and we have fewer hours of daylight .

Web hosting trends 2009 : the experts ' views 2009-01 - 22
Ever looking for insightful views on the topics of internet technology and business , HostReview conducted an exclusive head - to - head interview with executives from two major web hosting companies .
Our topic was web hosting trends 2009 : what does the year hold for the web hosting industry and its clients ?
We talk to John Lee , Senior Vice President of Small Business Hosting , with Hostway , and Urvish Vashi , General Manager , Dedicated Hosting , with The Planet .
Both companies have strong , and well deserved , presence in our Annual Web Hosting Awards listings .
John Lee is a co-founder of Hostway , together with CEO Lucas Roh and two other University of Chicago alumni .
His role at Hostway is to ensure that the company communicates its products and services to customers , in order to enhance their web hosting experience .

He previously served as director of product management with The Planet .
In your opinion , what were the defining characteristics of 2008 in terms of business and technology trends ?
What was different from previous years ?
John Lee : Mobile web , mobile email , and mobile everything .
iPhone definitely accelerated the trend towards more computing power being delivered through the mobile network and mobile devices .
SaaS is picking up steam .
This time around ( first round was ASP ) , we have the right model .
Cloud computing is picking up steam .
Amazon is the most innovative here .
Google has come to dominate the search space in all of North America and Europe .
Yet China marches to its own drumbeat .
Everything became expensive ; now it ’s not .
The US dollar was weak ; now it ’s not .
Mega datacenter projects [ are ] under way .
Urvish Vashi : Economic realities have created an almost “ bi-polar ” response over the last year , and 2008 can be divided into two distinct halves .
During the first six months , companies focused on building smart , actionable plans to grow their businesses online .
In the second half , we ’ve seen companies look for hosting as a way to operate more cost effectively , without all of the capital and operational risk that comes with IT expansion plans .
While we heard a lot of technology around virtualization , cloud and utility infrastructure , we saw that businesses increasingly turned to trusted IT partners who could help them navigate their hosting options with these infrastructure add - ons .
Customers are n’t always sure which options address the specific problem or use case they are looking to solve , whether it be long - term data archiving , on - demand scaling , data center optimization or myriad others .
As companies grow and make their bets on where to invest , we see an increasing number of SMBs wanting not just to pick and chose the infrastructure from simple to complex , but also increasingly wanting to take an a’ la carte view of services .
Which technologies will be " hot " in 2009 ?
John Lee : Mobile computing , Cloud computing and Virtualization , Unified Communication .
Urvish Vashi :
It ’s hard to talk about “ hot ” without mentioning cloud and virtualization .
Both will continue as big topics in the New Year .
These enabling technologies can provide real benefits to SMBs looking to outsource IT .
The opportunity for hosters is to take these emerging technologies and couple them with infrastructure management services to address specific customer needs .
Hosters stand to gain significant benefits from these technologies because they provide a path to better efficiency in labor , server and storage resources , and data center utilization .
While this is great news for hosters , the primary benefit for customers will come from improved performance and better prices .
How will growth in demand for virtualization and cloud computing solutions compare to traditional hosting offerings like dedicated servers and shared hosting ?
Do cloud platforms by Microsoft , Amazon and Google threaten traditional hosting providers ?
John Lee : [ There will be ] no end - user impact on the shared hosting .
However , from hosting company perspective , we can lower our cost of operation by adopting the cloud computing technology to better utilize resources .
As you know , there are a lot of idle servers in any big server farm .
Positive impact on dedicated servers :
It may come to pass that cloud computing may replace dedicated server model , but that is still some years off .
For now , cloud computing will help to drive more dedicated server sales as the expertise around cloud computing will develop faster in hosting companies than in internal IT departments .
While large clouds will continue to gather momentum , mini- private clouds hosted and managed by hosting companies will gain momentum as well .
Andthe cloud computing model is very conducive to outsourcing .
As more businesses consider cloud computing , they will be more open to outsourcing model .
That will help with the dedicate server sales .
Remember , our biggest competition is still the in - house hosting centers .
Urvish Vashi :
The cloud platforms offered by Microsoft , Amazon and Google play an important role in driving broad market adoption .
These players do n’t , however , have a heritage of service and support , which is what most customers require to make the best use out of these technologies .
That ’s where we come in .
The “ special sauce ” as you might say , is technology in conjunction with service and support .
The threat of these solutions will be felt first by the thousands of hosting resellers .
We ’ve already seen many of our resellers begin to develop platforms that provide similar functionality based on some of the same platforms .
However , those that thrive will recognize that the technical platform alone is not sufficient to address the needs of most customers .
What other trends do you foresee for 2009 , and how will your company align its operations to new technology and business requirements ?
John Lee : Datacenter space will continue to be tight .
As access to capital is already tight , the datacenter needs will outstrip the available datacenter space .
So as a hosting company , making sure we have enough room for growth is a key .
Hostway is in a good shape for this .
VALUE … maximizing value will be the key .
Not necessarily lower price , but delivering more value at the same price point .
This will be true across the board .
This will be especially true for shared hosting space .
We are hard at work to completely overhaul our shared hosting product line .
Urvish Vashi :
In 2009 , every company will have to do more with less , and hosting is no exception .
The companies that will come out on top next year are those who are squarely focused on scale , operational excellence and customer satisfaction .
For us , that means we will continue to focus on enabling technologies like virtualization , but will increase our investment in the systems that drive greater efficiency and automation .
Ultimately , this yields a better , more consistent customer experience , which is why customers keep coming back to us , even as they are trying to do more with less .
By all indications , 2009 will be slow in terms of economic growth .
How will the hosting industry at large fare in such a situation ?
John Lee : Hosting industry is in a good shape to take advantage of the heightened pressure to cut IT cost .
In dedicated servers , our biggest competition is still in - house hosting centers .
So , we should be poised to take advantage of this .
On the shared hosting side , we all know how resilient the small businesses are .
We will be fine .
Urvish Vashi : Although it ’s a tough economic environment , as an industry , hosting will see more takers .
In fact , we ’re very bullish about the market opportunities .
We ’ve just announced a new 86,000 square foot lease for our seventh data center that will be located in the Dallas suburb of Plano .
We plan to house colo , private racks and Managed Hosting customers there .
That said , IT managers who are struggling to raise capital to buy servers , software or data - center space will seriously evaluate companies that can provide that infrastructure without upfront expense or long - term commitment .
The cap - ex - free model of the hosting industry is even more valuable in an economic crunch .
Will green initiatives attract new clients ?
John Lee : Lower cost , innovative technology and better service attract new customers .
Everything else is ephemeral hype .
Do n’t get me wrong .
Green technologies help to drive the cost down , so it ’s good .
But I have n’t heard anyone losing deals or winning deals b/c they have green initiatives .
Urvish Vashi : At The Planet we see two main benefits to green initiatives .
Besides the benefits of being a good global citizen , lower power utilization means lower costs , which benefits all of our customers .
You ’ll see in our new data center announcement that we ’re spending an additional $ 2 million on our facility to make it environmentally friendly , and we expect a return on our investment in about 30 months .
If you had to specify a single most important priority for your company for 2009 , what would it be ?
John Lee : Delivering maximum value to our customers is our priority number 1 in 2009 .
Value is what ’s in everyone ’s mind .
Giving more for less is what it will be about in 2009 .
Look for technology and service innovations across all our product lines – domain name registration , shared hosting , dedicated hosting , managed coloation and marketing services – that will help us deliver more value than last year to our customers .
Urvish Vashi :
Our top priority is simple – to keep our customers happy and to find more of them .
The All For One Initiative is calling on us to contact Utah Governor Jon Huntsman as well as the Senate President Michael Waddoups and urge them to speak up in favor of Senator Buttars submitting his resignation .
The senator has recently called " gays the greatest threat to America " among other highly offensive comments .

If you have both cats and dirt you may want to be wary of a new type of worm that 's infecting computers across Great Britain -- or computer , anyway .
It 's called an earthworm , and one of the five - inch variety stealthily found its way into the laptop of one Mark Taylor .
He began receiving overheating errors and took his machine to a technician who promptly found the unfortunate invertebrate wedged in the cooling fan , slowly crisping thanks to the system 's heat .
Taylor thinks one of his cats dug up the worm , brought it inside , and then the poor thing crawled through one of the cooling vents on his notebook to flee its pursuer .
We 're not sure how it got separated from its ultra - high - tech - indestructible - super - space - cyber - suit , but surely somewhere Queen Slug - for - a - Butt is laughing .

With his world crumbling around him , investment advisor Marcus Schrenker opted for a bailout .
However , his plan to escape personal turmoil was short - lived .
In a feat reminiscent of a James Bond movie , the 38 - year - old businessman and amateur daredevil pilot apparently tried to fake his death in a plane crash , secretly parachuting to the ground and speeding away on a motorcycle he had stashed away in the pine barrens of central Alabama .
But the three - day saga came to an end when authorities caught up to Schrenker at a Florida campground .
“ He had cut one of his wrists , but he is still alive , ” said Alabama - based U.S. Marshals spokesman Michael Richards .

Schrenker was on the run not only from the law but from a divorce , a state investigation of his businesses and angry investors who accuse him of stealing potentially millions in savings they entrusted to him .
On Sunday -- two days after burying his beloved stepfather and incurring a half - million - dollar loss in federal court -- Schrenker was flying his single - engine Piper Malibu to Florida from his Indiana home when he radioed from 2,000 feet that he was in trouble .
He said that the windshield had imploded and that his face was covered with blood .
Then his radio went silent .
Military jets intercepted the plane and found the door open and the cockpit dark .
The pilots followed until the aircraft crashed into a bayou .
No body was found .

Lew Rockwell 's new manifesto is a clarion call — creative and thought - provoking on every page — for a principled liberty in our time .
There are very few books in which you can open up any page and immediately find a quotable and inspiring passage that will make you think hard , laugh out loud , or see things a completely new way .
This is certainly one of them .
He covers every topic related to economics and politics , from the business cycle , to trade , to the drug war , to environmentalism .
His central thesis is that the threat to liberty comes from both the Left and the Right , and that neither really offers a consistent way out .
The real problem is much deeper than either the Right or the Left recognizes .
It is the institution of the state itself , which everyone seems to want to use to his own philosophical advantage .
The problem , he writes , is not that we have chosen the wrong flavor of public policy but that we have public policy at all .
All forms of policy — decisions made by state institutions that affect the uses of private property according to political priorities — amount to invasions of liberty .
Relentlessly moving from left - wing to right - wing and back to left - wing policy is not progress ; it means continued movement down the road to serfdom .
Beautifully edited and pristinely argued , this is a work in applied Austro - libertarian theory , tracking issues and headlines as they occur and bringing the light of logic and evidence to bear on the question at hand .
The articles collected can be read in a matter of five minutes each , and they are organized along topical lines .
He is especially good in dealing with issues of national crisis , such as weather disasters , terrorist attacks , and economic downturns .
He shows that liberty is more important in these times than any other .
And while others back away during these times , he has consistently been out front , calling for peace when the masses are screaming for war , calling for freedom when the politicians demand a crackdown , and urging a free market when everyone else seems to be clamoring for state solutions .
If you have read Lew Rockwell 's articles and speeches over the years and wished for a single collection , it has finally arrived in a beautifully bound hardback that is a real treasure to own and study .
It makes a lasting impact .
Rockwell is the founder and president of the Mises Institute , and the editor of his own site LewRockwell.com .
He has played an important role in the shaping of libertarian theory for a quarter of a century .
This book shows how and why .
Subtle , radical , and compelling , Rockwell 's book is a great addition to the legendary literature of political dissidents .
The First World War does not grow old , as other wars grow old .
Age does not weary our memories , even if the years condemn .
Here is a great conundrum .
Ninety years ago this month , the guns fell silent in the war that failed to end all wars .
The last poilu – the last of 8,410,000 Frenchmen to be mobilised – died in March .
Astoundingly , there are six British and British Empire veterans , still living .
Their ages range from 107 to 112 – the last patrol of an immense host of 8,904,467 soldiers , sailors and airmen .
The First World War is passing over the horizon of living memory .
With next week 's 90th anniversary of the armistice of 11 November 1918 , it is right , surely , to bury the Great War .
Naturally , we should continue to study it as history .
However , has n't the time come to re-file the years 1914 - 18 in the same card - index of collective memory as the Crimean or Napoleonic wars : fascinating , terrible , but no longer linked umbilically to our own guts , to our everyday lives ?
The answer , it seems , is no .
And it comes not from historians or politicians or journalists , but from ordinary people , and especially ordinary British people .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Martin Middlebrook , the first British historian to chronicle the war from the viewpoint of the common soldier , says : " After the 80th anniversary [ of the Somme ] in 1996 , I would have told you that two things were inevitable .
We will see declining numbers of people at future commemorations .
Interest in the war will gradually reduce .
The opposite has been true . "
There are now more British visitors to the Commonwealth War Graves cemeteries in France and Belgium than ever before .
The nightly ceremony of the playing of the Last Post at the Menin gate in Ypres might have been attended by a handful of people 30 years ago .
Now , there is a sizeable crowd each night .
Memories of the war refuse to die but the physical traces of the great conflict are , like the survivors , fading away .
As a young man , in July 1979 , I cycled through the battlefields of the Somme .
I was surprised by the rolling beauty of the countryside .
I had imagined that the 1914 - 18 war had occurred on a vast , featureless plain .
A couple of years later , living in Brussels , I began to visit the Flanders battlefields around Ypres .
I discovered the featureless landscape of my imagination .
In both cases , I was astonished to find how many clear traces of the battles remained .
Remnants of the old trench lines – then 60 years old – could still be seen in places , snaking through the fields of shining wheat and around the smaller fields of shining , white graves .
In the last 30 years , most of these remnants have been erased by the creation of larger fields and farms and the use of heavier agricultural machinery .
On the edges of battlefield towns such as Albert , Arras and Ypres , industrial estates , suburban sprawl and motorways have been scribbled over parts of what was still an almost virgin landscape in 1979 .
You can still find scraps of pock - marked , overgrown battlefield in woodlands or in the memorial parks , such as Beaumont - Hamel and Vimy Ridge .
The shining white cemeteries are , of course , still there , beautifully preserved by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and by their French and German counterparts .
The poignancy of this " disappearing " landscape – especially the part of it around Ypres in south - western Belgium – has been captured masterfully in these images by the German photographer Stefan Boness .

In one image , a golf hole stands beside a small British cemetery that contains the graves of men who were killed a few yards away .
In another , a factory chimney peeps over the parapet of a British trench , reconstructed in absurdly neat concrete .
Perhaps most poignantly of all , a freshly ploughed field recalls the mud in which the British and German armies floundered from June to November 1917 , as they fought over an insignificant village called Passchendaele .
I was at just such a field with Martin Middlebrook two years ago .
In the lowest corner – to which water naturally flowed – the historian bent down to pick up a tiny metal ball : shrapnel from a fragmentation shell fired almost 90 years before .
Such metal - infested fields in Belgium and northern France also produce each year , as tractors and ploughs become ever more powerful , a steady harvest of bones – British , Australian , Canadian , French and German .
The one part of the Great War battlefields where this does not happen is the ridge just to the east of Verdun where 300,000 French and German soldiers died from February to November 1916 .
When the war ended , the blood - soaked Verdun moonscape was not cleared and reclaimed for agriculture , as were the " British " battlefields of the Somme or Passchendaele .
Instead , the entire battlefield was planted with conifers .
The forests were meant to be a permanent memorial to help future generations remember .
In truth , the Verdun forests , now grown dark and tall , make it harder to recall what the battle was like .
Around Ypres , for all the tides of time chronicled by Stefan Boness , it is still possible to grasp the contours of the three great Flanders battles of 1914 - 18 .
Why are we still so possessed by the Great War ?
What makes so many British people go back to the Somme and Ypres ?
Why did Boness spend so long – several years – taking photographs of the battlefields ( which have just been published as a book , Flanders Fields , Bildschöne Bücher , € 35 ) ?
Martin Middlebrook says that , for one reason or another , the 1914 war has " come out from behind the shadow " of the 1939 war .
Why ?
One of the forces at work is the new obsession of rootless , modern humanity with genealogy .
Almost all of us have a relative who fought at the Somme or Ypres or Verdun .
( My own great uncle Monty Lichtenstein , I discovered recently , died in the battle for Passchendaele . )
Another British historian , Michael Stedman , points to the recent explosion of writing about the Great War , in both history and fiction ( an explosion begun by Middlebrook in the mid-1970s ) .
Stedman believes that this surge in what he calls " people 's history " – converted into successful fiction by Sebastian Faulks , Pat Barker and others – has taken the faded sepia memories of a thousand photographs of dead great uncles and restored them to full colour .
There is , however , something else .
The Great War gnaws at our guts and our collective memories because it was the war that shaped the modern world .
" The logic of Hiroshima began at Verdun , " a French historian , Jean - Yves Le Naour , once told me .
" It was at Verdun that the notion of industrialised mass destruction was pushed to its limit for the first time . "
At Verdun , yes , but also within a few months , and even more destructively , on the Somme .
The 1914 war was the culmination of a 19th century that increased the productive – and destructive – power of mankind beyond the scope of dreams and nightmares .
It was a war fought with murderous inventions , such as machine guns , high - powered artillery , poison gas , tanks , war planes and fragmentation shells .
More importantly , it was a war fought with new economic and logistical capacities , from railways , to tinned food and the industrial and taxation power of the modern state .
Never before could armies of 3,000,000 men have faced each other in a space of 200 square miles for more than 10 months .
To kill 1,200,000 people in one battle ( the Somme ) takes political organisation and determination , great administrative skills and economic power , not just military strength or callousness .
The 19th and early 20th century also saw immense advances in political rights , in education , in respect for the humanity of the common man .
On the Western Front at least , the Great War was fought by educated men – one of the first generations to be universally educated .
On both sides , it was fought – not universally , but largely – by men who had the vote .
The First World War was also the first in history in which systematic trouble was taken to give soldiers individual graves ( at least those who could be found and identified ) .
This collision between industrialised mass slaughter and democratic respect for the individual is the great paradox of the First World War , one of the reasons , maybe , why it haunts us to this day .
Why did a Western world that was beginning , for the first time , to respect and value individuals , pour them into its new mincing machine of military - industrial power ?
Why did an educated population stand for it ?
The answer , in part , is that one of our first uses of mass literacy and mass education was to inculcate an unthinking patriotism and nationalism – in Britain and France , as much as in Germany .
The innocence and confidence of the young men in boaters and flat caps who queued to join Pals ' Battalions was born from a Boy 's Own - magazine conviction that British Is Best , as much as a belief in freedom and democracy .
And yet can we confidently state that they were not defending freedom and democracy ?
Can we say for certain that the world would have been little different if German militarism had triumphed over flawed democracy in 1914 ?
Talking to visitors to the battlefield today , you still find those who believe that the war was a great patriotic and democratic crusade and those who believe that it was a criminal waste of life .
You find many people who – quite reasonably – believe both .
Before he became a historian , Michael Stedman was a schoolteacher who took scores of school trips to Flanders and Picardy .
" The 1914 - 18 war raises questions which go to the core of mankind 's existence , " he says .
" Is it right to fight for what you believe in , even if you know that warfare , with modern weaponry , leads to unimaginable indignity and suffering ?
" At what point do you stand up to evil ?
How can you distinguish good and evil from nationalistic ranting and posturing ?
All those questions remain with us .
All are unresolved and perhaps will never be resolved ...
I know from taking school parties to the Somme , that just going to the battlefields forces young people to grow up , to face these questions for the first time . "
Here , then , is one reason why we should never bury the First World War .
Even for the internet , mobile - phone , cheap - air - fares generation , this is not a quaint , distant event like Waterloo or Agincourt .
The optimistic lesson ( if an optimistic lesson can be learnt ) is that the Great War happened at a unique and unfortunate time in human history .
It happened when military , and economic , power had achieved an extraordinary new zenith .
It also happened before the power of the modern media , and the scepticism of modern minds ( partly created by 1914 - 18 ) could hold politicians to account for wreaking such destruction .
Each British death in present - day Afghanistan is ( rightly ) the subject of anguish .
Imagine the reaction in the age of instant news to the 29,000 British deaths on the first day of the battle of the Somme ( largely in the first couple of hours ) on 1 July 1916 .
But what of the media jingoism that trumpeted the US and British invasion of Iraq ?
What of the persistent , intolerant , anti-Western and anti-semitic propaganda in parts of the Arab world and Iran ?
The Great War also remains a great warning .
In the days of mass terrorism and nuclear proliferation , it is a reminder of what can happen when two causes collide , each armed with technologies of mass destruction and each driven by a blind faith in its own righteousness .

A security guard accidentally suffocated himself in an autoerotic accident , an inquest heard .
Ralph Santiago , 31 , was found dead in the men ’s toilets of the building he worked wearing Wellington boots , a wetsuit and gas mask .
His body was found by a colleague at about 7 am on Tuesday , July 22 , last year , lying on the floor with a gas canister nearby .
Further rubber / latex outfits were found in Mr Santiago ’s car and in the ladies ’ toilets of his workplace at Aquis House in Blagrave Street , Reading .
The evening before he died Mr Santiago printed off information from the internet explaining how inhaling “ poppers ” ( legal chemicals used to stimulate a sexual high ) via a gas mask can cause arousal .
At an inquest into his death Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford explained Mr Santiago had only worked at Aquis House for one day before he died .
On Monday , July 21 , he arrived ready for his 6.30 pm to 6.30 am shift .
But the next morning , when fellow guard Christopher Courtenay arrived , Mr Santiago was nowhere to be seen .
Reading from Mr Courtenay ’s statement , Mr Bedford said : “ At 6.30 am I could still not see him .
I assumed he was in the bathroom .
“ At 6.50 am I carried out a full patrol .
Ralph was still not back . ”
Mr Courtenay visited the staff bathroom and discovered the men ’s toilet was locked .
He went upstairs to get a key , when he opened the door he found a body .
However , he was not certain it was Mr Santiago because only his eyes were visible under the mask .
Paramedics and the police were called .
In a statement , PC Barbara Cummings described Mr Santiago as wearing “ a black latex suit , gloves , a gas mask and Wellingtons . ”
Mr Santiago ’s girlfriend Hannele Vaher did not attend the inquest but had previously explained “ he had fetishes ” , of which she did not take part .
She said he was “ prone to dressing up ” and adding that he took poppers .
Toxicology tests showed Mr Santiago , of Beresford Avenue in Surbiton , had some alcohol in his system .
Dr Sukhvinder Ghataura , who carried out the autopsy , told the inquest it was likely – owing to the fact Mr Santiago ’s lungs were filled with blood – he died of cardio respiratory arrest .
Dr Ghataura said he believed this was caused by inhalation of noxious gases via the gas canister , but added the chemicals had dispersed by the time the post - mortem was carried out .
Mr Bedford recorded a verdict of misadventure , adding : “ He indulged in a certain pastime which he was fully entitled to do in his own time .
“ This time he was doing it while he worked as a security officer .
The fact is he was taking a risk .
Tragically and unexpectedly this caused him to die . ”
Tributes to ‘ generous and loving guy ’
Friends of Ralph Santiago paid tribute to him on the networking website Facebook .
Claire Feltham said : “ Billy Joel was so , so right when he sang Only The Good Die Young . ”
Paul Mason said : “ Ralphy , I ’ve never met a more generous and loving guy , I ca n’t believe I wo n’t hear your laughter . ”
Vickas Handas wrote : “ Ralphy .
You were such a genuine and sincere person . ”
And Natalie Baker wrote : “ Poor Ralphy ... we are all completely gutted to hear such sad news . ”
Bobby Jindal walked out to the microphone with a glaze in his eyes and seemed hopped up on Red Bull as he shuffled through the Republican response speech to President Obama .
If the Republican Party thinks he 's their solution they are sadly mistaken .
Instead of launching his national political career , he just about ended it .
Some people thought he reminded them of Kenneth from 30 Rock , but at least Kenneth has some enthusiasm .
Not only was he zombie - like throughout , but he did n't even have his facts straight .
Too much Red Bull ?
But Democratic leaders in Congress rejected this approach .
Instead of trusting us to make wise decisions with our own money , they passed the largest government spending bill in history -- with a price tag of more than $ 1 trillion with interest .
While some of the projects in the bill make sense , their legislation is larded with wasteful spending .
It includes $ 300 million to buy new cars for the government , $ 8 billion for high - speed rail projects , such as a ' magnetic levitation ' line from Las Vegas to Disneyland , and $ 140 million for something called ' volcano monitoring . '
Instead of monitoring volcanoes , what Congress should be monitoring is the eruption of spending in Washington , DC
.
As Newsweek documented , the levitating train is a complete myth .
A widely repeated claim that $ 8 billion is set aside for a " levitating train " to Disneyland is untrue .
That total is for unspecified high - speed rail projects , and some of it may or may not end up going to a proposed 300 - mph " maglev " train connecting Anaheim , Calif. , with Las Vegas .
The truth never seems to be a problem for the Republican Party .
Jindal also boasted that government is ineffective by sneering at the government response to Hurricane Katrina .
Yes , under Republicans and George Bush , Hurricane Katrina was a disaster -- one led by his own party .
Way to go there , Bobby .
I do n't think Americans have forgotten that fact , and it was an idiotic analogy to use .
Pretty much like most of his childlike stories .
Dave N : Do n't you think he and Sarah Palin seem fated for each other ?
... Birds of a feather and all that .
UPDATE : Digby has her take :

A catalogue of failures in the government 's massive NHS IT project has led health service staff to lose confidence in the records system , and has put the success of the programme in serious jeopardy , a report has concluded .
Essential systems are late or when deployed do not meet the expectations of clinical staff , according to the Public Accounts Committee ( PAC ) .
Local cost estimates are unreliable and many NHS staff remain unenthusiastic about the usability .
" The risks to the successful delivery of the programme are as serious as ever , " Edward Leigh , chairman of the committee of PAC , said .
Full implementation of the systems was planned by 2010 , but while some are complete or well advanced , major ones , such as the care records systems , are " way off the pace " .
By the end of 2008 , care records software for the North , Midlands and East had not gone live throughout a single Acute Trust , and a revised completion date of 2014 - 15 for the late systems - four years behind schedule - looks doubtful in light of the termination last year of Fujitsu 's contract covering the South .
Now , even if NHS Trusts decide not to deploy the patient care records systems , the taxpayer would still have to foot the bill .
The estimated cost of the programme is £ 12.7 billion , including £ 3.6 billion of local costs , although this figure remains uncertain .
Mr Leigh called on the Department of Health ( DoH ) to reassess the ability of its IT suppliers to meet their substantial commitments .
" Trusts should not be expected to deploy care records systems that are n't working properly .
If there is no improvement to this situation within six months , then the department should consider allowing Trusts to apply for funding for alternative systems , " he said .
Commenting on the report , Lib Dem health spokesman , Norman Lamb blamed delays , spiralling costs and totally frustrated staff on minsters ' incompetence , calling the programme a " disaster " .
Responsibility for delivery is shared with the local NHS and with the chief executives of the ten strategic health authorities .
Mr Lamb criticised the government for its top - down approach , " despite the fact that there was no proper business case and no clinical assessment of what was needed .
" We need to end this centrally imposed system and give power to local health services to organise their own IT needs " he added .
The programme is intended to generate substantial benefits for patients and the NHS , increasing NHS staff 's ability to access information stored in the care records system .
Delivering the clinical functionality will be key to convincing NHS staff of the benefits of the programme .
Keeping patient data secure will be crucial to the reputation and success of the IT investment , and the department is confident that the mechanisms it is putting in place will provide a high level of security .
Access to the Care Records Service will be controlled through Smartcards and passcodes , and will be auditable .
The security of the IT systems themselves is the responsibility of suppliers , with NHS organisations and their staff responsible for keeping the data secure if they access it .
Well , what do you know ?
Nearly four years after Arizona State University opened its very own flexible display center comes this , a prototype device that 's purportedly easy to manufactur , easy on the environment and practically as strong as Thor.
HP and ASU have teamed up to demonstrate the fresh e-displays , which are constructed almost entirely of plastic and consume far less power than traditional computer monitors .
The " unbreakable displays " were crafted using self - aligned imprint lithography ( SAIL ) technology invented in HP Labs , and while we'd love to see this in a pliable laptop at CES 2009 , we suspect it 'll be a few years yet before these slither out to the commercial realm . : HP Labs pinged us with this tidbit on the image above .
" This image from the Flexible Display Center at ASU represents what the flexible display , a paper - like computer display made entirely of plastic , could look like in the future . "
Today one of Britain ’s most senior police officers with responsibility for public order raises the spectre of a " summer of rage , " with victims of the increasingly bitter recession taking to the streets in possibly violent protest .
Superintendent David Hartshorn , who heads the Metropolitan police ’s public order branch , warned that law - abiding middle - class individuals who would never have considered joining demonstrations may now seek to vent their anger through protests this year .
Many will consider such a scenario unlikely , or point out this has not been the " British way " over the past two decades .
Violent protests take place in Europe  in recent weeks Greek farmers have blocked roads over falling agricultural prices , a million workers in France took to the streets to demand greater protection for their jobs and wages and Icelandic demonstrators have clashed with police in Reykjavik  but not here .

A group of European sailing enthusiasts have just created a solar - powered , Linux - brained sailboat that can sail anywhere and navigate pre-set race courses with no human intervention whatsever !
Sounds like a novices dream and a fantastic way for beginners to learn .
The Roboat can calculate the optimal route by weighting drift coordinates against weather parameters .
The rudder and sails as well as the tacks and jibes are autonomously controlled by incoming data from sensors ( GPS , compass , anemometer , etc. ) , which are analysed using artificial intelligence .
According to CleanTechnica : The Roboat is actually an adapted 3.75 m
Laerling beginner ’s sailing vessel that has been kitted out with a Linux operating system and a control software suite that uses Java and C ++.
The boat also features sensors that track position and speed over ground , speed through water , ultrasonic wind speed , and more .
When a destination is set , the Roboat ’s chain - driven motors adjust the mainsail , jib , rudder , and boom .
In case its solar panels fail , the Roboat also comes with a methanol fuel cell for backup .
There are a number of applications for Roboat ’s Technology including :
Intelligent Sensor Buoys :
An autonomic sailing boat is completely energy autarkic and can therefore collect unlimited measured data from world ’s lakes and seas .
In other words this application would make possible that surveying and mapping as well as water ecological studies or recording of fishing resources would be rather cost - effective .

Safety on Sailing Boats :
This technology can be implemented on sailing ships of any sizes .
Similar to the ABS or the ESP of the car this Roboat - System can interfere in dangerous situations and help the skipper to get the ship under control again .
The system can also detect when the skipper fell overboard and is able to retrieve him automatically and precisely .

CO2 - neutral in Transportation of the Goods : Nowadays with the fuel getting more and more expensive and complying with Kyoto standards is getting more difficult , better alternatives for the transportation of the goods need to be sought .
The sailing boats are environment - friendly but they require a rather high number of human resource .
Here is where the Roboat - Technology comes into play with its autonomous attributes from calculating the optimal itinerary to independently executing the right manoeuvres .

Comfort on Board :
The sailor can freely decide which board responsibilities are likely to be taken over and which to be transferred to the Roboat - System .
This alternative of delegating the ship can be of great advantage for people with handicaps , injured , ill or exhausted skippers or ships with reduced crew .

Supply Vessel : Secluded regions with lower number of inhabitants for instance researching base camps on islands can be cost - effectively supplied by the robot sailing boats with equipment , medicine , food or correspondence .
Although there are other robotic sailboats around , the Roboat is clearly one of the best , winning the first World Robotic Sailing Championship earlier this year .

While I was downloading 10 + gigabytes of the new Lord of the Rings : Online 10 Day Free Trial , ( because LOST does n’t air for me until tomorrow on abc.com )
I wondered how many floppies that would be if this game were released in the early 90’s .
Of course , nobody sane would ever release 10 + gigabytes of data on floppies .
In order to visualize the result I consulted my handy tools , google image search and the gimp .
But how many floppies is it ?
The Lord of the Rings Download Manager estimates that it ’ll take about four hours to download the remaining 8 + Gigabytes .
If I were to install all Seven Thousand , Three - Hundred and Sixty - Seven Floppies , it would take about 491 hours , assuming only 4 minutes per floppy .
Based on the download speed of a 56 k modem ( which rarely worked as advertised on my phone lines ) , ten gigabytes would take about Seventeen Days , Eighteen Hours , and Five Minutes to download , assuming the connection is never interrupted by someone picking up the phone to call for pizza .
The number of floppies is probably unrealisticly low since my calculations do n’t take into account the floppy headers , and the archive data that interprets each disk in the chain .
Can you imagine if you went into Radio Shackâ „ ¢ and they had one of those cardboard cutouts with a Seven Thousand , Three - Hundred and Sixty - Seven Floppy Free Trial of Lord of the Rings Online cellotaped into one bundle ?!
There could only be one set in the store !

But in a pointed and political call to more than 40 heads of state and national leaders attending the conference , he said : " What is not reversible is the acquisition of nuclear weapons by a fanatic radical regime committed to a pre-medieval view of the world .
We have never had , since the dawn of the nuclear age , nuclear weapons in the hands of such a fanatical regime . "
His comments , clearly designed to bolster his standing in the imminent polls in Israel , he said any efforts worldwide to secure peace in the Middle East would fall apart if Tehran managed to arm itself with nuclear weapons .
Mr Netanyahu was speaking on a panel on leadership which included the British Opposition Leader , Conservative David Camero .
The Israeli said that three qualities were needed to successfully lead a nation : courage , power that is usable and a level of vision .
" Unless you have the big three - the vision , the power and the guts - it is not going to happen , " he said .
Mr Netanyahu insisted that he wanted to " move rapidly to advance a workable peace " with moderates in the Palestinian Authority and said the Iranian arms race was the greatest challenge facing the leaders of the 21st century . "
Iran has consistently denied that it is moving towards nuclear armament , insisting the push is for energy and peaceful use instead .
Mr Netanyahu used the forum discussion to float his proposed economic stimulus package for Israel , signalling tighter government spending , tax cuts and increased competitiveness including major infrastructure construction .
" My vision is that we can use this crisis to complete reforms so that Israel becomes one of the ten most competitive economies in the world , " he said .
The most recent polls suggest that Likud and other tough talking parties will win a majority in the parliament , giving Mr Netanyahu a strong chance of forming a government after the February election .
However during a discussion on Central Asia and the Caucuses on Thursday , Iran 's Foreign Minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , signalled a positive response from his nation if the new US President , Barack Obama 's promises on a new tack in foreign policy changes are " genuine " .
He said nations of his region are waiting to see if the US leadership is offering strategic or just rhetorical change : " We do believe that if the new administration of the United States , as President Obama has said , is going to change its policies , not in talking but in acts , then definitely it will find in the region a creative and cooperative reaction , including from Iran . "
He said his country 's 3000 - year history had shown that the Iran 's relationships with its neighbours are based on peaceful coexistence and had helped work towards " stability and security which we consider to be in our interests , as well as in those of other countries in the region " .
If our first look at OpenOffice.org 3.0 has you salivating for the official download of this free Microsoft Office replacement , the final release has already been pushed to a mirror near you ( like this one ) .
Expect an official release announcement on Monday . [ via ]

A 23 - year - old woman has been jailed after falsely claiming she had been raped by a taxi driver in a bid to obtain £ 10,000 from him .
Bradford Crown
Court heard yesterday how the cabbie acted as a Good Samaritan when Shabnam Masood flagged down his vehicle in September 2007 and told him she had been assaulted by her boyfriend .
She was jailed for six months after the court heard she intended to ask the driver , Mohammed Taj , to pay up £ 10,000 to avoid a court case .
Prosecutor Michelle Colborne said the taxi driver arranged for the woman to be put up at a hotel in Bradford after she claimed to be hungry and homeless and they later had consensual sex .
But the next day Masood phoned the police and alleged that she had been abducted by two men .
She claimed she had been blind - folded , tied up and taken to an unknown location in a car where she was raped by one of the men .
The taxi driver was arrested , interviewed and subjected to an intimate medical examination .
But Miss Colborne said CCTV footage of Masood ’s movements showed her behaving in a carefree manner until the police arrived .
“ On sight of the police she throws herself to the ground and demonstrates the persona of a victim , ’’ said Miss Colborne .
Masood , of Brompton Road , Bradford , pleaded guilty last month to a charge of perverting the course of justice and Judge Roger Scott said it was clear that the false rape claim had been designed to get £ 10,000 from the alleged attacker .
He told her : “ I shall deal with you on the basis that £ 10,000 was what was envisaged by you as the end result ” .
She now faces deportation as an overstayer in this country .
‘’ The end result was that he ( the alleged rapist ) would not go to court , but you would receive £ 10,000 to share between you and your partner . ”
Masood ’s lawyer , Assumpta O’Rourke , described her as a vulnerable individual who was easily manipulated .
She said : “ Miss Masood fully accepts her wrong - doing . ’’ Sakhawat Hussain , chairman of the Bradford Private Hire Association , said later : “ All the drivers are vetted by the Criminal Record Bureau and if they have any convictions , serious or not serious , they are not allowed to get their taxi licences .
“ When something like this comes out it gives the driver a bad name , his family and all the rest of the members a bad name – it puts a black scar on the person ’s life . ”
Barbara Siedlecki , manager of Star ( Surviving Trauma After Rape ) , said : “ A malicious false allegation is very detrimental and I think it stops people coming forward .
“ If people are reading that these allegations are false and someone gets six months , it leads them not to report any incidents . ”

Earlier this year , researchers at the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology , the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Cambridge University published a study in the journal Genome Biology providing further evidence that the evolution of human cognitive abilities was accompanied by adaptive changes in brain metabolism , potentially pushing the human brain to the limit of its metabolic capabilities [ 1 ] .
The results support the theory that schizophrenia is a consequence of human brain evolution .
Schizophrenia is a disorder known to affect human cognitive abilities , commonly presenting with auditory hallucinations , paranoia and / or disorganized speech and thinking .
It is considered a psychosis and is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors .
Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) brain scans show dramatic differences in the distribution of electrical activity in a normal brain compared to the brain of a schizophrenic patient ( right ) .
Schizophrenia affects ~ 1 % of the world ’s population with a peak onset in young adulthood ; men are more likely to become ill earlier in life than women .
Although current treatments can eliminate many of the symptoms of schizophrenia , the molecular causes of the disease have not been identified .
In the present study , researchers compared the molecular changes observed in schizophrenia to changes identified on the human evolutionary lineage and tested whether there was a significant overlap of affected biological processes .
Such an overlap would suggest that schizophrenia affects recently evolved biological processes and may provide insights into molecular changes critical for the evolution and maintenance of human - specific cognitive abilities .
The scientists used a published list of 22 biological processes showing evidence of positive ( i.e advantageous ) selection based on gene expression in the brain during recent human evolution [ 2 ] .
They then tested whether the expression of genes contained in those biological processes is altered in schizophrenia to a greater extent than expected by chance .
Six of the 22 processes were found to be significantly enriched with genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia .
Surprisingly , all 6 processes were associated with energy metabolism .
Researchers then studied brain metabolism in human schizophrenia patients and healthy controls , as well as in chimpanzees and rhesus macaques using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , a method that exploits nuclear magnetic resonance to study molecules .
They measured the relative concentrations of 21 metabolites and observed systematic differences , demonstrating that metabolite profiles of the brain appear biochemically distinct among the 4 sample groups .
Specifically for schizophrenia , significant differences were observed between schizophrenia patients and controls for 9 of the 21 metabolites .
The altered metabolites play key roles in energy metabolism , neurotransmission and lipid / cell membrane metabolism .
Researchers then measured changes in the two metabolite groups ( 9 metabolites different , 12 metabolites not different ) on the human and chimpanzee lineages .
Strikingly , phylogenetic analysis showed that the distance between human and chimpanzee for the 9 - metabolite group ( i.e. metabolites significantly different between schizophrenia patients and controls ) is more than three times greater than the 12 - metabolite group .
This result suggests that schizophrenia affects biological processes changed during human evolution .
To further substantiate this result , the scientists measured the extent of amino acid and mRNA expression divergence for genes involved in biological processes related to the 9 metabolites significantly altered between schizophrenia patients and controls .
They again found greater divergence between humans and chimpanzees for genes associated with the 9 - metabolite group than the 12 - metabolite group .
Linkage disequilibrium , an indirect but unbiased measure of recent positive selection , further demonstrated that genes associated with metabolites that are altered in schizophrenia and fast evolving on the human lineage display greater amino acid sequence and mRNA expression divergence between humans and chimpanzees that may be due to recent positive selection in humans .
The results suggest that changes in human brain metabolism may have been an important evolutionary step in the development of human cognitive abilities .
The findings are consistent with a theory that schizophrenia is a “ costly by - product of human brain evolution ” [ 1 ] .
According to lead author Dr. Philipp Khaitovich [ 3 ] :
Our brains are unique among all species in their enormous metabolic demand .
If we can explain how our brains sustain such a tremendous metabolic flow , we will have a much better chance to understand how the brain works and why it sometimes breaks .

Today 's Music News Zep without Plant Page 's manager discusses possible tour and album for Zep mark II 07 January 2009 - Legendary rock manager Peter Mensch has been discussing his client Jimmy Page 's plans to reform Led Zeppelin without Robert Plant .
According to Mensch , Jimmy Page , bassist John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham - the son of original Zep drummer John Bonham - look likely to tour , and there 's even talk of recording an album .
“ People do n’t really understand it , ” Mensch told 6 Music , “ Jimmy Page has been playing guitar professionally since he was 16 years old .

Page likes being a musician .
That ’s what he does !
He does n’t want to be a race car driver or a solicitor .
“ So they [ Page , Jones , Bonham ] did the show with Robert Plant ; they had a really good time rehearsing , the three of them , before Robert showed up .
“ And they decided that if they could find a singer that they thought would fit their bill – whatever their bill was at this stage in their career – that they ’d make a record and go on tour .
“ And I support that because , why not ?
That ’s what Jimmy Page does .
That ’s his job , his hobby , his vocation . ”

What are these ?
How is Britain to mark the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ?
With the continued development of £ 12bn plans to set up a vast data silo to store information on all phone calls , emails and internet connections ?
Another soviet style article form Jack Straw , which tells us how the inventory of freedoms has increased under Labour ?
Or the issue of ID cards to foreigners by a government that knows the public do n't give a damn about the rights and privacy of foreigners ?
Somehow we always knew that Jacqui Smith would be at the centre of this important anniversary but you have to hand it to the government : nobody had predicted that human rights and freedom in Britain would be celebrated with the arrest and fingerprinting of an opposition MP by terror police , the search of his premises , hard drives and telephones , the taking of his DNA and the attempted intimidation of his wife , Alicia .
And no one foresaw the good fortune that Green 's young daughter arrived from school to find her home swarming with police .
Why is it so important to the symbolism of the affair ?
Because her appearance allows the police to enter her name on the Merlin database which requires them to take the details of children who come to their attention when a premises is being searched .
No action by the authorities could have better revealed the decay in the chassis of parliamentary democracy .
It captures everything – the seeming politicisation of the police , the unprincipled brass neck of the home secretary , the degradation and failure of the parliamentary authorities and the growing confusion in labour between the roles of the government and state .
Jacqui Smith has been busy saying that she knew nothing of the operation before it took place and that she adhered to the principle that the police should be allowed to pursue the investigation without political interference .
But then under pressure she has begun to hint of a dark interior to this scandal , a conspiracy to distort the political process .
She can't have it both ways .
Either she did know about the operation , in which case she should resign , or she did n't , in which case she should keep quiet on the purpose of the investigation .
My guess is that she did n't have to know about the arrest : she could rely on the anti-terror chief Bob Quick to serve the government 's interests because he so desperately wants Sir Ian Blair 's job .
And we should not forget that the home secretary has just given the police a Christmas present of 10,000 Taser guns .
Labour loves a uniform – especially one that is armed .
The arrest of Green is so grave in its implications that even Labour MPs have begun to wonder who exactly is running the show .
Harriet Harman , once known as a civil libertarian , David Blunkett and Denis MacShane have all protested .
Incidentally , the last time I talked to MacShane – I think it was on the subject of ID cards , which he supports – he told me that the British public wanted a strong state .
But not when it interferes with MPs , it seems .
Let us hope more Labour MPs find the courage to protest at the state opening of parliament for it is only MPs who have a complete understanding of the way parliament has been undermined by Labour – the threats to committee chairmen to follow every dot and comma of the government line , the frequent and cynical use of the guillotine to cut short inconvenient discussion on the business of the house , the replacement in the post of Serjeant - at - Arms of Peter Grant Perkin by Jill Pay who allowed the arrest of Green and finally the attack on sessional orders which define MPs ' rights .
Conservative are at this moment investigating whether they still have the right to debate the matter of Green 's arrest under the sessional orders on Wednesday .
By any standards the authority of parliament has declined since Labour came to power .
There has been an aggregation of power at the centre , a politicisation of the civil service and a decline in the scrutiny and therefore of the government 's accountability to the public .
This has all been presided over by Michael Martin , one of the worst speakers since the war , a man distinguished by his complete failure to understand the duties and the history of his office .
His head should roll but not before we know the full facts about the involvement of Sir David Normington , the permanent secretary at the Home Office .
It shows how far things have gone that the home secretary displays no understanding of the importance of what happened last week .
On Friday she blithely called the objections " disreputable " .
It seems that it has become unacceptable even to question the use of terror police to storm into parliament and search an MP 's office , breaching parliamentary privilege and the privacy all those people who have trusted Green with their confidences .
This episode should not be allowed to die .
It symbolises the attack on parliament started under Tony Blair , who never had any love or understanding of the place .
It is now time for parliament to reassert itself .
One way to do that is to call for the impeachment of those involved .
The threat alone would restore some of the power that has ebbed from parliament over the last dozen or so years .
What we should take away from the arrest of Damian Green are the following .
Terror police were used on an inquiry that involved neither threat to public safety nor a breach of the Official Secrets Act .
That is the definition of function creep and it is an abuse of special tactics and powers .
The authorities are suspected of bugging MPs – the Conservatives are having their offices swept .
Whether they are being bugged or not , we should note that the police seized all Damian Green 's digital equipment and are busily copying his communications and contacts .
If they are prepared to do this without a charge being laid then we must assume that government surveillance will one day include anyone who threatens its interests .
It may already include journalists and activists who are opposed to its policies .
It will certainly do so if Jacqui Smith 's proposals to collect all our communications data go ahead .
And finally we should not forget that the slide in the quality of democracy and the erosion of liberty in Britain have been allowed to take place by MPs and many journalists who simply averted their gaze .
As the News of the World pointed out yesterday , " This is how British liberties are destroyed .
Not by a conniving , cat - stroking prime minister .
But by lack of attention . "
If Rupert Murdoch 's newspaper can see what has happening so should all Labour 's friends in the liberal press who have been in a state of denial .
Pentagon to Get Over 4,000 LED Fixtures
January 10th , 2009 by Jerry James Stone
Cree Inc. will be fitting Wedge 5 of the Pentagon with over 4,000 LED light fixtures .
The U.S. Department of Energy said that LED lighting saved the country about 8.7 trillion watt hoursin 2007 .
This is out of the 765 trillion watt hours used for lighting in the United States .
The LEDs will reduce power usage by 22 percent and pay for themselves in four years .
I ca n’t help but wonder , is the Pentagon trying to get on the good side of President - Elect Barack Obama ?
Details on the deal have been very hush - hush , as one would expect from the Pentagon , but Cree did say the fixtures would cost about $ 380 apiece .
Funding comes from Title III , a Department of Defense program designed to “ promote creation and strengthening of domestic industrial capabilities to support national security needs . ”
A goal of the program is to enable early adoption , and drive down the cost , of new tech for weapon systems – eek !

Al - Shabab Islamist militants were seen parading in Baidoa
Islamist insurgents have captured most of Somalia 's central city of Baidoa - one of the last strongholds of the fragile transitional government .
Officials and witnesses say Islamists have seized the parliament building in the city , some 250 km ( 155 miles ) north - west of the capital Mogadishu .
Some reports say the presidential palace is also under their control .
The MPs are currently meeting in neighbouring Djibouti , where they are due to elect a new president this week .
They have voted to expand parliament to bring some 200 moderate Islamists into parliament .
They are also expected to vote on whether to delay the presidential election , which is currently due before Wednesday .
Negotiations
Islamist insurgents from the al - Shabab group entered Baidoa from two different directions on Monday , officials say .
There were reports of heavy fighting in the city .
Eyewitnesses said the militants were later seen on the streets of Baidoa , shouting " Allahu Akbar ! [ God is Great ! ] " .
Negotiations are now under way between the militants and representatives of the transitional government to try to find a peaceful settlement .
There has been widespread looting in Baidoa since the last Ethiopian troops pulled out overnight .
The Ethiopian troops withdrew after two years of battling Islamist insurgents .
Some 16,000 civilians have been killed in the conflict and a million more have been forced from their homes .
Somalia has not had an effective national government since 1991 , since when various militias have been battling for control .
It has been an interesting couple of days .
Today yet another scientist has come forward with a press release saying that not only did their audit of IPCC forecasting procedures and found that they “ violated 72 scientific principles of forecasting ” , but that “ The models were not intended as forecasting models and they have not been validated for that purpose . ”
This organization should know , they certify forecasters for many disciplines and in conjunction with John Hopkins University if Washington , DC , offer a Certificate of Forecasting Practice .
The story below originally appeared in the blog of Australian Dr. Jennifer Marohasy .
It is reprinted below , with with some pictures and links added for WUWT readers .
– Anthony
J. Scott Armstrong , founder of the International Journal of Forecasting
Guest post by Jennifer Marohasy
YESTERDAY , a former chief at NASA , Dr John S. Theon , slammed the computer models used to determine future climate claiming they are not scientific in part because the modellers have “ resisted making their work transparent so that it can be replicated independently by other scientists ” . [ 1 ]
Today , a founder of the International Journal of Forecasting , Journal of Forecasting , International Institute of Forecasters , and International Symposium on Forecasting , and the author of Long - range Forecasting ( 1978 , 1985 ) , the Principles of Forecasting Handbook , and over 70 papers on forecasting , Dr J. Scott Armstrong , tabled a statement declaring that the forecasting process used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) lacks a scientific basis . [ 2 ]
What these two authorities , Drs Theon and Armstrong , are independently and explicitly stating is that the computer models underpinning the work of many scientific institutions concerned with global warming , including Australia ’s CSIRO , are fundamentally flawed .
In today ’s statement , made with economist Kesten Green , Dr Armstrong provides the following eight reasons as to why the current IPCC computer models lack a scientific basis :
1 . No scientific forecasts of the changes in the Earth ’s climate .
Currently , the only forecasts are those based on the opinions of some scientists .
Computer modeling was used to create scenarios ( i.e. , stories ) to represent the scientists ’ opinions about what might happen .
The models were not intended as forecasting models ( Trenberth 2007 ) and they have not been validated for that purpose .
Since the publication of our paper , no one has provided evidence to refute our claim that there are no scientific forecasts to support global warming .
We conducted an audit of the procedures described in the IPCC report and found that they clearly violated 72 scientific principles of forecasting ( Green and Armstrong 2008 ) .
( No justification was provided for any of these violations . )
For important forecasts , we can see no reason why any principle should be violated .
We draw analogies to flying an aircraft or building a bridge or performing heart surgery — given the potential cost of errors , it is not permissible to violate principles .
2. Improper peer review process .
To our knowledge , papers claiming to forecast global warming have not been subject to peer review by experts in scientific forecasting .
3. Complexity and uncertainty of climate render expert opinions invalid for forecasting .
Expert opinions are an inappropriate forecasting method in situations that involve high complexity and high uncertainty .
This conclusion is based on over eight decades of research .
Armstrong ( 1978 ) provided a review of the evidence and this was supported by Tetlock ’s ( 2005 ) study that involved 82,361 forecasts by 284 experts over two decades .
Long - term climate changes are highly complex due to the many factors that affect climate and to their interactions .
Uncertainty about long - term climate changes is high due to a lack of good knowledge about such things as :
a ) causes of climate change ,
b ) direction , lag time , and effect size of causal factors related to climate change ,
c ) effects of changing temperatures , and
d ) costs and benefits of alternative actions to deal with climate changes ( e.g. , CO2 markets ) .
Given these conditions , expert opinions are not appropriate for long - term climate predictions .
4. Forecasts are needed for the effects of climate change .
Even if it were possible to forecast climate changes , it would still be necessary to forecast the effects of climate changes .
In other words , in what ways might the effects be beneficial or harmful ?
Here again , we have been unable to find any scientific forecasts — as opposed to speculation — despite our appeals for such studies .
We addressed this issue with respect to studies involving the possible classification of polar bears as threatened or endangered ( Armstrong , Green , and Soon 2008 ) .
In our audits of two key papers to support the polar bear listing , 41 principles were clearly violated by the authors of one paper and 61 by the authors of the other .
It is not proper from a scientific or from a practical viewpoint to violate any principles .
Again , there was no sign that the forecasters realized that they were making mistakes .
5 . Forecasts are needed of the costs and benefits of alternative actions that might be taken to combat climate change .
Assuming that climate change could be accurately forecast , it would be necessary to forecast the costs and benefits of actions taken to reduce harmful effects , and to compare the net benefit with other feasible policies including taking no action .
Here again we have been unable to find any scientific forecasts despite our appeals for such studies .
6 . To justify using a climate forecasting model , one would need to test it against a relevant naïve model .
We used the Forecasting Method Selection
Tree to help determine which method is most appropriate for forecasting long - term climate change .
A copy of the Tree is attached as Appendix 1 .
It is drawn from comparative empirical studies from all areas of forecasting .
It suggests that extrapolation is appropriate , and we chose a naïve ( no change ) model as an appropriate benchmark .
A forecasting model should not be used unless it can be shown to provide forecasts that are more accurate than those from this naïve model , as it would otherwise increase error .
In Green , Armstrong and Soon ( 2008 ) , we show that the mean absolute error of 108 naïve forecasts for 50 years in the future was 0.24°C .
7 . The climate system is stable .
To assess stability , we examined the errors from naïve forecasts for up to 100 years into the future .
Using the U.K.
Met Office Hadley Centre ’s data , we started with 1850 and used that year ’s average temperature as our forecast for the next 100 years .
We then calculated the errors for each forecast horizon from 1 to 100 .
We repeated the process using the average temperature in 1851 as our naïve forecast for the next 100 years , and so on .
This “ successive updating ” continued until year 2006 , when we forecasted a single year ahead .
This provided 157 one - year - ahead forecasts , 156 two - year - ahead and so on to 58 100 - year - ahead forecasts .
We then examined how many forecasts were further than 0.5 °C from the observed value .
Fewer than 13 % of forecasts of up to 65 - years - ahead had absolute errors larger than 0.5°C .
For longer horizons , fewer than 33 % had absolute errors larger than 0.5°C .
Given the remarkable stability of global mean temperature , it is unlikely that there would be any practical benefits from a forecasting method that provided more accurate forecasts .
8 . Be conservative and avoid the precautionary principle .
One of the primary scientific principles in forecasting is to be conservative in the darkness of uncertainty .
This principle also argues for the use of the naive no -change extrapolation .
Some have argued for the precautionary principle as a way to be conservative .
It is a political , not a scientific principle .
As we explain in our essay in Appendix 2 , it is actually an anti-scientific principle in that it attempts to make decisions without using rational analyses .
Instead , cost / benefit analyses are appropriate given the available evidence which suggests that temperature is just as likely to go up as down .
However , these analyses should be supported by scientific forecasts .
The reach of these models is extraordinary , for example , the CSIRO models are currently being used in Australia to determine water allocations for farmers and to justify the need for an Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) – the most far - reaching of possible economic interventions .
Yet , according to Dr Armstrong , these same models violate 72 scientific principles .

Bay Area sees deals on homes for under $ 100,000 Banks want to unload huge inventories of foreclosed properties at bargain - basement prices
This 2 - bedroom , 1 - bathroom house in Vallejo is listed for $ 79,900 .

Realtor Gina Foronda no sooner listed the four - bedroom San Pablo home for sale than the offers started rolling in .
Within three days , she had seven bids , the top one for 18 percent over the asking price .
It sounds like the frenzied height of the real estate bubble .
But this property has a jaw - dropping feature that would have seemed preposterous two years ago .
Its list price ?
A mere $ 95,000 .
While five - figure homes are run of the mill in places such as Oklahoma or Mississippi , in the Bay Area you could n't buy a doghouse for that amount .
Until recently .
Today , more than 600 properties currently on the market here are listed below $ 100,000 .
Agents say prices dipped that low starting this summer , as banks became increasingly eager to unload huge inventories of foreclosed homes .
" When you tell people you can buy a house in the Bay Area for under $ 100,000 , it gets their attention , " said Carylon Dopp , a Realtor with Security Pacific Real Estate in Richmond .
These el- cheapo listings are not condos , trailers or manufactured houses .
They are stand - alone , single - family homes , albeit modest ones , generally about two bedrooms and 800 square feet .
Almost always bank - repossessed , they 're concentrated in the foreclosure - stricken areas of Alameda , Contra Costa and Solano counties , such as East Oakland , Richmond , Antioch and Vallejo .
Needless to say , five - figure homes are not always in pristine condition .
Instead of a white picket fence , expect chain link , perhaps with a barbed - wire accent .
Not only are there no granite countertops , often there also are no stoves , refrigerators , sinks - or even plumbing .
They are the ultimate handyman specials .
" I think it 's a shock to everyone that there are homes under $ 100,000 , " said David Kerr , a Realtor with ZipRealty in northern Alameda County , who has several clients house - shopping in that price range .
" Then you go into these houses , and you can understand why they 're that low because of some of the work that is needed .
They 've had partial remodels , they 're sitting on a brick foundation , or the plumbing has been ripped out . "
In more - affordable Solano County , five - figure properties tend to be in better shape .
" It 's amazing , in Vallejo for 99 grand you can get a cute little three ( bedroom ) and two ( bathroom ) in a decent neighborhood , " said Mark Miller , a Realtor with Re / Max Gold in Vallejo .
" Some need work , but many do n't . "
Homes can be bargains
Despite the repair issues , many agents said the homes can be bargains , representing a chance for first - time home buyers to own for less than the cost of rent , or for investors to acquire properties that will produce positive cash flow without a huge down payment .
In some cases , the needed work is largely cosmetic .
" You have to be aware of the area you 're buying in ; just because it 's cheap does n't necessarily mean it's a good deal , " Kerr said .
" You 're not going to find these properties in Montclair or Rockridge .
The neighborhoods range from fairly decent to fairly marginal .
A number are in areas where the regular resell houses are in the $ 250,000 to $ 350,000 range , although those are in better condition .
People can walk in , ( make some repairs ) and have instant equity . "
Anja Ulfeldt , a photographer who lives in Oakland , is currently house - hunting for an under - $ 99,000 property in Oakland ; Kerr is her agent .
" I'm a single person , 29 and an artist , I did n't really think I would be able to buy a home in the Bay Area , " she said .
" It 's exciting and a bit daunting .
I 'm a real do - it - yourself type ; I like the idea of getting a fixer , but I do n't have deep pockets to put into it . "
In the past couple of months , she 's viewed many homes in her price range and been out - bid on a couple .
" If they 're in good shape and they 're that price , then they are definitely in a bad neighborhood , " she said .
" If they 're in bad shape and that price , you might get a better neighborhood . "
The four - bedroom San Pablo house with seven offers exemplifies the latter circumstance .
Located in the Montalvin Manor neighborhood , which was a redevelopment district in 2003 , it is surrounded by suburban homes that appear tidy and relatively well - maintained , although many have " For Sale " signs .
From the front yard , you can see an expansive view of San Pablo Bay , as well as busy San Pablo Avenue .
Magnet for vandals
The home 's long vacancy has attracted vandals .
Graffiti is spray - painted on the fence .
As soon as you walk in , the stench of a mildewed carpet is apparent .
All the plumbing - pipes , faucets , toilets - has been ripped out .
In one room , daylight filters in through a hole in the wall .
So would a real estate agent hold an open house on such a property ?
Foronda , who currently is listing this property along with about a dozen bank - owned properties for less than $ 99,000 ( plus six dozen more at higher prices ) had a hearty laugh at that idea .
" How are you going to stage them ? " she said .
" Holes in the walls , missing plumbing , missing electrical wires , bad areas .
Oh my gosh , I am not going to sit there with those kinds of homes in those areas . "
As an agent specializing in bank - owned properties , known in the trade as REOs , for real - estate owned by banks , her commission is 2 percent of the sales price .
" For one of these $ 99,000 houses I make $ 2,000 .
REO agents have to work on volume , " she said .
Mason Yanowitz , a Realtor with Century 21 Landmark Excellence , recently sold a home on Cherry Street in Oakland for $ 49,000 to an investor , who reportedly had a tenant lined up to pay $ 1,000 a month in rent .
In May 2006 , the same house sold for $ 290,000 .
" They wanted to get a price reduction on that thing , but I had to play hardball and tell them we 're not going to entertain that , " Yanowitz said .
" They told me they can rent it out for $ 1,000 a month .
If you put $ 49,000 in the bank , you would n't make $ 1,000 a month on it . "
All - cash deals
Many under - $ 99,000 houses , especially if they 're in poor shape , are sold in all - cash deals .
Banks wo n't write mortgages for uninhabitable properties , although the Federal Housing Administration insures a loan for fixer - upper homes called the 203( k ) .
Buyers of five - figure properties might be surprised to find themselves in bubble - style bidding wars .
" You have to get to them very quickly , " Kerr said .
" Most banks will have a property actively marketed for three or four days before they look at offers , but once they do , they will take the highest and best offer . "
Doug Gillies of Douglas & Co. Real Estate , recently sold a bank - owned , one - bedroom , 650 - square - foot Oakland house near Children 's Hospital for $ 105,500 - 37 percent above asking .
" I had four or five offers , " he said .
" The one that was successful was an investor .
The others were from first - time home buyers . "
Gillies had recommended that the bank price the home between $ 99,000 to $ 110,000 , but was told to list it at $ 77,000 .
" It 's my first under - $ 100,000 property , and nothing surprises me anymore with the banks , " he said .
" They just do what they do ; they have their system , how they pick the price , I could n't tell you . "
Yanowitz said he could see the rationale for the bargain pricing .
" That 's a nice number , under $ 100,000 , " he said .
" People look at it as a green light . "

The spot where US soldiers forced naked Iraqis to form a human pyramid now smells of fresh paint and disinfectant .
The prison wing where hundreds more were executed during Saddam Hussein 's regime is silent and empty , but for a few desks and documents that stand testament to his sadism .
There are signs of new beginnings at the reborn Abu Ghraib jail as it prepares to open its doors again to prisoners ; there are greenhouses under construction , a rehabilitated sports yard , a barber shop - even beehives .
But the ghosts of an infamous past are never far away throughout the whitewashed , 10 - acre block on the western outskirts of Baghdad .
Five years after Abu Ghraib entered the global lexicon it is , to many Iraqis , still a site of degradation and a forbidding reminder of the American occupation .
This month , Abu Ghraib will receive inmates , many from the two US detention centres in Iraq - Camp Cropper and Camp Bucca - that this year are handing over detainees at rates unparalleled in the six years since the invading US army captured its first detainee .
In keeping with the spirit of renewal , the jail is to be renamed Baghdad Central Prison .
But Abu Ghraib 's new branding does not mean that its inmates , or its reputation , will soon change .
Iraqi authorities yesterday offered the first public glimpse inside Abu Ghraib since it was closed in mid 2006 and was transformed into a parking lot for army trucks .
Part of the prison reopened in November , with about 500 inmates now serving time there .
Up to 10,000 more will soon follow , including hardcore political prisoners and criminals sentenced to long terms .
Under current plans , many detainees in the US system deemed either hardcore , or irredeemable , will be sent here again , meaning that the prison will have come full circle since the Americans left in disgrace shortly after revelations of humiliation and torture of detainees were made public in the US media .
Shareef al - Raddi , who will act as the inaugural director of the new Abu Ghraib , said the facility would hold about a third of its former numbers .
" Already we have 400 and they will soon include Arabs and other foreigners , " he said .
" Abu Ghraib now is a source of rehabilitation , not like it was before .
" There are halls and places in which death sentences were handed down and executions carried out during the time of Saddam .
We have kept them as they are to remind people of the brutality of the previous regime .
We left it as it was so people will remember .
There is nothing to document the abuse of the Americans .
The prison under the old regime represented oppression , humiliation and torture for the Iraqi people .
And after 2003 , everyone saw what the Americans did here .
This is not the same Abu Ghraib . "
Raad Sayed , a Baghdad local , spent nearly three months in Abu Ghraib between February and May 2004 .
He has not told his story before , though his account of abuse is similar to that of others repeated over the past five years , which include evidence of dogs used to terrorise naked men , electrocutions and mock executions .
" I was taken from the Ameriyeh district [ in Baghdad ] to a police academy , " he said .
" From there I was put in a car belonging to the Americans .
My legs and hands were handcuffed and I was taken to Abu Ghraib .
We were handed over . "
While not himself claiming to have been badly abused , Sayed says others in his cell were regularly beaten and brutalised .
He alleges that two inmates in particular were targeted .
" One was called Hamudi and the other Abu Raya .
They were both beaten to a point where they could n't stand or use the toilet themselves .
I was forced to stand outside in a tent in my underwear and a female US soldier used to come into our cell asking who wanted to have sex with her .
From Abu Ghraib , Sayed was taken to Camp Bucca , near the Kuwaiti border , considered a centre for suspected hardcore militia members , mainly al - Qaida , or the Mahdi army .
He was released 18 months later in December 2005 .
With its fierce desert summers and uncompromising regime , Bucca has long been considered by Iraqi detainees to be the Middle Eastern version of Guantánamo Bay .
But that is about to change .
Under the Status of Forces security agreement signed between Iraq and the US late last year , Bucca is scheduled to close by midsummer , with all of its detainees transferred to the Iraqi prison system or released .
The agreement means the US military can no longer keep detainees without a valid detention order issued by an Iraqi court and must progressively release them to the vagaries of the Iraqi judicial system , which requires two witnesses and a confession to keep an accused person in custody .
" Our goal is to be close to being out of detainee operations by the end of 2009 , " said Brigadier General David Quantock , who runs the US detention programme in Iraq .
" We want all of them gone or transferred to the government of Iraq . "
Quantock claims the US exit strategy will be met with rising competence in the Iraqi justice system : " I am confident the rule of law will prevail .
" Sometimes , whether you go to Great Britain or the United States , a guilty guy goes free .
Most of the folks that we have , the vast majority got in this business because of money , there were no jobs or because of fear of their lives , or because if you grow up in a bad neighbourhood you become a bad guy . "
But among those the US army holds on to are about 5,000 men believed to be ideologically committed to the global jihadi insurgency .
Among that group are a further 1,000 deemed to be " irreconcilables " .
Many of these men will soon be heading back to Abu Ghraib .
" You do n't want to put the really bad guys in with the moderates , " Quantock said .
" So we practise the traditional counter - insurgency strategy of trying to insert a wedge between the extremists and the moderates .
It sometimes takes a couple of years to figure it out .
But for the most part we can get pretty close on some of these guys . "
At Camp Cropper , a large , mainly open - air prison about a third the size of Abu Ghraib , detainees in garish yellow overalls mill around in separated wings , alleged al - Qaida members on one side and members of the Shia militia , the Mahdi army , on the other .
" The war 's still on for these guys , " said Camp Cropper 's director , Brigadier General Robert Kenyon , as he walked the line above the perimeter wall earlier this month .
Beneath were dozens of vibrantly coloured prayer mats laid out between concrete dormitories .
This was deemed the al - Qaida wing .
" You do n't get a lot of interaction from these guys . "
Alongside , US military police and Iraqi corrections officers were firing less - than - lethal rounds at people - shaped tin cut -outs in full view of the suspected insurgents , who paid them no heed .
Idling ominously next to them was a giant circular machine on top of a Humvee , which can be used as a crowd control measure to emit piercing noises .
" That thing will make you lose control of your bodily functions , " said another US officer .
" They 're scared of it because they think it fries their brains .
We have n't had to use it yet . "
Iraqi officers spoke of skills training , which makes up a large part of detention centre life in Camp Cropper .
Sewing classes are popular , as are computer courses and carpentry .
Prisoners receive up to $ 1 a day .
Vocational training is being actively pushed as a means of putting a wedge between the abuses of the past and the detention centres now .
Several signs at Camp Cropper order guards to " treat detainees with dignity and respect " .
However , the legacy of Abu Ghraib seems never far away .
" That was an unhappy time in this campaign , " said Quantock .
" We have learnt a lot and developed programmes to prevent anything like that from ever happening again . "
Detention network
10,000 inmates will be sent to the newly named Baghdad central prison .
• During Saddam 's regime , Abu Ghraib regularly held 30,000 - plus inmates .
• The US military now has 14,410 detainees in Iraq , among them 2,453 being processed by the country 's legal system .
• Camp Bucca on the Kuwait border is the biggest US detention centre , with about 8,000 detainees .
Camp Cropper near Baghdad holds about 3,200 .
• Camp Bucca is scheduled to close by mid-year .
It is the biggest US detention centre in the world , rivalling Bagram air base in Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay in Cuba for infamy .
• The US detainee programme is due to wind down by the end of this year .

The pilot who safely landed a jet in New York 's Hudson River has received a hero 's welcome in his hometown of Danville , California .
As thousands of people waved US flags and cheered loudly , Captain Chesley " Sully " Sullenberger said he and his crew were only doing their jobs .
Officials honoured his family with a ceremony on Danville 's town green and presented him with a medal .
He is credited with saving the lives of all 155 passengers earlier this month .
But the celebrated captain gave credit to his crew .
' Miracle ' on water " Circumstance determined that it was this experienced crew that was scheduled to fly that particular flight on that particular day , " he told the 3,000 or so people gathered to welcome him home in the San Francisco suburb .
About 3,000 people attended the ceremony to honour Mr Sullenberger " But I know I can speak for the entire crew when I tell you we were simply doing the job we were trained to do . "
Mr Sullenberger 's brief comments were his first since he safely landed the US Airways Airbus A320 on the icy river on 15 January , in what New York Gov David Paterson called " a miracle on the Hudson . "
The former US Air Force pilot and air safety consultant was the last to leave the ditched airliner after ensuring the safety of all passengers and crew .
Wife 's tribute Mr Sullenberger 's wife , Lorraine , said through tears that she was not surprised by her husband 's heroism .
" I have always known him to be an exemplary pilot .
I knew what the outcome would be that day because I knew my husband , " she said .
" But mostly for me , he 's the man that makes my cup of tea every morning , " she added .
Mr Sullenberger , 57 , was also given the keys to Danville and made an honorary Danville police officer .
His first full comments are expected in an interview with Katie Couric on the CBS show 60 Minutes , scheduled to air on 8 February .

It 's been three years since The New York Times first broke the news of the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program , based on information provided by an anonymous source .
Today the identity of the Times ' Deep Throat is finally revealed to be a 56 - year - old former prosecutor in the Justice Department named Thomas Tamm , whose " passion for justice " led him to make a fateful call to the Times one day in 2004 from a phone booth in a Washington , D.C. , subway station .
The information is reported in a fascinating tale published not by the Times , but by Newsweek .
Newsweek describes how Tamm discovered the secret program and agonized about what to do before finally making the call to reporter Eric Lichtblau at the Times .
It also details the depression and constant fear he 's faced since then , knowing that he could be arrested any day and charged with a felony for revealing classified information .
Tamm was not the Times ' only source , but was the first to come forward with news of the surveillance program .
He was motivated by a need to do what was " right , " and was stunned that someone higher up than him did n't speak up about the program .
Tamm thought Congress and the public should know about the spying to debate its lawfulness .
He was also motivated by anger over the administration 's introduction of the controversial " enhanced " interrogation methods of prisoners at Guantanamo and elsewhere .
He hails from a family of high - ranking FBI officials ( his father and uncle were top aides to former FBI leader J. Edgar Hoover ; his brother was an FBI agent and investigator for the 9/11 Commission ) , and he held a Top Secret / SCI clearance at the Justice Department 's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review , where he was tasked with processing national security wiretaps in cases targeting suspected spies and terrorists .
That 's where he learned that some wiretap requests never made it to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for review and approval .
Instead , he discovered , they went straight to Attorney General John Ashcroft and the FISA court 's chief judge .
These requests , he learned , related to something that people in his office called simply " the program . "
Tamm told Times reporters Eric Lichtblau and James Risen about the program 's existence , but provided no operational details because he did n't know how the program worked .
Those details were provided to the Times by other sources .
Some revelations from the piece :
The code name for the NSA 's phone call and e-mail collection program was " Stellar Wind . "
The secret wiretap requests began in October 2001 .
Tamm tried to discuss the issue with a former colleague who worked for the Senate Judiciary Committee but was shut down by the colleague who did n't want to discuss anything related to government secrets .
The secret wiretap requests went only to Ashcroft and the FISA court 's chief judge , initially U.S. Judge Royce C. Lamberth but later Colleen Kollar - Kotelly , bypassing the other 10 judges on the court .
Targets for surveillance were chosen based on data obtained from computers and cellphones seized from Al Qaeda members overseas :
If , for example , a Qaeda cell phone seized in Pakistan had dialed a phone number in the United States , the NSA would target the U.S. phone number–which would then lead agents to look at other numbers in the United States and abroad called by the targeted phone .
Other parts of the program were far more sweeping .
The NSA , with the secret cooperation of U.S. telecommunications companies , had begun collecting vast amounts of information about the phone and e-mail records of American citizens .
Separately , the NSA was also able to access , for the first time , massive volumes of personal financial records–such as credit - card transactions , wire transfers and bank withdrawals –that were being reported to the Treasury Department by financial institutions .
These included millions of " suspicious - activity reports , " or SARS , according to two former Treasury officials who declined to be identified talking about sensitive programs .
( It was one such report that tipped FBI agents to former New York governor Eliot Spitzer 's use of prostitutes . )
These records were fed into NSA supercomputers for the purpose of " data mining " –looking for links or patterns that might ( or might not ) suggest terrorist activity .
Because intelligence obtained without a court order could n't be used in criminal court , counterterrorism officials would examine the surveillance information already obtained without an order to find a reason for requesting a legitimate FISA warrant and cover their illegal tracks .
When FISA Judge Royce C. Lamberth learned that information from warrantless surveillance was showing up in court - reviewed FISA warrant requests he warned Justice officials to keep the information out of the warrant requests or he'd force a showdown by ruling on whether the program was legal or not .
In doing so , Lamberth allowed the Justice Department to continue the warrantless wiretapping without challenge .
Tamm found nothing unique about the special wiretap requests to justify the runaround of the FISA court .
In early 2004 , the FISA court 's chief judge , Kollar - Kotelly , grew concerned that data obtained through warrantless wiretapping was still be being " backdoored " into legitimate FISA warrant requests and raised objections .
Tamm was told she wanted to put an end to the special requests .
A handful of colleagues in the Justice Department expressed doubts to Tamm about the program being legal and one even ventured that Ashcroft could get indicted for it .
These days Tamm is self - employed as a sometimes - public defender , and is struggling with $ 30,000 in debt .
He suffers from depression and waits in anguish to find out what will happen to him .
A Justice Department prosecutor has told his lawyer that the department will wait to decide whether to prosecute him until the Obama administration takes office .
As* Newsweek * notes , the case presents a dilemma for Obama and his new attorney general , Eric Holder , since both condemned the warrantless wiretapping program when it came to light and now will have to decide whether Tamm is a hero or a traitor .

A test case for the new government will be how it deals with the pharmaceutical industry , which rivals the gun manufacturers and tobacco companies for the position of most amoral industry in America .
Democrats have long been promising to stand up to Big Pharma on issues like Medicare drug pricing and importing drugs from Canada , but they ’ve accomplished little since they won Congressional majorities in 2006 .
If they truly want to reign in the drugmakers now that they have the clout , they ’ll need to not only move forward on these hot - button issues , but also completely overhaul the Food and Drug Administration , which stands as one of the most corrupt and compromised bodies in the federal government today .
Last week offered a glimmer of hope , with a bipartisan bill aimed at one of the many scurrilous practices employed by drug companies to win swift approval for their products and push them on the public .
Called the Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2009 , the legislation was introduced last Thursday by Senators Herb Kohl ( D - WI ) , Chair of the Senate Special Committee on the Aging , and Charles Grassley ( R - IA ) , in the past a rare Republican voice opposing some of Big Pharma ’s outrages .
They are calling for establishment of “ a nationwide standard requiring drug , device and biologic makers to report payments to doctors to the Department of Health and Human Services and for those payments to be posted online in a user friendly way for public consumption . ”
Let ’s be clear :
The proposed legislation does n’t say that doctors ca n’t receive money ( or expensive dinners , or luxury junkets ) while they are testing or endorsing new drugs ; it merely says the payments have to be made public .
Even this , however , has apparently proven too much for the Food and Drug Administration : A report released earlier this month found that the FDA had been sorely lax in demanding full disclosure of these relationships .
As reported by Bloomberg News :
Drug regulators have n’t done enough to force disclosure of financial conflicts of interest among the researchers who conduct clinical trials of medications and medical devices , according to a U.S. government investigation .
A total of 42 percent of marketing applications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were missing financial information that was supposed to be submitted by drug and device makers , according to a report today by the Health and Human Services Department ’s inspector general .
The FDA did n’t act against the companies , the report said .
Financial connections between companies that make drugs and devices and the doctors and other researchers who test them on humans may compromise the safety of patients in studies and the integrity of the results , according to the inspector general ’s report .
Lawmakers , led by Senator Charles Grassley , a Republican from Iowa , have raised concern that financial conflicts of interest among doctors and manufacturers may influence prescribing decisions .
The FDA has fallen a long way since 1962 , when legendary Senator Estes Kefauver championed its expansion , insisting that it was the federal government ’s responsibility to protect the public by ensuring that prescription drugs were both safe and efficacious .
The FDA has for decades been playing footsy with the drug industry , and it reached new lows under George W. Bush , as fundamentalist Christianity became yet another force undermining the agency ’s work .
Bush ’s appointments to the FDA leadership included a veterinarian who presided over the Vioxx scandal and stalled the Plan B pill , and a faith - based gynecologist who refused to prescribe contraceptives to married women and advised prayer as a treatment for many female ailments .
In a 2006 survey of FDA employees , more than 40 percent said they knew of cases in which political appointees had interfered with agency decisions .
At that time , more than 100 whistleblower cases were also pending at the agency .
Some things will now surely change at the FDA– but how much , and how soon ?
Obama has yet to announce his nominee for FDA commissioner , but HHS Secretary Tom Daschle talked about the agency at confirmation hearings earlier this month , promising “ to ensure that trust in FDA is restored as the leading science - based regulatory agency in the world .
… I will send a clear message from the top that the President and I expect key decisions at the FDA to be made on the basis of science–period . ”
It ’s true that we ’re unlikely to see prayer meetings in Tom Daschle ’s HHS .
But independence from Big Pharma is another story .
Since leaving Congress , Daschle has been working as an “ adviser ” to health care industry clients , including at the law and lobbying firm Alston & Bird .
As the New York Times reported at the time his nomination :
Although not a registered lobbyist , Mr. Daschle , a South Dakota Democrat who was party leader in the Senate , provides strategic advice to the firm ’s clients about how to influence government policy or actions ….
As examples of the firm ’s achievements the Web site lists matters involving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements , approvals of federally regulated drugs and medical products , fraud investigations , medical waste disposal , privacy and other compliance issues .
On the day Tom Daschle was nominated , the Washington Post ‘s “ The Ticker ” blog reported :

Los Angeles Police Department fingerprint examiners who falsely implicated at least two people in crimes have been linked to nearly 1,000 other criminal cases that authorities say must now be reviewed to ensure that similar errors were n’t made .
Nearly two dozen of those cases are awaiting trial in the Los Angeles court system , said Sandi Gibbons , a spokeswoman for Dist .
Atty Steve Cooley .
Prosecutors began a review of the cases as part of their work with a multi-agency task force formed by Chief William J. Bratton last fall in the wake of a Times article that revealed that six print analysts with the LAPD latent print section had made critical errors in their work .
“ Our goal is to go through all of [ the cases ] within about three months , starting with the D.A. 's priorities , ” LAPD Deputy Chief Charlie Beck said .
Even though the review focuses on the work of the six analysts , Beck said LAPD officials would conduct random sample tests for the entire latent print unit .

The LAPD ’s effort to reform the unit , however , has moved slowly because of a lack of funding .
Beck said the department has not secured the $ 400,000 to $ 500,000 in grants it sought to bring in an outside firm to review practices and protocols of the 80 - person fingerprint unit .
He said he is determined to move forward with the help of prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies .
The review of cases is being conducted by six of the LAPD ’s top fingerprint experts .
In a limited number of reviews so far , no new wrongful charges have emerged , officials said .
Nonetheless , none of the six analysts has been allowed to resume print work , several have been disciplined and one has been fired , according to Beck .
The multi-agency task force , which includes the LAPD , FBI , district attorney ’s office , city attorney , the Police Commission ’s inspector general and the L.A. County public defender ’s office , was formed in October but has yet to meet .
Beck said that the entire body would not meet until next month but that a core group of top LAPD officials meets regularly and that the department has regularly consulted with other agencies and experts .
Jennifer Friedman , forensic science coordinator for the L.A. County public defender ’s office , said she and others would like more information .
“ The LAPD may be meeting every day , but the other participants are n’t involved , ” she said .
The public defender ’s office has requested extensive records from the LAPD about its internal fingerprint processes , she said .
After an inquiry from The Times , Friedman said Wednesday , she received an invitation to meet with the LAPD and the district attorney ’s office .

A recent Times investigation found that errors were partly the result of the unit ’s being marred by inadequate training , antiquated facilities , poor supervision , careless handling of evidence and other shortfalls .
Friedman said prosecutors have provided the public defender with the list of 945 cases involving the questionable print examiners .
She said the list is probably not comprehensive because it was derived from subpoenas of LAPD print examiners for each case .
She said that in other cases , the print examiner could have done work after charges were filed .
Prosecutors said , however , that fingerprint evidence probably played a minor role in the cases .
“ In a lot of these cases , the fingerprint evidence was n’t necessary .
In most of these cases , there were [ guilty or no contest ] pleas , ” said Gibbons , the district attorney ’s office spokeswoman .

The issues with the latent print section came to light in April 2006 , when prosecutors informed the unit that a renowned fingerprint expert had testified that LAPD analysts had made a mistake on a case .
Months before , one of the unit ’s print specialists had determined that several prints lifted from a cellphone store where a burglary had occurred belonged to Maria Maldonado .
Two others in the unit had signed off on the work .
The woman was charged with the burglary .
Maldonado said detectives went to her home in southeast Los Angeles County on the basis of the fingerprint evidence and rummaged through her clothing .
They found a sweat shirt they said looked like one worn by one of the burglars , whose faces were not visible on the store ’s security video .
They took her to a couple of San Fernando Valley cellphone stores , she said , asking each time how she got in .
“ I told them I never been there , ” she said .
The analysts stood by their work , but days later the file containing the suspected burglar ’s prints disappeared from the unlocked drawer where it was kept .
Working from copies of the prints , others in the unit and outside consultants later concluded that Maldonado had been wrongly accused , and the charges were dropped .
Advertisement
Her case coincided with one in which a person was extradited from Alabama to face burglary charges after analysts matched the prints to a crime scene .
The mistake was caught as prosecutors prepared for trial .
A subsequent internal report highlighted the errors and many of the ongoing problems in the unit .
But Bratton did not create the task force or tighten the procedure for verifying fingerprint matches until The Times obtained that document and made its findings public .

Beck said changes in the way examiners verify prints have been made to guard against future mistakes .
“ Our current . . . process should eliminate this issue as we move forward , ” he said .

WASHINGTON -- About 40 % of the nation 's local broadcast stations want to shut off analog broadcasts by next week , raising concerns that thousands of Americans soon could lose TV service despite Congress 's recent decision to postpone the digital TV switch .
Congress approved delaying the mandatory switch to digital - only television to June 12 , but local stations can ask to switch earlier than that .
Many want to do so , hoping to save thousands of dollars they would have to pay to continue broadcasting in both analog and digital for a few more months .
Lawmakers did n't anticipate that so many stations -- nearly 2 in 5 -- would want to shut off analog signals Tuesday , and the development raises the likelihood that some consumers will become even more confused about what to do .
At the Federal Communications Commission , officials are considering denying some stations ' requests so communities wo n't be left without at least one local channel .
" It 's important to understand that while a significant number of broadcasters want to shut off their signals early for economic reasons , the FCC will work hard to ensure entire markets are n't blocked out , " said Robert McDowell , a Republican FCC commissioner .
Interim FCC Chairman Michael Copps declined to comment .
Most Americans wo n't be affected by the switch to digital because they subscribe to cable or satellite TV services .
About 20 million U.S. households rely on free over - the - air TV , although millions of viewers have already prepared for the digital switch by installing set - top converter boxes .
Nielsen Co. recently estimated that about six million homes nationally are unprepared for the switch .

The bold effort the present ( central ) bank had made to control the government ... are but premonitions of the fate that await the American people should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like it .
Andrew Jackson quote s :
The brave man inattentive to his duty , is worth little more to his country than the coward who deserts her in the hour of danger .
Andrew Jackson quote s :
Every man is equally entitled to protection by law ; but when the laws undertake to add … artificial distinctions , to grant titles , gratuities , and exclusive privileges , to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful , the humble members of society -- the farmers , mechanics , and laborers -- who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves , have a right to complain of the injustice of their government .
Andrew Jackson quote s :
You are a den of vipers and thieves .
I intend to rout you out , and by the grace of the Eternal God , will rout you out .
Andrew Jackson quote s : I am one of those who do not believe that a national debt is a national blessing , but rather a curse to a republic ; inasmuch as it is calculated to raise around the administration a moneyed aristocracy dangerous to the liberties of the country .
Andrew Jackson quote s : Gentlemen , I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country .
When you won , you divided the profits amongst you , and when you lost , you charged it to the bank .
You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter , I shall ruin ten thousand families .
That may be true , gentlemen , but that is your sin !
Should I let you go on , you will ruin fifty thousand families , and that would be my sin !
You are a den of vipers and thieves .
Andrew Jackson quote s :
As long as our government is administered for the good of the people , and is regulated by their will ; as long as it secures to us the rights of persons and of property , liberty of conscience and of the press , it will be worth defending .
Andrew Jackson quote s : The Bible is the rock on which our Republic rests .
Andrew Jackson quote s :
It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes .
Andrew Jackson quote s :
There are no necessary evils in government .
Its evils exist only in its abuses .
If it would confine itself to equal protection , and , as Heaven does its rains , shower its favors alike on the high and the low , the rich and the poor , it would be an unqualified blessing .
We all know how annoying it is when we are told by the system that our ink cartridges are empty .
It is not only annoying but is expensive too , to buy new cartridges frequently .
However , there seems to be a little secret which the ink cartridge companies do n’t want us to know .
It is possible to not only harness remaining ink in the cartridge before throwing , but we can get almost half of the cartridge !
All one would need to do is reset the cartridge using a pin .
One would need to locate a hole above the circuit at the back of the cartridge and reset it easily .
This would allow you to use the ink that you would otherwise have thrown in to the dustbin .
The video shows an Epson cartridge and it is not clearly mentioned if we can use this trick on cartridges by all companies .
However , before you throw the cartridge away , do try this trick just in case it helps !
This would not only save us from spending more on ink , but would also give us the pleasure of doing something that big corporations do not want us to do .

ARNOLD , Missouri ( Reuters ) -
When he strayed slightly off script this week on the campaign trail , the usually loquacious but gaffe - prone Joe Biden quickly reeled himself in .
U.S. Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Joe Biden ( D - DE ) waves to the crowd as he introduces presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) at a campaign rally in Sunrise , Florida , October 29 , 2008 .
Obama is campaigning in North Carolina and Florida on Wednesday before the November 4 presidential election .

Famous for off - the - cuff comments he later regrets and for long - winded speeches , the Democratic vice presidential candidate , a veteran foreign policy expert in the U.S. Senate , is showing unusual restraint .
“ That ’s what you call getting off message , ” Biden quipped in a light - hearted reference to his new discipline after he took his eyes off a teleprompter for a second to greet band members in a high school gym in Arnold , Missouri , on Thursday .
With polls giving Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama a lead over Republican candidate John McCain , the Delaware senator is anxious not to rock the boat by creating an unwelcome diversion before the election on Tuesday .
Biden , 65 , was downright restrained in a vice presidential debate with Republican opponent Sarah Palin this month and most of his stump speeches have been carefully scripted .
His biggest gaffe so far has been to say that if Obama wins , he will be tested in his first six months , a comment the McCain camp seized on as it argued that the first - term Illinois senator is too inexperienced to be president .
“ Watch -- we ’re going to have an international crisis , a generated crisis , to test the mettle of this guy , ” said Biden , immediately raising red flags among Obama campaign staffers .
Obama publicly dismissed the comment as Joe ’s “ rhetorical flourish ” and at nearly every rally since Biden has told supporters he believes the Democratic candidate has the “ steel spine ” to deal with any problem that comes his way .
Earlier , Biden had alarmed Democratic aides when he said that Sen. Hillary Clinton , whose supporters were still smarting from her defeat by Obama in the contest for the Democratic candidacy , might have been a better vice presidential pick .
PRESS SHY
On the trail , Biden is kept largely away from the small group of reporters traveling with him and has not held a news conference since early September .
But on Friday , in rare comments to reporters when he stopped at a fast - food restaurant in Lima , Ohio , Biden denied he had been “ muzzled ” by the Obama campaign .
“ I have done 200 interviews .
I have done half a dozen to a dozen satellite feeds every day .
I am doing shows .
And so no one has said anything to me about it , ” Biden said .
His opponents have been waiting for Biden to trip up .
McCain supporter Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has included Biden ’s penchant for gaffes in his retinue of jokes .
“ He ’s the sound - bite machine that keeps on giving , ” Graham said recently .
“ Keep it up , Joe ! ”
Biden spokesman David Wade said voters were a lot smarter than people gave them credit for and his boss was doing a great job connecting with voters .
“ They are very good at smelling authenticity .
With Joe Biden you get the real deal , ” he said .
A lawyer and seasoned debater , Biden on the campaign trail sticks largely to what is in front of him on the teleprompter .
Biden ’s supporters largely forgive his missteps and refer to his foreign policy and other experience as a big plus .
“ He ’s human , ” said Adrienne Hochberg , an Obama - Biden backer who attended a rally in Florida .
“ He ’s a man of knowledge and experience .
He can be trusted , ” she said when asked what she thought of Biden ’s occasional mistakes .
Biden comes from a working - class background , often bringing up his Scranton , Pennsylvania , roots .
He tells supporters he knows what it ’s like to struggle financially , recalling how his father lost his job and had to move to Delaware .
Aside from using his folksy style to appeal to all groups , Biden gives sharp responses to attacks on Obama .
“ Joe Biden has been Barack Obama ’s defender - in - chief , ” said Wade .
“ He has called his friend John McCain out for below - the - belt tactics . ”
While he has made fewer gaffes than many expected , Larry Sabato , a political scientist at the University of Virginia ’s Center for Politics , said they had been enough to annoy the Obama campaign and distract from the economy and other issues .
But Sabato says the biggest challenge for Obama and his No. 2 pick will likely come if they win the White House .
“ It is one of the easiest predictions that Biden is going to make waves from time to time that will not help Obama .
That ’s a given , ” Sabato said .
Mannequins are one of those things that are somewhat necessary even though they are undeniably scary .
And as if they were n’t creepy enough on their own , now you have to deal with moving mannequins – or cyberquins as they ’re called – that can run , walk , cycle , and generally motion like human beings .
Be warned , the following set is not for the faint of heart .
The creepiest of all creepy mannequins are of course the ones that look like children .
Why else would there be dozens of horror flicks with deranged ventriloquist ’s dummies , deranged dolls , and maniacal mannequins ?
We can in part thank Don Mancini and his cult - favorite Child ’s Play series for making us perpetually look over our shoulders for children of the devil .
Though many have tried to explain our irrational and inexplicable fear of mannequins , there is no concrete explanation thus far .
Some , like the psychologist Ernst Jentsch , attribute this pediophobia to the uncertainty we feel about an object being animate or inanimate when the object resembles a living thing so closely that it can cause confusion about its nature .
Others , like roboticist Masahiro Mori , believe in the uncanny valley hypothesis that argues , as robots become increasingly human - like , we have an increasingly positive reaction to them , however , after a while we reach a point where this increasingly positive response starts to become one of repulsion .
What happens is that if something looks human but is ‘ obviously ’ non-human , the resemblance is endearing , however , when the non-humanness becomes not so obvious ( as in the case of these mannequins ) we begin to feel disturbed , repulsed , and in some cases worried and fearful .
In popular culture , it ’s not merely the mannequin that is scary but audio and visual cues are used to present overtones of violent insanity and create a strong feeling of insecurity that magnifies both our pediophobia as well as the uncanny valley effect .
Though most instances in which mannequins are used prey on our fears , thanks to DC Comics , there may still be hope .
DC ’s Brother Power the Greek is a mannequin that comes to life and uses his super powers for good ( and incidentally has a group of hippie friends to help him out ) .
Taxpayers ' money is being wasted by government departments ' failure to learn from day - to - day mistakes and listen to staff concerns , a public spending watchdog said today .
A study by the National Audit Office found it too often took a major crisis or breakdown to prompt Whitehall to making changes – affecting frontline services .
" There is effective learning in departments , but overall the evidence also indicates that learning is not yet sufficiently embedded within departments ' working practices , nor is it prioritised as much as it should be , " the NAO concluded .
" Learning often occurs following a crisis or high profile failure , but departments will be more effective at learning when it becomes a more habitual aspect of everyday working practice .
" Until then , learning within departments will be constrained and failures will continue to happen , leading to avoidable waste , inefficient practices and ineffective services . "
Rapid staff turnover , a lack of time for learning , a failure to communicate between sections and " ineffective mechanisms " to support learning were to blame , it found .
Even some efforts to improve learning had backfired , it added : " A proliferation of tool kits , guidance and other products ... have been useful but there is a danger of guidance overload . "
The NAO said staff had to be made to feel " safe " in speaking up about failures , their ideas for improvements and rewarded for coming up with better practices , and public complaints used better to shape reforms .
Departments also needed to " institutionalise the systematic reflection on performance after projects , even if it means delaying moving on to the next project for a while " .
Tory MP Edward Leigh , who chairs the Commons public accounts committee , said he was fed up with investigating failures caused by the mistakes time after time .
" It is obvious that government needs to get better at learning lessons from past mistakes , " he said .
" Departments must understand that the best time to learn how to improve service delivery is n't necessarily after a crisis or large - scale project , but day in , day out .
" Before embarking on projects , departments should identify lessons from what has gone well or badly in the past .
And they need to examine what has worked well for other organisations .
" More generally , they should learn from a whole range of sources such as trends in complaints or the views of frontline staff , who often know best .
" Discussing service delivery with those who actually use or deliver the service is not just a nice idea , it is indispensable to improvement .
" When government projects fail to deliver fully , fall behind schedule or go over budget , it is often a result of poor learning .
It is frustrating to see the same mistakes being brought before my committee time and again .
" Good quality lesson - learning makes for better service delivery .
Government departments must take it much more seriously . "
A Cabinet Office spokesman said : " The NAO report makes clear that best practice is shared across the civil service every day and highlights numerous examples that have allowed us to improve the quality and range of services we deliver to the public .
" Many of the problems the report identifies have already been addressed , saving the taxpayer millions of pounds . "
It seems unfortunate to me that George Bush ’s legacy will leave Obama with countless sophie ’s choices where the only way to avoid giving up his precious reasonable moderate image , at least in the eyes of the media , will entail doing genuinely heinous and extremist things .
For the first tangible example look to yesterday ’s decision to abuse the State Secrets privilege in a torture case .
The only justifiable decision here would be to revoke the Bush DoJ ’s attempt to use State Secrets to block not only specific evidence but any hearing at all .
However , doing so would almost certainly compel a wider investigation and likely criminal charges against former government officials .
To avoid being seen as the President who put his last administration on trial Obama must resort to the exact same heinous abuses of power that made the Bush DoJ into a national disgrace .
However , it also seems likely to me that the substantive difference between Obama ’s administration and the Bush years will become increasingly evident as time goes on .
At the very least , given his past writing , Marty Lederman must be shitting a two story colonial townhouse right now .
I have to assume that Lederman and other principled hires at the DoJ will either ensure that decisions like this do not happen again or else he will resign .
I doubt that Marty ’s old blog can avoid talking about this decision for much longer , and given their connection to the guy who now has John Yoo ’s desk it also seems unlikely that they would write without taking his perspective into account .
At the risk of sliding towards Kremlinology I will keep an eye on Balkinization for evidence that principled elements within Obama ’s DoJ hope to prevail in steering the administration away from this disastrous and legally indefensible course .
*** Update ***
The mood is not happy at Balkinization .
The title more or less says it all .
You Cover It Up , You Own It
Due to the ongoing recession , Google , who can do no wrong in our eyes , has let many of its temporary workers go .
The Mountain View - based company , according to Business Week , has an estimated
Der IT - Rat der Bundesregierung hat beschlossenen , das von der Internationalen Organisation für Normung ( ISO ) im Jahr 2006 als Standard veröffentlichte Open Document Format ( ODF ) in der Bundesverwaltung schrittweise einzusetzen .
Die Entwicklung des Konkurrenzformats Office Open XML ( OOXML ) aus dem Hause Microsoft , das die ISO im Februar in einer heftig umstrittenen Entscheidung ebenfalls normierte , soll zudem " mit Interesse " zunächst beobachtet werden .
Dies gab das federführende Bundesinnenministerium am heutigen Dienstag bekannt .
Hans Bernhard Beus , Beauftragter der Bundesregierung für Informationstechnik und Vorsitzender des IT - Rats , bezeichnete die Entscheidung als " wichtigen Schritt , um den Wettbewerb zwischen den Software - Herstellern zu fördern , die IT - Sicherheit zu stärken und die Interoperabilität zu verbessern " .
Zur Erreichung dieser Ziele trage bei , dass offene Dokumentenformate " vollständig und regelmäßig veröffentlicht werden " .
Bürgern , Unternehmen und anderen Verwaltungen stehe nun künftig der Dokumentenaustausch mit der Bundesverwaltung auch per ODF offen .
Die Behörden des Bundes werden laut dem Staatssekretär " spätestens ab Anfang 2010 in der Lage sein , diese Dokumente zu empfangen und zu versenden , zu lesen und auch zu bearbeiten " .
Der IT - Rat setzt mit seinem Beschluss nach Angaben des Innenministeriums den Antrag des Bundestags für " mehr Wettbewerb durch offene Dokumentenstandards " vom Juli 2007 um .
Die Empfehlung war damals umstritten , da die Ausgestaltung der Nutzungsbedingungen offener IT - Standards " den Vorgaben der internationalen Standardisierungsorganisationen entsprechen " sollen .
Gegner dieser Formulierung beklagten , dass damit eine sogenannte " RAND " - Lizenzierung ( Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory ) gestattet werde .
Demnach müssen Anwender für die Nutzung eines derart lizenzierten Standards üblicherweise Geld zahlen oder sonstige Leistungen erbringen , was nicht mit den Prinzipien freier Software zu vereinen sei .
An die Regierung erging mit dem Papier unter anderem der Auftrag , das öffentliche Bewusstsein für die Bedeutung " international akzeptierter , offener Dokumentenstandards " umfassend zu fördern .

Q. What are different quotas in railway reservation ?
A : There are different types of quotas that determine the railways reservation availability including General , Ladies , Tatkal , Senior Citizen and so on .
When Indian Railways booking starts in the Advance Reservation Period , which is 4 months before the journey day , only about half of the seats are under train ticket availability for the general public .
The remainder of the railway reservation seat availability is divided into various quotas and only travellers of select categories are permitted to make Indian Railways booking under these quotas .
The 12 different quotas are :
1. Premium Tatkal Quota -
It is a new quota introduced by the Indian Railways Reservation .
It reserves a few seats with a dynamic fare pricing while making online train ticket booking .
Premium Tatkal booking timings are the same as the Tatkal booking timings .
Dynamic fare pricing means that increased fare is charged only for passengers with confirmed online train ticket booking , and it is twice the usual tatkal ticket charges .
No refund is given on premium tatkal tickets .
2. Tatkal Quota -
While making online train ticket booking , emergency tickets refer to Tatkal tickets .
These tickets are necessary when you make an online train ticket booking at a short notice .
At times , you have only a day or two before the journey .
In such situations , emergency online train ticket booking of tatkal tickets comes handy .
No refund is given on tatkal tickets .
3. Ladies Quota -
Train ticket availability for Ladies Quota was introduced in the year 2011 to facilitate Indian railways booking for women passengers .
This quota provides concession to women who are either travelling alone or with a child below 12 years of age .
There are only 6 berths available under ladies quota in the entire train in sleeper class ( SL ) and second sitting ( 2S ) .
4. Senior Citizen Quota - Railway reservation seat availability grants male senior citizens that are at least 60 years of age and female senior citizens that are at least 58 years of age fare concessions in all classes of Mail / Express / Rajdhani / Shatabdi / Jan-Shatabdi / Duronto trains .
5. Defence Quota -
This quota is available for Indian Armed Forces ( including the Army , Navy and Air Force ) under the Railways reservation seat availability .
The paramilitary servicemen quota is also included under this broad category of Indian Railways booking .
2 seats are reserved under this quota in most trains across the nation .
Indian Railways booking can be made under the Defense Quota for official purposes like relocation or movement of forces from one part of the country to another .
It can also be used by individual defence personnel while coming back home or rejoining duty after their leave .
6. Lower Berth Quota - Under the Indian Railways booking , lower berth quota( SS quota ) can be allotted only to female passengers of age 45 and above that are travelling alone or senior citizen passengers travelling alone .
7. Physically Handicapped Quota - Railway booking can be made under this quota that includes reservation of two sleeper class berths in all trains running on non-suburban sections by handicapped persons taking their journey on handicapped concession tickets .
The person accompanying the handicapped person as an escort is also allotted the berth out of this quota under the Railway reservation seat availability .
8. Headquarters / High Official Quota -
This is a type of emergency quota under the Indian Railways reservation .
This quota provides a limited number of berths to the high ranking officials of railways and other ministers .
This quota is used to provide train ticket availability in emergency situations or for an urgent surprise inspection the official might need to conduct .
9. Parliament House Quota - Parliament House Quota is similar to HQ Quota under the Indian Railways reservation .
This quota is meant for ministers and high bureaucrats as well as members of parliament and their staff to meet urgent travel requirements .
10 . Foreign Tourist Quota -
It is a quota under the Indian Railways reservation meant for foreign tourists who visit India .
Small number of seats are kept reserved while Railway booking under this quota for those who hold valid tourist visas when they visit India .
It is also available to Indian Passport holders with NRI status .
Foreign Tourist Quota passengers are allowed to make online train ticket booking in Executive Class / First Class AC and Two - Tier AC coaches in all trains , including Shatabdi , Rajdhani , Duronto and Gatiman Express trains , for which the fares are uniformly charged at 1.5 times the base fare by the Railways .
In addition to this , IRCTC charges an enhanced service charge of ₹ 200 per ticket + GST under this quota .
11 . Duty Pass Quota - Duty Pass Quota is also one of the quotas under the Railway reservation seat availability meant for railway staff on duty .
Railway staff that need to travel in trains for duty are issued a duty pass through which they can board the trains .
A limited number of berths are earmarked in Rajdhani , Shatabdi and Duronto Express Trains in all classes and in air - conditioned class of Jan Shatabdi Express Trains as Duty Pass Quota against which serving / retired railway employees can book seat against Duty / Privilege / Post Retirement Complimentary passes under the Indian Railways reservation .
12 . Yuva Quota -
This is a quota for unemployed people in the age group of 18 to 45 years .
Under the Indian Railways reservation , it is applicable only for Yuva Trains .
To avail this facility under the Railway reservation seat availability , a passenger must have an age / income proof certificate .
She stole his heart , but it ’s his kidney that he wants back .
A Long Island surgeon who dumped his wife after she allegedly had a steamy affair wants her to give back the kidney he lovingly gave her , or fork over the $ 1.5 million he claims the organ is worth .
“ I saved her life and then , to be betrayed like this , is unfathomable .
It ’s incomprehensible , ” said Dr. Richard Batista , 49 .
“ I feel humbled and betrayed and disregarded .
This divorce is killing me . ”
Batista , a vascular surgeon at Nassau University Medical Center , claimed his wife left him after getting physical with her physical therapist .
He said the couple married on Aug. 31 , 1990 , in “ a very nice , lavish wedding , ” but two years later , the relationship began a “ slow downward trend . ”
Since he filed for divorce in 2005 , he said , she has made it increasingly difficult for him see their three children .
“ The main reason the doctor is doing this is because of how he ’s been treated in this case , ” said Dominic Barbara , Batista ’s lawyer .
They are asking for the $ 1.5 million as part of the distribution of assets based on a medical expert ’s estimated value of the kidney .
“ In theory , we are asking for the return of the kidney , ” Barbara said .
“ Of course , he would n’t really ask for that , but the value of it . ”
Dawnell Batista , a physician ’s assistant at Winthrop Hospital in Garden City , had her first kidney transplant as a baby , with her father as the donor , and a second one years later , from her brother .
Her body rejected both kidneys .
Her husband then donated one of his healthy organs to her in June 2001 .
“ There ’s no greater feeling on the planet ” than to save a life , said the surgeon , who lives in Ronkonkoma .
But Dawnell ’s new lease on life left her with a wandering eye , he claimed .
Within two years of the lifesaving transplant , he said , she suffered a knee injury during a karate class – then hopped into bed with her physical therapist .
Even worse , she flaunted her romance – once leaving her lover ’s clothes in the family laundry , he claimed .
The physical therapist , David Cazalet , vehemently denied the accusation .
“ We ’re friends – we ’ve never had an affair , ” he insisted , calling Batista a “ big monster . ”
“ I feel bad for her because he ’s a wackadoo , ” he said .
Dawnell Batista ’s lawyer refused to comment .
“ She ’s a wonderful person , ” said her mother , Cynthia Carroll .
A brother , who asked that his name not be used , said , “ You expect the worst from a bad person . ”

My route to saner eating was more or less accidental .
Two years ago , I was 57 and weighed more than I ever had .
When I graduated from college , I weighed 165 pounds ; when I stopped smoking , about five years after that , I weighed 180 .
Then , when my first daughter was born and I had started writing about food and doing some serious eating and drinking , I hit 190 .
Over the next 20 years , I managed to gain more weight , reaching 214 .
I ’m not a small person , so I did n’t look that heavy ( I thought ) , but I was overweight and developed health problems .
My cholesterol was up , as was my blood sugar ( there ’s diabetes as well as serious obesity in my family ) .
I had a hernia , my knees were giving out , and I ’d developed sleep apnea .
As a reporter and researcher for many years , I was writing a food column called “ The Minimalist ” for the New York Times and a book called How to Cook Everything Vegetarian .
I had ( and still have ) no intention of becoming a vegetarian , but I could see the writing on the wall : Industrial meat production had gone beyond distasteful and alienating to become disgusting and dangerous ( its link to global warming did n’t help ) ; traditional , natural ingredients were becoming rare ; and respectable scientific studies pointed toward the health benefits of eating more plant - based foods and fewer meat - based foods .
For me , the combination of cholesterol , blood sugar , and apnea was the real trigger .
My problems were scary — and , according to my doctor , all easily remedied .
For the cholesterol , I could take cholesterol - lowering drugs or eat less meat ; for the blood sugar , I could eat fewer sweets ; for the apnea , I could lose 15 percent of my body weight .
Everything pointed to a simpler style of eating .
I started following a diet that was nearly “ vegan until six . ”
Until dinner , I ate almost no animal products and no simple carbs ( no white - flour products , junk food , or sugar - heavy snacks ) .
At dinner , I ate as I always had , sometimes a sizable meal including animal products , bread , dessert , wine — you name it — or sometimes a salad and a bowl of soup .
I also took several long walks each week ( my bad knees could n’t handle more ) .
Though few nutritionists would disapprove , this eating plan may seem counter intuitive .
The opposite schedule ( eating the day ’s heaviest meal for lunch or breakfast ) may make more sense for many people .
But this suited me .
I detest overly prescriptive diets that are impossible to follow , and the point was to eat more vegetables , fruits , legumes , and whole grains and less meat , sugar , junk food , and overrefined carbs , without giving up foods I loved .
My results were striking .
I had little trouble eating this way , I began feeling and sleeping better , and I did n’t think much about it for a month or two .
It just made sense .
A month later , I ’d lost 15 pounds .
A month after that , both my cholesterol and my blood sugar were down , well into the normal range ( my cholesterol went from 240 to 180 ) .
My apnea was gone , and I was sleeping through the night .
Within four months , I ’d lost more than 35 pounds and was below 180 , less than I ’d weighed in 30 years .
In fact , of all my diet - related ailments , only my knees did n’t respond .
( Oh well .
One does age . )
My weight has stabilized , and — perhaps more important — I ’m at home with this way of eating .
My doctor was happy with my progress .
( Check with yours first . )
Today I eat about one third as much meat , dairy , and even fish as I did a few years ago .
( Farmed fish has many of the same issues as farmed land animals , including antibiotic use and environmental damage . )
I eat few refined carbs .
But if there ’s good white bread at dinner , I attack it , and I still have pasta a couple of times a week .
I eat almost no junk food .
I eat about three or four times as many plant foods ( like green leafy vegetables ) as before ; probably 50 percent or more of my calories come from nonanimal sources .
For some people , a shift of 10 percent of calories from animal to plant may feel significant , though I doubt it ; it would be the equivalent of maybe not having chicken on a Caesar salad at lunch .
A person making that kind of shift , along with cutting way back on junk food and carbohydrates , might still see positive health changes .
But a shift of 50 percent — replacing half your animal calories with plant calories — would be significant and need a conscious effort .
The goal of eating sanely is not to cut calories ; it will happen naturally .
Nor is the goal to cut protein , though again , you ’ll wind up eating less .
The goal is not to cut fat , either ; in fact , you ’ll eat more of it , though different fat ( the same is true of carbohydrates ) .
And the goal is n’t to save money , though you probably will ; think of the cost of rolled oats ( $ 1 a pound ) and , say , Honey Bunches of Oats ( about $ 5 a pound ) .
Rather , the goal is to eat less of certain foods and more of others — specifically , plants , as close to their natural state as possible .
Above all , this is a shift in perspective , one that means better eating for both your body and the planet .
More donors are urgently needed More people need to donate their brains to medical research if cures for diseases like dementia are to be found , UK scientists say .
They say research is being hampered by a gross shortage of brains and are urging healthy people as well as those with brain disorders to become donors .
Brain research has proved essential for finding new treatments - such as dopamine for Parkinson 's disease .
Brain investigator Dr Payam Rezaie called the current situation " dire " .
He said thousands more brains were needed to look for the cause and treatments for conditions like autism and Alzheimer 's disease .
Most drugs already developed for brain - related diseases have relied on research using human brains
Dr Marie Janson of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust Dr Rezaie , from the Neuropathology Research Laboratory at the Open University , said : " For autism , we only have maybe 15 or 20 brains that have been donated that we can do our research on .
That is drastically awful .
" We would need at least 100 cases to get meaningful data .
But that is just one example .
A lot of research is being hindered by this restriction . "
Short supply Professor James Ironside , of the Human Tissue Authority , which regulates the donation process , said as well as a shortage of diseased brains to study , there was a bigger problem of getting hold of healthy donor brains for comparison .
He said this was down to poor awareness rather than people being squeamish .
BRAIN BANK BREAKTHROUGHS
Discovery of L - dopa treatment for Parkinson 's disease Discovery of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer 's disease Discovery of Lewy bodies in dementia Discovery of variant Creutzfeldt - Jakob Disease Discovery of the role of glutamate in Schizophrenia
He helped set up a brain bank in Scotland to collect normal " control " brains from people who had died unexpectedly and needed an autopsy by law to establish the cause of death .
" We were surprised and pleased that over 90 % of the relatives approached in this way gave consent . "
He said more needed to be done to raise public awareness .
Dr Kieran Breen , of the Parkinson 's Disease Society , said over 90 % of the brains in their bank at Imperial College London were from patients , with the remaining 10 % of " healthy " brains donated by friends or relatives of patients .
" It is a question of awareness rather than anything else . "
But he said scandals like Alder Hey - where organs were kept without consent - have put some off donating their organs to medical research .
" There is also confusion .
Some people are under the impression that if they sign up for a donor card that will include donating their brain for research .
But it wo n't .
BRAIN DONATION
Dr Lorna
Wing , a retired expert who studied autism and helped change thinking about the condition as a spectrum disease rather than a single disorder , consented to donating the brain of her daughter , who had autism , after she died unexpectedly aged 49 .
" My husband and I still mourn her loss .
One consolation for us is that we donated her brain and are donating ours in our wills . "
" Donor cards are about donating organs for transplant , not for medical science . "
He said anyone interested in becoming a donor should contact one of the 15 - 20 brain banks dotted around the UK .
The Medical Research Council is setting up a network to coordinate the existing brain banks from one central location .
It is hoped this will make it simpler for those wanting to donate and for researchers to pool information and resources .
Dr Marie Janson , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " Donated brains can be an immense help in the fight against dementia and are likely to become more important in the future .
" Most drugs already developed for brain - related diseases have relied on research using human brains .
" Unfortunately dementia research is still severely underfunded , and - if new treatments are not found - the number of people with dementia in the UK could increase from 700,000 to 1.5 million within a generation . "

New surveillance video( Not the greatest ) was released on Wednesday ( Jan 07/08 ) that shows the dramatic lead - up to an accused robber being shot in Ocoee .
The video shows a man , while on a cell phone with 911 , shooting and killing the suspect .
The shooting occurred just before midnight on Monday .
The surveillance video shows a man , identified by polic More ..e as Freddie Carson , 40 , entering the Kangaroo gas station on Franklin Street in Ocoee , getting behind the counter and trying to rob the clerk .
Police said Carson tried to beat the clerk with a bottle .
A customer , only identified as Chris , heard screaming from outside and rushed back into the store .
On the tape , Chris shot Carson and is heard telling a 911 dispatcher that he just shot someone .
" Yes you need paramedics .
A man just broke in .
I shot him .
I have a gun , " Chris told the dispatcher .
" He was beating her over the counter and I shot him .
I came in and I shot him .
You need paramedics .
Oh my God , I ca n’t believe I just shot somebody .
" Chris said he was just trying to help his friend .
Authorities are still looking for two other men they believe were involved in the robbery .
Waste heat from computers could be used to add to their processing power , say physicists working in an emerging field known as phononics .
The latest advance is a design for a thermal memory device that stores data as heat , not magnetism or electricity like existing computing devices .
The search for ever - faster hardware has in recent years sent physicists and engineers exploring more complex ways to perform calculations .
Crunching data coded using photons – photonic computing – is one example , and in 2007 researchers built the first workable optical transistor .
But now the idea of computing using heat flow is gaining popularity among applied physicists .
Heat travels through solid materials by means of phonons – ripples of vibration passing through a series of atoms .
Those ripples can be used to send and store data in digital form : one temperature is read as 0 or “ off ” while a second , higher temperature is interpreted as 1 or “ on ” .
Provided that the thermal memory is well insulated , it can keep its temperature – and data – intact for a long time .

Memory trouble
However , accessing stored data by latching a thermometer onto a thermal memory is likely to either heat it up or cool it down , altering the memory being read .
So Lei Wang of the Renmin University of China in Beijing and Bao Wen Li at the National University of Singapore have come up with a design that does n’t suffer from this problem , and have tested it in simulations .
It exploits the fact that some materials can only exchange heat when they are at similar temperatures .
The small memory store at the heart of their design is set to either a 1 or 0 temperature by an element that can rapidly shunt in or draw out heat .
The store itself is sandwiched between two large chunks of other materials .
One of those materials is constantly hot , but can only donate heat to the memory store when that too is hot , in the 1 state .
The material on the other side of the memory patch is always kept cold , but can draw heat away from the store whatever state it is in .
When the store is in its hotter state , it receives a strong flow of heat from the hot side of the sandwich , which then passes through to the cold side .
The heat flow maintains the temperature of the memory patch , and reading its temperature cannot alter the flow enough to confuse the reading .
When heat is sucked out of the memory store to cool it to the 0 temperature , it can no longer receive heat from the hot material , despite the temperature difference .
The cold side of the sandwich helps maintain the memory ’s 0 state , even when the temperature is read .
Wang and Li also have a design for a thermal logic gate – a key component of digital circuitry – which they developed in 2007 ( Physical Review Letters , DOI : 10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.177208 ) .
Hybrid systems
Thermal equivalents of most of the other basic components needed for computing have also been designed .
Giulio Casati at the University of Insubria at Como , Italy , has created designs for a thermal rectifier , to convert digital into analogue signals ( a pre-print of Casati ’s paper is available on the arXiv ( pdf ) ) , and more recently a design for a thermal transistor was published ( Applied Physics Letters , DOI : 10.1063/1.2191730 ) .
These components are only theoretical , though – the only working example is a thermal rectifier built at the University of California in Berkeley ( Science , DOI : 10.1126/science.1132898 ) , and no one is exactly sure how and why it works .
Casati remains cautious about the immediate future of phononics .
“ Thermal memory is possible in principle , but it would be a mistake to think that we will have such things actually working in the short term , ” he says .
“ The main problem is the gap between theory and experiments . ”
Casati says practical physicists must rise to the challenge set by the theorists .
Yet even if they can , phononic computing is unlikely to threaten electronics because phonons travel a lot slower than electrons .
Li imagines that the two technologies will work together , in hybrid devices that perform some computation using waste heat .

BRT , Rail , and New York City : A Conversation With Walter Hook

New York City made a major public commitment to Bus Rapid Transit in 2006 when , after years of discussion , the MTA and DOT put forward plans for pilot routes in each of the five boroughs .
In the meantime , the city ’s BRT agenda has encountered a few setbacks in Albany and made a partial breakthrough on Fordham Road , with a service that incorporates some nifty bus improvements , but not enough to merit the BRT designation .
Perhaps no one knows the ins and outs of BRT better than Walter Hook ( right ) .
As director of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy , Hook has advised cities on four continents about BRT implementation , including Jakarta ’s seven - corridor network , the first full - fledged BRT system in Asia .
Streetsblog caught up with Hook — in between trips to Cape Town and Mexico City — for an email Q&A about why New York City needs Bus Rapid Transit , common misconceptions of BRT in America , and what will make BRT succeed here .
This is the first of four installments .
Streetsblog : Is BRT the right mode for New York City at this moment in time ?
A lot of folks think that BRT is no substitute for light rail or a subway system .
How would you pitch the idea of BRT to New Yorkers ?
Walter Hook : I was in Philadelphia a few months back , which is a real rail and streetcar - loving town , and I took a lot of heat for suggesting BRT had a place in U.S. cities like New York and Philadelphia , particularly from my friends in the sustainable transportation advocacy community .
I understand why a lot of folks in the U.S. see BRT as some sort of marketing trick to pawn off low - quality bus improvements as mass transportation .
I think it ’s because we do n’t really have a full BRT system in the U.S.
Not very many people have been to Bogotá , or Curitiba , or Pereira or Guayaquil to see the best BRT systems .
These are not exactly tourist Meccas .
The Second Avenue Subway would be great , it ’s needed , it would have higher demand than almost any other metro line in the country .
But will it happen ?
The U.S. has a BRT program , and it has brought real improvements , and it ’s using some elements of the Latin American BRT systems , but most of them fall short .
There is no quality control or mechanism to protect the ‘ BRT ’ brand , so some fairly modest bus improvements are calling themselves BRT , not only in the U.S. but all over the world .
New York City already has the most extensive subway network in the U.S. , and one of the most extensive in the world .
Whatever BRT is built , it will need to fit seamlessly into that network .
Some subway lines are extremely crowded — at capacity despite a very high fare by international standards .
The 4 , 5 , and 6 , the L — these trains are packed .
I do n’t know why Japanese and Chinese cities can roll out 10 miles of new subway line a year , and the richest city in the world has been trying and failing to build the Second Avenue Subway since the 1960s .
But I ’ve lived in this town a long time , and I am skeptical .
The optimists are telling us that we will have a Second Avenue Subway between 125th Street and 63rd Street by 2015 and only after we spend $ 4 to $ 5 billion .
So this means we are probably talking about 2018 or 2020 , and $ 10 billion .
The Second Avenue Subway would be great , it ’s needed , it would have higher demand than almost any other metro line in the country .
At those volumes , metros are often a good investment .
But will it happen ?
Plus , the MTA needs something like an additional $ 20 billion just to bring the existing system into a state of good repair .
If we only talk rail , that puts any mass transit improvements to my neighborhood — Brooklyn adjacent to the hole in the ground that may one day be Atlantic Yards — off the radar for two decades , even though they are talking about introducing Manhattan - level densities into my neighborhood in the next few years .
SB : Could n’t light rail get the job done in many cases ?
WH : I do n’t see light rail as much of a solution to this problem .
Light rail has all the problems of a BRT system with most of the cost of a metro system .
Surface light rail in Manhattan — how much would it cost ?
The Denver light rail line was estimated to cost from $ 40 to $ 75 million per mile , and naturally it ’s proving to be like double that .
That ’s less than the billions per mile the subway would cost .
But the best BRT system in the world , Bogotá ’s TransMilenio , when the complete reconstruction of the entire road into a boulevard with bike lanes and beautiful trees is all included in the price , cost about $ 20 million a mile .
It might cost more than this in the U.S. , but all things being equal ( high quality of all elements , dedicated transitways , specially configured low - noise , low - emissions vehicles , etc. ) it ’s going to be a whole lot cheaper than LRT .
Very good BRT systems have been built for as little as $ 8 million a mile .
With the same capital budget , we could build more than twice as much proper BRT as light rail , probably 5 to 10 times more , with no loss in the quality of service , the capacity , or the speed .
Even counting the contribution to total life cycle costs of operating and maintenance costs , BRT is a bargain , something all New Yorkers love .
The engineering for light rail is more complicated :
You need electric conduit , ugly overhead wires , tracks — not to mention rail yards that are nearly impossible to locate in any dense city .
What is the operational advantage ?
If light rail does not have an exclusive right of way , it is even more stuck in traffic congestion and much more accident prone than local bus services .
Capacity ?
The capacity of a light rail system is no higher than a BRT system .
The law of physics pertaining to only one object occupying a given space at one time applies to LRT just as it does to buses .
The limitations of block lengths and traffic signals apply to both equally .
The capacity of LRT with only two tracks ( almost universal ) is significantly lower than the many BRT systems that have passing lanes at the stations supporting express services just like on the subway here .
Very good BRT systems have been built for as little as $ 8 million a mile .
With the same capital budget , we could build more than twice as much proper BRT as light rail .
BRT is a bargain , something all New Yorkers love .
BRT also has the very distinct advantage that the bus can leave an exclusive busway and enter normal traffic on any road .
A light rail line can only go where the tracks are built ( and can not go around an LRT vehicle that is stopped because it just hit a double - parked truck ) , so network connectivity and reliability are always going to be a bigger issue .
There is one circumstance that I have discovered where light rail might have a higher capacity .
If a light rail station has all the same features as a BRT system , including pre-paid boarding from stations with platforms level with the vehicle floor , and there is only one exclusive lane available ( no space for a passing lane at the station ) , so express services are impossible , and the LRT has an ultra- modern signaling system like they have in Zurich , it might be possible to reach capacities of about 20,000 passengers per direction during a single peak hour using LRT , while a BRT with the exact same configuration would only be able to reliably move about 15,000 at a similar speed .
But there are almost no corridors in the United States with transit demand above 15,000 at the peak hour per direction that do not currently have a metro or subway line in them , so ultimately , the preference for light rail over a proper BRT system is mostly aesthetics and ignorance of the technical capabilities of a well - planned and implemented BRT system .
In Mexico City , MetroBus has enhanced perceptions of surface transit .

Like in many places , people in the U.S. associate buses with people of lower social status .
Where there has been significant money available for public transport , it is put into core - commuter focused rail transit lines that usually provide disproportionate benefits to the upper middle classes , while the poor — who make much higher use of transit for all their travel — have much less invested in the bus services that they need .
Interestingly enough , in Mexico City — where there is a full featured , real BRT system — the rich are willing to take the BRT , but they wo n’t take the metro , which has more crime and is rapidly deteriorating — the same historic phenomenon as the U.S. but in reverse !
Of course , you can mess up a BRT system , and Boston ’s Silver Line proved that you could waste almost as much money on BRT as you can on a rail system .
Many of the BRT systems we ’ve worked on are nowhere near as good as TransMilenio .
For mainly political reasons , the risk of BRT being something far from optimal is pretty big , even here in New York City .
It ’s important to the world that New York City does n’t just build some low - quality bus improvement and call it BRT .
This could really damage the already poor reputation of BRT as a serious mass transit option in the U.S.
But what if New York were to hit it out of the park , with something amazing ?
The rest of the world expects no less from the greatest city in the world .
In a unanimous vote , the California Fish & Game Commission decided to remove the California brown pelican from the state endangered species list .
Our colleague Kelly Burgess at the Outposts blog has the details :
" Every Californian should be proud of this landmark decision , " commission President Cindy Gustafson said in a news release .
" This is a story of magnificent success .
In the 38 - year history of our protection of endangered species under the act , the California brown pelican is the first species to fully recover .
We hope to have many more . "
The delisting recommendation made to the commission by Department of Fish and Game biologists is based on studies showing an increased breeding population of brown pelicans on West Anacapa Island in the Channel Islands , where there are now an estimated 8,500 breeding pairs .
This is the only area in California where these birds nest .
The announcement from the Fish & Game Commission comes shortly after many brown pelicans were found disoriented , exhausted and with bruised pouches , often miles from their normal coastal haunts .
The reason for the pelicans ' plight is still a mystery , but the Monterey County Herald reports :
A leading theory is that a warming global climate and abundant food caused about 4,000 pelicans to remain in Oregon and Washington months past when they normally would have migrated south .
Then many of the birds got caught in record - freezing December temperatures , stressing their bodies and leaving them without food supplies .
The state 's Office of Administrative Law will have to review the commission 's decision before the pelicans can officially be delisted .

ActiveRecord Optimization with Scrooge
Dynamic query optimization is a hotbed of research in the database industry .
Each and every query you execute goes through a rigorous optimization phase which tries to squeeze every last bit of performance : deciding which indexes to use , the execution order and sort order to minimize the number in - memory tables , etc .
However , one thing the database has no access to is the application layer knowledge of which data the user is actually using after it is retrieved .
Often times , the query fetches all of the columns when only a few are required , which is exactly the pattern that Lourens Naudé is seeking to optimize with his new plugin : scrooge .
Tracking and Scoping Attributes with Scrooge
The idea behind scrooge is both surprisingly simple and powerful : instead of forcing the developer to manually specify each attribute column , simply observe and record for some period of time all of the attribute accesses and then reuse this knowledge in the future to automatically optimize your subsequent query requests .
The entire process is split into two simple phases .
First , the track phase is executed where all database columns are fetched and any attribute accesses in your templates are recorded .
Then , once you ’ve built up a representative sample , this data is persisted and the scope phase begins where scrooge intercepts all of your database queries and dynamically modifies them to select only the required columns .
# 1 ) unscoped select : # => SELECT * FROM widgets LIMIT 1 Widget . find ( :all , : limit => 10 ) # 2 ) manually scoped select : # => SELECT widgets .id FROM widgets LIMIT 1 Widget . find ( :all , : select => " id " , :imit => 10 ) # Scrooge automatically transforms 1 ) into 2 ) after the tracking phase is complete !
scrooge.git - Fetch exactly what you need
Dynamic Query Optimization
The real benefit of this technique lies in its transparent nature .
Both novice users who are simply unaware of the extra database cost , and a seasoned veteran working with 30 K + lines of database dependent code can breathe a sigh of relief .
After all , why burden the developer with something that software can automatically optimize for us ?
Think of it as an automated application layer query optimizer .
Your database has no knowledge of the properties of your application , but ActiveRecord ( or any other ORM for that matter ) can build a very good profile for this type of data .
To get started , simply drop in the Rails plugin and you ’re off to the races .
It ’s a very promising project !
Scrooge has been completely re-engineered by Laurens Naude and Stephen Sykes since this article was written to use an ‘ inline cache ’ approach with callsites : faster , better , more compact , same results !
mod_python versus mod_wsgi
January 6 , 2009 at 7:09 pm | Posted in General | 8 Comments
So at work recently , we started looking at switching our django setups from mod_python to mod_wsgi , as we kept having memory and cpu use issues with mod_python , and mod_wsgi was supposed to be far better with performance .
Well , it ’s only been a day so far , but the results have been very promising .
Our memory usage was cut in half , and load bottomed out .
Edit : this is daemon mode with threads=1
Initial testing showed more drastic improvements , so for anyone else testing , take initial results with a grain of salt 🙂
With that said , here are the actual results :
Just after switching :
A day after switching :
Too early to be absolutely sure that everything is working well , but it ’s all looking good so far 🙂

A Government of Laws , Not of Men Editor ’s Note : Washington insiders are divided into two basic groups over what to do about the sordid history of the Bush administration : one side wants a “ truth ” commission but no jail time , and the other side says do nothing beyond thanking George W. Bush and his aides for a job well done .
But there is a grassroots movement out there that battled the Bush administration ’s crimes as they were happening – often in the face of disdain from the insiders – and that group believes serious accountability must be achieved if the health of the American Republic is to be restored , a position shared by journalist Peter Dyer :
Now that the unprecedented lawlessness of the Bush administration is history , we have an equally unprecedented opportunity to reaffirm the foundation of American democracy : the rule of law .

Digg Email
Printer friendly Restoring the rule of law is as urgent as restoring the economy .
Indeed , the problems are closely related and best addressed together .
In 1947 , U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote : “ In a democracy , power implies responsibility .
The greater the power that defies law , the less tolerant can this Court be of defiance . ”
[ See concurring opinion in UNITED STATES V. UNITED MINE WORKERS , 330 U. S. 258 . ]
Two years earlier , seeking to bring high - ranking Nazis to justice at Nuremberg , U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson said : “ The very minimum legal consequence of the treaties making aggressive wars illegal is to strip those who incite or wage them of every defense the law ever gave , and to leave war - makers subject to judgment by the usually accepted principles of the law of crimes . ”
In 2000 , during his first campaign for President , George W. Bush said , “ I ’m running for President because I want to help usher in the responsibility era , where people understand they are responsible for the choice they make and are held accountable for their actions . ”
Now a private citizen , George W. Bush has much to be held accountable for as President .
During his “ responsibility era ” he and several other of the most powerful Americans accumulated a list of serious and far - reaching criminal offenses .
Despite his oath to “ preserve , protect and defend ” the U.S. Constitution , President Bush and his administration used the fear and anxiety generated by 9/11 to justify torture , kidnapping ( extraordinary rendition ) , and illegal surveillance and wiretapping .
These offenses were followed by the crime of aggression -- the waging of unprovoked war .
Aggression is , in the words of the judgment at Nuremberg , the “ supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole . ”
A measure of the enormity of this crime is that five of the eight high - placed Germans convicted of aggression at Nuremberg received death sentences .
U.S. aggression in Iraq violated both the Nuremberg Charter and the United Nations Charter ( Article 2 , Sec. 4 and Article 39 ) as well as U.N. Security Council Resolution # 1441 .
Both charters were established by treaties signed and ratified by the U.S.
This means the invasion of Iraq also violated the U.S. Constitution ( Article VI , Clause 2 : the “ Supremacy Clause ” ) .
The scale of open contempt for the rule of law in the Bush administration also was historic .
It was a sustained assault on the vision of John Adams and the Founders : “ a government of laws and not of men . ”
In his campaign for President , Barack Obama recognized this as he pledged to restore the rule of law .
Indeed , judging from some of the new President ’s first actions , such as his order to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay , the future holds promise .
At this point , however , we have little more than the word of the new President that he will continue to show more respect for the law than his predecessor .
We need more .
The foundation of our democracy should not rest upon the intentions , honorable as they may be , of one man .
We ca n’t just forgive , forget and hope a bipartisan spirit of unity under a new President will bring a brighter future .
The government of laws and not of men requires a comprehensive restoration .
We must repair the Bush administration ’s legal vandalism and ensure that we fulfill our obligation to deliver intact to the next generation the precious and fragile treasure entrusted to us by Adams and the other architects of the Constitution .
It is precisely the magnitude of Bush administration criminality that provides the unparalleled opportunity to do this .
Justice and the rule of law demand of us now that we enforce the law .
Justice demands as well that we reverse the Abu Ghraib approach , which punished only some lowly prison guards , and begin at the very top where policy was formed .
At Nuremberg , Justice Jackson said : “ The common sense of mankind demands that law shall not stop with the punishment of petty crimes by little people .
It must also reach men who possess themselves of great power and make deliberate and concerted use of it to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world untouched . ”
Harry Truman said of the President ’s desk : “ The buck stops here . ”
He was right .
We should begin with the arrest and fair trial of citizen George W. Bush .
It would be difficult to imagine a more dramatically convincing way to give new life to the vision of the rule of law shared by Adams , Justice Frankfurter , Justice Jackson and generations of less conspicuous Americans whose love for their country was and is rooted in wholehearted devotion to this bedrock American principle .
Reluctance to Prosecute Unfortunately , as compelling and as essential as this principle is , and as clear as Bush administration lawlessness seems , there is widespread reluctance to prosecute .
Many who agree that criminal behavior in the Bush administration went to the very top nonetheless feel that prosecuting powerful lawbreakers would be a divisive and impractical drain of resources at a time when an economy in freefall demands national unity as well as unprecedented amounts of time , energy and treasure .
From this perspective , the economy is a separate issue .
It comes first .
In addition , the tradition of prosecution of powerful American outlaws is weak .
When the crimes are related to war it is virtually nonexistent .
Because of this the idea of actually arresting someone as powerful as George W. Bush or Dick Cheney for war crimes is , in many circles , a non-starter .
Unfortunately in a nation founded on the rule of law there seems to be a category of people who are above the law .
There is no question a failing economy poses an immediate threat which cannot be ignored .
But the threat to the Republic posed by lawlessness among the powerful is at least equally grave .
Justice Frankfurter said : “ … from their own experience and their deep reading in history , the Founders knew that Law alone saves a society from being rent by internecine strife or ruled by mere brute power however disguised . ”
What could be more fundamental to the survival and maintenance of democracy than the preservation of the rule of law ?
The decay of the rule of law and the disintegration of the economy can be seen as two sides of the same coin : failed leadership grounded in a culture of irresponsible abuse of wealth , power and the public trust , nurtured by our own failure to insist on accountability .
In that light the best chance of turning this culture around lies in a comprehensive approach that addresses both issues concurrently .
And whatever the costs of criminal trials in dollars , they are unlikely to approach the nearly unimaginable sums we have been throwing at war and at bailouts .
We now have a chance to unequivocally affirm a government of laws and not of men .
Rather than shrink from it we should embrace it .
Neither should we tentatively peck around the edges with suggestions of non-punitive truth commissions , etc .
If timidity and apathy prevent us from defending our way of life we will effectively show that the Bush administration ’s contempt for the rule of law is mirrored by our own .
In his campaign , Barack Obama called for an end to the politics of fear .
Americans overwhelmingly took to heart this rejection of the disgraceful , shameless manipulation of fear that enabled the criminals in the Bush administration .
Likewise we should neither fear nor hesitate to challenge and to bring these people to justice .
As powerful as they may still be , they are no more nor less than fellow citizens with whom we share exactly the same legal rights and responsibilities .
In 1776 , a few months before the Declaration of Independence , John Adams wrote to Continental Congressman George Wythe of Virginia : “ Fear is the foundation of most governments ; but it is so sordid and brutal a passion , and renders men in whose breasts it predominates so stupid and miserable , that Americans will not be likely to approve of any political institution which is founded on it . ”
Was Adams right ?
Adams ended his letter to Wythe with thoughts of future generations : “ You and I , my dear friend , have been sent into life at a time when the greatest lawgivers of antiquity would have wished to live .
How few of the human race have ever enjoyed an opportunity of making an election of government , more than of air , soil , or climate , for themselves or their children ! ”
In a democracy , the people get the government they deserve .
One way or another , we will get the one we deserve .
But our children deserve at least as good a government as the one we inherited .
At this moment we have the opportunity to help make sure they get it .
Now is the time to arrest and give a fair trial to every member of the Bush administration who broke the law .

In August of last year , I was happy to be able to share some amazing photos of London , as seen from above at night by photographer Jason Hawkes .
That entry continues to be one of the most consistently popular ones I 've ever put together , so I was happy to hear from Jason again recently , and to find that he wanted to share another 24 photos from 2008 below .
Jason shot these images with a camera attached to gyro - stabilized mounts from a Eurocopter AS355 , hired out at around £ 1150 ( GBP ) per hour , using Nikon gear and either a 14 - 24 mm or a 70 - 200 mm lens .
Even with that , the low light and heavy vibrations can make things difficult , Jason says " I often shoot tethered to my MacBook Pro to check the sharpness of the images whilst I shoot . "
Mr. Hawkes has agreed to jump into the comments and answer some of your questions as well , so feel free to ask .

The Canadian government opted last week to allow the killing 500 narwhals trapped beneath ice rather than calling in icebreakers to free the animals , claiming the process would have been too stressful for the whales .
[ social_buttons ]
Paul Watson , founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and star of Animal Planet ’s Whale Wars , wrote a lengthy condemnation of the Canadian government ’s decision .
He noted that the government provides millions to fund ice - breaking for the annual baby seal hunt , but rejected the idea when proposed in order to save the whales .
Canada allowed Inuit hunters to shoot the whales as they swam one - by - one to the one hole in the ice where they could come up for air .
If minimizing stress was the goal , they miserably failed .
Watson believes the decision was made purely for economic reasons : breaking ice costs money , while killing narwhals makes money .
“ Where Canada could have delivered the gift of life , they have instead unleashed a torrent of violence that has spewed the hottest of blood into the frigid seas of the high north , ” wrote Watson , who is a Canadian citizen .
“ Narwhal tusks sell for thousands of dollars and this bonanza was 4 times [ the Inuits ’ ] allowed ‘ legal ’ kill .
This was an opportunity to put hundreds of valuable ‘ unicorn horns ’ on the market and to bring hundreds of thousands of dollars into the economy of the far North , ” he continued .
“ Every Canadian should hang their head in shame at this atrocious environmental crime . ”
Correction : Narwhals are in fact merely a threatened species , not endangered .
However , there appear to be around 45,000 still in existence , meaning this killing spree wiped out a large chunk of the population .
Narwhals also happen to be considered the animal most threatened by climate change , even more so than polar bears .
It is also worth noting that the number of narwhals killed in this incident is actually now approaching 600 .

The latest twist in the clash between Western values and the Muslim world took place yesterday in the Netherlands , where a court ordered the prosecution of lawmaker and provocateur Geert Wilders for inciting violence .
The Dutch MP and leader of the Freedom Party , which opposes Muslim immigration into Holland , will stand trial soon for his harsh criticism of Islam .
Mr. Wilders , who made world news last year with the release of a short anti-Islam film called " Fitna , " certainly intends to provoke .
In his 15 - minute video , he juxtaposes ...
When high - ranking executives are fired from a company , for whatever reason , they do n’t go to the back of the unemployment line .
Instead , they typically receive compensation in the form of the “ golden parachute . ”
Golden parachutes can include severance pay , cash bonuses , stock options or other benefits .
In the case of the financial crisis and the ensuing bank failures , if it seems like these executives are being rewarded for poor performance , you may be right .

It 's no secret that Google ( GOOG ) is hoping its Android operating system can be useful for more than just mobile phones .
So it makes sense that Google would want to get Android on " netbook " laptops -- small , lo -fi computers that companies like Dell ( DELL ) , HP ( HPQ ) , Acer , and Asus are selling like hotcakes to geeks and early adopter - types .
If that happens , and Google - powered computers take off , Microsoft is the biggest loser .
Early netbooks ran Linux , but today 's best sellers run Windows .
For instance , the 10 top - selling laptops on Amazon ( AMZN ) right now are netbooks running Windows XP Home .
While selling an XP
Home license likely is n't as valuable to Microsoft as selling a Vista Ultimate license , it 'd still be losing some potential license sales .
And if netbooks start cannibalizing real laptop sales , Microsoft stands to lose market share , too .
What about Apple ?
The company has n't joined the netbook market yet -- unless you count the iPod touch , or maybe the iPhone -- but will supposedly start selling larger tablet computers sometime next year .
We see no reason why a Google - powered netbook would necessarily be better than an Apple - powered netbook .
But they could be cheaper .
So who will win ?
Obviously too early to tell -- most of this is theoretical .
But if Google and Apple both enter the market , we think it 's a positive for both companies , and a negative for Microsoft .
Some thoughts :
It will be hard for anyone to make hardware as nice as Apple 's , especially if their multi - touch technology is involved .
And their OS X is still more elegant and useful than Android ( and Windows , many will argue ) .
Assuming Apple 's tablets can access an equivalent of the iPhone App Store , it 'll be hard for Google or Microsoft to catch up quickly with similar offerings of lightweight , powerful apps .
Android 's app market is a disappointment so far , and Microsoft 's Windows Mobile apps would be useless on netbooks .
It will be hard for Apple ( or Microsoft ) to match Google 's excellent , expanding base of free Web services -- which is the core purpose of a netbook -- ranging from GMail and Google Maps to Docs , Gears , and even an e-book store .
As long as these services run just as well on an Apple - or Microsoft - powered device as they do on a Google - based device , that 's not a reason to buy a Google - powered device .
However , if a special version of Google 's Chrome browser is Android - exclusive , and makes Google apps much , much better , that could be an Android advantage .
It 's always possible Microsoft has something up its sleeve -- the killer netbook platform , or something .
But given the way they 've punted so far in the next - gen mobile platform war -- Windows Mobile is weak compared to iPhone and Android -- we 're not holding our breath .
Meanwhile , Google 's best bet for making money still seems to be using Android as a tool to get more people using the Internet on more non-PC devices , and eventually viewing and clicking on Google ads .
So ... how 's that mobile ad business going ?

TO BE HOPEFUL in bad times is not just foolishly romantic .
It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty , but also of compassion , sacrifice , courage , kindness .
What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives …
If we remember those times and places … where people have behaved magnificently , this gives us the energy to act , and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction .
And if we do act , in however small a way , we do n’t have to wait for some grand utopian future .
The future is an infinite succession of presents , and to live now as we think human beings should live , in defiance of all that is bad around us , is itself a marvelous victory .

I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history .
I refuse to accept the idea that the " isness " of man 's present nature makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal " oughtness " that forever confronts him .

True religion consisted in an inward life , wherein the heart does love and reverence God the Creator , and learns to exercise true justice and goodness ... I found no narrowness respecting sects and opinions , but believed that sincere , upright - hearted people , in every society , who truly love God , were accepted of him .

Love each other as I have loved you ..
I call you friends because I have made known to you everything I heard from my Father .

You have answered right , said Jesus , do this and life is yours ...
Who is my neighbor ?
Jesus replied with the Parable of the Good Samaritan [ heretic , outsider , enemy ] .

Manufacturer ACard Model ANS - 9010 Price ( Street ) Availability Now Solid - state storage is the new hotness .
Of course , that hotness is relative — this is still the storage market we ’re talking about .
Think less Scarlett Johansson and more Tina Fey .
Nonetheless , the recent almost - affordability of blazing - fast flash drives has been an interesting development in the storage world .
And it ’s getting even more interesting , because in addition to an entire family of flash drives , the SSD market also has a crazy uncle .
The focus of most solid - state storage discussions centers on flash - based solutions , but they ’re not the only game in town .
DRAM chips offer solid - state storage , too , and they ’re widely available on plain old memory modules .
What ’s more , even Intel ’s fastest X25 - E flash drive is limited to 250 MB /s reads and 170 MB /s writes , but your average DDR2 - 800 DIMM can read and write at up to 6.4GB /s .
That ’s like lining up a 40 - horsepower motor ripped from a Vespa against the W16 monstrosity that powers the Bugatti Veyron .
Of course , you still need a way to get DRAM chips to behave as a hard drive .
The hardware to do so was initially offered only for high - end servers and workstations , and it was priced accordingly .
Then , about three years ago , Gigabyte went out on a limb with an i-RAM storage device that allowed users to plug four DIMMs into a PCI card that hooked up to a standard Serial ATA port .
The i-RAM was ridiculously fast , and for most intents and purposes , it behaved exactly like a normal hard drive .
The original i-RAM ’s total capacity was limited to 4GB of DDR SDRAM , so it ’s not particularly useful by today ’s standards .
However , a company called ACard has done one better with the ANS - 9010 RAM disk , which has eight DDR2 DIMM slots and support for up to 8 GB of memory per slot .
The ANS - 9010 also features a pair of Serial ATA ports , allowing it to function as a single drive or masquerade as a pair of drives that can easily be split into an even faster RAID 0 array .
Can this latest RAM disk live up to its staggering performance potential , and perhaps more importantly , could you live with it as a primary hard drive ?
The difference DRAM makes Before taking a closer look at the ANS - 9010 , I should date myself by noting that the RAM disk concept is really nothing new .
Those who have been around for a while will remember that sectioning off a chunk of system memory for storage was all the rage back in the day .
RAM disks were a software solution back then , so they used memory already plugged into your motherboard .
The move to hardware - based RAM disks has made things much easier by allowing users to access memory modules through a standard hard drive interface without the need for drivers or even an operating system .
So why use DRAM over the flash memory everyone and their mother seems to have their fingers in ?
Speed , for one .
I ’ve already mentioned DDR2’s 6.4GB /s transfer rates .
However , that 6.4GB/s is just a theoretical peak .
The Serial ATA interface is currently limited to 300 MB/s , and even with both its SATA ports active , ACard only claims transfer rates up to 400 MB /s for the ANS - 9010 .
Another benefit DRAM has over flash memory is that there ’s no limit on the number of write - erase cycles it can endure .
Effective wear leveling algorithms and single - level cell memory can greatly improve the lifespan of a flash drive , but they just prolong the inevitable .
DRAM ’s resiliency does come with a cost , though .
While flash memory cells retain their data when the power is cut , DRAM is volatile , so it does not .
To keep DRAM data intact , you have to keep the chips juiced .
Evolving the RAM disk Storage solutions generally are n’t much to look at , but the ANS - 9010 is a little different .
Instead of being tucked away in an internal hard drive bay , it slides into an external 5.25 ″ optical bay where you can see it .
The device ’s front panel has a few ventilation slits and is littered with indicator lights for power , drive access , and battery life .
ACard equips the ANS - 9010 with a 7.4V , 2400 mAh battery that keeps the drive ’s memory powered when the host system is shut off .
Our battery was able to keep 16GB of memory powered for more than four hours , which is n’t nearly good enough if you want to turn your system off at night , but more than enough to get through the occasional reboot or hardware upgrade .
For those who would rather not trust a battery with preserving their data , the ANS - 9010 also features a CF card slot up front .
With the push of a button , the drive can back up or restore the contents of its memory to a flash card .
This backup capability might seem like a small thing , but it greatly improves the RAM disk ’s usability in the real world .
ACard quotes a CF backup time of 21 minutes and 34 seconds for a 32GB configuration and a restore time of just over 14 minutes for the same config .
Busting the ANS - 9010 open reveals eight 240 - pin DDR2 DIMM slots .
ACard says module densities up to 8GB are supported , bringing the drive ’s total capacity potential up to an impressive 64GB .
Keep in mind that 8GB memory modules are extremely expensive , though .
For most folks , cost alone will limit the drive ’s total capacity to 32 GB or less .
ACard does n’t yet list any 8 GB modules on its memory compatibility list , either .
You ’ll want to pay attention to that compatibility list , because registered and ECC DIMMs are n’t supported .
It also took a couple of firmware revisions for the ANS - 9010 to get along with the OCZ DIMMs we used for testing .
The RAM disk ’s DIMM slots are arranged in pairs of four , with spacing similar to what you ’d find on a motherboard .
This leaves just enough room for modules with normal heatspreaders , although taller DIMMs may bump their heads on the 5.25 ″ drive bay ceiling .
You can still run taller DIMMs by removing the ANS - 9010 ’s top panel , and as long as you do n’t have a 5.25 ″ drive in the bay directly above , most cases should be accommodating .
Between the rows of DIMM slots sits the RAM disk ’s battery and really the only silicon of note .
Hidden under a passive heatsink sits a FPGA chip that ACard has programmed to make the memory modules behave as a hard drive .
As Intel ’s X25 - series SSDs have illustrated , a good storage controller architecture can significantly improve performance .
ACard is n’t saying much about the ANS - 9010 ’s storage controller design , but we ’ll soon see whether it ’s made the most of the prodigious bandwidth potential inherent to DDR2 memory .
We do know that ACard ’s storage and memory controller has at least one interesting trick up its sleeve — it ’s able to split installed memory between two physical Serial ATA ports .
Even with only a single DIMM installed , the ANS - 9010 can present itself as two physical hard drives via two SATA ports located at the rear .
This feature allows users to wring even more performance from the drive by pairing it with a RAID controller for a little striped RAID 0 love .
And because solid - state storage is immune to the mechanical failures that make running RAID 0 dicey with traditional hard drives , you do n’t have to worry about a head crash hosing the array .
Switching the ANS - 9010 between single - drive and RAID modes requires flipping a jumper , which is accessible from the rear .
Otherwise , there is n’t much to see .
The drive pulls juice from a standard Serial ATA power cable , although it only seems to draw from the 12V line .
WorldBench
WorldBench uses scripting to step through a series of tasks in common Windows applications .
It then produces an overall score .
WorldBench also spits out individual results for its component application tests , allowing us to compare performance in each .
We ’ll look at the overall score , and then we ’ll show individual application results .
You wo n’t find Gigabyte ’s i-RAM in the graphs below because its 4GB maximum storage capacity is too limited for WorldBench to run .

You wo n’t find Gigabyte ’s i-RAM in the graphs below because its 4GB maximum storage capacity is too limited for WorldBench to run .
The ANS - 9010 gets off to a good start in WorldBench , besting the X25 - E Extreme by a single point .
Running the drive in RAID mode bumps its overall score by two points , which is less than one might expect .
However , keep in mind that WorldBench runs through common desktop applications that tend not to be bound by storage subsystem performance .
Let ’s step through the individual application results to see how the ACard fares in each test .
Multimedia editing and encoding MusicMatch Jukebox Windows Media Encoder Adobe Premiere VideoWave Movie Creator
Although it stays at the front of the pack through most of WorldBench ’s multimedia editing and encoding tests , the ANS - 9010 is a hair behind Intel ’s fastest SSD in the one benchmark that spreads the field .
In the Premiere test , the X25 - E comes out ahead of the ANS - 9010 by one to four seconds depending on whether the RAM disk is running in single - drive or RAID mode .
Image processing Adobe Photoshop ACDSee PowerPack Another member of the WorldBench suite that benefits from faster storage is the ACDSee test , which has the ANS - 9010 making an SSD sandwich out of the X25 - E. Multitasking and office applications Microsoft Office Mozilla Mozilla and Windows Media Encoder
The field does n’t spread much in WorldBench ’s office and multitasking tests , although the ANS - 9010 continues to turn in some of the quickest completion times of the lot .
Other applications WinZip Nero Among all of WorldBench ’s individual application tests , Nero and WinZip are the most demanding of the storage subsystem .
In the latter , which appears primarily to stress read performance , the ANS - 9010 just edges out Intel ’s SSDs .
The RAM disk stretches its legs even more in Nero , with our single - drive config outpacing the X25 - E by 13 seconds .
The RAID 0 setup is an additional 20 seconds faster than that .
This test appears to have a mix of read and write requests , as evidenced by the performance gap between the X25 - E and the X25 - M ; the X - 25 M ’s write speeds are 100 MB /s slower than those of the X25 - E Extreme .
Boot and load times
To test system boot and game level load times , we busted out our trusty stopwatch .
To test system boot and game level load times , we busted out our trusty stopwatch .
The i-RAM makes its first appearance in our boot time test , and it ’s roughly as fast as ACard ’s RAM disk .
However , both are lodged in the middle of the pack and much slower than not only Samsung ’s FlashSSD , but also a few mechanical hard drives .
The RAM disks claw back to the front of the pack in our level load tests .
The i-RAM and ANS - 9010 share the lead in Doom 3 , but they ’re not quite as quick as the X25 - M and FlashSSD in Far Cry .
File Copy Test

File copying is tested twice : once with the source and target on the same partition , and once with the target on a separate partition .

File copying is tested twice : once with the source and target on the same partition , and once with the target on a separate partition .
Scores are presented in MB/s .
To make things easier to read , we ’ve separated our FC - Test results into individual graphs for each test pattern .
We ’ll tackle file creation performance first .
The ANS - 9010 easily outguns the competition in FC - Test ’s file creation tests .
Only the i-RAM and X25 - E Extreme give it much competition here , and they ’re really only within striking distance of the single - drive config in two of the five test patterns .
Striping makes the ANS - 9010 even faster , although it ’s hardly the doubling of performance one might expect — or at least hope for — from such an arrangement .
Interestingly , the ANS - 9010 stumbles a little when FC - Test moves from writes to reads .
ACard ’s RAM disk is by no means slow , but it ’s not as quick as Intel ’s X25 - series SSDs , which take the first two spots through four of five test patterns .
Only with the Windows test pattern , which is made up of a large number of small files , does the ANS - 9010 eke out a win , and then only when running in RAID 0 .
FC - Test – continued Next , File Copy
Test combines read and write tasks in some , er , copy tests .
The ANS - 9010 returns to glory in FC - Test ’s suite of copy tests , although it takes RAID to outrun the X25 - E Extreme with the ISO test pattern , which is made up of a small number of very large files .
Note that the gap between the RAM disk ’s single - drive and RAID configs is significant with some test patterns .
The ANS - 9010 is also notably faster than the i-RAM across the board .
Next , we turn our attention to FC - Test ’s partition copy tests , which copy data between partitions on each drive .
The i-RAM ’s 4GB maximum capacity precludes it from running these tests , so you wo n’t find Gigabyte ’s RAM disk listed in the graphs below .
The partition copy tests shake out much like the first wave of copy tests , except this time the single - drive ANS - 9010 sweeps the X25 - E Extreme across all five test patterns .
Keep in mind that the Extreme is Intel ’s most expensive SLC - based solid - state drive .
The X25 - M uses less expensive MLC flash memory , whose comparatively slow write speeds really hurt the drive ’s performance here .
iPEAK multitasking
We ’ve developed a series of disk - intensive multitasking tests to highlight the impact of seek times and command queuing on hard drive performance .
You can get the low - down on these iPEAK - based tests
We ’ve developed a series of disk - intensive multitasking tests to highlight the impact of seek times and command queuing on hard drive performance .
You can get the low - down on these iPEAK - based tests here .
The mean service time of each drive is reported in milliseconds , with lower values representing better performance .
Our iPEAK workloads were recorded using a 40 GB partition , so they ’re a little big for the 4GB i-RAM , 16GB ANS - 9010 , and even the 32 GB X25 - E .
The app had no problems running , but it warned us that I/O requests that referenced areas beyond the drives ’ respective capacities would be wrapped around to the beginning of each drive .
Since there should be no performance difference between the beginning and end of an SSD , the results should be valid .
When configured in a RAID 0 array , the ANS - 9010 runs the table in iPEAK , turning in the quickest mean service times across all nine workloads .
This RAID setup is notably quicker than running the ANS - 9010 in single - drive mode , too .
If we average the response time of each config across all workloads , ACard ’s RAM disk turns in a 0.18 - millisecond service time in RAID and a 0.32 - millisecond service time in single - drive mode , making it nearly twice as fast when you use both SATA ports .
Of course , the single - drive config ’s slower performance leaves it vulnerable to the X25 - E in some workloads .
In four of our multitasking tests , the Extreme just edges out the single - drive ANS - 9010 .
ACard ’s take on the RAM disk concept is consistently faster than Gigabyte ’s four - year - old i-RAM , though .
IOMeter
IOMeter presents a good test case for both seek times and command queuing .
IOMeter presents a good test case for both seek times and command queuing .
Wow .
That ’s , uh .
Wow .
With the exception of the web server test pattern , which is made up entirely of read requests , the ANS - 9010 completely dominates our IOMeter transaction rate tests .
Even in single - drive mode , it ’s quicker than the i-RAM and much faster than the X25 - E .
The Intel SSDs prove worthy competition with the web server test pattern , but they ’re still trumped by the ANS - 9010 running in RAID mode .
Splitting ACard ’s RAM disk into a striped array just about doubles its transaction rates at higher load levels .
Of course , there ’s a price to be paid for those high transaction rates .
The ANS - 9010 also consumes quite a lot of CPU power in the process .
To put these results into perspective , we ’ve whipped up another set of graphs that illustrates the transaction rate per percent CPU utilization .
Since our mechanical hard drives do n’t deliver anywhere near SSD levels of performance here , we ’ve left them out of the equation , with the exception of the VelociRaptor .
The ANS - 9010 ’s RAID config may be exceptionally fast , but there ’s a greater CPU utilization cost for each transaction than with a single - drive setup .
Interestingly , the i-RAM and the single - drive ANS - 9010 are evenly matched here .
However , Intel ’s SSDs have the highest transaction rates per CPU cycle overall .
HD Tach
We tested HD Tach with the benchmark ’s full variable zone size setting .
We tested HD Tach with the benchmark ’s full variable zone size setting .
So much for DRAM ’s peak bandwidth advantage over flash memory .
In HD Tach ’s sequential transfer rate drag race , the ANS - 9010 only manages to read at 173.6MB/s and write at 144.1MB/s .
What ’s more , it ’s slightly slower when running in RAID 0 .
Those sustained transfer rates do put ACard ’s RAM disk ahead of the i-RAM , but the X25 - E Extreme is much faster .
Even the X25 - M is quicker in the read speed test .
The ANS - 9010 ’s burst performance is n’t as quick as one might hope , either .
The drive does n’t even manage 200MB /s with one SATA port plugged in , although it does eclipse 300 MB /s when running in RAID .
Solid - state drives do exceptionally well in random access time tests , and the ANS - 9010 is no exception .
The drive ’s seek times are essentially instantaneous , and interestingly , they ’re just a little bit quicker when running in single - drive mode .
I ’m hesitant to make too much of the 0.1 - millisecond difference between single - drive and RAID modes , but it was consistent across three test runs , suggesting that there ’s a hint of a latency penalty associated with splitting the RAM disk ’s memory between two SATA ports .
HD
Tach ’s margin for error in the CPU utilization test is +/- 2 % , which narrows our results considerably .
Noise levels
Noise levels were measured with an Extech 407727 Digital Sound Level meter 1 ″ from the side of the drives at idle and under an HD Tach seek load .
Drives were run with the PCB facing up .
Noise levels were measured with an Extech 407727 Digital Sound Level meter 1 ″ from the side of the drives at idle and under an HD Tach seek load .
Drives were run with the PCB facing up .
Because it has no moving parts , the ANS - 9010 is completely silent .
The 42.6 - decibel scores you see for the SSDs represent the ambient noise levels of the test system itself .
Power consumption
For our power consumption tests , we measured the voltage drop across a 0.1 - ohm resistor placed in line with the 5V and 12V lines connected to each drive .
Through the magic of Ohm’s Law , we were able to calculate the power draw from each voltage rail and add them together for the total power draw of the drive .
Because the i-RAM pulls its power from a PCI slot , we were unable to measure its exact power draw and include it in the results below .
Regardless of what it ’s doing , the ANS - 9010 pulls just under 12 watts with 16GB of memory spread across all eight of its DIMM slots .
The drive ’s power consumption is significantly higher than that of flash - based SSDs and even most of our hard drives , but it ’s not entirely unreasonable .

Last week , the Guardian revealed that United Kingdom government officials are now negotiating to soften the impact of EU directives affecting the operation of fossil fuel - fired power stations and their emissions of sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) and nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) .
This is enormously embarrassing for the UK , but no surprise .
Indeed , it suggests that government , or at least the civil service is beginning to appreciate the full impact of the regulations for the future of the UK 's electricity supply .
Currently , the UK faces significant shortage in generation capacity by 2015 that is likely to lead to price rises for the consumer ( a document leaked to the Guardian suggests price hikes of 20 % ) or power cuts at times of peak demand .
Indeed , industry analysts have been predicting for some time that the lack of reliable capacity in the UK electricity industry would force the government to seek humiliating exemptions from the EU Large Combustion Plant Directive and its successor legislation in order to keep dirty power stations online that would otherwise be phased out by the directive .
The government has underestimated the impact of the regulations and has failed to recognise that the LCPD would probably require the closure of the bulk of the UK 's coal generation fleet by 2016 .
It has been unduly optimistic with regard to the construction of new combined cycle gas turbines ( the only large power generation that will be built under the present policy regime in the required time frame , nuclear being unlikely to make any contribution until 2020 ) .
It is also reckless in committing the UK to extreme dependence on imported gas ( approx 80 % by 2020 ) at a time of rapidly growing international competition for this fuel .
In the wake of the Ukraine crisis this winter , this point is probably self - evident to all .
Ministers have also failed to understand that the security of supply contribution from renewables , even if built , would be modest
The LCPD will close 13GW of existing coal and oil - fired generation because they do not comply with the SO2 regulations laid down in the directive .
It is this pollutant which causes acid rain .
Of those power stations that are sulphur compliant , some 20 GW will probably fail to add equpiment to remove NOx because of high cost , physical difficulty , and the additional non-compliance of these plants with recently enacted climate change legislation .
30 GW plus is a very large part of the UK's current generation portfolio – approximately 78GW – and is roughly half of the 60 GW peak load on the network ( 5.30 pm on a cold weekday winter afternoon ) .
Rectifying this situation requires significant global manufacturing resources and capital – some £ 100 bn over the next decade .
After years of denial and misplaced optimism , awareness of the crisis has been growing in government .
John Hutton while at the Department of Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform , seemed to understand this well .
But the ministers at the newly created Department of Energy and Climate Change in their public statements seem to have no notion of the situation .
Mike O'Brien , the Energy Minister , even said on 12 November that there was no problem , and that the lights " would burn even brighter " in 2015 than they do now .
Nevertheless , concern is growing in the industry and , it seems , the civil service .
Hence the attempt by the government to quietly finesse the LCPD 's successor legislation , the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control directive .
On the one hand , we appreciate the necessity of this action , but we deplore the air of fudging secrecy which surrounds it .
Not only is this an undemocratic attempt to evade an admission of culpability , but it will deepen the anger of our EU partners who have complied with acid rain legislation .
Better to honestly admit fault and seek exceptions from the new directive , laying out a clear plan for retiring our non-compliant plant as soon as possible and replacing it with new generation capacity that is fit for the 21st century .
A modern diversified power fleet must consist of nuclear plants , high - efficiency and therefore cleaner coal - fired power stations , including gasifiers predesigned to be ready to capture CO2 for the purpose of enhanced oil ( and gas ) recovery in the North Sea .
Dedicated biomass and unlimited co-firing of biomass with coal might also help here , although most of this fuel will have to be imported .
Offshore wind will also assist .
Furthermore , every means must be found to diversify our sources of gas supply , including the manufacture of synthetic methane from coal , with the resulting CO2 being captured .
Additional gas storage , currently at a miserable 14 days ' supply , is an imperative .
Even assuming that this emergency plan is undertaken there is still the major risk of either a severe energy price shock or of interruptions of supply .
Even with these measures the UK faces a hydrocarbon trade deficit that will grow to over 150 m tonnes of oil equivalent by 2015 .
Assuming a price of $ 100 per barrel of oil equivalent , the balance of trade will grow from $ 35bn in 2008 to $ 96bn per year in 2015 .
With no end to this growth in sight , it is reasonable to ask how the UK will generate wealth to pay for this vast , permanent , and growing imbalance .

The new Java module system has received a lot of attention lately .
After watching a presentation on Devoxx about project Jigsaw , I was excited , thinking that it could be a solution to complicated classpaths versioning issues , JAR hell , etc .
Developers could finally be able to use whatever version of Xalan they wanted without being forced to use endorsed mechanism .
Unfortunately the road to a more efficient module system is not that clear .
Let 's take a look at some basics concepts before examining the actual issues :
Modularization
Modularization is great tool for tackling complexity .
It is useful to divide an application into parts ( modules , libraries , bundles , sub- projects , components ) and conquer them separately .
The ultimate goal of modularization is to have a defined set of APIs that are used for communication between modules .
If all the inter - module communication is realized only by using this APIs the modules are loosely coupled , so :
it is easy to change the implementation of a module and
it is easy to develop and test the modules separately .
It is analogous to object oriented paradigm .
In OOP the ideal situation is to have lot of small , reusable , simple and well separated objects .
In module system it is ideal to have small , reusable , simple and well separated modules .
The idea and the motivation is exactly the same only the scale is different .
Logical separation
Traditionally there are two approaches on how to achieve modularity in Java .
Logical separation is the most natural way .
It consists of splitting application into logical modules ( sub- projects ) but deploying them as one application .
It is possible to accomplish logical separation only by defining correct package structure but it is more common to split an application into several archives ( JARs ) .
Logical separation facilitates reuse of modules and helps achieving lower coupling between them .
It is even possible to define an API and declare that all communication between modules has to be realized only by using given API .
This concept has one big fault .
It is hard to impose this restriction .
There is no mechanism to enforce the API usage .
There is no way to distinguish classes that should be used only by given module and classes that are part of the public API .
If a class is " public " , it can be used by every other class no matter which module it is part of .
On the other hand , protected or package visibility is too constraining for use inside the module .
Usually the module consists of several packages and classes in the packages need to be able to invoke each other .
So even though an application consists from several logical modules , the modules are usually so coupled that the separation is almost useless .
Physical separation
Another traditional approach is physical separation .
It is possible to enforce the separation by splitting an application into components and by deploying each component into separate JVM .
Components then communicate using remoting facilities like RMI , CORBA or WebServices .
This way the separation and loose coupling is enforced .
The downside is big overhead .
Using remoting just to enforce separation is overkill .
It makes development and deployment unnecessary complicated .
Performance impacts are also not negligible .
Module system
Module system stands somewhere in between logical and physical separation .
It enforces module separation , but the modules are deployed into the same JVM and communication between them consists of plain old method calling .
Therefore there is no runtime overhead .
The most popular module framework in Java ecosystem is OSGi .
It is a mature specification with several implementations .
In OSGi modules are called bundles , every bundle is equivalent to one JAR .
Every bundle also contains a META -INF / MANIFEST .MF file that declares which packages are exported and which packages are imported .
Only classes from exported packages can be used by other bundles , every other package in the bundle is internal and its classes can be used only within the bundle .
For example consider following declaration :
Manifest - Version : 1.0 Import - Package : net.krecan.spring.osgi.common
Export - Package : net.krecan.spring.osgi.dao Bundle - Version : 1.0.0 Bundle - Name : demo-spring - osgi-dao Bundle - SymbolicName : net.krecan.spring-osgi.demo-spring-osgi-dao
It specifies bundle demo - spring - osgi - dao that requires classes from net.krecan.spring.osgi.common package and exports classes from net.krecan.spring.osgi.dao package .
In other words , the declaration says that other modules can use only net.krecan.spring.osgi.dao package .
Conversely , this module only needs to use net.krecan.spring.osgi.common package and it is up to OSGi to provide a module that exports the package .
Of course it is possible to declare more then one package in both import and export declaration .
The important thing to notice is that modularity of OSGi is build on top of Java .
It is not part of the language !
Module separation is not enforced by the compiler although it can be enforced by GUI .
An OSGi container is needed to run OSGi based application .
The container can be part of the runtime environment like in Spring DM server or it can be embedded in the application .
The container not only enforces the separation but also provides other services like security , module management and life - cycle management .
OSGi also provides lots of other interesting features , but they are out of scope of this article .
There has been lots of controversy regarding the proposal of JSR - 277 which partially duplicated OSGi .
For many months experts from both sides advocated about which one was better , until it was announced that JSR - 277 was abandoned and new module system which should be part of Java 7 was introduced .
JSR - 294
First part of the new module system is JSR - 294 aka superpackages .
This specification makes the concept of modules part of Java language .
JSR - 294 introduces new visibility keyword " module " .
If a member has this visibility it means that it is only visible by members of the same module .
It enables creation of an internal API that is meant to be used only by the module itself .
As I see it , " public " keyword should be used only when declaring a public API .
In all other cases " module " or more constraining visibility should be used .
Of course , once there is " module " keyword in the language , visibility constrains between modules will be checked by the compiler .
JSR - 294 will also allow dependency definition .
It will be possible to define that one module depends on another module in a given version .
For example :
//org/netbeans/core/module-info.java @ Version ( " 7.0 " ) @ ImportModule ( name= " java.se.core " , version = " 1.7 + " ) module org.netbeans.core ;
The latter means that module " org.netbeans.core " depends on " java.se.core " version 1.7 and higher .
It is equivalent to Maven dependencies or OSGi imports .
You should probably ignore the syntax , since it will probably change .
The important thing here is that module dependencies are defined in module - info .
java file and will be compiled into a class file .
In OSGi , the dependencies are defined in a plain text file .
Project Jigsaw
Project Jigsaw is second part of the proposed module system .
I assume that it will be Sun specific implementation of JSR - 294 .
But it will also be modularization of Sun JDK .
Since there is a need to make the monolithic JDK modular , Sun wants to split standard libraries into modules .
This will allow the facilitation of profiles directly in the JRE .
It would be possible to have full JRE on mobile phone containing everything except Swing .
It would also be possible to introduce new standard APIs into language without having to wait for new release of the whole platform .
It sure looks promising !
But here also comes my first concern .
The line between proprietary Jigsaw and the JSR standard is not clear , as Mark Reinhold 's notices .
This effort [ Jigsaw ] will , of necessity , create a simple , low - level module system whose design will be focused narrowly upon the goal of modularizing the JDK .
This module system will be available for developers to use in their own code , and will be fully supported by Sun , but it will not be an official part of the Java SE 7 Platform Specification and might not be supported by other SE 7 implementations .
This statement is unclear and leaves room for interpretation .
Does it mean that it will be possible to create modules but use them only in Sun JRE ?
Does it mean , that if a developer will write ' @ImportModule ( name= " java.se.core " , version = " 1.7 + " ) ' , it would work on Sun JRE but might not be supported by IBM JRE ?
Does it mean that Sun will split its JRE in one way and Oracle in other way ?
Let 's hope not for the sake of the " write once , run anywhere " principle .
The issue seems to be even deeper .
It is not clear what is the main objective of project Jigsaw .
It is mentioned that the main goal is modularization of Sun JRE , but in this case there are no language changes needed .
Sun can modularize its JRE without changing Java as a language .
Could these language changes be just a byproduct of the Sun JRE modularization ?
If this is true , it 's wrong !
Language change has to be a first class citizen , and not a byproduct of some proprietary effort .
Dependencies
My other concern is about dependencies .
If the module system manages dependencies , classpath is not needed any more .
On one hand that 's great .
Classpath often leads to so called JAR hell .
On the other hand classpath is extremely flexible .
I am afraid , that is not possible to replace classpath by a static module dependencies .
Let 's see why is that :
Deploy - time dependencies
In Java there are two classpaths .
There is a buildpath , which is used at build time and then there is a classpath which is used at runtime .
They are almost identical , but not completely .
Classical example is JDBC driver .
It is not necessary to specify JDBC driver at build time .
JDBC interfaces are part of core Java library .
But it is necessary to have a JDBC driver in the classpath at runtime .
Nowadays , when a programmer wants to change the database , he just changes driver class name in a configuration file , adds driver jar file to the classpath and that 's all .
He can't do this if all the dependencies have to be specified at compile - time !
Of course in Java EE he can use JNDI data source , but there is nothing similar in Java SE and it is not a viable solution to recompile the application every time the JDBC driver has to be changed .
Often the recompilation is not even possible .
In some organizations the final application is assembled from modules by someone called Application Assembler .
He does not have the source code , he just puts JARs together , changes configuration files and creates the final package .
Application Assembler role is even specified in Java EE specification .
Optional dependencies
Similar problem are optional dependencies .
Lets pretend that we are working on a logging framework like log4j .
This library is able to log over JMS , therefore JMS packages have to be in the build path .
But 99 % of the users are not using JMS logging , so they do not need the dependency in their classpath .
There has to be some mechanism that deals with such situations .
A library is needed in order to build the module , but this dependency is optional for the end users .
Of course , in a perfect world , the JMS functionality would be in a separate module , but we do not live in a perfect world and sometimes it is not practical to split a project in such way .
Dependency conflicts
Another big issue are dependency conflicts .
If you work with Maven , you know what I am talking about .
Average enterprise application consists of dozens third party libraries , all of them have dependencies and sometimes those dependencies are in conflict .
For example , a developer wants to use Hibernate that depends on commons - collections 2.1.1 .
He also wants to use commons - dbcp that depends on commons - collections 2.1 .
The developer or application assembler has to decide what to do in such situation .
He can either decide that he wants to use only one specific version of the library everywhere in the application , or he can decide that it is satisfactory to use different versions in different parts of the application .
The important thing is that this situation cannot be resolved automatically .
It has to be decided by someone who knows how the module is used in a given application and recognizes possible incompatibilities between versions .
There are a lot of things that can be said about Java dependencies that are beyond the scope of this article , but the main point to keep is that they are not static !
An application can be built with one set of libraries and run with completely different set .
Every modular system has to deal with this situation one way or the other .
Maven has lot of configuration options on how to configure dependencies , how to deal with dependency conflicts etc .
But it is still just a build system .
In the worst case it is still possible to configure the classpath manually .
OSGi is in the opposite situation .
It deals only with runtime ( deploy - time ) dependencies , but it does n't deal with build - time .
The new Java module system will be used for both build and runtime ( I assume ) .
It brings even more complexity to an already complex problem .
Conclusion
Of course , I do not think that Sun engineers want to break Java .
I know that they want to make Java better and easier to use , but I am just afraid that political and marketing reasons will be stronger than technical .
For one more time , it is not just an API change or Sun specific change .
It will be a language change !
And once the language is changed , once the " module " keyword is added , there is no way back .
There will be a module system in Java and we will have to use it whether we like it or not .
It is hard to imagine a situation where there will be a modular JVM , " module " keyword in the language , and we will still be using OSGi on top of it .

Tax rebates have encouraged consumers to spend more
The US economy grew at a revised 3.3 % annually in the second quarter of 2008 , the Commerce Department said , much higher than its first estimate of 1.9 % .
The rebound was linked to strong US exports , helped by the weak dollar , while government tax rebates also boosted consumer spending .
GDP grew at a rate of 0.9 % in the first quarter , after a 0.2 % contraction in the last three months of 2007 .
The Federal Reserve has warned the economy will remain weak this year .
" While we 're not out of the woods yet , maybe we 're beginning to see some sunlight , " said John Wilson , equity strategist at Morgan Keegan .
" At some point , the market will begin to look through the trough and gauge the strength of the coming upturn . "
' No recession '
The data showed that exports grew at an annualised rate of 13.2 % , higher than the government 's initial estimate of 9.2 % .
Imports fell at a rate of 7.6 % as the US economic slowdown reduced demands for goods made overseas .
The improved trade balance added 3.1 percentage points to second - quarter GDP , the biggest since 1980 .
The slowdown in the housing market was evident , as builders cut back and businesses reduced their spending .
Consumer spending , boosted by the government 's $ 600 tax rebate payments , rose by 1.7 % , slightly higher than the previous quarter 's 1.5 % .
Some observers said that the figures lent support to the argument that the US was not heading for a recession .
" For a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly , " said Avery Shenfeld , senior economist at CIBC World Markets .
" A lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that can't continue during slowing growth overseas .
" But I would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas ... this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession . "
16 - year low However recent data on the US housing market suggests a grim outlook for the sector .
US house prices were down a record 15.4 % in the April to June quarter compared with a year ago , according to a closely - watched report released earlier this week .
The decline was recorded by the latest S&P / Case - Shiller survey of US national home prices .
The report said the fact that the falls were nationwide was the latest sign the US housing downturn is continuing .
Separate government data said sales of new homes were at an annual rate of 515,000 units in July , up slightly from June , but still near a 16 - year low , and half the rate of new home sales one year ago .

What are these ?
What in heaven ’s name does Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have against honeybees ?
That question haunted my days after I saw the Kentucky Republican on TV fulminating about a provision he found in the proposed government stimulus package .
The provision , he said , would provide $ 150 million for “ honeybee insurance . ”
“ This is nonsense , ” he said , as if he took it personally .
You had to think he got stung as a kid or maybe caught a local swarm in the act of recruiting aphids for Al Qaeda .
So I resolved to get to the bottom of this scandalous expenditure .
Advertisement
But first , a little background .
McConnell ’s Sunday appearance on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” was part of a full - scale GOP assault on the Obama administration ’s stimulus bill , which was passed last week by the House with zero Republican support .
The package is being debated this week in the Senate .
The GOP , as I write , is thinking about a filibuster .
Yet the Republicans seem to have trouble coming up with more than irrelevant or trivial arguments .
Appearing on ABC on Sunday , Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) , for instance , owned up to calling the stimulus plan the “ worst plan since the 16th Amendment paved the way for the income tax . ”
Because the 16th Amendment was ratified in 1913 , this rather dated DeMint ’s mind - set .
In any event , he did n’t offer a proposal on how to fund the government , including his paycheck , without an income tax .
He just complained that the stimulus plan involved a lot of spending .
He would prefer that it all be in tax cuts , apparently on the grounds that the tax cuts enacted under the Bush administration in 2001 bequeathed to us an economy that has performed so well .
Advertisement
On NBC , Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - Texas ) , said she wanted the bill to have more spending on infrastructure , but she wanted it to be on military infrastructure , even though much of that winds up as scrap metal in Iraq and Afghanistan , not bridges and schoolhouses in the United States .
She said she would strip from the bill all the “ social spending that is not going to create jobs , ” but when pressed by Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , her on - air debating partner , she agreed to preserve some social spending , such as unemployment benefits .
The effect of this exchange was to leave Hutchison sounding as though she made up her position as she went along .
Very little of these discussions addressed the principle underlying the stimulus bill .
The idea is that when the private sector withdraws from the economy by cutting back on capital spending and laying off workers , it is up to the government to take up the slack , if necessary via deficit spending .
This is n’t radical thinking .
It ’s endorsed by , among others , Martin Feldstein , who was Ronald Reagan ’s chief economic advisor and is consistently voted by his peers as the Economist Least Likely to be Mistaken for a Democrat .
Feldstein opposes most of the tax cuts favored by the GOP , especially business tax cuts .
To be fair , he is n’t entirely enamored of President Obama ’s proposal -- he thinks it should spend more on programs that will produce more short - term employment and less on open - ended programs .
Advertisement
Yet the plan before the Senate includes hundreds of billions of dollars in near - term programs and projects .
There ’s $ 90 billion for school construction and renovation and educational grants and $ 79 billion for state educational programs , most of which would be spent within two years .
Of the $ 27 billion for highway construction , most would be spent within four years .
The bill also appropriates billions for the kind of forward - looking projects we ’ve neglected during the last two decades , such as broadband infrastructure , water and anti-pollution programs , and alternative energy research , which will produce long - term economic benefits for the entire country .
Is it possible to slip pork into a bill this massive ?
Well , duh .
But pork is often in the eye of the beholder .
House Republicans this week released a list of $ 19 billion in provisions they called “ wasteful ” ( i.e. , 2 % of the total package ) .
But the list includes numerous projects that many Americans would support and that would plainly stimulate our limping construction and manufacturing sectors .
For example , the purchase of new computers and vehicles for federal agencies , the building of fire stations and other public facilities , and the upgrade of rail lines .
Is this the best the GOP can come up with ?
Or are Republicans just determined to undermine the recovery effort ?
It ’s hard to disagree with Obama ’s complaint that “ modest differences ” over the package are being inflated to stall the whole program .

That brings us to McConnell and his problem with “ honeybee insurance . ”
It turns out that the Senate minority leader took his cue from Neil Cavuto of Fox News , who has been carrying on about the topic for more than a week .
Their campaign was joined Tuesday by Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) , who stood on the floor of the chamber challenging “ any member to come and explain what that provision was . ”
I ’m no senator , but I ’m pleased to inform Vitter that it is , in fact , a disaster insurance program for all livestock producers .
Beekeepers obviously would be minor beneficiaries next to , say , cattle ranchers , so it ’s a tad bit dishonest to label the whole program “ honeybee insurance . ”
The provision simply continues a program enacted by Congress last year , overriding a veto by President Bush .
In other words , the Senate voted on it twice in 2008 -- once to enact and once to override .
Connoisseurs of political comedy will see the punch line coming : McConnell and Vitter voted yea both times .
So it turns out that McConnell is n’t really against honeybees .
He ’s only using them to pretend that he ’s got a principled objection to a stimulus plan aimed at pulling the country out of the most severe recession in decades .

The moment the family of Jean Charles de Menezes attempted to force their way past a group of private security guards into the inquest courtroom marked the lowest point in a multi-million pound hearing into the fatal shooting of an innocent man by the Metropolitan police .
Any semblance of trust between the relatives and the establishment , in the person of the coroner and the court , dissolved into a volley of recriminations and accusations after Sir Michael Wright made a series of decisions that made the family question the openness and impartiality of proceedings .
The dramatic scenes , which can only now be reported after the lifting of a media gagging order imposed by Wright , came on December 5 , one hour before jurors were sent out to begin their deliberations on a verdict .
After two IPCC investigations into the shooting of the innocent Brazilian man and a crown court trial , the hopes of the family were high that the inquest , held in the surroundings of the Oval cricket ground amid much publicity , would establish the facts of the fatal shooting and come to a verdict that accurately represented the events of the day .
What they wanted , the relatives said , was some sort of accountability .
What they believe they were given was a slanted inquiry , held back by the restrictions on the verdict imposed by the coroner .
They believe he forced the jury into a corner , withdrawing any freedom to return a critical narrative on the shooting or to find unlawful killing - either on the grounds that an individual or individuals had committed murder or manslaughter .
These decisions began a week of escalating tension that exploded into open hostility between the family and the court and resulted in the relatives withdrawing their legal team and their cooperation .
" It is increasingly clear in the last week that the coroner 's impartiality has simply disappeared , " said Jasmin Khan of the Justice4Jean campaign .
" That is one of the reasons why the family felt they had no choice but to withdraw their cooperation . "
The relatives had hoped the jury would be told of their decision to withdraw before they retired to consider their verdicts , but the barristers for the police and the coroner agreed that only the blandest of statements about the absence of the family 's legal team could be given to the jury .
" The less said the better , " said Richard Horwell QC , representing the commissioner of the Met .
The coroner had earlier ordered the public and the media to leave the courtroom while he completed his summing up to the jury last week , giving no reason except to say he had reached a " sensitive " point in the hearing .
When the public refused amid repeated requests for clarification of his ruling , there was a standoff for an hour and 40 minutes .
The public refused to leave and the coroner refused to return to court .
At one point the team of bouncers with walkie - talkie microphones on their shirt cuffs who had been hired to provide security at the inquest were seen huddling in a corner .
" We ca n't use violence , that 's clear , " one was overheard saying .
Eventually the coroner 's orders were upheld and the public , including supporters of the family , left the court .
The relatives were held back by security guards and kept out of the courtroom while barristers , police and the coroner filed in .
Having lost all faith that those inside would honour the principle that " justice should not only be done , but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done " , they attempted to storm into the courtroom .
Today , although the hearing is over and the verdict delivered , the accusations , bitterness and recriminations continue from those who believe that the inquest was never an open , impartial examination of the facts .
LONDON , Jan. 13 ( UPI ) --
The environmental group Greenpeace has purchased land outside of London meant for a third Heathrow Airport runway and has vowed to defend it against the plans .
With the British government expected to approve the airport expansion this week , Greenpeace says its move is meant to put legal hurdles in the way of the project , hoping that the longer it is delayed , the more likely it is to be canceled , The Times of London reported Tuesday .

The newspaper said the field , about the size of a soccer pitch , will be used by Greenpeace to dig a network of tunnels and will be subdivided into tiny plots with separate owners so Heathrow owner BAA would be forced to enter into time - consuming negotiations with each owner .
British actress Emma Thompson was among those who signed the deeds to the site late last week , The Times said .
" I do n't understand how any government remotely serious about committing to reversing climate change can even consider these ridiculous plans , " she told the newspaper .
" We 'll stop this from happening even if we have to move in and plant vegetables . "

The parents of Deutsch ’s close friends lost $ 4 million to Madoff ’s alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme .
“ Every penny gone , ” the former Big Idea host said , visibly agitated .
So the fact that Madoff is n’t yet in jail is “ an abomination . ”
“ He destroyed lives , ” Deutsch said .
“ The fact that this guy ’s still sitting in an apartment and he ’s going to watch the BCS game tonight is a travesty . ”
How could this happen ?
“ Because we trust people , ” Deutsch said .
“ In money and in business , you bet on people … so if you trusted this guy , even if you were financially savvy , ” it cost you .
“ If anything , maybe it teaches you , you have to bet on yourself , ” Deutsch said .
“ You ca n’t bet on somebody else to make you money . ”

Now THIS is an agenda
by Jeremy Hooper
Human life that is sacred from the time of conception -- except in cases of war , capital punishment , or retaliation against our enemies .
Marriages that are defined by the gender of the participants , not the love and commitment shared between the duo .
Science teaching that ignores prevailing scientific opinion in favor of personal religious belief .
Restricting games of chance because a small minority find them uncontrollably tempting .
Throwing around terms like " socialistic , " when what you more readily mean really mean is principled , reasonable , and compassionate .
This from Florida Baptist Witness :
TALLAHASSEE ( FBW ) — With a looming budget deficit anticipated to dictate much of the action of the annual state legislative session , Florida Baptist Convention legislative consultant Bill Bunkley is urging Florida Baptists to evaluate budget priorities “ through the lens of God ’s principles and His priorities ” — and to urge the Legislature to do the same .
Bunkley offered his annual preview of the legislative session , set to convene the first week in March , in comments to Florida Baptist Witness .
“ Of primary concern to Florida Baptists should be the sanctity of human life from the womb to the tomb , marriages defined and supported as those anchored by a husband and wife , educational honesty about the creation and development of the world as created by God , the further temptation of those experiencing financial hardship by increased gambling venues and incremental moves by government to adopt a socialistic approach to providing necessary services , ” he said , summarizing the major concerns he will be watching on behalf of Florida Baptists this session .
Florida Baptists urged to ‘ closely monitor ’ Legislature [ FBW ]
Hold me , daddy .
The suggested worldview scared me .
Your thoughts
If they want to think that way , it 's fine with me .
However , I would hope that they would also keep their religion out of our government .
This is what I do n't get .
We have a friend that thinks that way , and he always votes straight Republican .
The problem is he 's gay and will nail anything with a y chromosome and a bit of a pulse .
He has no problem with hooking up with someone he just ran into online .
He even cruises truck stops .
I do n't understand how he reconciles his beliefs with his actions .

" However , I would hope that they would also keep their religion out of our government . "
Well unfortunately , this entire piece is about pressuring legislators to vote for " pro-family " policies .
So no , that 's not the plan .

I think we should get an Orthodox Jew somewhere in the Senate who wants to : 1 . ) Make the sale of meat / cheese products illegal
2. ) Make the use of electricity on Fridays illegal
3. ) Make pants for women illegal
4. ) Make a law that requires all delis to be kosher
5. ) Make the sale / presentation of shellfish and / or pork illegal on any restaurant menus
6. ) Make Cheeseburgers or any pork products or food demmed unkosher illegal in public schools .
7. ) Require Hebrew prayer to be taught and enforced in public schools .
8. ) Make it illegal for married women to leave the house without a head cover
9. ) Make it illegal for men / women to touch in public
10 . ) Outlaw any wedding ceremony that did n't segregate men and women .
11 . ) Make it manditory that all wedding dresses are conservative , long sleeve dresses .
See how the Christians like having someone else 's religion shoved down their throats for a day .
See how they feel being told one person 's beliefs should be the law of the land .

I swear , when I become president , I WILL put an end to this .
Some how , some way , I will .
It is not right in any sense of the term , and encroaches on others freedom of religion .
I know I will probably be hated by that generation , but I 'd rather do what I know is right then bend to the will of a vast majority bully .
And I 'll be PROUD , dangit !

Stef :
You raise an interesting point .
I was raised in the Bible Belt South , but now live in NYC where I married ( or , technically , will soon marry ) into a Jewish family .
So now , the orthodox form of religion to which I am most exposed is Orthodox Judaism .
The differences between the two could not be greater .
Heck , Andrew and I have even happily , non-controversially attended more than a few Orthodox weddings and other events , where our love is recognized and publicly respected .
The problem , which is obvious but not nearly discussed enough , is the Christian orthodoxy 's desire to evangelize to EVERYONE .
We have to have more people , of all faith views , standing up and resisting the attempts to force any religion down anyone 's throat .
Especially when we are talking about civil government .

The Federal Reserve inched toward a new program to purchase long - term U.S. Treasury securities , possibly the next step in the central bank 's battle against a recession that it said has only deepened in recent weeks .
" Industrial production , housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply , as consumers and businesses have cut back spending , " Fed officials said Wednesday in a policy statement following a two - day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee , which sets the central bank 's direction .
" Furthermore , global demand appears to be slowing significantly . "
The Fed has already pulled its main lever for managing the economy as far as it can .
Its benchmark short - term interest rate -- the federal - funds rate -- hovers near zero , and policy makers reiterated the rate would remain low " for some time . "
With the funds rate about as low as it can go , officials are focused on developing new lending and asset - purchase programs to bring down an array of other interest rates and boost the economy .
On the list of next steps could be an effort to buy long - term government debt , which could in effect lower rates on mortgages and other debt .
But the Fed is taking a slow path toward embracing the idea , something that has unsettled some investors .
Disappointed that the central bank did n't take a more decisive step toward buying government bonds , investors sold Treasury bonds Wednesday .

Advertisement Honda is pulling out of Formula
One , blaming the world economic crisis for plans to sell its team .
The decision leaves Englishman Jenson Button and 2009 team - mate Rubens Barrichello without drives , with only a few mid-ranking seats still available .
Honda , which spent more than £ 300 m a year on F1 , said it would also no longer supply the sport with engines .
The team say they are optimistic they will find a buyer who will enable them to continue in the sport .
Chief executive Nick Fry said he has had three approaches already .
But a deadline of January has been set to find an investor and workers at Honda 's Brackley base have been told to expect redundancy letters before Christmas .
" Honda Motor Co. has come to the conclusion that we will withdraw from all Formula One activities , making 2008 the last season for participation , " said Honda president Takeo Fukui at an emotional press conference .
HONDA IN F1 Honda team created in 2006 after BAR team was taken over Finished fourth in 2006 constructors ' championship with 86 points , but struggled to eighth in 2007 ( six points ) and ninth in 2008 ( 14 points )
Team costs Honda £ 200 m annually with more than 800 staff at Brackley Honda ran F1 cars with minimal advertising , meaning more funding had to come from Japanese parent company English driver Jenson Button could lose his place in the sport if the team were to fold " This difficult decision has been made in light of the quickly deteriorating operating environment facing the global auto industry ... and the sudden contraction of the world economies , " he added .
" Honda must protect its core business activities and secure the long term as widespread uncertainties in the economics around the globe continue to mount . "
According to the Reuters news agency , team bosses Ross Brawn and Nick Fry told a meeting of the Formula One Teams '
Association they had a month to find a buyer , otherwise Honda were closing the team .
BBC sports news correspondent Adam Parsons said the team was available for a nominal fee of £ 1 .
But any new owner would need a budget of at least £ 40 m to compete in F1 next year .
If no buyer is found , Honda 's decision will leave F1 with just 18 cars on the grid next season .
Honda said next year 's Japanese Grand Prix at its Suzuka circuit would go ahead as planned .

Honda recently cut road vehicle production as a response to the global economic crisis - the company 's sales in its key US market were down 30 % last month .
F1 is a notoriously expensive sport in which to compete , and teams have spent recent months in intensive discussions over cost - cutting measures .
Max Mosley , president of world motorsport governing body the FIA , recently urged teams to find ways to reduce costs .
In an exclusive interview with the BBC , Mosley described Honda 's withdrawal as a significant warning to the rest of the teams to start cutting costs dramatically .
Mosley wants to make drastic changes for the 2010 season - including making a standard engine and gearbox available to all teams at a projected cost of 5 m Euro ( £ 4.4 m ) per team .
Jenson Button faces an uncertain future after the announcement
The idea is opposed by the road - car constructors still in F1 , who are proposing a new engine formula of their own .
Honda 's decision came as a surprise within the sport as it curtails the company 's involvement just when they were expecting to deliver on their investment .
Honda appointed Brawn , the man who masterminded seven world titles for Michael Schumacher at Benetton and Ferrari , as their team principal prior to the start of the 2008 season .
His arrival was seen as the signal for the start of a concerted push for success by the company after several seasons as also - rans .
The company returned to F1 as a team owner and car builder in 2005 , having spent five years as an engine supplier to the British American Racing team .
But they have struggled to make an impact at the top levels of the sport .
Their sole victory of the modern era came with Button 's win at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2006 .
But they have been uncompetitive in the last two seasons - and they effectively wrote off 2008 to focus on building as competitive car as possible for next year , when new rules will be introduced .
Brawn said on Friday he was confident Honda would have been at the front in 2009 .

Considered a major player within F1 , Honda bankrolled more than 700 staff at the team 's Northamptonshire base and had one of the largest budgets in the sport .
In November , Honda announced it would build fewer cars in Japan , Europe and the US to reflect bleak economic prospects in the vehicle manufacturing industry .
Sales of new cars in the UK suffered their biggest monthly drop in 28 years , while car makers Ford , GM and Chrysler have asked the US Congress for multi-billion dollar loans to guarantee their survival .
The last team to leave F1 were Honda - backed minnows Super Aguri , which folded for financial reasons in April .
Honda 's own F1 team endured a deeply disappointing 2008 season on the track , earning just 14 points , leaving them the lowest of the nine points - scoring teams .
Button found himself ranked 18th in the drivers ' list , contributing only three points .
Only four drivers , each without a point to their name , ranked below him .
Barrichello earned the remaining 11 points - more than half of them earned with a third place in the wet British Grand Prix .
Honda initially entered F1 as a constructor in the 1960s , withdrawing at the end of 1968 .
606 : DEBATE Terribly sad for all concerned .
Hopefully some sort of independent team can rise from the ashes
GordonMurray
The company returned to F1 in the 1980s as an engine supplier with great success with the Williams and McLaren teams and then purchased a stake in the BAR team from British American Tobacco ( BAT ) in 2004 .
Honda bought out BAT in 2005 to form the Honda team for the 2006 season .
While the team finished fourth in the 2006 constructors ' championship , they have subsequently struggled to make an impact .
The 2009 Formula One season begins on 29 March , in Australia .

Druid wars :
How a drunken row over 4,000 - year - old bones is causing chaos in pagan circles
Druid dispute : King Arthur Pendragon is mightily annoyed
The last time I met King Arthur Uther Pendragon — at a summer solstice ceremony at Stonehenge — he was staggering about blind drunk , sword in one hand , warm can of Stella in the other , his long white robes rather worse for wear .
He proudly told me that he had loads of children , but could n’t remember exactly how many — ‘ the King ’s a bit of a tart , you see ’ — and very thoughtfully invited me to join his harem if I ‘ fancied a bit ’ .
He then made a great show of pretending to grab my right breast .
So as I park on a stretch of muddy grass next to his very small and tatty caravan which overlooks the famous pagan site , I am a little nervous .
Not just because he ’s a randy old lush , but because he has a pretty fearsome reputation as a self - styled warrior , political activist , new age militant , very enthusiastic demonstrator — he ’s camped out here on some sort of protest about the Stonehenge Visitor Centre — and Battle chieftain of the Council of British Druid Orders , or COBDO .
Happily , this year , he ’s sober ( if very keen to get down the pub ) and extraordinarily chatty , with a tendency to ramble .
‘ I ’m a spiritual warrior .
I ’m here to bang heads together to get everyone on the same side and I ’m prepared to fight for what I believe in .
. .
‘ Like this huge row over the skeletons — do n’t whatever you do listen to that other bunch of idiots who make up COBDO West .
No one bothers with them , I ’m Battle chieftain , I decide the policy and what I say goes —
I think we should let those who lay at rest , stay at rest .
You would n’t want someone digging up your grandma from the churchyard , would you ? ’
It ’s difficult to know where to start ...
The ‘ skeletons ’ are the 4,000 - year - old remains of a young girl called ‘ Charlie ’ and seven other sets of prehistoric bones , excavated near the ancient stone circle in Avebury , Wiltshire , and now on display at the Alexander Keiller Museum in the village .
The ‘ row ’ concerns a small breakaway group of druids ( known to some as COBDO West ) who ’ve requested the museum release the remains so they can rebury them where they came from .
King Arthur and mainstream COBDO want the same thing — but are upset that COBDO
West have taken matters into their own hands .
‘ COBDO
West are just a joke — three men and a dog , without even the dog , ’ splutters King Arthur .
‘ I ’ve got thousands of members in my Arthurian War Band all round the world and loads more in the UK .
I could field hundreds of activists at the drop of a hat .
Bunch of idiots . ’
Gosh .
Silly me , I thought druids were just a bunch of tree - huggers who wore flowing robes , paid homage to the sun and were full of peace and love .
I could n’t be more wrong .
Because the Council of British Druid Orders is at war .
Or , more accurately , a few key members are at war , after a punch - up in a pub and a horribly acrimonious split back in 2006 .
Today , no one seems able to remember exactly what it was all about but for the past two years , they ’ve been busy slinging mud , insults and the odd fist at each other .
The bones at the centre of the row were found at Stonehenge
On one side is my old friend King Arthur , an ex-soldier , ex-builder and ex-Hell ’s Angel who changed his name by deed poll to King Arthur Uther Pendragon in 1976 .
He sports long grey locks , a big grizzly beard and a slew of tattoos .
On his ‘ team ’ are Rollo Maughfling , alias the Elder Arch Druid of Stonehenge , and his COBDO supporters .
On the other , the breakaway COBDO West , is Paul Davies , Druid Chief Reburials Officer , who lives on a narrow boat in Bath and started all this fuss about the skeletons , and the very hirsute Archdruid of Exmoor , who merely identifies himself as ‘ Steve ’ .
The latter , now 53 , is teetotal and claims King Arthur is a drunken , self - invented , aggressive fraud who has a nasty tendency to throw up in sacred circles and is a hazard with his faithful sword —
‘ I ’ve seen him wave it about when he ’s p***ed and nearly decapitate people . ’
‘ A lot of people are embarrassed by it all — very embarrassed , ’ says Emma Restall Orr , a druidic teacher and priestess from Warwick - shire .
‘ They ’re feisty , burly lads who are very much on the edge of druidism but are rowing in public and giving druids a bad name . ’
And there are an awful lot of druids out there — according to Professor Ronald Hutton ( a leading authority on paganism ) there are more than 10,000 in the UK .
There are countless cults , covens and orders , and with meetings ( or moots ) just as likely to be down the pub now as in a moonlit wood , this 9,000 - year - old branch of paganism is becoming more and more mainstream .
Peacemaker : Terry Dobney , aka Chief Druid of Avebury , is calling for a Druid code of conduct
But the definition of druidism is also pretty vague .
It has been described alternately as the ‘ nature religion of Albion ’ ; ‘ the sacredness of the earth and nature and all living things ’ ; and a ‘ natural spiritualism ’ .
Terry Dobney has been a druid for 50 years and has been Chief Druid and Keeper of the Stones at Avebury for the past 11 .
He wears long white robes and an antler on his belt , clasps a hazel staff and has a rook ’s feather in his cap .
‘ Druids are supposed to have a balanced view and see both sides of the argument , ’ he explains .
‘ But there are some strong egotistical characters who need keeping in check .
We ’re drawing up a code of conduct for being a druid .
‘ There are very few actual time - served druids .
It takes a minimum of 21 years before you can call yourself a druid . ’
According to Terry , it starts with a year and a day learning all the ceremonies with a mentor druid .
The next seven practising what you ’ve learned — ‘ it ’s an oral tradition , so you ’re not supposed to write it down ’ .
Seven more dressed in blue , getting a handle on the poetry and music .
And , finally , the white robes and a political role .
Which , if you believe King Arthur as he sits nursing a pint of Strongbow in the pub with his girlfriend Kazz , 49 , is where he is now .
‘ I work out the political tactics for the druids .
My order is the political arm .
We ’re the guys in white frocks , up the trees .
We ’re the ones trying to stop the Newbury by - pass . ’
Has n’t that been open for a few years ?
‘ Whatever — we ’re at the sharp end .
We ’re the political arm of the whole spiritual movement . ’
But it ’s tricky to get a handle on what this lot actually believe in .
Terry ’s take is : ‘ We ’re born , we reproduce if we ’re lucky , and we die .
I certainly do n’t believe in any sort of goddess . ’
For the Archdruid of Exmoor it ’s all about helping and healing , though he dismisses Terry ’s 21 - year druidic training scheme as ‘ a complete load of rubbish — no need to take any notice of that because every druid is different ’ .
Paul Davies , for example , says : ‘ It ’s all about respecting nature as a living being , and beauty and power and love of nature — the ceremonies help us become part of nature and the local landscape . ’
King Arthur , meanwhile , seems more preoccupied with his passport , which he produces in the pub .
‘ Look — look !
I ’m the only subject of Her Majesty the Queen who is allowed to wear a crown on his passport photo !’
There does seem to be a certain lack of spiritualism among some Council members .
Which is a terrible shame for the rest of Britain ’s druids , quietly getting on with their lives , planting trees , performing ceremonies and trying their utmost to live at one with nature .
And finally , the skeletons — what ’s that all about ?
Paul Davies kindly explains .
‘ It ’s very simple .
Christian remains are automatically reburied if they are exhumed for any reason and it seems reasonable that non- Christians should have the same rights . ’
Which , on the face of it , seems pretty reasonable .
Indeed , pretty much the only sensible thing I ’ve heard all day and the only thing they all seem to agree on .
Meanwhile , back in his local , I buy King Arthur another pint and make my farewells to him and Kazz .
‘ Sorry about the summer solstice , ’ he mutters .
‘ It ’s always quite a long night , ’ adds Kazz , diplomatically .

No matter how much we progress as far as technology is concerned , we always look back towards retro stalwarts for inspiration in the designing field .
NVDRS
Tape foxes around in the Cassette Tape construction but is actually a digital player .
Deceptive looks aside , the player continues to follow the 45/60/90 minutes norm , holding 10/15/20 select songs in digital format ; uploaded via USB .
Designers : Stefano Pertegato , Massimiliano Rampoldi , Eloisa Tolu , Francesco Schiraldi & Giovanni Mendini
There are a couple of things regarding this player that really stands out .
Like for example , if you want to forward or rewind a song , you need to manually do it by rotating the spools with your finger or pencil .
To play just slide the Play Button .
Charging it depends how good are you at … you guessed it …rotating the spools !
Rotating the second hole of the tape charges the kinetic battery .
An LED light indicates the power status : Green - full charge ; Amber - Medium Charge ; Red- will die out any moment .
Between the two wheels is nestled a small display that only shows you the time elapsed for the song , nothing else !
Both the 90 and 60 - minute versions are housed in recycled aluminum enclosures , however the 45 - min one is constructed from Polypropylene .
Retro , green and spunky makes this my wishlist priority .
BEIRUT - A yacht carrying international peace activists and medical supplies to the embattled Gaza Strip was turned back and damaged in an altercation with the Israeli navy yesterday , Israel and trip organizers said .
The vessel , called SS Dignity , was greeted by a small , cheering crowd as it pulled into the southern Lebanese port of Tyre with damage near the prow .
Its aid trip was foiled as Israel wages a major bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 360 people since Saturday .
Yigal Palmor , Israel 's Foreign Ministry spokesman , said an Israeli navy ship intercepted the boat , which he said ignored a radio order to turn back as it approached Gaza early yesterday .
Palmor said the boat tried to outmaneuver an Israeli navy ship and crashed into it , slightly damaging both vessels .
The navy then escorted the boat out into the territorial waters of Cyprus .
But passengers and crew aboard the SS Dignity disputed the Israeli account , saying the Israeli vessel rammed the ship .
" We were prevented from entering Gaza . . . by Israeli patrol boats that tracked us for about 30 minutes .
They shone their spotlight on us , and then all of a sudden they rammed us approximately three times , twice in the front and once in the side , " said former US representative Cynthia McKinney of Georgia , who was aboard the boat .
" Communications from the Israelis indicated that we were involved in terrorist activities .
. . .
I presume that 's why they rammed our boat , " she added .
The boat 's British captain , Denis Healey , said the Israeli action occurred " without any warning or any provocation . "
Organizers said the boat was in international waters - 90 miles off the coast of Gaza - when it was intercepted .
The 66 - foot yacht set off from Cyprus on Monday with almost 4 tons of Cypriot - donated medical supplies , including antibiotics , as well as 16 passengers from the United States , Cyprus , Britain , Australia , Ireland , and elsewhere .
The trip was organized by the Free Gaza group , which has made five deliveries of aid by boat to Gaza since August , defying a blockade imposed by Israel when Hamas gained control of the territory in June 2007 .

Apple 's broadening of App Store acceptances has opened the door to a number of new novelty applications including InfoMedia 's iFart Mobile [ App Store ] .
The $ 0.99 humor application has rapidly seen success and has rocketed up to the # 1 App Sales slot .
Most interesting is that the developer of the app has been very transparent about his sales numbers during his app 's climb in ranking .
From a previous blog post :
12/14 - 841 units - # 76 overall
12/15 - 1510 units - # 39 overall
12/16 - 1797 units - # 22 overall
12/17 - 2836 units - # 15 overall
12/18 - 3086 units - # 10 overall
12/19 - 3117 units - # 9 overall
12/20 - 5497 units , - # 4 overall
He 's since revealed to us the most recent sales numbers for the last couple of days which includes the coveted # 1 spot on the App Store 's Top 100 sales .
12/21 - 9760 units , # 2 overall
12/22 - 13274 units , # 1 overall
After Apple 's 30 % cut , that means the iFart Mobile is generated $ 9198 in one day .
These sales numbers are especially interesting to developers looking at the potential market for their iPhone apps .
From what we 've heard from developers , however , these targets do constantly change and have been growing .
So app sales for the # 1 spot will likely increase over time as the installed market of iPhones and iPod touches continue to increase .

Since the original seminal paper , Introduction to Coenzyme Q10 , Dr. Langsjoen and his wife have co-authored dozens of papers dealing with the consequences of lack of sufficient bioavailability of Coenzyme Q10 .
Out of this abundance of papers I have chosen the following few , best depicting the efforts of the Langsjoens to communicate their views and research findings to the medical community .
1. ) Supplemental Ubiquinol in Patients with Advanced Congestive Heart Failure
Peter H. Langsjoen - East Texas Medical Center and Trinity Mother Francis Hospital , TX , USA
Alena M. Langsjoen - Coenzyme Q10 Laboratory , Inc. , Tyler , TX , USA
Abstract :
Patients with moderately advanced ( New York Heart Association class IV ) congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , often fail to achieve adequate plasma CoQ10 levels on supplemental ubiquinone at dosages up to 900 mg / day .
These patients often have plasma total CoQ10 levels of less than 2.5 μg/ml and have limited clinical improvement .
It is postulated that the intestinal edema in these critically ill patients may impair CoQ10 absorption .
We identified seven patients with advanced CHF ( mean ejection fraction ( EF ) of 22 % ) with sub - therapeutic plasma CoQ10 levels with mean level of 1.6 μg/ ml on an average dose of 450 mg of ubiquinone daily ( 150-600 mg /day ) .
All seven of these patients were changed to an average of 580 mg / day of ubiquinol ( 450-900 mg / day ) with follow - up plasma CoQ10 levels , clinical status , and EF measurements by echocardiography .
Mean plasma CoQ10 levels increased from 1.6 μg/ml ( 0.9-2.0 μg/ml ) up to 6.5 μg/ml ( 2.6-9.3 μg/ml ) .
Mean EF improved from 22 % ( 10 - 35 % ) up to 39 % ( 10 - 60 % ) and clinical improvement has been remarkable with NYHA class improving from a mean of IV to a mean of II ( I to III ) .
Ubiquinol has dramatically improved absorption in patients with severe heart failure and the improvement in plasma CoQ10 levels is correlated with both clinical improvement and improvement in measurement of left ventricular function .
2. ) Statin Induced Cardiomyopathy
By Peter H. Langsjoen , M.D. , F.A.C.C .
In this paper Peter Langsjoen directed his primary attention to the effect of statins on cardiac muscle performance .
In the final paragraph of this report he states , " Statin - induced CoQ10 depletion is the topic of a recent petition to the FDA requesting that this drug / nutrient interaction be identified in a black box warning as part of statin package insert information .
A comprehensive review of animal and human trials addressing this issue has been submitted to the FDA as a supporting document .
We , of course , do not expect any response from the FDA , but 10 years from now when the full extent of statin toxicity becomes painfully evident , at least we can , in good conscience , know that we tried and who knows , sometimes small sparks may spread in dry grass . "
3. ) Statins Contraindicated in Heart Failure
By Peter H. Langsjoen , M.D. , F.A.C.C .
In this paper Langsjoen makes one of the strongest early warnings of the relationship between statins and congestive cardiac failure .
With researchers Eddie Voss , MEng and Luca Mascitelli , MD of THINCS ( The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics ) the aggravation and even causation of congestive heart failure by statin drugs was brought to light and introduced to the medical community .
In this report they drew attention to the fact that statins lowered serum LDL cholesterol and CoQ10 both by 51 % in one study and emphasized that without CoQ10 , mitochondria cannot produce adenosine triphosphate , which provides the energy for muscle heart contraction .
They concluded by saying , " Based on the foregoing , we conclude that statins are contraindicated in patients with borderline and full - blown heart failure . "
4. ) Treatment of Heart Disease with Coenzyme Q10
By Peter H. Langsjoen , M.D. , F.A.C.C .
In the text of this early paper , Langsjoen describes his clinical research .
" CoQ10 was added to standard treatments for heart failure such as fluid pills ( diuretics ) , digitalis preparations ( Lanoxin ) , and ACE inhibitors .
Several trials involved the comparison between supplemental CoQ10 and placebo on heart function as measured by echocardiography .
CoQ10 was given orally in divided doses as a dry tablet chewed with a fat containing food or an oil based gel cap swallowed at mealtime .
Heart function , as indicated by the fraction of blood pumped out of the heart with each beat ( the ejection fraction ) , showed a gradual and sustained improvement in tempo with a gradual and sustained improvement in patients ' symptoms of fatigue , dyspnea , chest pain , and palpitations .
The degree of improvement was occasionally dramatic with some patients developing a normal heart size and function on CoQ10 alone . "

The space shuttles are slated to be retired in September of 2010 .
NASA put out a call recently to ask what should be done with the shuttles post - retirement , and many think they should be put in museums or on display in rocket parks .
But futurist and entrepreneur Eric Knight , ( founder of UP Aerospace and Remarkable Technologies ) has a somewhat novel idea of what to do with the shuttles after they are done with their current duties :
Send them to Mars .
He says his formula is simple and will allow humans to travel to Mars in years , not decades .
Knight ’s proposal , which he calls “ Mars on a Shoestring , ” outlines two shuttles going into Earth orbit , hooking them together with a truss and strapping on a powerful enough propulsion system .
And that ’s pretty much it .
A pressurized inflatable conduit would connect the two orbiters so the astronauts could go back and forth between the two shuttles .
Then comes the really cool part ; a way to provide artificial gravity during the trip to Mars .
From Knight ’s webpage :
• Once the propulsion stage has accelerated this entire system on its trek to Mars , the truss is detached from the two orbiters and the truss - propulsion assembly is jettisoned .
•
The two orbiters then separate to a distance of a few hundred feet , but remain connected — top to top — by a tether cable that is spooled out .
•
During the separation , the accordion - style inflatable crew - transfer conduit equally elongates . •
Once the orbiters are at their maximum fixed distance apart , they would simultaneously fire their reaction control systems to set the pair into an elegant pirouette — creating a comfortable level of artificial gravity for the crew ’s voyage to the red planet .
It gets a little dicey once the shuttles arrive at Mars , however .
How would these huge spacecrafts get to Mars surface ?
Knight ’s only proposal is separating the orbiters and each having a REALLY huge parachute .
Right now , the largest parachute that ’s been successfully tested is 150 ft ( 45 m ) in diameter .
However , in an interview we did with JPL ’s Rob Manning for a previous article on Universe Today ( see “ The Mars Landing Approach : Getting Large Payloads to the Surface of the Red Planet ) , Manning says there ’s currently no way and there ’s not a parachute big enough to allow a big spacecraft , even a high lift vehicle like a shuttle to land successfully on Mars .
The atmosphere is too thin to provide any drag .
From our earlier article :
“ Well , on Mars , when you use a very high lift to weight to drag ratio like the shuttle , ” said Manning , “ in order to get good deceleration and use the lift properly , you ’d need to cut low into the atmosphere .
You ’d still be going at Mach 2 or 3 fairly close to the ground .
If you had a good control system you could spread out your deceleration to lengthen the time you are in the air .
You ’d eventually slow down to under Mach 2 to open a parachute , but you ’d be too close to the ground and even an ultra large supersonic parachute would not save you . ”
Supersonic parachute experts have concluded that to sufficiently slow a large shuttle - type vehicle on Mars and reach the ground at reasonable speeds would require a parachute one hundred meters in diameter .
“ That ’s a good fraction of the Rose Bowl .
That ’s huge , ” said Manning .
“ We believe there ’s no way to make a 100 - meter parachute that can be opened safely supersonically , not to mention the time it takes to inflate something that large .
You ’d be on the ground before it was fully inflated .
It would not be a good outcome . ”
So , while Knight ’s proposal is interesting and perhaps forward - thinking , it would need quite a bit of work to actually be feasible .
He admits as much , saying “ This thought paper is certainly not meant to be the technical be all , end all on the topic — but merely a springboard to new thought .
The science and topics touched on herein are superficial ; the concepts are simply provided to fuel the imagination and promote discussion . ”
Knight said he was inspired by Robert Zubrin ’s Mars Direct concept , and he also wanted to “ repurpose ” the space shuttle fleet .
“ In all , I hope that my thought paper provides a catalyst for additional thinking as we ponder our place in the universe — and the methods to transport us to new frontiers . ”
Who knows ?
Many successful endeavors start out as crazy ideas .
But first , someone has to have the idea .

By tracking the evolution of language and gut bacteria , scientists may have settled a debate over the spread of humans across the Pacific .
The evolutionary trajectory implied by words and bugs begins with an initial migration from Taiwan 5,000 years ago , with a first wave of people spreading to the Philippines and a second to western Polynesia .
The findings , writes University of Cambridge archaeologist Colin Renfrew , " mark a substantial advance in our understanding of human population history " — and they involve some cutting - edge archaeological sleuthing to boot .
Physical remains , rather than linguistic patterns and microbes , are the preferred form of evidence for human migratory maps .
Population genetics has also proved useful , with the progressive differences between modern and ancient DNA samples forming a biological tapestry of human history .
But archaeologists attempting to understand the settlement of far - flung Pacific islands have been stymied by a lack of hard evidence , and genetic studies have proven inconclusive .
As a result , some historians concluded that settlement occurred gradually , over the last 30,000 years , by descendants of an initial population from inland southeast Asia — the so - called " slow boat from Wallacea " theory .
Others hypothesized a recent , Taiwan - based origin .
In the latest analyses , published Thursday in Science , researchers abandoned traditional tools in favor of languages and Heliobacter pylori , a microbe that has co-evolved with humans for at least 50,000 years .
Bacterial samples taken from modern aborigines in Taiwan , Australia , Melanesia , Polynesia and New Guinea reveal a common , 5,000 - year - old Taiwanese ancestor , which varied as human populations took their stomach bugs to the Philippines 3,000 years ago and then , several hundred years after that , to Western Polynesia and New Zealand .
A separate analysis of of 210 core vocabulary words in 400 Pacific - region languages produced an evolutionary tree of culture rather than organisms — and its branches followed with the migratory routes suggested by H. pylori's locale - specific evolution .
" The use of modern genetic data to reconstruct phylogenetic trees shows that the past is still ' within us ' today , " wrote Renfrew in a review of the studies .
" Our past is within us in a different sense when the vocabularies of specific modern languages are the basis for historical analysis .
And the past is within us in a very literal way when the early history of humankind is reconstructed based on the bacterial flora in our guts . "

My boys are 7 and 5 years old .
They love to draw .
Their latest drawing craze has to draw Star Wars scenarios .
They draw stick figures with Darth Vader helmets , recreate a decent picture of R2 - D2 and everyone is holding a light saber ( yep , even R2 - D2 ) .
You see , my boys have not seen any Star Wars , Episode IV – or otherwise .
I was n’t even aware they had so much knowledge until they started drawing .
So , they do n’t appreciate the significance of the light saber and have n’t got their heads around what a Jedi Knight is .
Hence , everyone in their drawings has a light saber .
I know it should n't , but this really annoyed me and I felt like sitting them down to watch Episode IV : A New Hope and explain that R2 - D2 can't be drawn with a light saber and introduce them to the whole experience .
But , on reflection I decided they are only 7 and 5 years - old and I ’m not sure I ’m that keen for them to know yet .
That is why I ’ve made THE RULE .
THE RULE is that my boys wo n’t watch any Star Wars movie until they are 10 years - old .
And , when they do I will be watching it with them .
I ’ve told them this .
I ’ve explained that it is a special movie and that when they see it conditions have to be perfect .
They know about Star Wars thanks to the epic commercialization that the Lucas Empire has embarked upon .
I do n’t begrudge George this , though it has created some damn awful content and stories if you ask me .
It also leads to a discussion about the commercialization of geek culture and how much of it is driven by the dollar , rather than the passion these days .
And of course , my boys learn a lot from their friends at school and preschool who have watched the movie ( or been exposed to said - commercialization of the Lucas Empire ) .
This concerns me .
Given the research and work I do in the area of childhood development I do n’t think young children should be watching movies with the level of violence and adult concepts like the Star Wars trilogy .
Just because it is a geek movie does n’t make it alright for children of all ages .
It is a common mistake people make – geek does not equal appropriate for children .
But , we also do our children a disservice if we simply use seminal movies like Star Wars as just another DVD to distract the kids while we go about the business of daily life .
Yet , it feels to me like this is what is happening .
Now , I may be romanticizing my own pop culture experiences here , but surely movies like the Star Wars Trilogy , Indiana Jones , The Princess Bride and others are core texts in geek development and should be treated differently to your standard Disney or Pixar animation ( though Toy Story might reach a new level in the future ) .
Should n’t we be finding the space in our children ’s lives to introduce these movies with some thought and consideration ?
As responsible GeekDads should n’t we be talking about when we will watch these movies with our children ?
Should n’t we be sharing the questions our children ask and what we will highlight to them ?
John Davison ( of whattheyplay.com ) has been doing this through Twitter recently .
Just as I was thinking about writing this piece , he was been sharing the questions his children asked after watching The Empire Strikes Back like “ If he is his Dad , why does he cut off his hand ? ” – damn good question , I ’d love to know what John ’s answer was .
He did n’t tweet that .
It was probably much more than 140 characters .
It is the same with books of course , though we tend to give them greater reverence .
In my GeekDad enthusiasm I first tried to read The Hobbit to my boys when the eldest was only 4 years old .
Three pages in , it was clear they were not ready ?
I ’ve tried a couple of times since , but have now put my 50th anniversary copy away for a bit longer until the narrative will resonate in a way that makes their experience of Tolkien ’s world will be as magical and life - changing as when I read it .
My aim is to make the experience of watching the Star Wars Trilogy a special event in my children ’s childhood .
I want them to know more than light sabers and special effects .
I want them to be thinking about the blurring of black and white , the complexity of good versus evil and I want them to ask questions like “ If he is his Dad , why did he cut his hand off ? ” – and I want to have an answer that helps them to think about ethics and philosophy at an age appropriate level .
So , do you have a RULE ?
Have you saved a special movie to watch with your children ?
What age is going to be optimum to give my boys the experience I would like them to have ?
UPDATE : One commenter mentioned Common Sense Media - it is a great site for parents to compare notes on movies , and given the discussion about violence in the movie .
People might be interested that Episodes 4 - 6 in are recommended for children 8 years and up on that site .

If you 're contemplating divorce , you might want to make a little time – keeping in mind it will cost you $ 125 an hour – to sit down first with Deborah Moskovitch .
She 's not only been through a " really difficult " divorce herself , she wrote the book on it .
The Smart Divorce is a guide , of sorts , to getting out without going bankrupt .
During the course of a few hours in the uptown Toronto boardroom where she regularly meets with clients , Moskovitch will sketch out a rough portrait of your life post separation .
First she 'll ask the $ 64 million question ( and that 's not such a reach given the crippling cost of a long and ugly courtroom battle ) : " Are you sure your relationship is over ? "
" I can't tell you the number of times I 've heard people say in social situations , `Had I realized how difficult it is being divorced , I would have worked harder at my marriage . '
I want to be sure when clients make this decision , they do n't look back with regrets . "
Moskovitch calls herself a " divorce educator " and offers seminars as well as one - on - one sessions ( see thesmartdivorce.com . )
She is n't a lawyer or a marriage counsellor , but a divorce that took seven years to finalize , and ongoing research for two more books , have made her a kind of canary in the marriage mine shaft .
She 's seen the carnage and the collateral damage of divorce firsthand and finds , quite often , divorced people , with the exception of those escaping violent relationships , do n't end up in quite the sunny situation they pictured after the divorce papers are signed .
" You have to feel really comfortable being alone , " she warns as a starter .
" People think it 's easy just to bounce into another relationship and they 're single for a lot longer than they thought they might be .
So there 's the loneliness .
Being a single parent is challenging .
And it 's very much a Noah 's Ark society as I like to call it – the world is very couples oriented .
Often you 'll be on your own on the weekends because you 're no longer part of the social circle you were in when you were married . "
If your partner was a top executive , or came from a big , boisterous family , you 'll especially feel the drop in what Moskovitch calls " social status . "
She presses home a point that may be lost on couples in the heat of battle :
That you need to arm yourself for divorce psychologically first .
You have to work hard to " remove emotion from the legal process so that you deal with it separately .
You want to make your decision based on facts , not on revenge , shame , anger , blame . "
She has a list of trained professionals , from marriage counsellors to psychiatrists ( covered by OHIP ) , who can help you do that .
And most of all , you need to do the math .
If you can't , she 'll help you find a financial adviser who 's good with a calculator and some hard reality checks .
One divorced woman , now almost 18 years into her second marriage to a divorced man , says she can pick out at a party who 's still married to their first wife or husband by the number of trips they take , the size of their home , if they have a cottage : " Divorce follows you the rest of your life , financially , " she says .
And be forewarned :
You 're unlikely to be remarried within five years ( contrary to popular belief ) and if you do find another partner , he or she will probably be a lot like the one you left .
Okay , the sex may be better – at least for a while .
But you 'll stand an even higher chance of ending up in divorce court again , according to the research she 's studied for her books :
While 38 to 50 per cent of first marriages end up in divorce , that number is closer to 60 per cent the second time around .
" When I tell people this they listen because I 've been through it myself .
I 've experienced a gamut of emotions and experiences .
Personally , I have never looked back with regret , and I think a big part of that is because I did the ( mental preparation ) work up front . "
Marriage counselling should be a prerequisite to divorce , she believes , but acknowledges it can be almost impossible to pull couples back from the brink if one partner has had an affair or walked out : " The person who was left feels ashamed .
They want to blame someone .
That can wreak havoc on lives and often their parenting skills are diminished because they 're sad and angry .
So they try to gain justice through the legal system and that 's not going to happen .
" I really try to drill home that you might have been a victim , and if you continue to play that game , you 're only hurting yourself .
You have to move on .
Therapy is n't for everyone , but you can't ignore your feelings because somewhere along the way , they will catch up with you . "
Researchers in York University 's department of psychology are in the midst of groundbreaking " emotion - focused couple 's therapy " with couples on the brink of divorce , many of whom have failed at traditional marriage therapy , that shows it may not just be enough to forget past " injuries . "
You have to forgive .
Professor Leslie Greenberg and clinical psychology doctoral student Catalina Woldarsky Meneses have been working with couples since 2000 to help them identify incidents or " wrongs " that may have started pushing the relationship off the rails at least two years prior and have festered – in some cases without even their direct knowledge – into a seething resentment that has badly damaged the marriage .
" Basically , we 're finding that emotion really drives both thoughts and behaviour , so we 've really got to get to the underlying emotions and have them expressed to the partner in non-blaming ways .
We 're not dealing with people who are in the crisis of just discovering an infidelity .
We 're dealing with festering resentments that have n't been resolved , " says Greenberg .
That can range from ( and these are true stories ) a husband who forgets to pick up his wife from surgery , to the husband ( sorry , guys ) who hangs up on his wife , saying he 's too busy , before she can let him know she 's in labour .
Even more damaging than age - old affairs is a new marriage threat , the researchers say : Internet " cheating " and porn .
" In some ways , it 's more complicated ( than a traditional affair ) because there 's often repetition ( and multiple online partners ) .
We 've seen a number of couples where the partner says , ` You promised not to do it and then I found you doing it again , ' " says Greenberg .
" The first time may not be as big a betrayal as an actual affair , but when they are caught again , it becomes a kind of repeated set of injuries . "

A lot of marriage counselling traditionally takes the view , ` Put this behind you and get on with your life , ' " he adds .
" We 're finding that you have to forgive first .
That that has a positive affect in terms of relationship rebuilding . "
Greenberg and Woldarsky Meneses are looking for at least a dozen more couples who think they could benefit from 10 free therapy sessions ( usually worth about $ 200 an hour ) as part of their research .

Toyota plans to introduce its plug - in hybrid electric vehicle late this year , a year earlier than originally planned , and a year ahead of the Chevrolet Volt , a senior Toyota executive said on Sunday .
James Lentz , the president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. , said in an interview that Toyota planned to initially make about 500 plug - in hybrids , which will be made available first to commercial customers .
About 150 plug-ins will be slated for customers in the United States , Mr. Lentz said .
His comments came at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit , which opened to the press on Sunday .
At last year ’s show , Toyota ’ s president , Katsuaki Watanabe , said Toyota planned to introduce a plug - in hybrid vehicle in 2010 .
The plug - in , which can be re-charged by plugging it into a wall outlet , will join a lineup of other hybrid- electric vehicles sold by Toyota , including the Prius .
Toyota will show a new version of the Prius here on Monday .
G.M. says it plans to introduce its plug - in Volt by late 2010 .
The Volt , which will be made at a plant in Detroit , and powered by a lithium - ion battery , is the centerpiece of G.M. ’s efforts to market environmentally friendly cars .
The Toyota plug - in hybrid will be built in Japan , where Toyota also builds the Prius .
The first plug-ins will be essentially built by hand , said Masami Doi , Toyota ’s general manager of its global strategic planning department .
The plug-ins also will be powered by lithium - ion batteries , Mr. Lentz said , unlike the Prius , which will continue to be powered by a nickel - metal hydride battery .
The lithium - ion batteries will be produced in Japan by Panasonic , which also makes batteries for the Prius , Mr. Doi said .
G.M. unveiled the Volt as a concept car at the Detroit show in 2007 , beating Toyota with word that it was developing a plug - in hybrid .
Mr. Lentz did not say why Toyota had sped up its program , which has been a major project within the carmaker .
But if Toyota stays on its new schedule , it will win at least a psychological advantage over G.M. , said Andrew Shapiro , an industry analyst with the Casesa Shapiro Group .
“ G.M. announced it first , and Toyota gets it to the market first , ” Mr. Shapiro said .
Mr. Lentz sought to play down any impression that Toyota was in a race with G.M.
The initial Toyota plug-ins will not be available to individual consumers , unlike the Volt , which G.M. says will go on sale to the public at the end of 2010 .
“ I do n’t consider that they will be on the market yet , ” Mr. Lentz said .
Mr. Lentz said the first Toyota plug-ins will be provided to commercial customers like utility companies , corporations and others where their use can be carefully monitored .
“ We ’ll learn how they ’re used , and where people want to re-charge them , ” like office versus home charging stations , he said .
Toyota also can study “ the trade - offs between performance and range ” meaning the miles the car can travel before its battery needs to be recharged , he said .
Mr. Shapiro said the strategy of providing plug-ins to fleet users first would give Toyota information that its engineers can use to improve the vehicle before the Volt arrives .
“ They ’ll have a year ’s worth of real world feedback .
That will be invaluable , because they can make changes quickly , ” Mr. Shapiro said .
When George Bush ’s people put on a $ 42 - million inaugural program four years ago , many editorial writers and columnists around America came unglued .
A St. Petersburg ( Fla . )
Times commentator said the president needed to prove that his call for sacrifice “ is more than just empty words . ”
A Washington Post columnist suggested Bush & Co. should be ashamed of staging lavish parties in the face of their debacle in Iraq .
A columnist at the New York Observer evoked images of Louis XIV .
It would have been nice , for the sake of consistency and fairness , if the commentariat had leveled a measure of that same attitude at last week ’s Obamapalooza , which cost roughly the same but drew a fraction of the blow - back .
Critics on the right have explained the discrepancy with their default argument about liberal media bias .
But I think President Obama got a ( mostly ) free pass on his lavish coming - out party because of other bad media habits : like the tendency to follow the pack , to embrace critiques if they are buttressed by a politician ’s allies and , especially , to get swept up in the mood of the moment .
Advertisement
Reporters -- yes , even columnists -- are human .
They get carried away with the big story and have trouble changing direction -- which last week centered on all the people who came a long way to be a part of history .
“ The press is reflecting a euphoria about the Obama presidency that is real and a honeymoon that any new president gets , ” said Tom Rosenstiel , director of the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism .
“ But it ’s important for media not to get caught up in that euphoria . ”
First , the facts as laid out by the nonpartisan FactCheck .org : Obama ’s private fundraising for inaugural parties and events will probably come to $ 45 million .
Adjusted for inflation , that would amount to slightly less than the $ 42.3 million that Bush raised for his second inaugural .
That ’s not counting the well over $ 100 million that taxpayers had to shell out this year and in 2005 for a phalanx of local , state and federal police and security agencies .

Contrary to some assertions , many news organizations -- including the Los Angeles Times -- quoted critics about the unseemliness of partying so hearty at a time like this , when Circuit City clerks , Microsoft techies and lots of others are swelling the unemployment lines .
Three days before Obama was sworn in , the Associated Press captured the incongruity with a story that began : “ Unemployment is up .
The stock market is down .
Let ’s party . ”
That piece played the hypocrisy card on a couple of Democratic congressmen ( Anthony Weiner of New York and Jim McDermott of Washington ) who argued four years ago that , with the nation at war , Bush should rein in his celebration .
America ’s still fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and now faces a painful recession .
But the congressmen did n’t express the same concern , the AP reported , when it was their own party getting ready to party .
Advertisement
So , Obama ’s pricey debut has not gone unnoted .
But the critics attacked Bush more fiercely and in greater numbers four years ago .
As one measure , an online search for the words “ Bush , inauguration , extravagant ” for the three months around the 2005 inaugural turned up 140 news stories , compared with 99 for a similar search on Obama .
Why the difference ?
Reporters and columnists tend to feel they have a particularly free hand to launch criticisms when a politician ’s allies agree there is a problem .
In 2005 , Bush supporter and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban helped open the floodgates when he told the press that the inaugural balls should be canceled and the money donated to tsunami victims in South Asia .
Advertisement
The Washington Post found a “ white - collar Republican ” lodging a similar complaint .
And Newsday on Long Island added oomph to the argument when it reported how the parents of soldiers serving in Iraq said the celebration money would be better spent on body armor for their sons .
No equivalent critics emerged this time around .
But that does n’t mean the press should n’t have raised the obvious question .
With Obama speaking eloquently about the need for sacrifice in a time of need , it seems only natural people might want to know how that squares with a $ 150 - million party .
Yes , this was an inauguration for the history books .
Yes , the country needed its spirits lifted .
Nothing would have , or should have , driven Obama ’s achievement off front pages .
But we have learned , painfully , what happens when journalists get caught up in the mood of the moment -- to the exclusion of other ideas .
Advertisement
They stop asking questions .
They channel the popular narrative .
They even watch young men and women being shipped overseas without demanding sufficient justification .
The press ’ failure to buck popular sentiment worked in Bush ’s ( short - term ) favor , as the president pushed toward war in Iraq .
That failure said much more about the press ’ psychology -- caught up in the fear of terrorism and desire to unite behind the commander in chief -- than it did about its ideology , which generally tends toward the liberal and antiwar .
Six years later , the public overwhelmingly supports the new president .
Surveys show that even a majority of Republicans have a positive view of Obama .
Advertisement
That gives Obama tremendous power -- and the press a tremendous responsibility , to avoid being carried away .
It might not be a matter of life and death , but I ’d still like to know :
What else could we have gotten with that $ 150 million ?

Pity the Poor Neocons
As bloody and grotesque as Israel ’s pounding of Gaza has been , it marks a bitterly disappointing end for seven - plus years of neoconservative dominion over U.S. foreign policy , a period that was supposed to conclude with the dismantling of Israel ’s Muslim enemies in the region .

Printer friendly Contrary to those neocon plans , George W. Bush is limping toward a historical judgment as possibly “ the worst President ever ” ; U.S. power is waning in Iraq under a “ status - of - forces agreement ” that is showing the Americans the door by 2011 if not earlier ; and key neocon targets – Iran , Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon – have gained in regional influence .
All the neocons have left now is to cheer the Israeli air force as it , in effect , shoots fish in a barrel , i.e. blasting away at selected Palestinian targets inside the crowded confines of Gaza , killing more than 400 people , including many children and other civilians , over the past week .
In 2001 , especially after 9/11 , the neocon dreams were so much more ambitious .
The neocons planned to achieve “ regime change ” in all Middle Eastern countries that were perceived as threats to Israel and replace them with compliant , pro-Western leaders .
First on the list was Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq , which was a center for Arab nationalism and an advocate for resisting Israeli occupation of Palestinian land .
Since Iraq was too strong – and too far from the effective reach of the Israeli military – U.S. forces would be needed to conquer Iraq .
After that , Iraq was supposed to become the staging area for projecting American power across the region , with the governments of Iran and Syria the next targets .
A favorite neocon joke in 2003 was whether after capturing Baghdad , U.S. forces should go east or west , to either Damascus or Tehran , with the punch line : “ Real men go to Tehran . ”
Of course , unlike American soldiers , the neocons were n’t really going anywhere , except to the next AEI conference or a Georgetown cocktail party .
By replacing the governments of Iran and Syria , the neocons would knock out the support structure for Israel ’s two most immediate threats , Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories .
Then , with Israel – aided by some Arab allies – finishing off those two weakened militant groups , Israel could dictate terms of a final settlement to the Palestinians .
The Palestinians would have little choice but to accept an agreement even if it deprived them of the most desirable land .
Peace would be imposed on the region by a neocon Pax Americana .
Pretty Rhetoric
Throughout this ambitious process , the neocons wrapped their plans in pretty or high - blown rhetoric .
There was talk about spreading “ democracy ” to the region ( even though the neocons have never had much use for real democracy , having secured their place of power under George W. Bush after he and five Supreme Court allies overrode the will of American voters in 2000 .
The neocons also never objected to the plans of Bush ’s political operatives to create a “ permanent Republican majority ” in America – a virtual one - party state – so long as the neocons kept their seat at the table . )
Besides “ democracy promotion ” in the Middle East , the neocons talked about advancing “ human rights , ” even as their policies rained death and destruction upon countless thousands of defenseless Arabs .
There was also the claim that the United States was acting in post - 9/11 self - defense because Saddam Hussein was in league with al - Qaeda ’s Osama bin Laden ( even though the pair actually were bitter rivals in the Arab world ) .
So there were plenty of pleasant rationales to justify the brutal strategies , so many that thoughtful analysts to this day express uncertainty over what the Bush administration ’s real motivation was for invading Iraq .
It has always been a key part of neocon PR strategy to follow Winston Churchill ’s famous advice that " in wartime , truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies . "
And for the neocons , it is always wartime , if not actual war then it ’s the “ war of ideas ” or the “ war on terror . ”
Having covered the neocons since their emergence in the early 1980s as junior partners in the Reagan Revolution , I have always been amazed at their facility for clever arguments and their willingness to demonize or marginalize anyone who disagrees with them .
In essence , they are intellectual bullies who care only about achieving their political ends .
Though Ronald Reagan “ credentialed ” many of the key neocons – the likes of Elliott Abrams , Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Perle and Robert Kagan – he mostly kept them focused on Central America and other strategic backwaters .
This was not good news for Central Americans – who died by the tens of thousands as the neocons concealed or downplayed the human rights crimes committed by U.S. - supported military forces in Guatemala , El Salvador and Nicaragua – but at least Reagan knew enough not to give the neocons broad control over U.S. policy in the oil - rich Middle East .
Reagan ’s key diplomats in the Middle East were more pragmatic operatives , such as James Baker and Philip Habib .
In the 1980s , the Reagan administration mostly played Realpolitik games there , like helping both sides in the Iran - Iraq
War to ensure that neither one got too much of an upper hand .
There also was ambivalence toward the Arab - Israeli conflict .
That changed when George W. Bush became President as a born - again Christian devoted to Israel .
Especially after 9/11 , Bush handed control of Middle East policy to the neocons , with officials such as Elliott Abrams holding key posts on the National Security Council , Wolfowitz at the Pentagon , and Lewis Libby serving under the powerful Vice President , Dick Cheney .
Media Megaphone
By then , the neocons also had gained extraordinary sway over the Washington press corps .
In the 1980s , the neocons expanded their megaphone from relatively small - circulation magazines , like Commentary and Dissent , to more general - interest publications , such as the Wall Street Journal ’s editorial pages , The New Republic and later Newsweek ( where I worked in the late 1980s ) .
The neocon editorialists – people like Charles Krauthammer and Fred Barnes – also excelled at amplifying their political message through their seats on TV news chat shows , such as “ Inside Washington , ” “ Crossfire ” and “ The McLaughlin Group . ”
By the 1990s , with the emergence of right - wing talk radio and Fox News , the neocons consolidated their power in the national news media .
Most notably , the Washington Post ’s editorial section fell firmly under neocon domination .
As much as the Right still uttered its ritualistic complaints about the “ liberal press , ” the reality was quite different .
As became acutely clear in 2002 and early 2003 , the neocons in the news media worked hand in glove with the Bush administration to rally public support behind the Iraq War by citing such canards as the risk of Saddam Hussein giving his WMD to al - Qaeda .
It turned out , however , that manipulating reality inside the Washington Beltway was a lot easier than controlling it inside Iraq .
Rather than happily accepting U.S. occupation , many Iraqis joined an armed resistance , tying down American troops in a bloody quagmire .
Also , failing to find the promised caches of Iraq ’s WMD and facing new skepticism about Hussein ’s ties to al - Qaeda , Bush elevated “ democracy ” to be the prime post facto justification for the invasion .
But that led to Iraqi elections in early 2005 and they installed a Shiite government with close ties to Iran .
Similarly , U.S. - demanded elections in the Palestine territories led to victory by Hamas and its eventual takeover of Gaza .
Other elections in Lebanon strengthened the position of Hezbollah .
So , very few of the Middle East plans were working out as the neocons had airily envisioned them .
Tied down by worsening violence in Iraq , the Bush administration issued belligerent warnings to Syria and Iran but lacked the military manpower to back up the threats .
Another Front Stymied on plans to roll up Israel ’s enemies via U.S. - imposed “ regime change ” in Iran and Syria – and thus undermine Hamas and Hezbollah – the neocons pinned their hopes on Israel ’s ability to punish those two groups with military offensives in 2006 and then possibly move on to invading Syria .
After consultations between President Bush and Israel ’s Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Israel engaged in a series of low - key tit - for - tat exchanges with Hamas and Hezbollah , which responded by capturing several Israeli soldiers ( the U.S. press corps preferred the word “ kidnap ” ) .
That was followed by a massive Israeli retaliation that killed more than a thousand people , including many civilians , in Lebanon .
Inside the United States , there was a reprise of the war - drum - beating that had preceded the Iraq War .
Well - placed neocons in Washington and elsewhere tried to whip the American people into a new war frenzy .
Again , U.S. politicians and much of the U.S. news media fell into line .
On July 17 , 2006 , New York Sen. Hillary Clinton shared the stage in a pro-Israel rally with Dan Gillerman , then Israel ’s ambassador to the United Nations who had espoused anti-Arab bigotry in the past and proudly defended Israel ’s violence inside Lebanon .
Responding to international concerns that Israel was using “ disproportionate ” force by bombing Lebanon and killing hundreds of civilians , Gillerman said , “ You ’re damn right we are . ” [ NYT , July 18 , 2006 ]
In other statements , Gillerman had been even more disdainful about Muslims .
At the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington on March 6 , 2006 , Gillerman virtually equated Muslims with terrorists .
“ While it may be true – and probably is – that not all Muslims are terrorists , it also happens to be true that nearly all terrorists are Muslim , ” Gillerman quipped to the delight of the AIPAC crowd .
[ Washington Post , March 7 , 2006 ]
Despite Gillerman ’s professed uncertainty about whether “ all Muslims are terrorists , ” this anti-Muslim bigotry did n’t generate any noticeable protest from American politicians and pundits .
It would have been hard to imagine any other ethnic or religious group being subjected to a similar smear without provoking a noisy controversy .
Four months later , Sen. Clinton and other Democrats joined Gillerman at the New York rally to endorse Israel ’s devastating military attacks on Lebanon .
Clinton , who was then considered the Democratic presidential frontrunner , denounced Hezbollah and Hamas as “ the new totalitarians of the 21st Century ” who believe in neither human rights nor democracy , even though both groups had done well in elections .
Clinton was joined by two Democratic congressmen who also endorsed Israel ’s bombing raids on Lebanon .
“ Since when should a response to aggression and murder be proportionate ? ” asked Rep. Jerrold Nadler .
“ President Bush has been wrong about a lot of things , ” said Rep. Anthony D. Weiner .
“ He ’s right about this . ”
[ For more details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ A New War Frenzy . ” ]
Turning Points
However , as it turned out , the Israeli offensive against Lebanon – though very bloody – was generally ineffective .
It may even have been counterproductive by enhancing Hezbollah ’s status within Lebanon and around the Muslim world for having fought the potent Israeli military to a standstill .
As 2006 wore on , things went from bad to worse for the neocons .
Their dreams of a “ permanent Republican majority ” – with them in charge of U.S. foreign policy – collapsed on Nov. 7 , 2006 , when American voters turned both houses of Congress over to the Democrats .
Two years later , the Republicans ( and the neocons ) fared even worse , also losing the White House to Barack Obama , despite a GOP and neocon smear campaign that featured Obama ’s middle name “ Hussein ” and called him a secret Muslim .
Also disheartening was Bush ’s capitulation in accepting a timetable for U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq .
The President was forced to accept a “ status - of - forces agreement ” with a timetable for American withdrawal – first from the cities by the end of June and from the country as a whole by the end of 2011 – and possibly earlier if the SOFA is rejected by an Iraqi referendum .
In Washington , the neocons now are scrambling to find themselves new places of influence .
Some neocon - lites are hoping to decamp inside Hillary Clinton ’s State Department .
However , rumors also are rife in Washington that some think tanks are lightening their ranks of neocons in order to retain some influence with the new administration .
Ironically , one of the few remaining neocon strongholds is the Washington news media , where support for Israel ’s punishing bombing campaign against Hamas in Gaza -- in retaliation for missiles fired into southern Israel -- is nearly unanimous .
For instance , the Washington Post ’s op - ed page has shed even the pretense of offering a balanced picture .
On New Year ’s Day , the Post ran two long op - ed pieces – one by Ephraim Sneh , chairman of the Strong Israel party , and another by Robert J. Lieber , author of The American Era : Power and Strategy for the 21st Century .
Both articles defended Israel ’s bombing attacks in retaliation for Hamas rocket fire .
The next day , Jan. 2 , the Post offered two more columns , one by neocon stalwart Charles Krauthammer and the other by former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson .
Both op - eds enthusiastically endorsed Israel ’s bombing campaign as morally righteous .
“ Some geopolitical conflicts are morally complicated , ” Krauthammer wrote .
“ The Israel - Gaza war is not .
It possesses a moral clarity not only rare but excruciating . ”
Gerson added , “ There is no question – none – that Israel ’s attack on Hamas in Gaza is justified . ”
Gray Areas
Though typical of the absolutist neocon view that Israel is always right , the articles still are striking in their unwillingness to see any gray areas relating to the moral ambiguities that have surrounded the Israeli - Palestinian conflict for more than six decades .
Not only has Israel committed its share of outrages against Palestinians ( and vice versa ) but the neocons of the Washington news media still refuse to acknowledge the fundamental humanity of people from the Muslim world .
In the neocon view , the lives of Arabs and other Muslims are cheap and their aspirations are of even less consequence .
The American neocons echo the stunning opinion of Israel Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , who stated on Jan. 1 that – despite the widespread carnage in Gaza – “ there is no humanitarian crisis in the strip , and therefore there is no need for a humanitarian truce . ”
But that is not the view of everyone .
In contrast to the Washington Post editorial section ’s inability to see any moral ambiguity in the Israeli bombing campaign , Richard Falk , the United Nations rapporteur for the Palestinian territories , has deemed the Israeli attacks war crimes .
“ The Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip represent severe and massive violations of international humanitarian law as defined in the Geneva Conventions , both in regard to the obligations of an Occupying Power and in the requirements of the laws of war , ” Falk wrote on Dec. 30 .
2008 .
Among those violations , Falk cited : “ Disproportionate military response .
The airstrikes have not only destroyed every police and security office of Gaza 's elected government , but have killed and injured hundreds of civilians ; at least one strike reportedly hit groups of students attempting to find transportation home from the university .
“ Earlier Israeli actions , specifically the complete sealing off of entry and exit to and from the Gaza Strip , have led to severe shortages of medicine and fuel ( as well as food ) , resulting in the inability of ambulances to respond to the injured , the inability of hospitals to adequately provide medicine or necessary equipment for the injured , and the inability of Gaza 's besieged doctors and other medical workers to sufficiently treat the victims . ”
But the American neocons care little what happens to the Palestinians of Gaza .
It matters not that they have been denied basic human rights for the past six decades , nor that some 1.5 million impoverished Palestinians are packed into the Gaza Strip with little hope for meaningful work or the ability to escape from what amounts to a giant prison .
Similarly , the neocons feel little or no remorse for the butchery in Iraq where hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died and many more have been horribly maimed as a result of the U.S. invasion that the neocons demanded and rationalized .
Indeed , it is difficult not to judge the neocons to be racist in their nonchalance toward the killing of Muslims , though the neocons would bristle at the assessment .
In many civilized societies , the intellectual and political authors of a crime against humanity as egregious as the Iraq War would be dragged from their offices in handcuffs and put on trial .
In modern Washington , however , they do n’t even lose their privileged spot on the Washington Post ’s op - ed page .
But perhaps we all should feel some pity for the neocons .
Their grand dreams of Middle East conquest – with them as modern - day Alexanders – have been reduced to them cheering as Israeli bombs smash apart the crowded neighborhoods of Gaza .

Scientists continue to respond to the latest attacks from creationists , and at the same time propose profound new ideas about evolution .
This year has seen perceptions of the virus change from disease - causing villain to evolutionary hero , and the emergence of a new force of evolution - the absence of natural selection .
( Note : This post appears to be exceedingly popular and I want to thank all the generous new donors to my PayPal button .
Also , this post has garnered a large amount of attention ( assuming site meter stats are accurate ) and I am astonished at the number of third - and fourth - rate tax burdens who have written privately , proclaiming their faith in propositions like the Big Bazooms theory of human evolution .
No wonder our economy is in the tank , and a thorough housecleaning is needed .
I had no idea how bad it all was - but then I have usually had the privilege of working with productive , intelligent , and interesting people .
Wow .
I have always had the highest respect for my friends and colleagues , but I had no idea how lucky I have been , compared with the current Deleted Items box , mostly from Darwin's Faithful . )
In " Darwin's " dangerous " idea :
Top ten evolution articles , the inimitable New Scientist advises us , In other words , this year has seen the emergence of even more aggressive attempts to just plain make stuff up .
Put another way , everyone except the Darwinists has long since observed " the absence of natural selection . "
It 's the presence of natural selection - as a source of new species - that we look for in vain .
A couple of years ago , after I had been following the controversy for several years , I found myself listening to a long lecture by a Darwinist , replete with bafflegab and pretty lame examples .
Finally , sensing ( correctly ) that I was unconvinced , he proclaimed to me , " You just do n't understand how natural selection works , do you ?
" And suddenly , the penny dropped .
What he meant was that I just do n't believe in magic .
I can't make myself believe in magic ; I have n't been able to since I was a child .
And I was no longer going to give the matter any attention .
What I really wanted to know then and now is - how magic became so important a principle in science ?
And I think I know of at least one reason .
Looking over New Scientist 's top ten evolution articles , I am struck by how paltry it all looks , how inadequate to the matter to be explained .
I can't believe that they are still fronting the peppered moth , for example , but they are , and under the windy title , " reclaiming the peppered moth for science . " ( =
In order to qualify as " science , " the moth must be reinstated as the notorious " peppered myth . " )
Who ever doubted that dark coloured moths might have a selective advantage over their light coloured kin in a polluted environment ?
The key problem , of course , was that , as Judith Hooper showed in Of Moths and Men , experimenter Kettlewell interfered with the moths ' normal behaviour during his research .
So , while the legend blossomed in textbooks and popular science presentations , the very minor event of a change in population frequencies between the two variants that Kettlewell was attempting to demonstrate may never actually have occurred .
And if it did occur , it was soon reversed by widespread industrial cleanup .
In other words , to the extent that natural selection does occur , it is apparently easily reversed .
The fact that so many people have put so much energy into defending the peppered myth merely shows how important the popular science myth of " evolution " is to their world view .
Following the story , I learned far more about them than about moths .
So now , as to why the magic of Darwinism is so important to some people : People who do n't follow traditional religions make a religion out of whatever they follow .
In this case , apparently , historical biology .
But that comes at a cost .
A burden is placed on historical biology that it cannot really bear .
To see what I mean , consider the difference between being a Darwin popularizer and being a traditional Catholic .
As a traditional Catholic , I am asked to believe in the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ .
But I am not asked to believe in virgin birth as a general proposition , and especially not for human males whose mothers ' pregnancies could be readily - though not respectably - accounted for otherwise .
In that one instance , I am told , I cannot argue that " God would n't have done it that way , " as I have no basis for arguing with God about what he would or would n't have done as an intentionally unique , divinely ordained event .
By contrast , in all conventional matters , I am entitled to use my best judgement as to what would or would n't - or did or did n't - happen .
Not so the Darwinist who is compelled to defend the increasingly shabby icons of popular materialist science culture as if they were Very Important .
Sadly , to him , they are .

BBC Asian Network
The device allows officers to take fingerprints away from a police station A disproportionate number of Asian and black people are being stopped by police and fingerprinted using a new mobile scanner , the BBC has learned .
Of the 29,000 people stopped , 14 % were Asian and 16.5 % black despite those ethnic groups representing just 4 % and 2 % of the population respectively .
The figures were revealed in a Freedom of Information request made by the BBC .
Police said no single group was being targeted but human rights group Liberty said community relations could worsen .
' Concern '
The figures , between 1 November 2006 and 31 October 2008 , showed 53 % of those stopped were white , while 12 % did not record their ethnicity and 4.5 % were described as " other " .
Twenty police forces across Britain are trying out the new mobile fingerprint scanner , called the Lantern , with the aim of making on - the - spot identity checks easier and faster .
Liberty said it was concerned the new scanner was another measure alienating ethnic minority communities .
Police forces trialling the Lantern British Transport Police , Essex Hertfordshire , North Wales , Bedfordshire Lancashire , Northamptonshire , Kent City of London , West Midlands , Metropolitan Police Derbyshire , West Yorkshire , Durham Avon & Somerset , Greater Manchester Leicester , Merseyside , Surrey , Thames Valley
The group has already been very outspoken about how trust between officers and young Asian males in particular can be damaged by stop - and - search powers used as part of the Terrorism Act .
Policy director Isabella Sankey said : " There 's always the concern that innocent people feel like they 've been unfairly stopped and searched .
" It 's when those stats demonstrate that there 's a certain part of the population that it happens to more , that you really have to worry . "
But the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) said no single group was targeted with these finger printers or any other stop - and - search powers .
" No one community is singled - out or targeted , criminals come from all backgrounds , " said Acpo's Craig Mackey .
" We have conducted a major review of the use of these powers .
We have updated our standard operating procedures , and briefing and training processes for officers to ensure stops are conducted without discrimination . "
But Information Technology student Waleed Mirza , 19 , from Barking in east London , disagreed .
Student Waleed Mirza questioned why he was " always being stopped " Mr Mirza said : " I do n't see white people being stopped , I 'm not trying to be racist but why is it always me being stopped ?
" Just yesterday I was stopped and I 'd done nothing wrong .
I 'm not happy about these finger printers .
" They say it 's optional but if you do n't want to do it you have to go down to the station , so they are forcing you .
It 's your privacy if you do n't want to do it . "
Baljit Jutla , a student from Upton Park , was more supportive .
He said : " It 's good actually , yeah they should n't target the Asian community - they should n't be targeting anyone .
" But if they have done something wrong I prefer that they are caught , it 's better than Asians being labelled as the ones that mess things up " .
The mobile scanning device means police can take fingerprints away from a police station if they suspect the person is committing or attempting to commit an offence .
It can also be used if the name of the person is unknown , or an officer has reasonable grounds for doubting whether a name given is fake .
There are plans for an updated version of the device to be rolled out to all UK police forces from 2010 under a scheme managed by the National Policing Improvement Agency .

China ’s Qaidam Basin could become the equivalent of the Mojave Desert in terms of solar power projects , if new plans to build a 1 - gigawatt solar power photovoltaic farm in China come to fruition .
While utilities and startups have sited the Southern California desert for some of the world ’s largest solar - thermal and solar photovoltaic projects , the China Technology Development Group Corp. ( s CTDC ) and Qinghai New Energy Co. signed an agreement with local Chinese officials over the weekend to begin work on a massive plant that would use crystalline silicon and thin - film solar cells , research firm JLM Pacific Epoch reports ( hat tip VentureBeat ) .
To be clear , 1 gigawatt of power — 1,000 megawatts — from photovoltaics is huge .
The next - largest PV project we ’ve heard of is a 550 - megawatt plant being built by OptiSolar in San Luis Obispo , Calif . , as part of a larger PG&E ( s PCG ) plan to bring 800 megawatts of solar power onto the electric grid .
A Godzilla - like PV project by Intersolar in Germany , now more than half complete , is set to generate 40 megawatts .
While it ’s possible that the Qaidam project will falter before breaking any records , even the first phase — about $ 146 million for a 30 - megawatt plant — could put China on the photovoltaics map .
According to JLM , construction is slated to begin as early as 2009 .
The first step of the development of PCC made possible by donations via BSD Fund is complete and I would like to invite people to start testing PCC more heavily .
Some of the changes have been quite substantial and I may have introduced some new bugs .
I think the support for GCC - specific extensions should be quite good now , even though most attributes are simply parsed and ignored .
The only useful target to currently test is i386 .
Others are coming but not yet complete .
To test PCC under OpenBSD you probably need some patches to the system headers to run it .
To apply them , fetch ftp://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/pub/patches/openbsd-include-sys-081220.diff and go to /usr / include / sys and apply them .
To compile PCC , it is best to fetch it out of cvs via pserver : " cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pcc.ludd.ltu.se :/cvsroot co pcc " and then just run ./ configure , make and make install
There are also daily tarballs generated if you do n't want to use cvs by some reason .
Please register bug reports in the pcc bug database .
The best bug reports is of the form " this particular code snippet does n't compile " or " this expression generates wrong assembler " .
Good luck with it and thank you for your support !

客先に行った商社の人間がメンテ代をケチって自分で触ってトラブった。まあ、計測器のUSBケーブルを外して挿し直した時に、きちんと挿さなかった為認識しなかっただけっぽいのだが。
普通はそこ で 「ちゃんと挿したか確認してね」で終わるのだが、それが困ったチャンで「USB接続がが正しいかどうかが解るマニュアルが無い」と騒ぎ出した。
それも客先で 。
って事で、 「 機器 のUSBケーブルはきちんと挿しましょう」マニュアルなどと言うオモシロ文書を作る羽目に。
最初は単に機器側の口とPC側の口とケーブルの形状で「こうこう指せばこうなる」って的な物だった。
が、 「どうなっているのかの確認方法を全部挙げろ」とか「どういう順番で挿すのか？」とか「ドコに刺さるのか？」とか「間違った所に挿したら？」とか、果ては「ここのPCではそう言う順番でポートがなってない」とか「別のに入れたらポート番号が前と違う」とか、まあ、どうでも良い事テンコ盛りに言って来た。
結果として、カラー写真満載の総ページ45ページにわたる大作が出来る羽目に成った。
内容的には普通の説明書を想像するよりは鉛筆の取り扱い説明書を想像してもらった方が近いものに。
そしてその商社の人間と客先のお偉いさんがやっとこいさっとこ納得してくれたのを現場責任者に見せた時に一言、
「 内容が多すぎて逆に判りません。結局はどうすれば良いのでしょうか？」
って言葉で商社の人間とお偉いさんが更に色めきたった。
「 マニュアルに書いてあるとうり、ちゃんと接続されているか確認して下さい。なんならデバイスマネージャーでも見れば解りますよ」
って言うと 、
「 あ、それだけですか 」
とな。
ま、「USBケーブルなんて言われても普通は解らん」と言い張る人間が一人居るだけでどのくらい非効率になるかって教訓か。
しっかし 、「 USBコネクタ（Aタイプ）が挿さっているのは本当にUSBコネクタ受け口ですか？LANのコネクタ（RJ-45タイプの受け口）にも挿すことは可能です」なんて大真面目に書く事を要求してくる奴が居るとは･･･。
KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) -- A 14 - year - old who was trained to kill by radicals in the tribal regions of Pakistan now sits in a crowded classroom at a detention facility in Kabul .
His only wish is to see his parents again .
Shakirullah , 14 , is convicted of planning to carry out a suicide bombing in Afghanistan .
" I miss my parents , my mom and dad , " Shakirullah says in soft tones .
Like others in tribal regions , he goes by one name .
Shakirullah is already a convicted terrorist for planning to carry out a suicide bombing .
He says Muslim radicals lied and tricked him into becoming a would - be bomber .
" I have been detained for trying to commit a suicide attack , " he says .
He says his recruiters told him it was his mission as a Muslim to kill British and American soldiers because they were killing Muslims .
Watch teen say recruiters " cheated me " »
They told him that once he blew himself up he would n't die because God would save him for being a true Muslim .
Asked what he now thinks of Americans and Westerners , Shakirullah is calm , but quick in his response .
" I do n't know .
God knows what type of people they are , whether they are good or bad .
I do n't know them , " he says .
Shakirullah now passes his hours in a cell block at a juvenile detention facility in Kabul .
He is serving at least five years in detention .
He is to be transferred to an adult prison in a couple of years , authorities say .
He has n't heard from his family in the North - West Frontier Province of Pakistan .
He tried to send them a letter through the International Committee of the Red Cross but is not sure it reached them .
" I do n't know what they are thinking .
They have no news of me , " he says .
On this day , Shakirullah attends a rehabilitation class , easily lost in the crowd of boys with shaved heads .
All of the children are convicted for various crimes , including theft , fighting and even murder .
Three boys like Shakirullah are here , all guilty of planning to kill themselves and others after being recruited by terrorist groups .
With the increased violence in Afghanistan , international observers say they have seen more and more children being recruited by armed groups and national forces .
The Taliban , which ruled Afghanistan with its strict Islamic rule from 1996 to 2001 , has regrouped and launched a fierce insurgency .
" As you see in many places in the world , children are being used in armed conflict .
They 've been recruited as child soldiers ; they 've been recruited as armed groups .
And the phenomena is now impacting , again , Afghanistan , " says Catherine Mbengue , the UNICEF representative in Afghanistan .
Watch one boy 's struggle begging for food on streets »
Inside the detention center , Shakirullah walks up to his cell , his sandals sliding across the tile floor .
The cell block is empty and has metal bunk beds lined across the wall and a television set , ready for the times they have electricity .
Shakirullah shares this space with 10 other boys .
He sits in the center of the room with a blanket draped around him .
He barely makes eye contact and looks away as soon as he does .
He is shy , but forthright in his words .
" I did n't want to do it but he forced me to go , " he says of his recruiter .
Rubbing his face with his hand , he says he now spends his time dreaming of his life back home in rural Pakistan .
His eyes begin to water and his voice becomes softer when he talks about missing his mother .
Asked what he misses most about her , he says simply , " A mother is a mother . "
His was a life of farming and tranquility in Pakistan , he says .
It was also a life that took a drastic turn when his father decided to send Shakirullah for studies at a madrassa .
He says his dad wanted him to learn more about Islam and the Quran , something he could not do himself .
He says his father did n't know radicals ran the school .
In the madrassa , Shakirullah learned to recite the Quran in Arabic , not his native language .
He relied solely on the fanatical interpretations the mullahs were giving him .
" When I finished reciting the Quran , a mullah then came to me and told me , ' Now that you have finished the Quran , you need to go and commit a suicide attack . '
That I should go to Afghanistan to commit a suicide attack , " he says .
The teenager was n't given the chance to say goodbye to his parents or siblings when he was driven to the Pakistan - Afghan border and handed over to strangers .
He says he was taken to the southeastern province of Khost , a hotbed for terrorist activity in Afghanistan .
Suicide attacks have risen in Afghanistan since the U.S. - led invasion to topple the Taliban began in late 2001 , after the 9/11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon .
Shakirullah says that before the police arrested him , he was learning how to drive a car but that he was not sure how he was supposed to carry out his attack .
Khost is the province where a suicide car bomb went off near a voter registration site this past Sunday , killing 16 people , 14 of whom were children .
At the juvenile detention facility , Shakirullah and the others are now being taught a different interpretation of Islam .
" The teachers educate them on Islam , and explain to them that the acts that they were doing is not right for them and for others , " says Mir Fayaz ah - Din , who works and lives with the boys at the facility , mentoring them and helping them in their rehabilitation .
" The way you want to kill yourself and someone else -- it in itself is a big offense in Islam . "
Shakirullah now says of his recruiters , " They cheated me . "

Speed Up Ejabberd
January 18 , 2009
Whenever an XMPP server or client writes stanzas to the wire , it must serialize its internal XML representation to real XML .
This serialization process is the biggest consumer of clock cycles in XMPP code .
Ejabberd is no exception , but you can make serialization almost ten times faster with this little trick .
Erlang comes with a native code compiler called HiPE ( High Performance Erlang ) .
One of the great things about Erlang is that you can mix native modules and byte - compiled modules freely .
We ’re going to native compile the ejabberd XML routines to achieve the speed boost .
First , you ’ll need some ejabberd source code .
The file we want to compile is ejabberd / src/xml.erl .
If you installed ejabberd from a package , do n’t worry .
You do n’t even need to run configure .
Next , go to the directory with xml.erl and run the compiler :
cd ejabberd / src erlc +native xml.erl
Finally , move the xml. beam file into your ebin directory .
On Ubuntu , this is normally / usr / lib / ejabberd / ebin , but it might also be under / usr / local / ejabberd / ebin .
Just replace the xml. beam that is already there .
That ’s it !
Now you ’re XML routines will execute much faster !
It would be great if the ejabberd team made this the default for CPU hungry modules .
Jindal may have fudged the facts in his Katrina boat story Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday February 26 , 2009
Print This Email This ( Update at bottom : Jindal aide ' clarifies ' Katrina tale )
Louisiana Governor " Bobby " Jindal 's retort to President Obama 's first major address to Congress was not exactly well - received .
One Fox News panelist went so far as to call his oration " amateurish , " " simplistic " and even " childish . "
Also , on Thursday , a report by Talking Points Memo strongly suggests Jindal 's critics should add dishonest to the litany of complaints .
" During Katrina , I visited Sheriff Harry Lee , a Democrat and a good friend of mine , " said Jindal during his Tuesday night speech .
" When I walked into his makeshift office I 'd never seen him so angry .
He was yelling into the phone : ' Well , I 'm the Sheriff and if you do n't like it you can come and arrest me ! '
I asked him : ' Sheriff , what 's got you so mad ? '
He told me that he had put out a call for volunteers to come with their boats to rescue people who were trapped on their rooftops by the floodwaters .
" The boats were all lined up ready to go - when some bureaucrat showed up and told them they could n't go out on the water unless they had proof of insurance and registration .
I told him , ' Sheriff , that 's ridiculous . '
And before I knew it , he was yelling into the phone : ' Congressman Jindal is here , and he says you can come and arrest him too ! '
Harry just told the boaters to ignore the bureaucrats and start rescuing people . "
The problem with Jindal 's recounting is that it may not have even happened .
However , the one man who could have set the record straight -- Democrat Harry Lee , " one of the most famous politicians in Louisiana history , " according to the Times - Picayune -- passed away in late 2007 .
" According to numerous reports , Harry Lee did not leave the affected area of New Orleans during the crisis , " wrote TPM's Zachary Roth .
" But there is no reported evidence of Jindal having set foot in the area during the period when people were still stranded on roofs -- which , based on a review of news stories from the time , was only until September 3 at the very latest .
Indeed , the evidence strongly suggests he did not . "
" We 've reviewed [ Lexis ] Nexis and other sources , and can find no news reports putting Jindal on the ground in the affected area during the few days after Katrina struck when people might still have needed boats to rescue them from rooftops , " he added .
Portions of TPM 's research were based on a DailyKos diary by user xgz , who links to a find in CNN 's archives that appears to be " the final nail in the coffin , " he said .
Speaking with CNN's Larry King on Sept. 11 , 2005 , Lee , the sheriff Jindal spoke of , said he did n't learn of the required insurance forms until a week after the boats were needed .
Saying , " rules and regulations is what got things all screwed up around here , " the sheriff inadvertently shot down the future governor 's claim .
" Those boats where not allowed to get into the water when they were needed and I just found out about seven days later one of the reason boats could n't get in was they did n't have enough life preservers and some of them did n't have proof of insurance , " said Lee .
" And I 'm sure that there 's a FEMA regulation that says that .
But when a storm of this magnitude hits , you through those regulations out the window and you do what you have to do and start saving lives . "
" Perhaps Mr. Jindal can explain how he learned that lesson during Katrina , when Harry Lee did n't learn about it until a week later ? " asked DailyKos user Barbara Morrill .
A request for comment to Gov. Jindal 's office was not returned as of press time .
Jindal aide ' clarifies ' Katrina tale
Politico's Ben Smith spoke to an aide for Governor Jindal who " clarifies " his Katrina anecdote , but it may not be enough for some liberal critics .
" A spokeswoman for Bobby Jindal says the Louisiana governor did n't intend to imply that an anecdote about battling bureaucrats during Katrina directly involved the governor or took place during the heat of a fight to release rescue boats , " Smith writes .
" The spokeswoman , Melissa Sellers , said the story Jindal told in his response to Obama actually took place some days later in Lee 's office -- though still in Katrina 's chaotic aftermath -- as Lee was ' recounting ' his frustrations with the bureaucracy to someone else on the telephone . "
Jindal chief of staff Timmy Teepell also told Smith that the " the exchange took place in the week following Katrina , when Jindal visited Jefferson Parish multiple times . "
" He was boots on the ground all the time , " Teepell claims .
At TPMMuckraker , Zachary Roth responds that this is " no minor difference . "
" Jindal 's presence in Lee 's office during the crisis itself was a key element of the story 's intended appeal , putting him at the center of the action during the maelstrom , " Roth writes .
" Just as important , Jindal implied that his support for the sheriff helped ensure the rescue went ahead .
But it turns out Jindal was n't there at the key moment , and played no role in making the rescue happen . "
Roth adds , " There 's a larger point here , though .
The central anecdote of the GOP 's prime - time response to President Obama 's speech , intended to illustrate the threat of excessive government regulation , turns out to have been made up .
Maybe it 's time to rethink the premise . "

Abstract Bioinformatics has become too central to biology to be left to specialist bioinformaticians .
Biologists are all bioinformaticians now .
Six years ago I felt like the boy who hit a telephone pole with a wooden stick at the exact instant a power failure darkened all the lights across the US Northeast .
In February 2003 I gave a keynote address for the second annual O'Reilly Bioinformatics Technology Conference called ' Bioinformatics : Gone in 2012 ' in which I predicted that bioinformatics as a discipline separate from mainstream biology would be gone in ten years .
My talk was met with resentment , disappointment and stunned disbelief by an audience of computer geeks who had come to the conference for the express purpose of getting in on the hot new thing .
Worse , this was the year in which biotech and pharma realized they had significantly overinvested in bioinformatics and started large - scale layoffs .
In the light of a downsized bioinformatics market , the O'Reilly publishing house cancelled a series of planned bioinformatics textbooks , and never sponsored another Bioinformatics Technology Conference .
It seemed as though my predictions had come true ten years early , and although I knew it was all coincidental , I could n't suppress the sinking feeling that I was the villain who triggered the collapse .
As it happens , my predictions were quite wrong .
Not only did bioinformatics recover nicely from its early - millennium swoon , but it looks like it is here to stay through 2012 and beyond .
Is this a good thing ?
At the halfway point between my keynote address and the date of my dire predictions , let 's have a look at my arguments and update them against what has happened since .
The core of my 2003 beef with bioinformatics was that it is a family of techniques and not a research discipline unto itself .
Today , if you search for the definition of bioinformatics on Google , you get a family of explanations that boil down to ' using computers to manage , organize and analyze large amounts of biological information ' .
I do n't find this a satisfying definition .
Physicists , geologists and chemists use computers to manage , organize and analyze large amounts of data from their disciplines , and at that time they did not have disciplines named ' physicoinformatics ' , ' geoinformatics ' and ' chemoinformatics ' .
My argument was that information management was so fundamental to the biological sciences that bioinformatics would be absorbed into the mainstream biological curriculum just like the techniques of molecular biology , sequencing and macromolecular separations .
In ten years , I felt , every biology graduate student and postdoc would have just as much facility with computer - based information management tools as they had in 2003 with multi-channel pipetors , electrophoresis units , ultracentrifuges and other stock - in - trade .
My prediction was that bioinformatics would become one of a series of core courses taught in undergraduate and graduate biology programs , and that there would be a vanishing market for researchers who focus solely on biological data management .
I was half right .
Today , bioinformatics lectures are offered by almost every undergraduate and postgraduate biology program in North America , Europe and Asia .
Many colleges and universities go further and make bioinformatics courses part of the core biology curriculum .
At the same time , educational institutions offering certificates and advanced degrees in bioinformatics have increased dramatically over the past decade .
In 1998 , a compilation of institutions offering bioinformatics training listed only ten degree - granting programs in the USA [ 1 ] .
Ten years later , there are at least 74 such programs in the United States and Canada , and more than 150 worldwide [ 2 , 3 ] .
At the same time , the average biologist has become far more computer - savvy than he or she was in 2003 .
It is now routine for wet labs to maintain Wikis to organize their papers and protocols , and unexceptional to see an enterprising graduate student or postdoc create a relational database to manage the results from a complex set of experiments .
Accessible web - based bioinformatics tools are commonplace , and many , in particular the University of California , Santa Cruz ( UCSC ) genome browser [ 4 ] , encourage researchers to upload and analyze their own datasets .
With all these training and online resources available , one would think there would be less need for card - carrying bioinformaticians , and my personal experience suggests that this is the case .
Eight years ago , at the height of the bioinformatics bubble , pharmaceutical companies and other industry players were offering big premiums to qualified bioinformaticians .
However , as of 2008 , The Scientist 's annual salary survey reported a median income of US $ 85,000 for all of the life sciences in the United States [ 5 ] , while the OpenWetWare bioinformatics career survey [ 6 ] found a median income of just US $ 70,000 for self - identified bioinformaticians in North America .
Granted , the two surveys are not comparable , but it does suggest that the salad days of six - figure salaries for entry - level bioinformaticians are unlikely to return .
On the other hand , bioinformatics as a named discipline is stronger than ever .
A decade ago at the annual Cold Spring Harbor Biology of Genomes meeting , the bioinformatics session would be offered early on Sunday morning ( the last day of the meeting ) and was sparsely attended .
Now bioinformatics pervades the entire meeting ; every talk has a strong bioinformatics or computational biology component , and the talks that are heavy in computational biology are always among those that are most heavily attended .
A major contributor to this trend is the breathtaking growth in the size and complexity of datasets .
Six years ago the largest dataset imaginable was the human genome , with its 3 billion base pairs and 100 million raw sequencing reads .
With advances in sequencing technology , it is now possible for a single machine to produce 1.7 billion base pairs over a two - to three - day period , and sequence a human genome at high coverage in just about a month .
This revolution in sequencing technology has spawned such projects as the 1000 Genomes Project [ 7 ] and the International Cancer Genome Consortium [ 8 ] , each of which will generate datasets thousands of times larger than the original Human Genome Project .
Other aspects of biology have experienced similar technological leaps ; for example , advances in fluorescently tagged markers and digital imaging now allow the temporal and spatial dynamics of gene expression to be followed in single cells in living organisms .
In neurobiology , innovations in electrophysiology and optics allow the coordinated electrical activity of hundreds of neurons in a living animal 's brain to be followed simultaneously .
The Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle , Washington , has produced a database of gene - expression information in the mouse brain [ 9 ] that is simply too large for the traditional practice of making local copies .
Very serious computer science is needed to extract knowledge from such datasets .
My argument against bioinformatics based on analogy with chemistry and geology also did n't withstand the test of time .
A few years after I gave the talk , the terms ' geoinformatics ' and ' chemoinformatics ' appeared on the scene , and show no sign of disappearing .
Perhaps I should trademark ' physicoinformatics ' before it is too late ?
So bioinformatics is n't disappearing .
But who is giving these bioinformatics talks , and making and analyzing these large databases ?
By and large these are not people who call themselves bioinformaticians .
Instead , we are witnessing the rise of a new generation of computational biologists who spend part of their time at the bench and part of their time at the computer .
Particularly eye - opening for me has been my recent experience at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research , where I have been recruiting principal investigators for the new Informatics and Biocomputing Department .
Almost all the young investigators that I have interviewed have asked about bench space , laboratory equipment and supplies .
Clearly these researchers see themselves as biologists first and foremost ; for them bioinformatics is a technique to be used , not a speciality to follow .
A career limited to computational data management and analysis alone is too confining a niche for them ; they want to take control of the datasets they generate , and temper theoretical models with empirical tests .
Even I am seeing the writing on the wall , and have started to spec out the equipment for a modest wet lab of my own .
So here is my revised prognosis for the next five years :
Bioinformaticians : gone by 2012 .
Bioinformatics : stronger than ever .

A beer and a movie go very well together .
However , unlike the amusement derived from spotting fictional beers in movies , the opposite can be said for the appearance of real beer brands on the big screen .
Product placement is a lucrative business in films and beer companies are eagerly waiting to throw cash at film - makers willing to feature their brands .
As with all movie product placements , it ’s only a problem when you actually notice it .
When a camera lingers too long over a beer label or a character strays from the plot and starts extolling the virtues of his favorite beer , it becomes an irritating distraction .
While we do n’t expect every movie to avoid any depiction of real - world brands , there is no place for some of the naked advertising that manages to get included in movies .
We ’ve assembled a collection of the 10 worst examples of the practice .
These are the most blatant , shameless product placements for beer that you ’re likely to see .
Prepare yourself for cringe - inducing dialog , bad acting and some thinly - veiled commercials masquerading as feature films .

Shameless placement # 1 : Spider - Man – Carlsberg
Product placements do n’t get much more blatant than in Spider - Man .
Carlsberg makes an appearance in the form of a branded truck providing a ride to our masked buddy as he careens down a city street .
Naturally , the Carlsberg logo is lit up and visible from the perfect angle – so much so that it almost looks like a commercial when taken out of context .
Watch the clip below , but hold your breath as you suffer through an even more obvious placement for Dr. Pepper beforehand .
Shameless placement # 2 : Urban Cowboy – Lone Star
Urban Cowboy was a prime target for beer product placement , considering the movie ’s setting and theme .
John Travolta , wearing a Stetson and belt buckle is seen in the movie ( and the movie poster ! ) holding a long neck bottle of Lone Star beer .
Dubbed the ‘ national beer of Texas ’ , it ’s currently owned by the Pabst brewing company .
Pictured left :
John Travolta concentrating hard to sure he does n’t obscure the label on his beer .
Fun fact :
Whatever about the impact on Lone Star sales , there was a huge soar in popularity for mechanical bulls following the prime billing they received in this movie .
Shameless placement # 3 : James Bond – Heineken
Fans of the James Bond movies have come to expect unprecedented levels of in - your - face product placement , but some controversy was stirred up when Heineken announced a product placement partnership with the franchise .
Always known for his refined taste in liquor , the introduction of beer marked a new direction for 007 .
The Heineken placement began in Casino Royale and continued more recently in The Quantum of Solace .
As with most big - movie product placements , Heineken have created Bond - themed advertising and promotions to get the most Bond for their buck .
Here ’s a clip of a Heineken commercial featuring Casino Royale Bond girl Eva Green .
Or is it a clip of Casino Royale featuring Heineken ?
It ’s hard to tell .
Shameless placement # 4 : The Deer Hunter – Rolling Rock
When you think of the cinema classic , The Deer Hunter , you may not automatically think of product placements .
But , here ’s another example of where the influence of marketing makes the movie dialog sound forced and contrived .
Rolling
Rock must have been ecstatic to have an actor such as Robert De Niro make several references to their beer , including the ultimate line , “ I ’ll get you a Rolling Rock ; it ’s a good beer ; it ’s the best around ” .
Interestingly , we do n’t get much attention paid to Rolling Rock bottles or logo , but when the dialog is this obvious and complimentary , there ’s hardly any need .
Shameless placement # 5 : E.T. – Coors
E.T. famously boosted the sales of Reese ’s Pieces after they were featured in the movie .
But they were n’t the only product to benefit from inclusion in this classic film .
Remember the scene where E.T. spends an afternoon in his bathrobe getting drunk and watching TV ?
Well , he was drinking Coors beer – if you watch carefully , you can catch the brand on the cans as he chugs them back .
Check out the beer at the 5 min 56sec mark below :
Shameless placement # 6 : Ice Cold in Alex – Carlsberg
This entry is a little different from the rest .
For a start , Ice Cold in Alex is the oldest movie in our list , from 1958 .
Back then , paid product placement in movies was relatively rare .
However , there is one iconic scene in the film that gives a strong spotlight to a particular Danish beer .
The scene in question features the renowned actor , John Mills , downing a glass of Carlsberg at the end of their epic journey .
A method actor , Mills shot the scene drinking real beer for authenticity .
It apparently took 14 takes to get the perfect shot ( below ) , so his demeanor was somewhat inebriated by then !
It ’s probably the singular scene in our list where the beer does n’t spoil the proceedings with its presence .
As far as we know , Carlsberg did n’t pay any money to be featured in the film , but rather the producers wanted to add an element of realism .
In an interesting turn of events , Carlsberg reused the exact same scene 40 years later for a TV commercial .
This is one to watch and enjoy :
Shameless placement # 7 : Bad Boys II – Miller
A wild car chase scene in Bad Boys II gets the product placement out of the way before the action heats up .
In this movie , the director opts for a gentle drive - by shot of a Miller Genuine Draft truck – nice and slow for maximum effect .
Take a look below :
Shameless placement # 8 : The Island – Michelob Light
If this article was not limited to beer , we could have filled the entire list with examples from The Island .
It puts the James Bond franchise to shame with its non-stop litany of jarring , blatant product placement .
We ’re treated to everything from Nokia to MSN Search to Puma to Aquafina to Xbox ( and more ) .
But , to the beer !
In a pivotal scene , when Ewan McGregor meets his double , we are treated to a slow and steady beauty shot of a bottle of Michelob Ultra , sitting atop the kitchen counter , followed by the obligatory swig from McGregor himself .
In the clip below , move forward to 4mins , 40secs for the perfectly crafted advertisement :
Shameless placement # 9 : Scary Movie 2 – Coors Light
Apparently , Coors signed a deal with Miramax in 2002 that copper - fastened their beer ’s inclusion in a slew of motion pictures .
One of the movies that ‘ benefited ’ from the deal was Scary Movie 2 .
It features a scene with the Coors Light Twins , that for all intents and purposes may as well be a tightly choreographed TV commercial .
Notice the endearing attention to detail , such as how everyone is holding their bottle of Coors Light with the label facing the camera .
To be sure , comedy movies – and especially the satires – have more forgiving viewers when it comes to product placements .
After all , the plotlines are allowed to be silly .
We ’ll let you decide if this clip falls in the silly or the shameless category …
Shameless placement # 10 : Fallen – Budweiser
According to BrandChannel.com , Budweiser has appeared in more big budget films in recent years than any other beer .
It should n’t be surprising , considering their sizeable marketing muscle .
So , to round off our list , we ’ve picked one of the most contrived , ill - fitting product placements of all .
The movie Fallen is a mediocre cop drama from 1998 .
There ’s a segment in the movie that sounds like it was written by a junior marketing executive from Anheuser - Busch .
It certainly has no bearing on the movie and sticks out like a sore thumb .
You can bet James Gandolfini was happy to hide behind a fake moustache as he spouted out the painful dialog name - checking Bud , Bud Light and Bud Dry .
The scene in question is truly staggering in its obvious plug for Budweiser ; it ’s hard to believe actors of this caliber were obliged to participate .
Watch the offending scene below :
Have you any beer product placements in movies to add to this hall of shame ?
Do product placements influence your beer - buying behavior ?

The idea to ban broadcasting of foreign languages in Azerbaijan has been in the works for a while , and it looks like the law has been passed .
What makes it silly ( besides the idea of banning broadcasts in other languages itself ) is that Turkish is included , which is a language so similar to Azeri that there is no problem in understanding shows broadcast in Turkish , and now apparently a lot of shows are going to have to be dubbed into Azeri to comply with the new law :
While the ban was taken as part of efforts to promote local rather than to penalize foreign shows , television stations have not dubbed any Turkish shows into the Azeri language yet .
" Kurtlar Vadisi Pusu , " " Tek Türkiye , " " Hırsız ve Polis , " " Yaprak Dökümü , " " Yabancı Damat , " " Arka Sokaklar , " " Bir İstanbul Masalı , " " Aşka Sürgün , " " Melekler Adası , " and " Beşinci Boyut " are among the Turkish shows that are popular in Azerbaijan , but are not dubbed into Azeri and will be affected by the new law .

It 's something akin to being in Scotland and having a law passed that requires shows like Friends / 30 Rock / Seinfeld / Simpsons / etc. to now be dubbed into a nice authentic Scottish brogue .
George :
Och aye , that wis a braw meal !
Elaine :
It 's easy whan ye ken it .( in walks Kramer ) Kramer : Guid tae see ye !
Er... something like that ( I 'm not very good at pretending to be Scottish ) , but done by government decree and done in spite of the fact that you had no troubles understanding the show before it was dubbed .
Just to give an example of how similar the two languages are , here 's part of the Azeri Wikipedia ( on the Apollo Program ) : I 'm not even Turkish and I can understand everything but two words there without even checking a dictionary , and even those that I do n't know are easy to understand through context : Layihə is obviously program , and soyuq müharibə is probably soğuk savaş ( Cold War ) ... and yup , looks like muharip is also a Turkish word too that I 've never seen before but I 'm sure Turkish people know very well , meaning combat .
I can even translate the above into Turkish that is probably all or mostly correct with almost no effort at all :
Now time to do some searching about on Azeri sites and forums to see how many people find this to be as ridiculous as I and parliamentarian

What your grocer is n’t telling you
Whether you know them by name , or it ’s your first time in a new grocery store , those workers with colorful smocks and name tags are n’t about to spill all their best kept , on - the - job secrets .
Luckily , Reader ’s Digest was able to convince a few experts to fill us in on what the people behind the scenes know about grocery shopping .
Additives used in bacon , ham and chicken ' could make cancers grow '
A common additive used in bacon and ham could fuel the growth of cancers , research suggests .
High doses of inorganic phosphate salts – which are used to enhance the texture and flavour of processed meats – increased the size of tumours in mice .
The chemicals are also added to bread , cakes and cheeses .
The research will increase concerns that additives used to boost food industry profits could be contributing to cancer rates .
Eating large amounts of processed meats has already been linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer .
The latest findings come from a Seoul National University study into the impact of phosphates on mice which were bred to be vulnerable to lung cancer .
High doses of inorganic phosphate salts can speed up the growth of tumours
The creatures were fed a diet containing 0.5 or 1 per cent phosphate – roughly equivalent to the amount found in human diets .
Those on the high additive diet developed tumours more quickly than those on a conventional diet , the researchers wrote in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine .
They say there is enough evidence to start looking for a link between phosphates and cancer in people .
As well as bulking out processed meats , phosphates are used as a raising agent in baking and an emulsifying agent in cheese .
Moderate levels are essential for a healthy body .
However the amount in our diets has been rising steadily over last few decades .
The researchers suspect that phosphates increase the growth of lung tumours by interfering in the chemical signals between cells – and this effect could also apply to cancers in other parts of the body .
Kath Dalmeny of the pressure group Sustain said there is growing evidence that processed meats increase the risk of cancer .
' A major study has linked red meats – and particularly processed meats – to bowel cancer , ' she said .
' The idea that lots of these chemicals are being used to add more water into meats so they weigh more and can be sold at higher prices is disturbing . '
However , experts urged caution over using the results of the trials on mice to predict the effect of phosphates on humans .
Professor Stephen Spiro , of the British Lung Foundation , said : ' The authors claim that in mice with lung cancer a diet high in phosphates increases lung cancer growth rates .
' While this may be a relevant observation , it has never been assessed in man .
Further study would be required to ascertain any link in humans . '
Dr Kat Arney of Cancer Research UK added : ' Smoking is by far the main cause of lung cancer and quitting is the best way to reduce the risk of this disease . '

How the faceless and amoral world of cyberspace has created a deeply disturbing ... generation SEX
Remember that Hilaire Belloc cautionary tale - Matilda told such dreadful lies , it made one gasp and stretch one ’s eyes ?
I used to love it as a child when telling lies was one of the naughtiest things you could do : Matilda ended up getting burned to death .
These days , however , everything has changed and it ’s the truths that children tell that make one gasp and stretch one ’s eyes .
A couple of years ago , my daughter Francesca , then aged 13 , told me about a party she had been to one Saturday night .
Insight : Olivia ( left ) and daughter Francesca
In the course of the evening , she came upon one of her friends , also aged 13 , performing oral sex on a boy in the garden .
The boy was standing and videoing the event on his mobile phone .
My daughter , in whom the feisty gene has always found strong expression , pulled her friend off the boy , knocked the phone out of his hand and slapped him round the face .
I apologise for shocking you , but then there are a number of things shocking about this event : the casual nature in which such an intimate act is performed in public , the young age of the participants and last , but by no means least , the fact that it is being filmed .
This not only signals the boy ’s disassociation from the physical experience , it also indicates his intention to replay the event and , no doubt , to share his triumph with his friends as one might brandish a trophy above one ’s head for all to see .
Reality TV has a lot to answer for
Nor was this the only such event on this particular evening .
I am no prude , but Francesca painted a picture of Bacchanalia that certainly made me gasp .
That week at school , when conducting a post mortem of their weekend as teenagers do ( and always have done ) , the girls at her then school ( she ’s since moved ) , a private girls ’ school in London , exclaimed : ‘ Hurrah , now we ’re more slutty than Slutney ’ , the affectionate nickname of another school .
Call me old - fashioned , but when I was a gal , sluttishness was not a condition one aspired to .
That year , they were all dressing in Hooters T - shirts ( the uniform of the well - endowed waitresses of a U.S. restaurant chain whose slogan ‘ delightfully tacky yet unrefined ’ sums up its approach ) and buttock - skimming shorts .
They looked , as girls so often do , far older than their 13 years and not unlike the Playboy Bunnies who incensed a generation of feminists .
( Interestingly , clothing depicting the distinctive Playboy bunny is highly popular now among teenage girls . )
When one considers our society , it ’s no surprise that our children have lost all sense of modesty .
Reality check : TV's Skins glamorises teenage promiscuity
Not only do social networking sites such as Facebook , MySpace and Bebo encourage teens to share information about themselves ; but when they are not taking their clothes off , their role models are spilling their guts about their ‘ private ’ lives all over the pages of every national newspaper , magazine and on television .
We have an immoderate interest in the private lives of perfect strangers .
Pop stars such as Amy Winehouse and Britney Spears expose the car crash that is their life for all to see .
Jordan , who won fame by revealing her breasts , has a documentary series where she and her husband , Peter Andre , discuss their sex life ( or lack of it ) in intimate detail .
The Osbournes revealed all for our entertainment in their television series .
Was this extraordinary exposure responsible in part for the subsequent drug and alcohol abuse of the two of their children who participated ?
One ca n’t help feeling it might have been .
Their third child , Amy , wisely chose to stay out of the limelight .
Whatever its exponents may say , reality television has a lot to answer for .
I have been a documentary film - maker for more than two decades and am well aware of the power of the medium .
Today ’s teenagers are starring in the reality show of their own lives and doing all they can to make it as dramatic as possible .
Where before mistakes we made when young - excessive drinking , acts of promiscuity - were quietly forgotten , now they are recorded and broadcast on the internet for all to see .
From happy slapping to amateur sex videos ( Paris Hilton rose to fame when a shamelessly intimate video of her and her boyfriend found its way on to the internet , a reality TV show followed , and the rest , as they say , is history ) .
Do these girls even know what feminism is ?
The sexualisation of our young is ubiquitous : boys caught cheating on their girlfriends on mobile phones , ritual humiliation and worse by YouTube ( In February 2008 , a gang of London teenagers aged 14 - 16 drugged and raped a woman in front of her children and then posted the film of the attack , videoed on a mobile phone , on YouTube ) , television programmes like Sex And The City with man-eating Samantha as the living embodiment of casual libidinous sex , all provide the back projection to our children ’s lives .
Instant fame is all .
In today ’s celebrity culture , no one cares how you made your name , as long as you ’ve made it ; there ’s no distinction between fame and notoriety .
Do you really want things that you ’ve done when drunk to be plastered all over the internet ?
These images are like puppies ; they ’re not just for Christmas , they ’re for life .
Would the 13 - year - old girl administering oral sex in a London garden have done so if she ’d fully considered the possible repercussions of the video the boy was taking of her ?
Once broadcast on the internet the images would have become available not merely to the boy ’s friends , but to the whole world ; to paedophiles and to prospective employers in the future .
Glamour model Jordan and husband Peter Andre discussed their sex life in a documentary series
In her book , Female Chauvinist Pigs : Women And The Rise Of Raunch Culture , Ariel Levy writes about the American experience , where many a young girl ’s dream seems to be the desire to dance around a pole or cheer while others do .
She says that feminist terms such as liberation and empowerment , that used to describe women ’s fight for equality , have been perverted .
Now the freedom to be sexually provocative or promiscuous is not enough - now it can mean the freedom to be an exhibitionist .
During the same summer as the party my daughter had told me about , she casually mentioned at a lunch gathering of family and friends how another of her friends allowed boys to ‘ touch them up ’ .
There was a sharp , shocked intake of breath around the table ; the casual use of language and the public mention of such an act astonished us .
Although many of us might have engaged in such activities at a similar age , none of us could have imagined discussing it in front of our parents let alone in front of our parents ’ friends .
So how much are the parents to blame ?
It is precisely this erosion of the boundaries of privacy and the absence of taboo that is so shocking about today ’s teenagers .
Modern technology allows children access to images and information we , as children , could scarcely have imagined .
You want to see a naked girl ?
Click on to the internet .
You want to hear exactly what your friend got up to the night before ?
Log on to Facebook .
Not only will their boasts tell you that they are recovering from the excesses of the night before , there ’ll be the pictures to prove it .
In today ’s world of fast information and access to all areas , too many - particularly the young - are having to up the stakes to chase their particular dragon and get the high they crave .
Sometimes , they ’re so busy creating drama and tension in the movie of their own lives that they ’ve forgotten to be human beings .
A video I was told about shows how far things have gone : a dying woman lay inert on a street while a man urinated on her , saying as he did so : ‘ This is a YouTube moment . ’
When I was young , secretly looking up the word penis in the dictionary and sniggering was how we got our thrills .
This is small beer for today ’s children : the girls especially , who , where once they might have struck a pose in front of mirrors in the privacy of their own bedrooms , now exhibit themselves scantily clad in hookers ’ poses in photo albums on social networking sites .
There ’s something about the one step removal into cyber space that allows people to behave even more outrageously than they might in person .
Now , even this boundary is becoming blurred .
Aspiration ?
Man-eating Samantha Jones from Sex And The City
Perhaps it ’s the freedom or lack of boundaries they ’ve learned from virtual reality that give them permission to behave with such frightening lack of inhibition in person .
That and the demon drink , for today ’s teenage girls drink in a way we rarely did .
So how much are the parents to blame ?
Those of us who grew up in the Sixties and Seventies will do almost anything to appear ‘ cool ’ to our children ; we certainly do n’t wish to come across as some sort of Mary Whitehouse scandalised by today ’s youth .
Nor do we wish to appear as joyless , men-hating feminists , although many of us remember that we fought hard for the right to do as men have always done .
One ca n’t help but wonder what happened to feminism and its lessons .
On the one hand , girls drink like men ; on the other they dress in a manner that invites sexual objectification .
Do these young girls even know what feminism is ?
‘ The problem is that teenagers have rejected the values of the previous era and to reject the values of the Sixties or Seventies , which was very laissez faire , you have to go very far , ’ says Dr Pat Spungin , psychologist and founder of parenting website raisingkids.co.uk .
The bar has unquestionably been raised .
Where will it end ?
In bizarre fetishism or S&M as teens strive to outdo each other ?
The lessons learned are confusing ones ; girls feel they have the right to get drunk and sleep around , but certain attitudes never change .
According to a sample group of 17 - year - olds I spoke to , there is an enormous double standard between the sexes .
Boys treat sex as being a sign of ‘ laddishness ’ and masculinity , they say ; promiscuous behaviour on their part is an achievement .
Girls , on the other hand , are caught between a rock and a hard place .
‘ Boys demand that they go further before they are ready ; if they do , they ’ll quickly be labelled as sluts , and gain a reputation as an easy target , so that drunk boys will seek them expecting that they ’ll be easy to get off with , ’ says one .
‘ If they do n’t , they ’ll be labelled as frigid and become instantaneously unattractive ; most boys wo n’t bother investing time and energy flirting with a girl if they think there is little prospect of pulling . ’
‘ Girls I know often get drunk and allow themselves to be touched up at bus stops or up against walls , ’ says my daughter , Francesca .
Many of her classmates , she says , have been sleeping with their boyfriends since the age of 14 or 15 .
Peer pressure has always been a persistent factor of teenage life .
The stakes are higher now and teenagers , not surprisingly , have become even more competitive and paranoid .
They may often find themselves in situations they are not equipped to deal with .
The internet personae that children create turn them into avatars - an online persona - in their own lives and diminish their empathy for each other .
It becomes hard to tell what is real and what is n’t .
Role models ?
Paris Hilton ( left ) rose to fame when an intimate video of her and her boyfriend hit the internet .
Britney Spears ( right ) had a very public meltdown
Facebook has an application called the Honesty Box , which invites you to send and receive anonymous messages to discover what people really think of you .
The application ’s blurb declares triumphantly that messages cannot be removed : ‘ Once you send a message , it ’s forever . ’
Thus has bullying moved from the playground into cyber space ?
The implications of all this behaviour are far reaching .
A survey about violence in teenage relationships released last month by Women ’s Aid and Bliss magazine found that nearly a quarter of 14 - year - old girls who responded had been pressured into engaging in sexual activity with somebody they ’ve dated .
According to the survey , boys see girls as sexual commodities and one in four 16 - year - olds had been hit or hurt in some other way .
Many felt it was OK to hit a girl if she ’d been unfaithful .
It also found that more than half of 14 and 15 - year - olds have been humiliated in front of others by someone they were dating .
‘ There used to be a stricter and more regulated approach to bringing up children , ’ says Dr Pat Spungin .
‘ Parents should take back some of the control they ’ve ceded .
We do n’t say “ no ” enough , so vulnerable girls do n’t have enough experience of saying “ no ” themselves . ’
This is not to say that we should be condemning teenagers for being sexual and proposing that they take chastity vows and attend purity balls as is fashionable in parts of the U.S .
However , we do need to consider what is appropriate behaviour and to help our teens ensure that ill - considered or drunken acts which are sometimes a part of growing up wo n’t come back and hurt them in the future .
Some , of course , have always been sexually precocious
There have , of course , always been girls and boys who are sexually precocious .
When I was in the fifth form ( Year 11 ) at my girls ’ grammar school , I remember a classmate going to Majorca and returning to boast that she ’d slept with six boys in a week .
Luckily , neither she , nor they , had the pictures to prove it .
These days they might well have had .
‘ The girls who are most vulnerable and have the most desire to be liked are the ones who are tempted to cross these boundaries , ’ says Dr Pat Spungin .
The event cited at the beginning of this article is an extreme one and by no means common to all teens ’ experience .
It did , however , occur .
Others will have similar stories , and it is symptomatic of a worrying tendency among our teens to live their lives in an inappropriately public arena where they reveal far more of themselves , both literally and metaphorically , than is wise .
Barack Obama recently commented on the fashion among young men for wearing their trousers low on their hips : ‘ Brothers should pull up their pants .
You ’re walking by your mother , your grandmother , and your underwear is showing .
( Some people might not want to see your underwear - I ’m one of them . ) ’
Few would wish a return to the hypocritical constraints of life before the sexual revolution ; however , the trouble with the pendulum is that it has a habit of swinging too far the other way .
Perhaps it ’s time for everyone to pull up their pants and show each other a little more respect ; and , since we ’re supposed to be the adults , it has to start with us , with how we behave , how we draw boundaries and what we put in our newspapers and magazines and on our television screens .

Here ’s a clever advertisement that began on April 20 , 2008 with the release of this weird video .
It takes place in what is commonly referred to in Singapore as the CBD , or Central Business District .
Have patience .
The hair - raising excitement intensifies in the elevator :
At the time , many people in Singapore were wondering :
Is this an authentic ghost or just another Internet hoax ?
They had no idea of the drama that was about to unfold .
Even the daily periodicals were baffled :
Perhaps in response to the frenzy , or maybe they were part of the hoax from the beginning , three local university students – Jimmy , Mike , and YQ – investigated the weird incident on their site , SG Office Ghosts .
This triumvirate claims to be interested strictly in Singaporean paranormal activity , which there must be an abundance of , at least that is what everyone must have thought .
I am referring specifically to those who worked in the CBD , especially while the case was still open and the suspicious video in the hands of a videographer to assess its veracity .
In addition to the inundation of emails and video responses to the alleged Raffles Place Apparition , the triumvirate ’s site garnered helpful people who sent in more multimedia leads of office ghosts in Singapore .
Five days after the initial sighting leaked onto the Internet , this video clip cropped up .
I ’ll let Jimmy fill you in on the details :
Fredrick
Tan submitted this video to us via email .
He claimed to have been working late one night when he noticed his window blinds moving strangely .
Although his office is located in the West instead of the CBD , this video is too sensational to miss .
When our team first saw it , we applauded the man for having the guts to capture the whole thing on his camera phone .
Look closely when the blinds start to part , it almost seemed as if something was climbing through .
One word .
Creepy .
Check it out .
Shortly thereafter , another weird lead came to the SG Office Ghosts , this time of a computer monitor turning on for no apparent reason in the middle of the night and the sound of a keyboard being tapped by invisible fingers .
The printer came out of its slumber to print whatever had been typed , and then the video ended .
What do all three videos have in common apart from the paranormal :
Well , they all occur after hours , when no one in their right mind should be at work .
On May 1 , 2008 the mystery behind the Raffles Place Ghost was solved by none other than GMP , which stands for Global Manpower Professionals , a highfalutin phrase used to describe what they really do , namely , recruit and place people willing to work all day – and apparently all night , too – in a stuffy office .
I ’ll let the weirdest ghost of them all , namely , GMPs corporate service manager , Josh , explain the hoax on his own in this video clip that first appeared on the HR company ’s official site along with – here ’s where the ad placement comes in – a link to submit your CV :
Is overworking really that much of a problem in Singapore ?

See this page in : Dutch , Hungarian , Swedish ( Letter ) I met this guy I really like .
The other day , I found out he is a _______ .
I know it ’s probably wrong for me to see him , but I was wondering if there could be a possibility of me changing his religion .
I am scared he will go to hell if I do n’t .
Can you help me ?
— Summer
I know how exciting it can be to meet someone you really like .
There ’s such a special rush to that kind of original attraction .
But you ’re facing the dating scene ’s old double whammy .
You like him and would like to date him , but you know what God wants you to do .
And they are n’t the same thing .
And it does n’t sound like I need to spend much time reminding you what God says about Christians dating non-Christians .
God knows it ’s a risky business , and He tells us not to do it .
You are not the same as those who do not believe .
So do not join yourselves to them .
Good and bad do not belong together .
Light and darkness cannot share together ( 2 Corinthians 6:14 ) .
If you know someone is not a Christian , you should not date him .
You already understand that , but you ’re concerned about this guy ’s relationship with God .
And I commend you for being so concerned .
But you must be careful with the temptation to want to be involved with this guy so you can lead him to Christ .
Missionary dating seldom works .
And God does n’t ask you to do it , either .
So here ’s what I suggest you do .
First , get with one or two of your close Christian friends and begin praying for this guy .
Only God can change his heart .
Ask Him to do that .
Secondly , talk to your youth pastor or some other Christian adult , preferably a male , and ask him to begin witnessing to this guy .
Ask him to talk to this guy about his relationship with the Lord .
And finally , continue to seek God ’s will first .
Do n’t force a relationship with this guy .
God could be saving you from a lot of heartache and pain .
Or someday , this guy may become a Christian and the two of you may begin a wonderful relationship .
Only God knows .
But remember , too , that God wants to give you the desires of your heart .
The thing you should want most is God ’s kingdom and doing what God wants .
Then all these other things you need will be given to you ( Matthew 6:33 ) .
So trust God , Summer .
Be faithful to Him .
And if it ’s not this guy after he gives his life to Christ , I suspect God has someone even more exciting for you .

Moses Rubn Omilia 's photo of an Arsenal football supporter 's home in Uganda is the first in a series of pictures taken of different signs in Africa and sent in by BBC News website readers .
Africa 's craze for the English Premiership is captured in Stella Joseph 's shot of a salon , or saloon , in the Gambian town of Brikama , where one wonders if only Manchester United fans will be served .
Claire Jaquin sent in this photograph of an advertisement for a salon in Elmina , in Ghana , where clients may wish to say a prayer before having their hair done .
This warning , snapped by Stuart Schaum in South Africa on the way up to the Mozambican border , will give would - be maize thieves something to chew over .
Way down in the south - west of South Africa , chicken farmers show their caring side for restful fowl in this plea to motorists , taken by Etienne Van Straaten in Worcester .
There are signs across the continent warning motorists about out - of - the - ordinary animals , as Marguerite Duponchel found on a visit to South Africa , where she took this shot near Blyde River Canyon .
Outside a bar in the city of Goma , eastern Democratic of Republic of Congo , drinkers are warned not to come in armed .
" The need for this notice says a lot about the place , " says Edward Roberts .
Arthur Buliva took this picture in the Ghanaian capital , Accra , where the warning appears to be more wishful thinking by town planners .
This Hilton Hotel in elegant decline and all its faded glory was photographed by David Gommeren at Mount Elgon in Uganda , near the border with Kenya .

Life makes more of itself .
And now so can a set of custom - designed chemicals .
Chemists have shown that a group of synthetic enzymes replicated , competed and evolved much like a natural ecosystem , but without life or cells .
" So long as you provide the building blocks and the starter seed , it goes forever , " said Gerald Joyce , a chemist at the Scripps Research Institute and co-author of the paper published Thursday in Science .
" It is immortalized molecular information . "
Joyce 's chemicals are technically hacked RNA enzymes , much like the ones we have in our bodies , but they do n't behave anything like those in living creatures .
But , these synthetic RNA replicators do provide a model for evolution — and shed light on one step in the development of early living systems from on a lifeless globe .
Scientists believe that early life on Earth was much more primitive than what we see around us today .
It probably did n't use DNA like our cells do .
This theory of the origin of life is called the RNA World hypothesis , and it posits that life began using RNA both to store information , like DNA does now , and as a catalyst allowing the molecules to reproduce .
To try to understand what this life might have looked like , researchers are trying to build models for early life forms and in the process , they are discovering entirely new lifelike behavior that nonetheless is n't life , at least as we know it .
As Joyce put it , " This is more of a Life 2.0 thing . "
The researchers began with pairs of enzymes they 've been tweaking and designing for the past eight years .
Each member of the pairs can only reproduce with the help of the other member .
" We have two enzymes , a plus and a minus , " Joyce explains .
" The plus assembles the pieces to make the minus enzyme , and the minus enzyme assembles the pieces to draw the plus .
It 's kind of like biology , where there is a DNA strand with plus and minus strands . "
From there , Joyce and his graduate student Tracey Lincoln , added the enzymes into a soup of building blocks , strings of nucleic bases that can be assembled into RNA , DNA or larger strings , and tweaked them to find pairs of enzymes that would reproduce .
One day , some of the enzymes " went critical " and produced more RNA enzymes than the researchers had put in .
It was an important day , but Joyce and Lincoln wanted more .
They wanted to create an entire population of enzymes that could replicate , compete and evolve , which is exactly what they did .
" To put it in info speak , we have a channel of 30 bit capacity for transferring information , " Joyce said .
" We can configure those bits in different ways and make a variety of different replicators .
And then have them compete with each other . "
But it was n't just a bunch of scientist - designed enzymes competing , like a miniature molecular BattleBots sequence .
As soon as the replicators got into the broth , they began to change .
" Most of the time they breed true , but sometimes there is a bit flip — a mutation — and it's a different replicator , " explained Joyce .
Most of these mutations went away quickly , but — sound familiar ? —
some of the changes ended up being advantageous to the chemicals in replicating better .
After 77 doublings of the chemicals , astounding changes had occurred in the molecular broth .
" All the original replicators went extinct and it was the new recombinants that took over , " said Joyce .
" There was n't one winner .
There was a whole cloud of winners , but there were three mutants that arose that pretty much dominated the population . "
It turned out that while the scientist - designed enzymes were great at reproducing without competition , when you put them in the big soup mix , a new set of mutants emerged that were better at replicating within the system .
It almost worked like an ecosystem , but with just straight chemistry .
" This is indeed interesting work , " said Jeffrey Bada , a chemist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , who was not involved with the work .
It shows that RNA molecules " could have carried out their replication in the total absence " of the more sophisticated biological machinery that life now possesses .
" This is a nice example of the robustness of the RNA world hypothesis , " he said .
However , " it still leaves the problem of how RNA first came about .
Some type of self - replicating molecule likely proceeded
RNA and what this was is the big unknown at this point . "

A Rational Response to Peanut Allergies and Children
Some parents of children with peanut allergies are not asking their school to ban peanuts .
They consider it more important that teachers know which children are likely to have a reaction , and how to deal with it when it happens ; i.e. , how to use an Epipen .
This is a much more resilient response to the threat .
It works even when the peanut ban fails .
It works whether the child has an anaphylactic reaction to nuts , fruit , dairy , gluten , or whatever .
It ’s so rare to see rational risk management when it comes to children and safety ; I just had to blog it .

Artists and geniuses , and titans of commerce and global affairs , actively leave legacies .
Beethoven reinvented the symphony , Picasso jolted us into abstraction .
Gandhi taught us nonviolent resistance , and Bill Gates came up with the chip .
Towering figures all .
Legacies , immutable and eternal .
But we use " legacy " in a second sense , do we not ?
Chernobyl , for instance , has a legacy : UN - led efforts to reduce nuclear fallout .
Here in the US , a notable example is that of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Manhattan in 1911 , in which 146 garment workers either died in the flames or jumped to their deaths , which helped propel certain reforms and the broader American trade union movement .
Tragedies do n't actively leave legacies , but rather legacies are created out of their ashes .
And this is the context – the only context – in which we must think about the legacy of blessedly exiting administration of George W Bush .
Am I being unfair ?
Is there not even one positive thing to say ?
OK .
It was nice the other day , in fact quite nice , that Bush announced new protections for 195,280 square miles of American - controlled Pacific islands , reefs , surface waters and sea floor .
That was well done .
Bully .
But the world the Bushies tried to create – the legacy , that is , they attempted to leave has virtually nothing to recommend it .
Even they know it .
Vice - President Dick Cheney , in an exit interview with one of the last remaining friendly media outlets in the US ( the Reverend Moon - owned Washington Times ) , said : " I 'm personally persuaded that this president and this administration will look very good 20 or 30 years down the road in light of what we 've been able to accomplish . "
Now , let 's parse why he said that .
He knew he could n't say with a straight face : " We 've been incredibly successful and leave office with our heads held high . "
Even the man who said in May 2005 that the Iraqi insurgency was in its " last throes " could n't pull that one off .
At the same time , Cheney and other defenders can't say : " Well , we blew it , we screwed a lot of things up . "
The admission would be refreshing of course , but it is n't done .
So they are left with this stab in the dark .
Bush 's defenders surely know that even this scenario is bloody unlikely .
But , you know , it could happen .
So it 's worth putting the spin on the record , just in case it does .
A list of grievances from the likes of me would be , I confess , a bit predictable and tedious , so there 's no point in doing much besides briskly enumerating the lowlights , notorious and somewhat lesser known .
The lies about the war .
The phony Saddam–al - Qaida link .
The use of one of our greatest national tragedy for partisan political purposes .
The smearing of political opponents as unpatriotic .
And in the face of all that , the temerity to botch of the prosecution of the war .
The corruption of the justice department .
The torture , the waterboarding , Abu Ghraib .
The domestic surveillance of only God yet knows who and what .
Guantánamo .
The intimidation of scientists , the doctoring of governmental reports on global warming .
The utter inaction , also , on global warming .
The utter inaction on healthcare .
The utter inaction on the economy .
The utter indifference – no , hostility – to any regulation of the mortgage market .
I promised I 'd be brisk , but there 's a little more .
The phony " compromise " on stem - cell research .
Katrina – ah , yes , New Orleans .
Ca n't forget that .
It , in turn , opens up an entirely fresh Pandora 's box peopled with unqualified incompetents and unyielding ideologues who were given their government jobs merely , or at least chiefly , because they swore a mafioso - like fealty to capo Bush and consigliere Karl Rove .
One more and I 'll stop .
In 2003 , the bookstore at the Grand Canyon mysteriously started carrying a book giving a " creation science " interpretation of the canyon , positing not that it is 4 - 5 m years old , as rational people believe , but fewer than 6,000 .
After all , it could n't be older than the Garden of Eden , right ?
The wreckage – intellectual , ethical , moral , and physical , in terms of the lives lost by our soldiers and Lord knows how many Iraqis – is everywhere .
The shame , even if Americans prefer not to admit it to Europeans , is immense .
We know what we have done .
We know how bad it is .
If you watch US television news , you will see roughly half the people presented defending Bush .
But that 's only because TV has to strive for balance .
Believe me , the real percentages are more like 80%:20 % .
Four out of five of my fellow citizens know we have erred .
For that reason , we can turn our attention now to Bush 's legacies - from - the - ashes , positive and wholly unintended .
Without his failures and , crucially , our collective acknowledgment of them , we would not have elected last autumn a man who is both a history maker and ( seemingly ) an intelligent and competent empiricist who believes in considering actual evidence (! ) before making decisions .
Without his failures and our collective acknowledgment of them , we would not be resolved as we are – some of us are merely resigned , but that 's good enough – to start addressing our festering problems and proto-crises : our energy woes , our over - consumption of everything , our healthcare mess , our global condition .
The incoming president has a mandate to move on all these fronts .
It is an astonishing and exhilarating thing to see ; for the liberally inclined , an invigorating and , indeed , joyous time to be alive , as Wordsworth wrote à propos the French Revolution .
Whether he will succeed , well , we shall see what we shall see .
Without question , some hopes are too high .
Human nature is human nature , despite what Marx and his inheritors thought .
The communists could n't change it , and Barack Obama wo n't change it either .
He will succeed here and fail there .
But that is n't the question for today .
We will have four or eight years to delve into all that .
The question for today is , does the opportunity exist , at this historical moment , for a reordering of national and global priorities on a scale greater than anything seen since the Great Depression and the aftermath of the first world war ?
Yes , it does .
And for this , paradoxically , we have Bush to thank .
Speaking of Marx , you know how the Marxists used to say " the worse , the better " ?
The dialectic has n't always worked out they way they said it would , to put it mildly .
But in the current case , it 's playing out pretty perfectly , no ?
Bush made things so much worse , made it so evident to almost all of us , that things can only get better .
Maybe in all that heavy reading he 's allegedly been doing the last three years , Bush has a ) become a secret liberal and b ) dipped into enough Hegel to have learned how to set the dialectic in motion .
Or maybe he 's just a really lousy president .
Who was in over his head to begin with .
I wonder how it feels , how it really feels , to know that , outside of the obvious mass murderers , you were one of the worst leaders in the history of modern world .
Because he knows it .
He 'll never say it , but he knows it .
I say , let him live with it , every day .
And let the rest of us thank him for failing so colossally and then get on with the rebuilding .
To Franklin Delano Roosevelt , 1 February 1938
Private and personal
Dear Mr. President ,
You received me kindly when I visited you some three years ago that I make bold to send you some bird ’s eye impressions which I have formed as to the business position in the United States .
You will appreciate that I write from a distance , that I have not revisited the United States since you saw me , and that I have access to few more sources of information than those publicly available .
But sometimes in some respects there may be advantages in these limitations !
At any rate , those things which I think I see , I see very clearly .
(1) I should agree that the present recession is partly due to an ‘ error of optimism ’ which led to an overestimation of future demand , when orders were being placed in the first half of this year .
If this were all , there would not be too much to worry about .
It would only need time to effect a readjustment ; — though , even so , the recovery would only be up to the point required to take care of the revised estimate of current demand , which might fall appreciably short of the prosperity reached last spring .
(2) But I am quite sure that this is not all .
The recovery was mainly due to the following factors : —
( i ) the solution of the credit and insolvency problems , and the establishment of easy short - term money ; ( ii ) the creation of an adequate system of relief for the unemployed ; ( iii ) the public works and other investments aided by Government funds or guarantees ; ( iv ) investment in the instrumental goods required to supply the increased demand for consumption goods ; ( v ) the momentum of the recovery thus initiated .
Now of these ( i ) was a prior condition of recovery , since it is no use creating a demand for credit , if there is no supply .
But an increased supply will not of itself generate an adequate demand .
The influence of ( ii ) evaporates as employment increases , so that there is a dead point beyond which this factor cannot carry the economic system .
Recourse to ( iii ) has been greatly curtailed in the past year .
( iv ) and ( v ) are functions of the upward movement and cease — indeed ( v ) is reversed — as soon as the position fails to improve further .
The benefit from the momentum of recovery as such is at the same time the most important and the most dangerous factor in the upward movement .
It requires for its continuance , not merely the maintenance of recovery , but always further recovery .
Thus it always flatters the early stages and steps from under just when support is most needed .
It was largely , I think , a failure to allow for this which caused the ‘ error of optimism ’ last year .
Unless , therefore , the above factors were supplemented by others in due course , the present slump could have been predicted with absolute certainty .
It is true that the existing policies will prevent the slump from proceeding to such a disastrous degree as last time .
But they will not by themselves — at any rate , not without a large - scale recourse to ( iii ) — maintain prosperity at a reasonable level .
(3) Now one had hoped that the needed supplementary factors would be organized in time .
It was obvious what these were — namely increased investment in durable goods such as housing , public utilities , and transport .
One was optimistic about this because in the United States at the present time the opportunities , indeed the necessities , for such developments were unexampled .
Can your Administration escape criticism for the failure of these factors to mature ?
Take housing .
When I was with you three and a half years ago the necessity for effective new measures was evident .
I remember vividly my conversations with Riefler at that time .
But what happened ?
Next to nothing .
The handling of the housing problem has been really wicked .
I hope that the new measures recently taken will be more successful .
I have not the knowledge to say .
But they will take time , and I would urge the great importance of expediting and yet further aiding them .
Housing is by far the best aid to recovery because of the large and continuing scale of potential demand ; because of the wide geographical distribution of this demand ; and because the sources of its finance are largely independent of the stock exchanges .
I should advise putting most of your eggs in this basket , caring about this more than about anything , and making absolutely sure that they are being hatched without delay .
In this country we partly depended for many years on direct subsidies .
There are few more proper objects for such than working - class houses .
If a direct subsidy is required to get a move on ( we gave our subsidies through the local authorities ) , it should be given without delay or hesitation .
Next utilities .
There seems to be a deadlock .
Neither your policy nor anybody else ’s is able to take effect .
I think that the litigation by the utilities is senseless and ill - advised .
But a great deal of what is alleged against the wickedness of holding companies is surely wide of the mark .
It does not draw the right line of division between what should be kept and what discarded .
It arises too much out of what is dead and gone .
The real criminals have cleared out long ago .
I should doubt if the controls existing today are of much personal value to anyone .
No one has suggested a procedure by which the eggs can be unscrambled .
Why not tackle the problem by insisting that the voting power should belong to the real owners of the equity , and leave the existing organizations undisturbed , so long as the voting power is so rearranged ( e.g. by bringing in preferred stockholders ) that it cannot be controlled by the holders of a minority of the equity ?
Is it not for you to decide either to make a real peace or to be much more drastic the other way ?
Personally I think there is a great deal to be said for the ownership of all the utilities by publicly owned boards .
But if public opinion is not yet ripe for this , what is the object of chasing the utilities around the lot every other week ?
If I was in your place , I should buy out the utilities at a fair price in every district where the situation was ripe for doing so , and announce that the ultimate ideal was to make this policy nation - wide .
But elsewhere I would make peace on liberal terms , guaranteeing fair earnings on new investments and a fair basis of valuation in the event of the public taking them over hereafter .
The process of evolution will take at least a generation .
Meantime a policy of competing plants with losses all round is ramshackle notion .
Finally , the railroads .
The position there seems to be exactly what it was three or four years ago .
They remain , as they were then , potential sources of substantial demand for new capital expenditure , Whether hereafter they are publicly owned or remain in private hands , it is a matter of national importance that they should be made solvent .
Nationalise them if the time is ripe .
If not , take pity on the overwhelming problems of the present managements ,
And here too let the dead bury their dead .
( To an Englishman , you Americans , like the Irish , are so terribly historically minded ! )
I am afraid I am going beyond my province .
But the upshot is this .
A convincing policy , whatever its details may be , for promoting large - scale investment under the above heads is an urgent necessity .
These things take time .
Far too much precious time has passed .
(4) I must not encumber this letter with technical suggestions for reviving the capital market .
This is important .
But not so important as the revival of sources of demand .
If demand and confidence reappear , the problems of the capital market will not seem so difficult as they do today .
Moreover it is a highly technical problem .
(5) Businessmen have a different set of delusions from politicians , and need , therefore , different handling .
They are , however , much milder than politicians , at the same time allured and terrified by the glare of publicity , easily persuaded to be ‘ patriots ’ , perplexed , bemused , indeed terrified , yet only too anxious to take a cheerful view , vain perhaps but very unsure of themselves , pathetically responsive to a kind word .
You cold do anything you liked with them , if you would treat them ( even the big ones ) , not as wolves or tigers , but as domestic animals by nature , even though they have been badly brought up and not trained as you would wish .
It is a mistake to think that they are more immoral than politicians .
If you work them into the surly , obstinate , terrified mood , of which domestic animals , wrongly handled , are so capable , the nation ’s burdens will not get carried to market ; and in the end public opinion will veer their way .
Perhaps you will rejoin that I have got quite a wrong idea of what all the back - chat amounts to .
Nevertheless I record accurately how it strikes observers here .
(6) Forgive the candour of these remarks .
They come from an enthusiastic well - wisher of you and your policies .
I accept the view that durable investment must come increasingly under state direction .
I sympathise with Mr Wallace ’s agricultural policies .
I believe that the SEC is doing splendid work .
I regard the growth of collective bargaining as essential .
I approve minimum wage and hours regulation .
I was altogether on your side the other day , when you deprecated a policy of general wage reductions as useless in present circumstances .
But I am terrified lest progressive causes in all the democratic countries should suffer injury , because you have taken too lightly the risk to their prestige which would result from a failure measured in terms of immediate prosperity .
There need be no failure .
But the maintenance of prosperity in the modern world is extremely difficult ; and it is so easy to lose precious time
I am , Mr President
Yours with great respect and faithfulness ,
J.M. Keynes

The disclosure of the unaccounted third came in the atomic agency ’s quarterly report to its board , which was made public on Thursday .
The report noted that Iran had now produced a total of 1,010 kilograms  or 2,227 pounds  of low - enriched uranium .
The discrepancy came to light when the report noted that the new total came from the addition of 171 kilograms of new production to 839 kilograms of old production .
But the agency had previously reported the old production as 630 kilograms .
So the Iranians had actually made far more uranium than previously disclosed  209 kilograms more , an increase of a third .
That amounts to a little more than 460 pounds .
The United Nations ’ officials explained the discrepancy as resulting from Iran ’s estimates versus careful measurement .
They called the inconsistency reasonable for a new enrichment plant .
The officials dismissed suggestions that the discrepancy meant that Iran could smuggle enriched uranium out of the Natanz plant for processing at a secret location .
“ We ’re sure that no material could have left the facility without us knowing , ” the senior United Nations official said .
But he admitted that the inspection teams do their own inventory just once a year .
“ It ’s only at that moment , ” he said , “ that we have our own independent data . ”
The report also gave updated figures for Iran ’s use of centrifuges  the machines that spin incredibly fast to enrich uranium into nuclear fuel .
At Natanz , it said , Iran is feeding uranium into about 4,000 centrifuges and has 1,600 more in the wings , for a total of 5,600 .
That compares with 3,800 working centrifuges listed in the agency ’s November report .
In Paris earlier this week , the head of the United Nations nuclear agency , Mohammad ElBaradei , said Iran appeared to have made “ a political decision ” to do less enrichment than it physically could .
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on Iran for failing to suspend enrichment , which can be used to make fuel for nuclear reactors or bombs .
While Iran insists that its efforts are entirely peaceful , the United States and other Western nations see the enrichment as a bid for atom bombs .
There has been an epidemic in New York City of false arrests of gay men under the guise that they were solicited by prostitutes who were really undercover cops .
Several adult porn shops and bookstores catering to men have been the target of the New York Police Dept .
It is said that an attractive officer is sent to flirt with middle - aged gay men .
The allegations are that the officer entices the man to have sex with him , and just before they leave the shop the officer says he wants to pay the man for sexual favors .
Without knowing whether the man would agree to payment , the police surround the man and accuse him with attempt to do business with a prostitute .
Christine Quinn the NYC Council Speaker has called these “ false arrests . ”
This raises serious questions as to why the NYPD is targeting gay adult shops , and why they are arresting people under these charges .
The LGBT community has faced scrutiny from the police before , including bar raids , and trans - women being accused of prostitution simply for the way they dress and express themselves .

HUMAN language is the subject of endless scientific investigation , but the gestures that accompany speech are a surprisingly neglected area .
It is sometimes jokingly said that the way to render an Italian speechless is to tie his wrists together , but almost everyone moves their hands in meaningful ways when they talk .
Susan Goldin - Meadow of the University of Chicago , however , studies gestures carefully — and not out of idle curiosity .
Introspection suggests that gesturing not only helps people communicate but also helps them to think .
She set out to test this , and specifically to find out whether gestures might be used as an aid to children 's learning .
It turns out , as she told the AAAS , that they can .
The experiment she conducted involved balancing equations .
Presented with an equation of the form 2 + 3 + 4 = x + 4 , written on a blackboard , a child is asked to calculate the value of x .
In the equations Dr Goldin - Meadow always made the last number on the left the same as the last on the right ; so x was the sum of the first two numbers .
Commonly , however , children who are learning arithmetic will add all three of the numbers on the left to arrive at the value of x .
In her previous work Dr Goldin - Meadow had noted that children often use spontaneous gestures when explaining how they solve mathematical puzzles so , to see if these hand - movements actually help a child to think , or are merely descriptive , she divided a group of children into two and asked them to balance equations .
One group was asked to gesture while doing so .
A second was asked not to .
Both groups were then given a lesson in how to solve problems of this sort .
As Dr Goldin - Meadow suspected , the first group learnt more from the lesson than the second .
By observing their gestures she refined the experiment .
Often , a child would touch or point to the first two numbers on the left with the first two fingers of one hand .
Dr Goldin - Meadow therefore taught this gesture explicitly to another group of children .
Or , rather , she taught a third of them , taught another third to point to the second and third numbers this way , and told the remainder to use no gestures .
When all were given the same lesson it was found those gesturing “ correctly ” learnt the most .
But those gesturing “ incorrectly ” still outperformed the non-gesturers .
Gesturing , therefore , clearly does help thought .
Indeed , it is so thought - provoking that even the wrong gestures have some value .
Perhaps this helps to explain why the arithmetic - intensive profession of banking was invented in Italy .
According to BoxOfficeMojo.com , the critically acclaimed Caped Crusader sequel — which actually could win eight Academy Awards on Sunday — is now in fourth place on the list of all - time box office grosses , behind only Titanic ( $ 1.84 billion ) , The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King ( $ 1.12 billion ) and Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man's Chest ( $ 1.07 billion ) .
The Dark Knight is currently sitting pretty with $ 1.001 billion , while the fifth - place Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone is way back there with $ 974.7 million .
$ 533.1 million of that billion - plus sum was grossed in U.S. theaters , while $ 468 million was raked in overseas .
Warner Bros. ' news comes along with the announcement that The Dark Knight is also now the top - grossing 2 - D IMAX release of all time , with $ 64.9 million grossed worldwide .
THE DALLES , Ore. , Dec. 29 ( UPI ) --
Scientists say they have yet to definitively determine what is causing the town of Maupin , Ore. , to endure an earthquake every other day .
Oregon State University research associate Jochen Braunmiller said during the last two years , more than 360 earthquakes have occurred in the general vicinity of Maupin for elusive reasons , The ( Portland ) Oregonian said .

The College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences researcher said while one theory focuses on water level shifts miles underground , scientists are at a loss to offer predictions regarding the quakes .
" It just kind of keeps going , " Braunmiller said .
" Overall , we know stress is being released so we think it will stop at some point .
But we cannot say when that will happen or whether we have seen the largest one yet . "
The Oregonian said the earthquakes have been focused around the Deschutes River , an area of Oregon filled with volcanic basalts .
Braunmiller told the newspaper that the Eastern California Shear Zone could play a role in the ongoing quakes if the expanding San Andreas Fault is putting sufficient geological pressure on the shear zone .
How come in a world of powerful languages , IDEs with intellisense , O/R mappers , unit tests , numerous libraries , copious amounts of third party tools , continuous integration , tons of code samples , thousands of developer forums , and more technical books than you can shake a stick at , is it so freakin hard to produce good software ?
There is a blog post by Oliver Steele that has gotten some recent attention ( despite the fact that it was written in 2004 ! ) and it is called " The IDE Divide " .
In this post Oliver Steele talks about a divide in the programming world between what he calls the " language mavens " and the " tool mavens " .
He points out that people are often either big proponents of a particular high level language , or group of high level languages ( an example he uses is Haskell ) , or they put tools above languages and focus more on how much more productive tools can make them .
While I do n't have any fundamental problems with his post ( it does actually make several good points and draws several important conclusions ) , I think it does underscore a particular mindset that often occurs in software development where we see tools and languages not problems and solutions .
If something goes wrong , then we need a tool to fix it !
If this project failed , well if we had been using language X or tool Y then it would have been easier !
We often want to put the implementation above the problem .
I think we do this for several reasons .
( keep in mind that in this list the word " customer " is overloaded , a customer is anyone who is consuming your software )
It 's the fun part !
For most of us we started off hacking away at software in our younger years before we ever knew what specs or customers were .
Because of this , and because the fact that most of us just want to write code , we often enjoy the architecture / design / development part of the software more than the requirements gathering .
Go figure .
This can be a good thing , if we did n't enjoy the construction part then all of our jobs would be hell , but at the same time , you need to figure out what you are going to build before you build it .
As Alan Stevens put it in a recent tweet " Knowing what to build is the hardest part .
Everyone focuses on the how to build it part because that 's an easier discussion . "
And he is completely correct , discussing construction is more natural for us because that is what we like to do and that is what most of us were trained to do .
How many blog posts have you seen on requirements gathering ?
We think we already know what needs to be written .
By the time that most programmers hear about a new piece of software that needs to be written they are already designing it in their head .
Once we start thinking about it we start building up layer upon layer of preconceived notions about what we are going to be building .
I can't tell you the number of times that a project has been put in front of me that needs a quote and I see the customers initial request and start thinking about what we would have to do in order to build such a system .
Then when you start asking the customer questions about what needs to be built you realize that the system is nothing at all like you would have envisioned .
There is either a barrier of language , lexicon , or experience between you and the customer .
A lot of methodologies at first glance support this behavior .
A lot of people will take the parts of agile development that they want and throw the rest out .
They will latch onto the parts about not having a big spec up front and writing tests first and think that this means that they should just jump right in and let the application evolve .
Well , that is a great idea as long as you want crappy software .
Even in most agile methodologies there is a strong emphasis on gathering requirements and defining things like user stories up front so that you * know * what you are building before you build it .
You may not know exactly * how * you are going to build it , but you have a general idea of * what * you are building .
This is what a lot of us are used to .
There are * a lot* of development shops out there that still writing software as if the developers are operating in a vacuum .
A team of people will hammer out a detailed spec ( assuming you have a spec ) and then they will " throw it over the wall " and the development team will disappear to their cubes for 3 months and then out pops a grotesque conglomeration of specification and assumption .
Then they get a long " you screwed this up list " and go back and start the same process to get the software to do what the customers actually wanted , the only problem is that they are using the same system that screwed it up in the first place .
Look ma , no collaboration !
We are n't agile .
We think that specs and requirements are something that you only get before you build software .
How many times have you completed a task only to show a customer your proud accomplishment and you receive a list of things that are completely wrong with your design ?
You may have heard the term " impedance mismatch " when talking about ORM software , well this is impedance mismatch for requirements .
Your customers requirements go in one end and then there needs to be a translation layer into your requirements .
This translation is neither clean nor is it deterministic .
Another point , you need to have customer feedback .
At at a previous job I held I was given a project and the specs were n't very clear at all .
I asked my boss to allow me to go talk with the people that were using the software and he told me that I did n't want to do that because it would just start down a road of constant changes and requests !
There are two problems here , first you need to set customer expectations .
They should not have the idea that every little tweak or suggestion they have is going to get implemented , but writing an application for someone without feedback is a lot like throwing javelin with a blindfold .
Secondly , to assume that changes are bad is how you end up with bad software .
Software needs to evolve in order to meet business requirements .
Your specifications are not very specific .
You look at your specs , you see a lot of holes , and so you want to just fill them .
Having a lot of gaps to a certain extent is a good thing !
Your customer often does n't know what they want any more than you do .
The only way to get it right is to evolve both of your opinions in the process by delivering early and often .
This way your customer can start to get a clearer picture of how they want the system to work while you start to see the evolution of the customer 's decisions which will make it easier for you to predict their needs .
To paraphrase Steve McConnell if your customers specifications spelled out the software 100 % you'd be better off just executing the spec .
Keep in mind also that good specs tell you what needs to happen ( and may give a little guidance on how ) , bad specs tell you in detail how to do it .
You might be thinking right now " So , you are saying that I should put the spec first ?
We just do n't have time to hammer out a big spec before ( or during ) our software development ! "
Well , I 'm not telling you to make a big spec document .
I think that big spec documents are something that hurts software development , not helps it .
I 'm not even necessarily saying that you should follow a formal agile methodology , what I am saying is that you * need * to take the time to figure out what you are going to write .
You need to figure out what problem you are solving or what task you are trying to accomplish .
You need to talk with your customer and figure out what they need from the system and what pain they are having that needs to be alleviated .
Whether you put it on note cards , a white board , or in a word doc , you need to figure out what you are going to do .
So , why do good programmers who use all the tools at their disposal write bad software ?
Because we are n't writing the correct program and we are n't solving the right problem .
We are n't going to our customer and getting feedback and we are n't keeping up with changing requirements .
Most often this is because we do n't know what our requirements are .
Generally speaking , our customers are not experts in application design , and usually they do n't understand how to give you requirements .
The only process they have for giving you requirements can be to look at an application and tell you what is or is not correct .
By acknowledging that the software you are writing is only partially correct , you will mentally prepare yourself for the inevitable changes that will come down the pipeline .
So , just remember that you can use BDD , TDD , DDD , MVC , ORM , ( enough ? ) all you want , but if you are not writing what your customer wants and needs then you are just wasting time .
So the next time someone tells you not to do something because it may result in change requests just tell them " we are n't writing software because we have a bunch of hard drive space that needs to be filled , we are writing software to solve problems and unless we are solving the right problems we might as well just stop writing code right now . "
… stepping down from soapbox .
1 ) Exfoliate lips in the shower or prior to makeup application .
Use a lip balm or moisturizer to condition lips .
Allow the product to absorb before proceeding .
2 ) Apply foundation and concealer as usual on face .
To not detract attention from dramatic lips , you must create a clean backdrop .
Under - eye circles and any discoloration and unevenness in skin tone should be camouflaged for an all - over flawless finish .
Use a translucent powder to mattify face .
Groom and define brows .
You may also bring out the shape of your eyes with eyeliner and mascara , but do n't apply any products with evident color .
Your eyeliner and mascara , should you use them , are best kept black , dark brown or gray .
3 ) Pat a makeup primer all over your lip line .
You can use one containing silicone to give dark lip color a firmer base to cling to so it neither feathers nor bleeds .
While you are waiting for the primer to absorb , survey the lip colors you wear on a regular basis .
To simply add some drama to your everyday look , you will need to intensify an existing lip color in your makeup kit .
On the other hand , to go in a completely different style direction , shop for a dark - - even decadent - - lip color you have n't worn in public before .
An almost - black red is such a color particularly fitting for a winter evening event .
4 ) Deepen your lip color of choice from your makeup kit by mixing it with a dark brown lip product on an artist 's palette .
Add as little or as much as you want to produce the shade you are most comfortable wearing .
The more opaque your mixing medium is , the more evidently darker your result will be .
For instance , for a thick , highly - pigmented finish , use a creme - based dark brown lipstick .
If you want a more sheer formulation , use a dark brown lip gloss .
Line and fill lips in with a pencil in the same color as your finished product .
Use a nude lip liner instead if you do n't have one that matches .
Smooth lipstick evenly onto lips with a lip brush .
5 ) Revamp your look by purchasing a new lipstick or lip stain in the dark shade you fancy .
If you 're going this far , do n't settle for a mid -tone intensity .
Choose a deeper and darker one unlike any you 've previously tried .
You can wear your new lip color in two different ways .
One method involves lining and filling lips in with a pencil as in Step 4 , before topping lips off with the lipstick or lip stain .
This gives you a more finished appearance .
The second option merely calls for a stained effect , where you generously swipe the color onto the center of both top and bottom lips before blending outwards to meet the boundary of your lip line .
Polish lips with a light coat of clear lip gloss if you wish .
Now Channel 4 gets a dwarf drunk on television
Verne Troyer took a tumble off his scooter after a boozy night in the Celebrity Big Brother house .
Channel 4 bosses provided housemates with champagne as a reward for winning a task and the 2ft 8in actor , 40 , indulged a little too much .
The Austin Powers star crashed his mobility scooter after driving it at speed towards the Diary Room after being summoned by Big Brother .
Whoops : Verne Troyer falls off his scooter after driving at speed into the Diary Room
Do n't drink and drive :
The actor had been sipping champagne before the tumble
Verne and his housemates were awarded champagne , party food , music and cigarettes after successfully passing the Message In A Bottle task , which required them not to moan for a whole hour .
As the group celebrated a rare passing of a task , Verne showed he was in the party mood as he swilled three glasses of champagne .
But , the alcohol appeared too much for the actor 's diminutive frame to handle and soon enough he was entertaining housemates by slurring his words and struggling to drive his scooter properly .
LaToya Jackson soon found herself as the target of Verne 's flirtatious behaviour , as he repeatedly told her how beautiful her smile was .
He said : ' You 're smile is so much special .
Let me tell you seriously .
When you smile you do so much more than the overall thing .
' You might have the whole thing .
These people who want to get involved , f**k them . '
Help is at hand : Tina Malone calls Terry Christian over to lift Verne back on his scooter
Embarrassment : Verne was clearly annoyed Big Brother had summoned help for the actor as Terry Christian came to his aid
His attempted seduction of LaToya in the bedroom came to an abrupt halt when Coolio walked in and informed him Big Brother had called him to the Diary Room .
Drunk Verne repeatedly insisted Big Brother had called Ben Adams , not him , prompting Big Brother to repeat Verne 's name several times .
After struggling to put on his shoes , Verne was helped onto his scooter by the rapper and kept stopping and starting the scooter on the way into the living room .
He then risked the wrath of Big Brother by refusing to go into the Diary Room and kept driving his scooter around the room , flirting up a storm with the female housemates .
Despite clearly having had enough alcohol , Verne demanded more booze from Coolio .
Straight to his head : Verne looks ready for bed after overindulging on champagne
He shouted : ' Hit me , come on bitch . '
As his request was ignored by Coolio , Verne proceeded to drive his housemates crazy by driving around and around the room , prompting his nemesis Ulrika Jonsson jokingly offering to ' spank him ' .
After being requested to come to the Diary Room yet again by Big Brother , Verne got as far as the hallway entrance and was thrown off the scooter after accelerating instead of breaking .
Verne was obviously embarrassed when Big Brother summoned someone to help him off the floor and was unhappy when Terry Christian came to his assistance .
This is n't the first time Verne has been drunk on television - in 2005 he starred in the U.S version of Celebrity Big Brother , entitled The Surreal Life .
On the first day of entering the show , Verne got so drunk he ended up urinating in the house gym .

America's top law enforcement official has declared that immigrants facing deportation have no right to an effective attorney , a move immigration lawyers and the country 's top lawyers ' guild described as a last - minute evisceration of a constitutional right .
In Wednesday 's decision , George Bush 's attorney general , Michael Mukasey , wrote that immigration courts need not reopen " removal " - or deportation - proceedings on the grounds that an immigrant 's attorney was incompetent .
As a result , illegal immigrants and asylum seekers who lose deportation hearings because their attorneys fail to file legal papers on time , who do not show up for hearings or myriad other infringements lack recourse in immigration court .
The decision stems from three cases in which immigrants appealed deportation orders .
In one , the lawyer of a Malian man who had overstayed his visa but married an American citizen neglected to file a legal brief in an appeal of a deportation order .
In another case , the lawyer representing a Colombian who sought asylum under the United Nations convention against torture failed to file a legal brief .
A coalition of law school clinics and immigration lawyers opposed the move , as did the American Bar Association , the top lawyers ' guild in America .
" Immigrants , refugees and asylum seekers often are unfamiliar with our language , culture , and legal system , and as a result are especially vulnerable to being deceived by persons who are not authorized to practice law , or harmed as a result of mistakes by attorneys who lack sufficient familiarity with our nation 's complex immigration laws , " the American Bar Association 's president , H Thomas Wells Jr , wrote to Mukasey .
Immigration courts have for decades operated under the premise that immigrants enjoy a constitutional right to effective counsel , immigration lawyers said .
Criminal defendants whose lawyers fail to represent defendants at a basic level of competence may seek a new trial .
Mukasey wrote that the US constitution affords a right to counsel , and hence a right to effective counsel , only in criminal matters .
Immigration proceedings are civil matters , he wrote , and therefore that right does not apply .
In a brief opposing the decision , the American Immigration Law Foundation argued that in deportation proceedings , the government exercises its power to deprive immigrants of their liberty .
" The entire removal apparatus was created by the government ; removal proceedings are initiated and conducted by the government ; the government detains removable non-citizens until they can be removed , often throughout their proceedings ; and removal is executed by the government , " attorneys Nadine Wettstein and Emily Creighton wrote .
" When a removal order is obtained in a process tainted by ineffective assistance of counsel , " they continued , " it is the government 's proceedings that have denied the respondent of constitutional rights " .
A spokesman for the US justice department said in an interview that an immigrant denied a second hearing under Mukasey 's decision will still be able to appeal to a higher - level panel of immigration judges , and ultimately to federal appeals courts .
The spokesman , Charles Miller , added that if Obama 's nominee as attorney general , Eric Holder , disagrees with the decision he may overturn it .
" The attorney general based this on a review of court decisions , and I can't go beyond what he wrote in his opinion , " Miller said .
Immigration lawyers on Thursday described the move as a last - minute blow to the US constitution by an administration that has for eight years sought to limit constitutional rights , for instance by arguing that prisoners at Guantánamo Bay have no access to US courts .
" It 's a departure from long standing legal precedent , " said David Leopold , a Cleveland , Ohio immigration attorney and vice - president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association .
" In the waning days of this administration the attorney general has taken one more stab at a fundamental constitutional right , in this case the right to counsel for people who are facing the lifetime banishment from the United States . "
Miller , spokesman for the justice department , disagreed .
" I can't tell you how long the attorney general was reviewing this - and those people working with him - but based on the opinion it looks like it was well thought - out before it was finally signed off and publicised , " he said .
People who use weight training to ease their lower back pain are better off than those who choose other forms of exercise such as jogging , according to a University of Alberta study .
The study , done in conjunction with the University of Regina , showed a 60 per cent improvement in pain and function levels for people with chronic backache who took part in a 16 - week exercise program of resistance training using dumbbells , barbells and other load - bearing exercise equipment .
In contrast , people who chose aerobic training such as jogging , walking on a treadmill or using an elliptical machine to ease their back pain only experienced a 12 per cent improvement , said Robert Kell , an assistant professor of exercise physiology at the University of Alberta , Augustana Campus .
The resistance - training group showed improvements in pain and function of about 60 per cent , while those who took aerobic training experienced only a 12 per cent improvement .
" Any activity that makes you feel better is something you should pursue , but the research indicates that we get better pain management results from resistance training . "
The extra benefits stem from using the whole - body approach required in resistance training , Kell believes .
" We tried to strengthen the entire body and by doing that , we decreased the fatigue people felt throughout the day .
They were better able to perform their activities of daily living . "
Aerobics training generally works just the lower body , he added .
Approximately 80 per cent of North Americans suffer from lower back pain at some point in their lifetimes , and for 85 per cent of them the pain is chronic .
Both types of training did provide other fitness benefits , such as lower body fat , the study showed .
The findings are to be published in early 2009 in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research .

A friend of my parents recently sent me a short article entitled “ The Shape of Lamp Shade Shadows ” by Kenneth E. Horst ( The Physics Teacher , Volume 39 , March 2001 ) .
In it , the author explains how a friend of his wondered if the shape created when light goes through a lampshade might be hyperbolic :
Disclaimer :
There ’s a much better photo in the article itself .
This one makes our living room look much browner than it actually is .
Also much cleaner .
Horst then collected data , analyzed it , and discovered that yes indeed , each curve was in the shape was a hyperbola !
In fact , if is the vertical distance from the center of the lightbulb to the circular opening on the top or bottom of the lampshade , and is the radius of the opening , and is the horizontal distance from the center of the lightbulb to the wall , then the equation of the hyperbola is :
( with a negative added for the bottom curve ) .
The top and bottom curves typically come from different hyperbolas , however , because while is the same in both cases , the top of the lampshade typically has a smaller radius than the bottom ; likewise , the bulb is usually closer to the top than the bottom .
In addition to the data evidence that it is a hyperbola , there ’s a geometric reason : the light that leaves the top ( and bottom ) can be thought of as a cone with vertex in the center of the light bulb , and the wall acts as a vertical cross section :
With this in mind , it might be possible to create the other conic sections by tipping the lampshade ( or moving the entire lamp ) so that the wall is in different positions relative to the cone of light .
I ’m also tempted to build a lampshade that has completely vertical sides with the lightbulb right in the center , so that the top and bottom curves are both part of the same hyperbola .
Thanks to Ted Foster for sending me this article !

Weâve been indiscriminately beaming everything from telephone calls to commercials deep into outer space for more than a century , but itâs only recently that weâve started to actively exploit that targeted demographic : Theoretical aliens .
Well , that 's all changed now that the new remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still was broadcast directly to Alpha Centauri last week in celebration of its Earthly release date .
Â
Now , while it's true that the inherent consumerism - run - amok vibe given off by this action - harnessing billions of dollars worth of NASA technology just for a simple PR stunt â speaks of such a pure , unabashed greed that it would shame even the bastard lovechild of Gordon Gekko and the Grinch ( probably conceived on the night Scrooge McDuck paid them to fuck on camera for his budding amateur porn site ifuckforpennies.com ) thatâs not the central issue here .
The real problems are far more distressing than mere Duck Tales pornography :
â Just put it in a little bit .
See how it feels .
Just the tipâ¦â 
Namely ( assuming that the remake is anything like the original ) the central message of this film is that our species is such an epic fuck - up , that the only motivation strong enough to force a change in our ways is having a hostile alien force descend from the heavens and burn our children until we learn to love each other ( I guess in the new one the lesson is recycling or something ?
I havenât actually seen it because I just donât hate ten dollar bills that much . )
So if weâre trying to establish contact , shouldnât we be beaming something a little more optimistic ?
Independence Day , Aliens , hell even Predator would be a better choice ; at least we fucking win in those !
And thatâs because the primary theme all these movies have in common is the idea that , yes , you may be more advanced than us , aliens , but our plucky can - do attitude actually deflects laser beams , turns the hearts of heartless robots and charms photon torpedoes so completely that they will choose not to explode on impact , but rather to pen a series of rhyming couplets about how our everlasting beauty is like the morning fog .
Whereas
The Day The Earth Stood Still conveys the idea that , though our kindly human nature does ultimately convince the aliens against complete annihilation , the near - total genocide really teaches us a valuable lesson .
Itâs like broadcasting an After School Special where the protagonist learns not to make fun of fat kidsâ ¦ because a chubby girl eats their entire family in retaliation .
Effective ?
Incredibly .
Iâm just saying that maybe itâs not a method of teaching you want to actively advertise ... when youâre the one getting eaten .
“ In one of the most evil offers ever laid on any table , ” said Elizabeth Fairview in Bodog Beat , porn company Vivid Entertainment is offering “ financially strapped ” Nadya Suleman — who just gave birth to octuplets and is now the mother of 14 — “ a $ 1 million payout as well as health and dental care for all of her kids in exchange for a starring role in a porno . ”
" What 's wrong with this country ? " said Raging Tantrum .
Suleman and her 14 children will " have a hard enough life " without having to bear unnecessary insults like this .
Yes , these kids need proper health care , but even a pornographer should be ashamed to offer it in such a " disgusting " way .
Look , said Gina Serpe in E !
Online , “ Octomom needs money , ” and “ the world needs porn . ”
Sure , the offer is “ clearly not in the best of taste , ” but it “ could n't have come at a better time ” :
Apparently , the hospital wo n’t release Suleman ’s octuplets “ until she has proven she can provide them with adequate care and living arrangements , ” and she ’s at risk of being evicted from her home for falling behind on her mortgage payments .
Nadya Suleman certainly is “ pregnant with possibility , ” said Michael Musto in The Village Voice .
But she has n’t even responded to Vivid 's offer yet , and there ’s a good chance she wo n’t do it :
Let ’s not forget that Suleman “ popped out eight implanted embryos ” — having sex does n’t seem to be high up on her list of priorities .
The Past
The Present
The Future ?
Make sure all of Drupal 's tpl. php template files contain usable , standards - compliant markup .
This came a long way in Drupal 6 , but there are still a couple of rough edges .
Content - first ordering in the default page.tpl , for example , would be great .
Include a layout.css file in Drupal 's System module that does nothing but position the header , sidebars , and content correctly .
Overriding these core CSS files is easy ; just add a CSS file with the same name into your theme .
For newcomers , though , it would help clarify how the default template files work in a minimalist layout .
Provide a core theme that is nothing but an .info file .
With default markup and a layout.css file provided by core , this theme would serve as an example of what " stripped down Drupal " gives a designer to work with .
Provide one or two core themes that are only CSS and images decorating the standard markup .
This has been done in contrib for Drupal 6 ( See dvessel 's Skyliner theme ) , but very few realize it 's possible .
If we discover that Drupal 's default markup is n't flexible or clean enough to theme with pure CSS , we should fix it .
Provide a theme that adds one or two additional content regions to implement the newsier appearance that 's common in Joomla ! and advanced Wordpress themes .
This theme should also override one or two of the less common templates from a core Drupal module : user-profile.tpl.php is one possibility , as few realize it can be tweaked so easily .
Provide a theme that uses template .
php code overrides and / or jQuery to implement exotic functionality .
This does n't have to be insane ; it could be as simple as turning one region into a slide - out panel using jQuery , adding daytime and nighttime CSS , or adding extra " template suggestions " so comments by the author of a post show up differently .
The important part is to point people in the direction of advanced techniques .
README. txt files inside each of these themes ' directories should explain what they do and how .
( Regions are added by putting a line of text in a theme 's info file , module templates are overridden by copying a tpl. php file into the theme 's directory and editing , etc . )
Can it be done ?
First , a disclaimer .
It 's been a long , long time since I 've done real design work for the web .
( One of my earliest sites is still standing , a monument to the days of hand - optimized GIFs and table - based layouts ... )
I 'm not a CSS guru , and I tend to get frustrated quickly when I leave the world of code and muddle into the cobwebbed design parts of my brain .
I do my share of converting existing themes and CSS / HTML templates to Drupal , though , and I chat with enough Joomla ! , Wordpress , Movable Type , and ExpressionEngine folks to have a few thoughts on what 's up in Drupal Theme Land .
Drupal has long had a reputation for baffling designers , and for years it was deserved .
First , Drupal 's approach to generating an HTML page is a bit different than the standard Wordpress / Movable Type approach .
Rather than asking the CMS for a piece of data and doing things with it , a Drupal theme is handed small pre-rendered chunks of text ( like a title , an author 's name , etc. ) and is responsible for ' wrapping ' them in the appropriate HTML markup .
It 's a subtle difference , but it requires a shift in thinking .
In addition , making a custom theme for Drupal that deviated from the normal markup in a significant way used to require nontrivial PHP skills .
While the big pieces ( like the page - level markup and individual pieces of content ) could be tweaked using editable template files , overriding smaller bits like navigation menus and the details of a post 's attribution line required wading into the depths of Drupal 's theming APIs and writing code .
If you remember the days of the _phptemplate_variables ( ) function , you know what I 'm talking about .
In addition , changing markup created by third - party modules required digging through the source code , finding where they generated their HTML , and implementing your own override functions in PHP .
It worked , and it did n't require hacking third - party code , but it was hell for folks whose comfort zone was pure HTML and CSS .
Thanks to some awesome work in Drupal 6 , a lot of those hassles are in the past .
More markup now lives in editable template files instead of PHP functions , and third - party modules can expose their own markup as editable template files .
Developers on large projects coordinating with designers can use hardcore PHP code to finesse data before it makes it to the template files , but the templates still say clean and easy to edit .
It 's also possible to build " pure " CSS themes that rely on Drupal 's default markup .
The down side , though , is that not many people outside of the Drupal development community know about these changes .
The information is there in Drupal 5 to 6 changelogs , and there are bits and pieces of knowledge scattered in blog posts and articles .
The little - known but information - rich Drupal 6 theming guide also helps .
However , the fundamental shift in Drupal design that took place has n't resulted in an new wave of non-programmers designing for Drupal .
Some of that is inertia -- it 's " well known " that Drupal is hard for designers , the same way that it 's " well known " that it 's impossible to make accessible Joomla !
themes .
( Both have been true in the past , but that 's changed -- witness Beez . )
Part of the problem is also cultural .
Drupal requires that designers learn to use CVS for version control before contributing their work back to the community .
Addons and themes the live outside of the Drupal.org downloads section tend to languish in obscurity , like books that can't be found on Amazon.com .
The biggest issue , though ( at least in my opinion ) is the lack of good theming examples in the Drupal core download .
Developers looking to learn best practices can pop open any core module , poking around to see how things are done .
While few are perfect , they demonstrate lots of useful techniques and can be used as starting points for almost any project .
Drupal 's bundled themes fail on that count , in a big way .
The default Garland theme , while attractive and customizable via the admin interface , is notoriously confusing for newcomers to use as a starting point in their own custom designs .
Older themes , like Bluemarine and Pushbutton , are holdovers from the days of tabled layout and 2004 era design .
None of the core themes demonstrate the capabilities in Drupal 6 : CSS - only themes that use the ' default ' markup , easy creation of new content regions without custom code , and the use of template files to override lesser known HTML like the poll module 's graph of survey results .
When Lullabot teaches its workshops on Drupal theming , we 've found that taking people through those steps is one of the best recipes for success .
Start with nothing but an .info file , to define a theme that uses the default markup and no CSS .
Start adding your own CSS files and images to customize the layout , and then begin pulling over templates like page .tpl.php when you find that the markup needs tweaking .
Eventually , we can lead them through the complexities of template .
php code overrides , but this progression makes for an actual learning curve rather than a wall that needs scaling .
Drupal 7 is still under development , and a lot of energy is crackling around how to improve the bundled themes that come with it .
Several people have proposed using a grid system like 960 to enable rapid theme development .
While I 'd love to see some cutting - edge CSS coolness make it into core , I think that we need to ensure that the basics are there , too .
What would I love to see included in Drupal 7 ?
This is a big set of wishes : it implies at least two completely new themes for core , with specific requirements .
If we were to hit those goals , though , I think we'd have a much better collection of examples to point designers to when they learn the Drupal ropes .
In addition , designers exploring a new Drupal install for clues would have something to go on before they start posting confused questions on the support forums .
So , what do you think , fellow Drupal developers ?
Can we make this happen ?
Even more important ... should we ?
Detroit
The North American International Auto
Show usually gives this downtrodden city an annual chance to celebrate with glitzy parties and celebrity sightings .
But with two of the three U.S. auto makers on financial life - support from Washington , 2009 's show is shaping up to be a scaled - back affair .
The show , which opens to the media Jan. 11 , comes amid further signs of gloom in what already ranks among America 's most depressed cities .
Cultural institutions are cutting back .
Charities are facing bleak times as big backers including Detroit 's car manufacturers become pinched for cash .
Detroit 's struggling local newspapers plan to stop home - delivery soon on most days of the week .
But perhaps the most visible sign of drearier times will come in January at the car show .
Carpenters and caterers are feeling the brunt as manufacturers scale back exhibits and parties .
The show 's economic impact on Detroit will be about $ 350 million -- some $ 100 million less than 2008 's show , predicted David Sowerby , portfolio manager and market analyst for Loomis , Sayles & Co. , an investment - management firm .
We all love modified Mustangs and GeigerCars.de offer an exclusive tuning package for the new Ford Mustang .
GT 520 modified by GeigerCars delivers 520 HP , reaches a top speed of 287 km/h , it has a new racing inspired body styling painted with hot orange and an exclusive interior with 10,000 watt sound system .
The car tuner reworked this Ford ’s engine and after they increased the displacement from 4.6L to 5.2L , installed sport camshafts and reinforced the valvetrain this ride sounds like a rebord sports car legend .
The new belt driven supercharger with a big intercooler and the fully stainless steel high performance exhaust system also contribute to the great driving sensation .
The aerodynamic body kit designed by GeigerCars.de could fit both styles of the current Mustang , convertible and coupe .
The front fascia was designed to be easily exchanged with the production bumper and the large oval air dam ensures efficient cooling when this ride gets too hot .
The lateral openings were shaped to optimize the air flow and the integrated front spoiler reduces lift on the front axle .
The rear part of this Mustang is also designed as a replacement part and with an adjustable wing it produces a lot more downforce on the rear axle than the stock Mustang ..
The spectacular appearance was further enhanced by installing multi piece 20 ″ chrome wheels equipped with 255/35 ZR20 tires in front and 285/30 ZR20 on the rear axle .
This extreme tire and wheel combination was specially matched with a height adjustable suspension which lower the car and lend to more agile handling .
The interior of this ride is a lot different than the one from a stock Mustang .
GeigerCars equipped their Ford with fully black leather interior with highly contured sport seats and a multimedia sound system from JBL that was custom tailored accoustically and visually to the interior of this Mustang .
The sound system is controlled by a head unit and sound processor from Alpine which allows the driver to shape the sound according to his or her personal taste .
With a total of four JBL amps , types Px300.4 , Px600.2 and A6000GTI this sound system has over 10,000 watts of power .
The guys from Geiger had to install a bigger alternator and five Optima yellow top batteries to ensure the stereo system ’s health even at full volume .
The car has a real 5.1 surround system with top shelf hardware from JBL with speakers located on the dashboard , in the doors and in the trunk , two W15GTI subwoofers and three C508GTI , two GTO804 and one C608 loudspeaker systems that guarantee incredible listening pleasure .
The GeigerCars GT 520 was a lot of time used as a show car at many exhibitions around the globe but now anyone could buy individual components of this vehicle for various Ford models .
ALBANY – Gov. Paterson , defying the liberal wing of his Democratic Party , has chosen little - known , NRA - backed , upstate Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as New York ’s junior senator , it was learned last night .
The surprising – and , for many Democrats shocking – decision to pick the conservative Gillibrand , 42 , from Hudson in Columbia County , was disclosed by the governor in calls to party officials and some members of the state ’s congressional delegation , many of whom said they were unhappy with the selection , sources said .

Gillibrand , a mother of two occasionally resented by colleagues for being an aggressive self - promoter , was strongly backed for the post by Charles Schumer , the state ’s senior senator , who said a woman and an upstater was needed on next year ’s ticket .
Paterson ’s decision – to be officially announced today at noon at the state Capitol – was made just 24 hours after Caroline Kennedy took herself out of the running .
The decision was a major rebuff to some of the state ’s best - known Democrats interested in Clinton ’s seat , including Attorney General and former federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo , for whom Gillibrand once worked as a junior lawyer ; Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi , and Reps. Carolyn Maloney of Manhattan and Steve Israel of Suffolk County .
Sources said “ at least five ” members of the state ’s Democratic congressional delegation called Paterson to protest the possibility of Gillibrand ’s selection .
One , Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of Nassau County , even threatened a primary challenge .
Gillibrand faces a special election in 2010 .
Democratic activists predicted that Cuomo , son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo , would also “ seriously consider ” challenging Paterson in a primary next year .
Calls were made from Paterson ’s office to leading Democrats and Republicans throughout the afternoon , inviting them to a special meeting room attached to the Capitol for “ a major announcement . ”
The inclusion of several prominent Republicans among the invitees was an early sign to insiders that Paterson planned to pick an upstate Democrat .
Gillibrand has won two successive elections in one of the heaviest GOP districts in the state , first upsetting incumbent Rep. John Sweeney and , in November , defeating former state GOP chairman and multimillionaire Alexander Treadwell , in one of the most expensive races in the nation .
Liberal Democrats have been wary of her because she ran for re-election with the backing of the National Rifle Association , opposed the federal TARP program to rescue banks , and has been less than enthusiastic about gay marriage .

What happened
Pakistani soldiers raided a camp used by Lashkar - e - Taiba — the group India blames for the deadly Mumbai massacre — and arrested a man they said was one of the masterminds of the terrorist attacks .
( CNN ) American intelligence officials say the group has thrived during a crackdown on other militias thanks to help from Pakistan ’s main spy service .
( The New York Times )
What the columnists said
Destroying Lashkar ’s training camps wo n’t rid Pakistan of terrorists , said Fareed Zakaria in Newsweek .
They are “ symptoms , not the sources of the rot . ”
Until the Pakistani government roots out terrorist sympathizers from its intelligence service and military — which India believes were involved in the Mumbai attacks — Pakistan will never be trusted by its neighbors .
The terrorists have another key group of enablers — the media , said Gregory Rodriquez in the Los Angeles Times .
The murderers in Mumbai monitored “ their three - day killing spree on their BlackBerrys , ” a clear sign that all the attention fed their dreams of martyrdom .
We can really strike a blow against terrorism if , during the next attack , we “ summon the courage to look away . ”
Do n’t underestimate the hatred seething within Lashkar - e - Taiba , said Patrick French in The New York Times .
Its leader , Hafiz Saeed , counts among his “ bugbears ” Hindus , Shiites , and women who wear bikinis . ”
Saeed “ has an explicit political desire to create a state of war between the religious communities in India and beyond , and bring on the endgame ” in his fight with all the enemies of Islamist extremism .

London V2 Rocket Sites ...
Mapped
Please note : this map , first created in 2009 , has now been superseded by this excellent alternative , plotted using official data of all V2 strikes .
We will no longer make updates to the map below .
Thank you to everybody who contributed .
The comments section contains many important eye - witness accounts , which will be maintained for future historians .
Autumn 1944 , and London was under attack from space .
Hitler 's ' vengeance ' rocket , the V - 2 , was the world 's first ballistic missile , and the first man-made object to make a sub-orbital spaceflight .
Over 1400 were launched at Britain , with more than 500 striking London .
Each hit caused devastation .
The 13 tonne rocket impacted at over 3000 miles per hour .
There was no warning ; the missile descended faster than the speed of sound and survivors would only hear the approach and sonic booms after the blast .
Left : Occasionally , craters are still visible , as here on Leyton Marsh .
Right : Often , whole blocks were obliterated , as can still be seen in this aerial image of Brockley .
It took half a year for Allied forces to neutralise the threat .
In that time , some 9000 Londoners lost their lives to the V - 2 .
As with the Blitz , South and East London took the brunt of the onslaught , with Woolwich , Ilford , Barking , Greenwich and West Ham each receiving over 20 hits .
Some did make it into the central areas , however .
V - 2 explosions devastated Selfridges , Speakers ' Corner and Holborn .
That isolated Caffe Nero near the mural on Tottenham Court Road stands on the still - undeveloped site of a blast that killed nine .
More seriously , 110 people were slaughtered at Farringdon when a rocket hit a packed market building on 8 March 1945 .
The worst death toll of all came on 25 November 1944 , when 168 people lost their lives after a direct hit on Woolworths in New Cross .
These famous tragedies are well documented , but over 500 rocket strikes , many with significant death toll , remain obscure .
We 've mapped out some of the impact sites above , with more to follow when we can access further information .
Make sure you zoom in and check satellite view .
Commonly , an area hit by a V - 2 is now covered with a car park or 1960s housing estate .
These areas are usually devoid of mature trees , and still stand out over 60 years on .
Notes on data sources
Records for the area then - governed by the London County Council ( LCC ) can be found in most libraries , and were recently published in one volume .
Further out , we 've used various web sites , books and eye - witness accounts to plot additional impacts .
Least information is available for those eastern boroughs mentioned above that were most badly hit .
If you have any information about V - 2 strikes in these ( or other ) areas , let us know in the comments .
All comments that we can cross-reference with other sources will be added to the map .
Those which sound accurate but are uncorroborated will be added with a question - mark pin .
Each of us has our own set of strengths and weaknesses but we never take the time to figure out what they are .
Even if you did would you know what to do with the information ?
You ’ve probably heard that you need to identify weaknesses so you can fix them .
After all , if you ’re already strong in an area there ’s no need to hone that skill , right ?
You should focus on your weaknesses so people do n’t point and laugh at you when you try to …do whatever it is you ’re weak at .
Right ?
That ’s what most people think , but I ’ve found this approach to be a recipe for mediocrity .
Becoming World Class
People who become world class at something begin with a strength in that area .
Tiger Woods had some kind of pre-disposition to be a decent golfer .
Paul McCartney had some kind of innate musical talent before he picked up a guitar , Yo - Yo Ma was likely a tiny bit better playing stringed instruments than his classmates , and Albert Einstein had something unique about his brain chemistry before he ever thought about the cosmos .
But these strengths take time to develop .
To become world - class ( or to take it one step beyond and re-define that term in your field ) you have to invest thousands of hours of focused practice into that strength .
This is known in psychology as the ten thousand hour rule , and Malcolm Gladwell ruined it for the rest of us by beating this idea to death in his book Outliers .
But the idea is that you need something on the order of 10,000 hours of focused practice to master something like the cello , golf , songwriting , or theoretical physics .
Becoming Mediocre
Perhaps Paul McCartney is particularly deficient in the skills needed to properly operate a motor vehicle .
I do n’t know this to be true , let ’s just suppose for the sake of argument .
Suppose that when Sir Paul was young that instead of spending hour upon hour playing music that he had instead focused on learning the skills necessary to drive a car .
He practiced steering , using the gas pedal , shifting , etc … all with the hope of becoming a Formula One driver .
He would have become a better driver , but it ’s almost certain that he would never have become world class at an activity where he has a particular weakness .
Instead of becoming one of the best known singer / songwriters of all time he would have become a second rate driver .
By focusing on something where he already had an innate strength ( or innate passion ) he was able to become one of the best of all time .
And the same story can be applied to Woods , Einstein , and Yo - Yo Ma .
Football vs. Track
One more example and then I ’ll get back to talking about software and entrepreneurship .
In high school I played football because that ’s what the popular kids did , but I was n’t well suited for it .
I worked my butt of at becoming a good football player .
Every Saturday my dad would take me and my brother down to a park to run routes , practice diving , do speed drills … things that none of my teammates were doing on the weekends .
And I got better .
But I was never , and could never have been , great .
The skills required for football were particularly lacking in me , and although I was able to improve through literally hundreds of hours of practice , I was never as good as the best receivers in the league .
The track was another story .
With my height I was well - suited for the long hurdles and winning races became almost second nature .
I worked at it , but the improvements were dramatic as I invested time into running .
I excelled at it from the start and ended up setting a school record , winning the league , and going to the state championships .
A far cry from my mediocre performance on the gridiron .
I ’ve always wondered how much better I could have been on the track had I never played football , and instead invested that time into becoming a better runner .
Now Back to Software
Let ’s translate this to being a software developer / entrepreneur .
Most people have no idea about their strengths and weaknesses .
So that ’s the first step – learning what they are .
And secondly , when most people find out they have a weakness they want to improve it .
“ Oh my gosh , I ’m a terrible public speaker … I need to become better at it ! ”
But this is the polar opposite , 180 degrees off , wrong way to approach it .
Instead , figure out your strengths and re-configure your career to amplify and build on them .
Avoid any position that requires a lot of public speaking , but instead take that job ( or start your own company ) where you do a lot of solo coding ( if that ’s what you ’re good at ) .
Some people excel at not needing social interaction and being extremely productive on their own .
After struggling for years , wondering why I was unhappy at most of my jobs I came to realize that they were pushing me to improve upon my weaknesses .
After a few years of introspection I decided to change my career path and became a Micropreneur .
Micropreneurship fits well with my strengths and has lead to more career happiness than I ’ve experienced in years .
Now Back to You
Most people , and developers in particular , are unhappy with their jobs .
And I conjecture that much of that is because you ’re doing something that requires you to utilize one or more weaknesses , and at the same time not taking advantage of your strengths .
If you ’re not a good public speaker and you do n’t enjoy it , do n’t take a position in management where you have to present to executives every month .
If you ’re not a good writer and do n’t enjoy it , do n’t start a blog .
It ’s not only more productive to capitalize on your strengths , it ’s way more fun .
You ’re good at it from the start ; better than most , in fact .
So you will experience a lot of victory in that area .
This will mean the activity will be enjoyable from the start .
So what can you do ?
Spend $ 13 to buy Strengths Finder 2.0 ( or any other book that helps you find your strengths – this one is n’t magic ; it just happens to be the one I ’ve used ) .
For a more fact - based justification of this entire approach read the pre-cursor to Strengths Finder called Now , Discover Your Strengths .
Take the test and figure out your strengths .
Consider making a change in your career path .
It may mean you need to change jobs .
You may need to do something rash like start a startup or start building apps on the side and become a Micropreneur .
Or you may be amazingly lucky and your current situation is already making you extremely happy ( and ask yourself if it ’s because it ’s amplifying your strengths so you know how to find this optimal situation in the future should things change ) .
But whatever you do , do n’t focus on improving a weakness .
I ’ve been there .
It does n’t end well .

The anniversary of that tragic day in November 1963 will be marked by quiet memorials by those that remember that fateful and fatal trip to Dallas by President John F. Kennedy .
The Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald , with some difficult ballistics and a controversial " magic " bullet , acted alone to take the life of the President .
Robert F. Kennedy , the Attorney General and President Kennedy 's younger brother , never did believe the Warren Commission despite his public refusal to contradict the official version of events .
The younger Kennedy began his own investigation the day of the murder convinced that members of the U.S. government were responsible for the shooting in Dallas .
Author David Talbot perhaps sums it up best in his book Brothers .
" Robert Kennedy did not resign himself to the lone gunman theory .
On the contrary , he immediately suspected that President Kennedy was the victim of a powerful conspiracy .
And he spent the rest of his life secretly searching for the truth about his brother 's murder . "
The Attorney General had been informed of the shooting by J. Edgar Hoover , director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Hoover had no love for either Kennedy and abruptly delivered news of the shooting .
Later , Robert would tell Nicolas Katzenbach that Hoover seemed to enjoy being the bearer of bad tidings .
" I think he told me with pleasure . "
Kennedy so little trusted Hoover he declined FBI protection for his family .
Uncertain if a conspiracy included members of the Secret Service , Robert pieced together his own security detail out of the U. S. Marshal Service in those early awful hours after the assassination .
With Kennedy when Hoover made a second call about the death announcement from Parkland Hospital was John McCone , director of the Central Intelligence Agency .
McCone called Kennedy when he heard the news of the shooting and Kennedy ordered him over to his house .
Kennedy grilled McCone for three hours that afternoon about whether or not the CIA had a role in the killing .
Fresh from intense behind - the - scene battles with the Cuban exile community and counter - intelligence CIA agents angry with both Kennedys over the failed Bay of Pigs invasion , Robert know that lethal tempers raged .
Kennedy told his close friend Edwin Guthman , " There is so much bitterness I thought they would get one of us , but Jack , after all he had been through never worried about it .
I thought they would get me , instead of the President . "
On the evening of November 22nd Kennedy would reach out to investigators he knew familiar with organized crime to explore if the Mafia was involved .
The CIA had joined forces with members of organized crime in their clandestine efforts to kill Fidel Castro and Robert wanted answers .
Kennedy made call after call with his network of advisors , investigators and friends seeking information .
Kennedy continued to make calls while he waited for the return of his brother 's body from Dallas .
Robert probed the Cuban exile community telling Enrique " Harry " Ruiz - Williams , " One of your guys did it . "
When the Kennedy family gathered for Thanksgiving at their Palm Beach compound and the family struggled to regain control of emotions , Robert cordoned himself with his investigators and advisors and continued working on solving the crime .
Robert Kennedy would dispatch his own investigator to Moscow for a secret meeting with the Soviets before the year was out to find out what their intelligence agencies knew .
Kennedy refused to appear before the Warren Commission .
When Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren moved toward compelling Robert 's appearance , Nicolas Katzenbach worked out a compromise , which became Kennedy 's official statement on the inquiry .
" I would like to state definitely that I know of no credible evidence to support the allegations that the assassination of President Kennedy was caused by a domestic or foreign conspiracy . "
In September 1964 , when the Warren Commission issued its single - assassin report Kennedy , then campaigning for the U.S. Senate in New York , was pressed for his opinion of the Commission conclusions .
Kennedy adopted a terse statement that became a standard response to end questions , " I have not read the report , nor do I intend to . "
But Kennedy 's relentless pursuit of the truth behind his brother 's death , which he privately blamed on a conspiracy within the secret branches of the U.S. government , was an inner driving force .

Did Humans Evolve From Monkeys ?
Humans are ( distantly ) descended from a fish that was able to escape some of it ’s competition and predation by escaping the water .
By coming out of the water it got more food and was able to escape all the bigger fish .
Over time certain species of fish were just better made for escaping to land so they passed on their traits and little by little these traits became more pronounced and they became an entirely separate species , amphibians .
Meanwhile , back in the water , there were many other species of fish who survive particularly well right where they are , either as top level predators , or because they feed on something that other fish do n’t feed upon , or they swim faster , or they have a swim bladder , or whatever .
So , now you have all these fish ( still ) and you also have land walking animals .
Everything is just capable of surviving in its own environment .
In the same way , we share common ancestors with monkeys , but monkeys are still suited for their own environment .
I mean , we ca n’t survive swinging from the tops of trees – our limbs are not strong enough , our weight is too great , and our visual cortex is not geared for mapping that environment the ways monkeys do it .
So basically , that question is a good one , but it makes a very basic mistake in understanding just how evolution works .
Do n’t you find it pretty scary that our ancestors were fishes before they turned into monkeys ?

Prayers for Bobby : Blurring out the most painful aspects
By Jordan Mattos
21 January 2009
Directed by Russell Mulcahy , teleplay by Katie Ford , based on a book by Leroy Aarons
Premieres January 24 , 2009 , on The Lifetime Network
Prayers for Bobby
In Russell Mulcahy 's Prayers for Bobby , Sigourney Weaver plays Mary Griffiths , a middle - aged factory worker living in a middle - class California suburb with her husband and four children .
It is the late 1970s , and nothing seems out of the ordinary in a life of touch football , anti-gay jokes and gospel radio .
A loving family , the Griffithses are also devoted Christians who do not blink an eye when grandma announces in casual conversation that " fags should all be lined up and shot . "
Meanwhile , Bobby , a teenager ( born in 1963 ) , is struggling with depression .
When Mary learns that her son is homosexual , the world as she knows it is shattered .
Humiliating attempts at " converting " Bobby to heterosexual life have disastrous results .
In the summer of 1983 , barely 20 years old , he drops off a bridge into oncoming traffic .
Six months after her son's suicide , a devastated Mary begins a journey that transforms her into a prominent gay rights activist in the 1980s and 1990s .
The film is based on the book of the same name , written by Leroy Aarons , a California journalist and playwright .
Born in 1933 , Aarons was one of the first openly gay journalists in the American media , eventually founding the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association in 1990 .
He first came in contact with Bobby Griffiths 's story through a newspaper article about the suicide , and reached out to Mary in hopes of understanding her transformation from Bible literalist to PFLAG activist ( the association of Parents , Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays ) .
The book is the closest we come to understanding the processes involved in young Bobby 's suicide .
It contains difficult passages from his personal diary where one feels the self - hatred , loneliness and confusion first - hand .
Aarons demonstrates the contradictory signals Bobby received , as the gay rights movement flourished just across the bay in San Francisco and Harvey Milk was elected the first openly gay public official in a major city while his mother preached a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible at home .
Bobby was an ultrasensitive young man with a paper - thin ego living in a mystical world of " evil forces . "
He had lively friendships with many gay and lesbians his age , and had a guilt - ridden but active sex life .
He also worked as a prostitute , sharing the earnings with his unsuspecting mother , and expressed hatred for himself and others at the drop of a hat .
Aarons 's book also recounts the frustrations Mary felt , not just as a God- fearing mother of a homosexual son , but as a daughter seeking the approval of a distant and abusive mother , a wife terrified of her husband 's infidelity and , finally , as an abuser of pharmaceutical drugs .
Aarons 's Prayers paints a portrait of a loving family broken up not by a single nagging prejudice , but a combination of social forces and circumstances that are at work in many middle - class American families .
The filmed version of the Griffiths story , on the other hand , ignores the details and complexities of this life .
Born in 1953 in Melbourne , Australia , Russell Mulcahy 's most recent directing credits include Zen in the Art of Slaying Vampires ( 2008 ) , The Scorpion King 2 : Rise of a Warrior ( 2008 ) , Resident Evil : Extinction ( 2007 ) and The Curse of King Tut 's Tomb ( 2006 ) .
After 20 years of directing music videos ( Mulcahy 's was the first music video ever aired on MTV ) and straight - to - video product , Mulcahy directed four episodes of Queer as Folk , the US counterpart of a British soap opera focused on gay men .
Screenwriter Katie Ford has written the screenplays for Miss Congeniality ( 2000 ) , Miss Congeniality 2 : Armed & Fabulous ( 2005 ) , a TV remake of Little House on the Prairie ( 2005 ) and an episode of Desperate Housewives ( 2005 ) .
All in all , not all that promising , when what 's needed are individuals attuned to the profound discontents of modern American life .
Mulcahy and Ford 's history , this combined decision - making experience within Hollywood genre films each costing upwards of $ 40 million to manufacture , is relevant .
In Prayers for Bobby , every scene , camera angle and line of dialogue are informed by it .
Ford 's Mary is a " tough - cookie " type with a clean record .
Her troubled family history , paranoid fears about her marriage and bout with drug addiction are omitted .
No clues as to why she so tightly holds onto her beliefs and forces them on her children are given .
Bobby , whose often rage - fueled journal entries expressed the desire to " claw out the eyes " of family members and who longed for a man to hold him " more than anything in the world , " is irrevocably sanitized .
Shockingly , Ford goes as far as supplying Bobby with a cheerleader girl friend at the start , and a steady , picture - perfect boy friend as the film progresses .
Mulcahy 's broad directing generalizes everyone in sight .
A scene in a raucous gay bar is made less intimidating by blurring out the faces in the crowd .
Bobby 's exchanges with friends and family are limited to sitcom clichés and dialogue .
Weaver 's performance as Mary stands out , especially in moments when Mary realizes the monumental nature of her error .
In the film 's coda , Weaver delivers Mary 's speech to a room full of local churchgoers that hints at true loss .
But with the " polished " feel of Ford 's script and Mulcahy 's cinematic " choices , " it is an uphill battle for all the performers involved .
Given the pressures with which an artist must contend within the Hollywood environment — satisfying investors , advertisers , censors and the network — it is no surprise that Prayers is as compromised as it is .
But Mulcahy and Ford have not exactly put up a struggle .
Ford 's script is a 107 - page effort that scene by scene seeks to make tragedy , complexity and anguish too easily palatable for its audience .
That is the sort of contradiction a film attempting to " raise awareness " cannot afford to contain .
An easy - to - digest , " low - calorie " artistic rendering of such a subject , which purports to bring the various elements into focus while blurring out their most painful aspects , does no one much good .
This is the mechanism in place for Prayers for Bobby , and it is the result of many years of decline within the filmmaking model at large in Hollywood .
Despite the best intentions of the people involved with the project , the film is half - dead on arrival .

ITV and Channel 4 today announced they would screen an appeal to raise emergency funds for Gaza , as the BBC came under intense pressure from the government to reverse its decision not to transmit the appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee .
Around 5,000 people joined protests condemning the broadcaster across London today , including rallies outside the BBC's Broadcasting House headquarters and Trafalgar Sqaure , and an MP began collecting colleagues ' signatures for a motion to be tabled in parliament on Monday , condemning its refusal to broadcast the TV and radio appeal .
The BBC decision not to show the appeal was reached together with other broadcasters last week .
But ITV today said that " the majority " of networks had now agreed to broadcast the appeal .
An ITV spokesman said : " After careful consideration , and in consultation with other networks , a common consensus has been reached by the majority of broadcasters and as a result ITV will broadcast a DEC appeal . "
A spokesman for Channel 4 said : " Channel 4 will broadcast the DEC appeal for humanitarian aid for civilians caught up in the Gaza conflict .
We accept the DEC 's guidance on the urgent need for humanitarian aid and believe this need should take precedence over any considerations as to the causes of the suffering that necessitates it .
" We believe Channel 4's news coverage of the conflict in Gaza has at all times been appropriately impartial and we do not believe our impartiality will be compromised in the eyes of our audience by broadcasting this appeal .
We have informed other broadcasters of our decision . "
Channel Five also announced that it was joining ITV and Channel 4 in broadcasting the appeal .
A Five spokesman said : " Five feels this is an urgent humanitarian situation which transcends politics and has taken the decision to show the Gaza appeal . "
The BBC was not immediately able to say whether it was reconsidering its decision .
The communities secretary , Hazel Blears , said : " The BBC 's decision should not discourage the public from donating to this important appeal .
I sincerely hope the BBC will urgently review its decision . "
Douglas Alexander , the international development secretary , welcomed the decision by ITV and other networks .
Yesterday , he rebuked Britain 's broadcasters for refusing to air the appeal .
In a letter to the BBC , Sky and ITV , Alexander expressed his " disappointment " that the appeal would not be broadcast .
Today , the health minister Ben Bradshaw , a former BBC journalist , described the decision not to screen the appeal as " inexplicable " and dismissed the corporation 's explanation for its position as " completely feeble " .
The BBC refused to broadcast the humanitarian appeal on the grounds that it did not want to risk public confidence in its impartiality .
The decision meant other broadcasters also refused to air the appeal by the committee , the umbrella group for 13 aid charities .
A BBC spokesperson said : " The decision was made because of question marks about the delivery of aid in a volatile situation and also to avoid any risk of compromising public confidence in the BBC 's impartiality in the context of [ a ] news story . "
In his letter , Alexander said : " I write to express my disappointment at your decision not to support the Disasters & Emergency Committee ( DEC ) Gaza Crisis Appeal .
I met with DEC , along with other NGOs and charities , yesterday to discuss their and the British government 's humanitarian response .
" As you know , the support of broadcasters is highly effective and extremely valued by the group of charities and NGOs [ non- governmental organisations ] who provide humanitarian relief under the DEC umbrella . "
Alexander offered to mediate between the charities and the broadcasters .
" I understand from a statement issued to the press by the BBC that ' the decision was made because of question marks about the delivery of aid in a volatile situation ' .
" I stand ready to facilitate discussions with NGOs and charities to seek to address broadcasters ' concerns on this point .
The situation is developing on the ground and I understand that Oxfam , Save the Children and others have been able to get some aid into Gaza today . "
In his reply to Alexander , the BBC 's director general , Mark Thompson , said : " After consultation with senior news editors , we concluded that to broadcast a free - standing appeal , no matter how carefully couched , ran the risk of calling into question the public 's confidence in the BBC 's impartiality in its coverage of the story as a whole ...
" We will continue to broadcast news about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and , if appropriate , to cover the work of the UK NGOs on the ground .
We cannot , however , broadcast anything which we believe might compromise the impartiality of the BBC 's journalism . "
The former cabinet minister Tony Benn will today join a protest against the decision outside the BBC's Broadcasting House .
He used an interview on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme to broadcast an appeal himself , urging listeners to send gifts to PO Box 999 London EC3A 3AA , or donate via freepay account 1210 at the Post Office .
The Muslim Council of Britain ( MCB ) said it viewed the BBC 's decision to disallow an appeal by the DEC for Gaza as " a serious dereliction of its public duty " .
In a statement , the MCB said : " We urge the corporation 's governors to urgently reverse its decision which would severely jeopardise efforts to raise millions of pounds of voluntary contributions for emergency humanitarian assistance in Gaza .
" In sabotaging the DEC appeal broadcast , the BBC is clearly acting against the public interest .
As custodians of the public trust in the BBC its governors must act immediately to avoid the blame of being complicit in denying humanitarian aid to the desperate people of Gaza . "
The MCB secretary general , Dr Muhammad Abdul Bari , said : " The excuses given by the BBC are simply untenable and the governors need to act quickly before the corporation 's image is irretrievably tarnished .
" The need [ to ] reverse this decision is even more compelling as the BBC 's coverage of the carnage in Gaza was very tame and not reflective of the scale of the violations committed there . "
Few industries inspire more enmity than the record business .
It ’s been tainted since the birth of rock , with transgressions that include payola , greed , a reactionary aversion to technology and a plantation mentality toward its bread and butter -- the recording artists .
Thanks to the Internet and the MP3 revolution , karmic justice has finally been served :
The record industry has toppled like a house of cards .
To many , its collapse is less a crisis than a beautiful sunset .
Yet as Steve Knopper notes in “ Appetite for Self - Destruction : The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age , ” this was a business hellbent on destroying itself for at least 30 years .
Digital music was merely the final dagger in its heart .
Knopper , a Rolling Stone music business writer , thoughtfully reports on the record racket ’s slow , painful march into financial ruin and irrelevance , starting with the near - catastrophic sales slump that began in 1979 after the demise of disco .
Though the labels persevered , they finally lost control of their product when they chose to ignore the possibilities of the Internet .
Now , it ’s consumers and recording artists who have the power .
Musicians can create , produce and distribute their work without the indentured servitude of record labels .
That ’s great news for younger artists , but even geezers like the Eagles and Paul McCartney have taken advantage of the new technology .
McCartney distributes through Starbucks , and the Eagles sold its 2007 album , “ Long Road Out of Eden , ” exclusively through Wal - Mart -- how ’s that for a hippie dream ?
And Radiohead ’s 2007 “ In Rainbows ” was first issued as a download , for which customers could pay what they saw fit .
Meanwhile , fans can buy tracks through e-stores or “ share ” their collections through torrent or file - swap sites .
The record industry hates it , but that ’s the bed it made .
Rather than trying to monetize the new technology , the labels chose to fight it .
“ It became the moment the labels killed themselves , ” says Jeff Kwatinetz , chief executive of the talent management company the Firm .
When copyrighted content could no longer be controlled , the industry , long obsessed with piracy , spent tens of millions of dollars in court to destroy file - sharing promoters such as Napster .
By the time labels got around to authorizing the digital sale of content in 2003 -- to Steve Jobs and iTunes -- the deal turned out to be much more beneficial to Apple .
( As of April 2008 , iTunes had sold more than 4 billion songs around the world and was the top music retailer in the U.S. )
But this is just the most egregious mishap in a long history of foot - shooting .
Knopper piles on examples of incompetence , making a convincing case that the industry ’s collapse is a drawn - out suicide .
Through dozens of interviews , he recounts the business ’ ebb and flow from MTV to Michael Jackson ’s “ Thriller ” to the cash cow that was the CD .
“ That is the single thing that made the record industry roll in cash , ” says Howie Klein , who ran Reprise Records in the ‘ 80s and ‘90s .
Despite the new format ’s pristine digital sound and convenient size , label chiefs were wary .
Yet it was an instant success .
Music fans began buying their collections all over again .
In 1983 , the CD ’s first year on the market , sales jumped 625 % .
Still , " [ w ] hen Netscape went public in 1994 , ” Knopper writes , “ introducing the world wide web to the public and ushering in the internet boom , top executives at major labels were largely unmoved . ”
As the 20th century ended , teen popsters Backstreet Boys and ‘ N Sync were making millions .
Meanwhile , Napster was the hippest site on the Web .
“ Had the labels made a deal with Napster , ” Knopper notes , “ they would have found several immediate advantages : a built - in user base of 26.4 million people as of February 2001 . . . ; an efficient way of communicating with customers ; and the flexibility to set prices at a number of levels .
The sad fact was employees at major labels had spent years and years downplaying the internet as a marketing tool . ”
Now , the conventional music business model is all but DOA .
Sites such as YouTube , Facebook and MySpace are important hubs for music promotion , while artists earn big licensing money through Guitar Hero and telephone ring tones .
It ’s a brave new world , yet many in the industry still do n’t get it , thinking that a few big hits can cure all ills .
“ But continuing to build an entire business that relies on another ‘ Thriller ’ is simply not viable , ” Knopper writes .
“ Hits are getting smaller and smaller and they just do n’t have the healing power they had in 1982 . ”
The hits may be getting smaller , but as “ Appetite for Self - Destruction ” reveals , music is adaptable .
The record business ?
Not so much .
Himmelsbach is a Los Angeles writer and producer .
In 2009 the United States will see the worst economic collapse ever , the “ Greatest Depression , ” says Gerald Celente , U.S. trend forecaster .
Celente believes it ’s going to become very violent in the U.S. , and forecasts a tax revolt .
Russia Today video interview of Gerald Celente here .
“ We ’re going to see an economic collapse the likes of which the world has never seen before .
It ’s not only in the United States ; it ’s going global .
At the end of 2008 we saw Christmas retail sales : women ’s apparel down 23 % ; home furnishings and electronics off 27 % ; luxury items down 35 % .
These are Depression Era collapses .
We saw major bankruptcies , such as retailers Circuit City and Linens & Things ; one bankruptcy after another . ”
“ The question becomes who is going to take all of the vacant retail space ?
Who is going to rent it ?
The answer is – nobody .
Now we look at the financial collapse in 2008 , we saw the Merrill Lynch mob go under the bed and the Lehman boys went bankrupt .
You saw bond companies , brokerage firms , and banks go belly up .
Who is going to rent all the vacant commercial business space that they used to occupy ?
The answer is – nobody .
The commercial real estate collapse that ’s going to happen in 2009 is going to dwarf the residential real estate collapse . ”
“ RT : You use the Great Depression as an analogy , as a comparison .
During the Great Depression unemployment was 25 % .
Now it has increased , it ’s I think over 7.2 .
Is that number going to get much , much bigger ? ”
“ G.C. : We have to look at the real number .
There are two sets of books that the government keeps .
When they measure up unemployment they do n’t add in the people who are no longer looking for jobs because they have become discouraged since they cannot find employment after looking so long .
And they do n’t include part - time workers .
When you put that number into it , the number is 13.7 % .
And that ’s a government number .
And this is just beginning .
And again , current events form future trends . ”
“ What did we see ?
We saw in one day some 61,000 jobs evaporate off the map .
You ’re going to see Great Depression numbers .
Because , as I mentioned , with this commercial real estate collapse , all of these retail stores closing , like Starbucks and Macy ’s , you go down the line .
You look not only at people who work for these places that no longer have jobs , but how about all the supportive industries – the advertising , the manufacturers , the products .
They ’re going to be laying off people as well .
We ’re going to see Great Depression numbers .
In that effect , this is going to be worse than the Great Depression . ”
“ When I say it ’s going to be worse than the Great Depression , we call it the Greatest Depression .
By the way , to be using 1930s models to get the U.S. out of this is really stupid .
Back then when we first crashed most people did n’t have homes .
There was no such thing as home equity loan .
And back then , people did n’t have credit cards .
The consumer was n’t 14 trillion dollars in debt .
We had a manufacturing base that built the world out of the Great Depression following World War Two .
We no longer have that . ”
“ Now people are at the edge .
They ’re stressed out .
Look , the Americans are the most depressed nation on the world already .
They take more antidepressant drugs than anybody , plus the other kinds of drugs that they are taking .
You ’re going to see crime levels in America that are going to rival the third world .
Welcome Mexico City .
You ’re going to start seeing people being kidnapped in this country like they do in other underdeveloped nations .
So it ’s going to be very violent in America . ”
“ I have a saying : when people lose everything and they have nothing to lose , they lose it .
You ’re going to see people saying , off with their heads .
There ’s going to be another revolution in this country .
It ’s going to be a tax revolt .
We ’re going to start seeing a tax revolt in the United States .
People are one job away from losing everything .
We ’re seeing more and more closures , people are being laid off .
People are stretched to the limits .
And what do they do in New York State ?
Some 130 new taxes are being proposed , they ’re raising sales taxes .
There ’s going to be a tax revolt in this country from property taxes first and school taxes second .
That ’s what we ’re going to see start to happen . ”
“ People are hopeful that ( President Barack ) Obama will make a difference , they are desperate and they are fearful .
And they ’ll hang on to anything .
But let ’s look at the facts .
A man of change , who did he bring into Washington ?
Timothy Geithner … Larry Summers …
I never remember a newly elected president bringing in basically the national security team from the last administration which happens to be from another party .
Look at the crew .
Look who they are .
They ’re strike out artists , every one of them .
The only thing that they know how to do is not to get their fingernails dirty . ”
“ RT : Are you saying that Americans should not be listening to the officials who are saying the Stimulus Plans are going to make everything better ?
Is that the analogy ? ”
“ G.C. : Read my lips .
No new taxes .
I did n’t have sex with that woman , Monica Lewinski .
I smoked but I did n’t inhale .
Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al - Qaeda .
Why would anybody believe these people ? ”
“ RT : What about geopolitics , what trends are we going to see in terms of the relationships between the United States and the rest of the world ? ”
“ G.C. : Well the rest of the world is very hopeful , using the word ‘ hope ’ , with the Obama administration .
And again , we ’re going to have to see what transpires , but so far , and again , by their deeds you shall know them . ”
“ Obama , when he first started to run , he was going to be out of Iraq .
As soon as he became president he was going to start bringing soldiers home .
Now they wo n’t be out for 16 months and now their reports say they ’re going to bring upwards of 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan .
He was also talking about preventive strikes in Pakistan .
So it really does n’t look like it ’s going to be much of a smoothing of geopolitical relations . ”
“ The one factor we ’re looking at , at a time that could only be the worst time for it to happen , is what ’s going on in the Middle East , in the Israel - Gaza war .
Israel , as they said , they were trying to do as the reports have come out , if they attack Iran at any level , it will begin World War Three – because if this war spreads beyond Gaza , it ’s going to inflame the Middle East .
It can cause an oil crisis as we saw in 1973 , that ’s what ended the Arab - Israeli war when they embargoed oil going into the U.S.
That ’s our major concern .
We ’re also seeing , and we ’re going to wonder , if Obama continues with putting the so - called missile defense shield in Poland and in Czech Republic in Eastern Europe and if they keep pushing more and more into Georgia .
If that keeps happening we ’re going to see a reigniting of the Cold War . ”

No apostrophe either
WHEN more than 100,000 people paraded through Dublin on February 21st , it was the biggest march the Irish capital had seen since 1980 .
Then , binmen joined bankers in protest against Ireland 's high tax rates .
This time there was less social solidarity .
The marchers were mostly public - sector workers angry over a plan to cut their pay , via a 7 % pension levy .
They were also outraged by the behaviour of bankers , whom one union leader accused of economic treason .
The government has injected € 3.5 billion ( $ 4.5 billion ) into each of the country 's two largest banks , but this has not impressed markets .
Shares in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland have fallen sharply .
After the bursting of the property bubble , more than € 7 billion may be needed to cover bad loans to developers .
In January the government nationalised Anglo Irish Bank ( often seen as the builders ' bank ) , after its chairman , Sean Fitzpatrick , failed to disclose some € 83 m in personal loans .
This week anti-fraud police raided the bank to investigate alleged breaches of company law .
The prime minister , Brian Cowen , faces two crunches : the banks and the public finances .
So far , he has had little success in tackling either .
His government 's popularity ratings , and his own , have dived .
He is struggling to avoid nationalising the two biggest banks .
And his fiscal plan is in trouble .
It aims to keep the budget deficit below 10 % of GDP this year ( the highest in the European Union ) , and to achieve balance by 2013 , via spending cuts and tax rises worth 8 % of GDP .
Tough , yet most economists doubt it is enough .
The European Commission is sceptical .
The government 's proposals , it has said , lack detail and its growth assumptions are too optimistic .
This may force the government to try to trim the deficit sooner , this year and next , not later in its five - year plan .
That would mean raising taxes earlier than expected .
Mr Cowen had been hoping to delay that unpalatable medicine .
He faces European and local elections in June and , in the autumn , a second referendum on the EU 's Lisbon treaty , which recent polls suggest should be winnable .
The state now pays higher rates on its bonds than Greece .
With increasing talk of potential default on its sovereign debt , Ireland has become the weakest link in the euro .
Mr Cowen has little time left to turn things round .
For years , people have been asking , what is implied , and what delivered , in the handshake between pharmaceutical companies and the doctors who conduct their research , speak at their luncheons , or serve on their boards ?
Can physicians , even those with grand accomplishments , remain immune from the nagging pull of a gift relationship ?
Last week a controversy erupted with this issue the flash point .
Writing in Slate.com , authors Jeanne Lenzer and Shannon Brownlee accused the award - winning radio program , The Infinite Mind , of not disclosing that panelists on " Prozac Nation : Revisited , " accepted Eli Lilly consulting fees .
The subtitle , “ Are doctors shilling for drug companies on public radio ? ” was the billboard for their contention : “ Some experts who appear independent are , in fact , serving as stealth marketers for the drug and biotech industries , and reporters either do n't know about their sources ' conflicts of interests , or they fail to disclose them to the public . ”
The show included Dr. Andrew Leuchter , Director of the Laboratory of Brain , Behavior , and Pharmacology at UCLA , Dr. Nada Stotland , president of the American Psychiatric Association , and Peter Pitts , former FDA official .
Even Dr. Fred Goodwin , the show ’s distinguished anchor known for his gentle manner , soft - spoken questions , and his distinguished career including head of NIMH , came under fire for fiscal relationships .
Not so quick , responded producer Bill Lichtenstein .
In a letter sent to media watchdog Romanesko , Lichtenstein reacted as if pharma 's marketing practices were tolerable because they were ubiquitous .
Lichtenstein did apologize for not knowing that Pitts works for a public relations company whose clients include pharma .
But he vigorously defended his reporting practices , saying :
Pharmaceutical companies fund the lion 's share of research being conducted today .
There are strict ethical codes and laws governing the use of such funds .
Journalists covering this industry know that , and routinely disclose only those ties that are likely to raise serious questions about a researcher 's neutrality .
Lichtenstein , a respected journalist , did not pause to examine the merits of his critics .
Nor did he ponder whether he might have succumbed to the cultural norm assuming symbiosis between research and practitioners .
After he explained the firewall between his show 's content and its supporters , he turned the tables on Lenzer and Brownlee .
He asked if they were journalists scorned because their pitch for an on - air rebuttal was rejected .
His answer confirmed what critics fear .
Some aspects of medicine have become indistinguishable from the marketing interests of drug companies .
For more than a decade , people have been pointing to dummy foundations housed in academic centers , research findings manipulated or withheld from regulators or the public , sumptuous meals and generous honoraria offered to doctors , and the failures of medical education to erect barriers to pharma .
Melody Petersen 's new book , Our Daily Meds is one of the recent exposes documenting how the pharmaceutical industry stampedes interest by blitzing journals with ghost written articles under the names of prominent academics .
To promote Zoloft , a marketing plan included 85 different articles written in this fashion and targeted to different audiences .
A law - suit eventually uncovered them .
Had the guests on The Infinite Mind disclosed their connections to Eli Lilly , would it have mattered ?
As long as the relationship remains robust , and it certainly appeared to be that at last week ’s meeting of the American Psychiatric Association , does disclosure constitute more than a ritualized sanction of a porous wall between marketing and medicine ?
Business as usual
The APA convention in Washington , D.C. did not suffer for lack of disclosure .
In the official program panelists identified their competing interests , specifying how they received compensation and for what – speakers bureau , stock , grant or research support .
The number of participants without competing interests was five times those receiving honoraria .
But anybody who went to an industry - sponsored symposium dined on the message along with salad and salmon , while earning continuing medical education credits .
In this way , hundreds of practicing psychiatrists , residents and students , enjoyed their breakfasts , lunches and dinners .
Meanwhile they heard about research and treatment from people who fully disclosed their connection to the sponsors .
Two of the five speakers in AstraZeneca ’s dinner symposium about recovery in schizophrenia disclosed they were consultants or speakers for pharma .
Four of the participants in Sunday ’s lunch , with Bristol - Myers Squibb / Otsuka America Pharmaceuticals disclosed 28 different relationships with pharmaceutical companies , while addressing the pharmacological management of children and adolescents with autism , bipolar , early - onset schizophrenia and disruptive behavior disorders .
And a new malady pointing to a burgeoning revenue stream -- too much or too little arousal affecting sleep -- was discussed over two breakfast meetings with an educational grant from Takeda .
Only one of the four speakers claimed no competing interest .
Disclosure versus influence
Does the focus on disclosure divert attention from access , influence and bias ?
Conventional hiring practices discourage nepotism , professional athletes are barred from betting parlors , and judges recuse themselves when their experience could affect an outcome .
If it is understood that loyalties can affect judgment , it is hard to understand why some doctors consider themselves immune .
Or how those still in the midst of professional training acquire a healthy skepticism when exposed to as many as 70 drug company lunches in one year , as were the psychiatric residents in one Canadian program .
In the mid 1980s The New England Journal of Medicine initiated a policy requiring authors to disclose “ financial ties with companies that make the products under study . ”
In an editorial discussing the explosion of such relationships throughout medicine , former editor Dr. Marcia Angel described how difficult it was to find a psychiatrist without financial ties to companies making antidepressants to write an editorial about depression .
In another instance she described authors of an article whose financial connections to Bristol - Myers Squibb were so complex that the NEJM was forced to note , “ the large number of authors and their varied and extensive financial associations with relevant companies make a detailed listing here impractical . ”
They summarized the disclosures :
all but 1 . . . of the 12 principal authors have had financial associations with Bristol - Myers Squibb — which also sponsored the study — and , in most cases , with many other companies producing psychoactive pharmaceutical agents .
The associations include consultancies , receipt of research grants and honorariums , and participation on advisory boards .
Of the 17 other authors , 2 are employees of Bristol - Myers Squibb , 5 . . . have no relevant additional financial ties , and the others have a variety of associations similar to those just mentioned .
Everybody 's doin ' it
Dr. Adriane Fugh - Berman , director of PharmedOut.org , agrees that disclosure only skims the surface .
She calls for an end to pharmaceutical funding for all education ( medical school and continuing education conferences ) .
Her organization is joined by a handful of others , including the American Medical Students Association which produced a guide to “ pharma - free ” meetings .
No Free Lunch , also dedicated to ending pharma gifts , was easy to overlook on the margin of the APA exhibition gallery .
It was , however , located next to the food court where one could purchase hot dogs and soda .
It ’s unclear if this was deliberate or just ironical .
How does this affect what practitioners actually do when they treat patients or when they interpret data ?
Dr. Mark Zimmerman , director of outpatient psychiatry at Rhode Island Hospital , said last week that that diagnosing bipolar disorder in children might be “ reinforced by the marketing message of pharmaceutical companies to physicians . "
It is worth noting that one session at the psychiatry convention asked whether bipolar disorder in children might be over diagnosed .
Some deny that a financial relationship alters judgment .
They point to a history of professions reforming themselves and claim this can prevent serving two masters .
Others are dubious .
Psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Carlat regularly blogs about the unholy alliance .
Now Congress is holding hearings about pharma ’s reach .
As the psychopharmacological revolution offers the promise of treatment for many , it will be unfortunate if the story is sidelined to questions about integrity and credibility , as it was with The Infinite Mind .
So much for biometrics and immigration security : A South Korean woman managed to fool a million - dollar fingerprint reading machine in Japanese border controls using a simple piece of tape stuck to her fingers .

It happened at Tokyo airport .
The woman has repeatedly entered Japan using the same trick without anybody noticing .
Japanese officials say that they suspect many others have been doing the same things , demonstrating that the biometric systems they installed in 30 airports in 2007 - to the tune of $ 45 million - are completely useless .
The woman was deported in July 2007 for illegally staying in Japan as a bar hostess in Nagano , but she entered again with the system , using the tape and a fake passport allegedly provided by a South Korean broker .

Anti-Zionist activists blockade the entrance to the Marriott Marquis Hotel at 47th and Broadway in Manhattan .
They were protesting a $ 1,500 - per- plate fundraising dinner for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , the nation ’s most powerful pro-Israel lobbying organization .
Ten people were arrested during the action .

Judy Rebick has received death threats , been screamed at , and been labeled a “ self - hating Jew ” for her outspokenness on the Arab - Israeli conflict .
But that has n’t stopped her participation in any of the many Jewish - led and supported actions during Israel ’s latest incursion into the impoverished Gaza Strip in Palestine .
“ For people who embrace a progressive Jewish vision , Israel is against everything we believe in , ” Rebick said .
“ They ’re violating the Jewish tradition of progressive struggle , and their claim of being a victim is wrong . ”
Rebick , who holds the Sam Gindin Chair in Social Justice and Democracy at Ryerson University and who founded rabble .ca , a progressive Canadian news website , was arrested along with seven other Jewish women after they occupied the Israeli consulate in Toronto Jan. 8 in an action against the Israeli bombing and invasion of the Gaza Strip , which killed more than 1,300 Palestinians and wounded at least 5,000 .
Jewish peace activists in Montreal , San Francisco and Los Angeles have staged similar demonstrations at Israeli Consulates , highlighting the many Jewish voices around the world that are speaking out against continued occupation and war in Palestine in what is often a bitter and polarizing debate .
In New York City , Jews Against the Occupation - NYC ( JATO ) dropped antiwar banners near the Brooklyn - Queens Expressway and near the U.S.S. Intrepid , and another group of New York City Jews hastily organized a demonstration outside the Israeli consulate in New York Jan. 12 that drew around 1,000 people .
On Jan. 29 , 10 anti-Zionist activists , two of them Jewish and most of them college students , were arrested while trying to blockade the entrance to a Midtown hotel that was the site of a $ 1,500 - per- plate benefit for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , the nation ’s leading pro-Israel lobbying group .
“ [ Israel ] is the state that purports to be our homeland , and whether we feel that it is or not … its actions somehow reflect on Jews in general , ” said Alisa Solomon , co-editor of Wrestling with Zion : Progressive Jewish - American Responses to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict and a contributing editor to the WBAI radio show “ Beyond the Pale : Radical Jewish Culture and Politics . ”
“ It ’s a very dubious and dangerous collapse when ‘ Jew ’ and ‘ Israel ’ are conflated , ” Solomon said .
“ Anti-Semites do it a lot , and unfortunately , powers of the Israeli state do it as well . ”
And while being a Jew who forcefully speaks out against Israel ’s actions continues to be a minority position within the larger Jewish community , there is something of a generational shift among younger Jews away from attachment to Israel .
According to a 2007 National Survey of American Jews , 54 percent of Jews younger than 35 are “ comfortable with the idea of a Jewish state , ” compared to 81 percent of Jews older than 65 , who grew up with the memory of the Holocaust fresh in their minds .
“ The shift is going to happen slowly in the Jewish community , very slowly , ” said Ethan Heitner , 25 , an activist with JATO and Adalah - NY : The Coalition for Justice in the Middle East .
“ There are starting to be cracks in the Zionist hegemonic viewpoint on things … [ Activism ] has to continue , it has to keep growing , even when things get quiet . ”
Michael Letwin of New York City Labor Against the War supports terminating U.S. aid to Israel as well as a nascent divestment and sanctions movement against Israel modeled on the one that confronted apartheid South Africa during the 1970s and 1980s .
He says he lost the presidency of his union , the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys UAW Local 2325 , in the year after 9/11 due to his anti-Zionist views .
Still he insists it is crucial for progressive Jews to speak out despite the possible consequences .
“ It ’s very hard to be an anti-Zionist in this country … but there is space , ” he said .
“ And to the extent that we can open that space , and keep pushing the envelope , I think there ’s more opportunity sometimes than we think there is . ”
Letwin also stresses the importance of Jewish activists doing Palestine solidarity work engaging in open and constructive dialogue with Jews who believe in Zionism and support the state of Israel .
“ There ’s no point in just speaking to people who are already convinced .
We have to show our support for people who are already convinced … but that ’s only the beginning , not the end , ” said Letwin .
“ We ’ve got to talk to people that are n’t already convinced , who do n’t know anything about it , or if they ’re Jewish and have a totally distorted view . ”
Partnerships between Jews and Palestinians who protest Israel ’s occupation are also essential “ to break this myth that there ’s no relationships available between these groups of people , ” said Flo Razowsky , the U.S. coordinator for the International Anti-Zionist Jewish Network , an organization that was a key player in the Israeli Consulate actions in California .
Razowsky , 34 , was once the president of a Zionist youth group .
She says she had a “ strong relationship to Israel . ”
“ The simplest way to put it is to make an analogy between white - skinned people doing anti-racist work [ with ]
Jews doing anti-Zionist work .
… [ Zionism ] is a deadly form of racism based on a very specific identity , ” Razowsky said .

Manuel Rosales has strenuously denied all the allegations Prosecutors in Venezuela have summoned one of the country 's main opposition leaders to appear before a judge on 11 December to face corruption charges .
Manuel Rosales , the outgoing governor of the oil - rich state of Zulia , is accused of defrauding the state lottery and misusing public funds .
He has denied the accusations , saying they amount to a political lynching of President Hugo Chavez 's opponents .
Mr Rosales ran against Mr Chavez in the last presidential election in 2006 .
The Attorney General 's office said Mr Rosales had been summoned to appear before the judge investigating the case on the morning of 11 December .
The announcement came just days after President Chavez said he would seek the constitutional changes necessary to allow him to stand for indefinite re-election .
On Tuesday he announced that he expected a referendum would be held in February .
Government campaign
During the recent regional election campaign , Mr Chavez repeatedly threatened Mr Rosales with prison , taunting him at rallies by saying that a prison cell was waiting for him .
Mr Chavez threatened Mr Rosales with prison during the regional elections Mr Rosales , previously the governor of Zulia , was elected mayor of the country 's second city , Maracaibo , in last month 's municipal elections .
Adverts featuring alleged telephone conversations made by Mr Rosales , in which he was accused of receiving illegal gifts for his business partners and wife , were also put out by the government .
Just over a week after the poll , the state prosecutor 's office announced it would charge him with defrauding the state lottery and misusing state funds .
Separately , the government has also accused Mr Rosales of plotting to kill the president and overthrow his administration - allegations strenuously denied by the opposition .
" I will confront everything I must ... They are aiming to politically lynch all of us who are opposed to the coronation of Chavez , " Mr Rosales said .

A simple petri dish test revealed that by overlooking basic hygiene , a healthcare worker infected a quadriplegic Iraq war veteran with MRSA , an antibiotic - resistant bacteria that plagues hospitals .
The Cleveland VA medical center has an aggressive program to protect its patients from germs , and part of that effort includes regularly swabbing their noses to check for staph .
In this case , the quadriplegic man had never tested positive before , so clearly something had gone wrong .
" All patients admitted to VA hospitals are screened to determine if they carry MRSA , " says Curtis Donskey , the doctor in charge of infection control .
" When carriers are identified , extra precautions are taken to decrease the likelihood that MRSA will be spread to other patients . "
Donskey figured out who had been in contact with the patient .
He asked a medical student to give the patient an exam , touch an agar plate , use some hand sanitizer , and then make another imprint on an identical dish .
Each batch of agar contained a little bit of cefoxitin , an antibiotic that should prevent any ordinary bacteria from growing on the plates .
After a little bit of incubation , the first plate ( left ) was covered in bright red colonies .
It provided damming evidence that the infection can easily be spread by hand .
The second plate ( right ) was completely free of bacteria .
It showed that disaster can be averted very easily .
By taking just a minute to lather up , anyone who works with patients can fight the spread of antibiotic - resistant bugs .
" Healthcare workers usually clean their hands with alcohol because it is very effective at killing most of the bacteria that cause hospital infections , " says Donskey .
" The exception is Clostridium difficile which is not killed by alcohol ; for patients with C. difficile infection it is recommended that healthcare workers wear gloves and wash their hands with soap and water .
Donskey submitted a photo of each plate to the New England Journal of Medicine .

I had to hold my 17 - year - old son down on the bed after he heard the news .
His strength really shocked me .
I was gripping his upper arms as tightly as I could to hold him flat on the bed , but he was spitting with rage , tears streaming down his face .
I was shouting , " Stop !
Please stop ! " but he was pushing up at me hard , his face twisting like his body underneath me .
He was fighting with everything he had in order to be able to get up , run down the stairs and get out of the house .
All I knew at that moment was that I could n't let him leave .
We were in his bedroom in London and I had just given him the news that his grandmother had been blown to pieces by a rocket in Israel .
Jordy had lost his other grandmother five months earlier to cancer .
This time there was someone to blame .
Our pain and his rage opened a window up for me on to what is happening in Gaza .
There are thousands and thousands of young men who have experienced - or are experiencing - that rage in Gaza and the West Bank , and their fathers and grandfathers have no doubt experienced it too .
When I heard in the days that followed Shuli 's death that they handed out sweets in Gaza to celebrate the fact that the rocket had hit a target , I was appalled .
Now with all I have seen over the last two weeks in Gaza , part of me feels : why would n't they celebrate ?
Shuli , my wife 's mother , lived on Kibbutz Gvar-am , which lies 5 km to the north of Gaza and 10 km to the south of Ashkelon .
She had been the kibbutz nurse until she retired and lately had worked part - time in the kibbutz factory making envelopes for the Salvation Army and Asda .
In May last year she had been expecting a visit from a cousin who was over from America .
The cousin had phoned to say that she was too frightened to come to Shuli 's kibbutz on account of a rocket landing in Ashkelon the previous day .
" Do n't worry , " Shuli told her , " every missile has its own address .
We 'll come to you instead . "
An hour later she arrived at the house where her cousin was staying .
Her son , Yariv , rang the doorbell and while they waited for someone to answer , Shuli stepped away in order to get some shade next to a wall .
The rocket came out of nowhere and she died instantly .
None had landed in that area before .
Only later did we find out that Shuli had rung her sister the night before her death and made her promise to look after her children if anything were to happen to her .
It was beshert - meant to be .
That was six months ago and now , sat at home in north London with the Israeli bombardment of Gaza well into its third week , and with news of fresh horrors arriving daily , our house is filled with a despair of a different kind .
It has felt like a house in mourning again .
A dark fog which I can't really describe has enveloped us .
Maybe it 's shame .
I do n't know .
I know we all felt relief that Israel did n't retaliate after Shuli was killed .
But it 's happening now .
I keep looking at Shuli 's birth certificate which my wife now has .
Shuli 's mother had left Germany by boat for Palestine after Hitler came to power and she helped form a radical socialist community on land partitioned to the Jews by the British .
Shuli 's birth certificate states her nationality as Palestinian .
Her death certificate said Israeli .
My wife says she feels scared and lost and full of guilt .
" It 's my country and I see myself as Israeli not Jewish , " she keeps shouting at me .
Does that make you feel better or worse about what 's going on , I ask ?
" That 's worse ! " she says , " because Israel is nothing to do with God . "
I digest this , but do n't even know where to begin to start unravelling that statement .
I 'm trying to think back to Christmas when I was staying on the kibbutz .
I 'm struggling to remember what I felt as the Hamas rockets were flying in every day during the week before the Israeli F16s screamed over our heads and began pounding the Gaza Strip and those condemned to live within it .
My five - year - old son , Geffen , was constantly asking me if he was going to die like his Grandma .
People on the kibbutz rallied around as you would expect ; it was no time for questions or politics .
We did n't see the bigger picture .
But on returning home , I saw it all too clearly , and it sent me into meltdown .
I feel guilty about abandoning my friends on the kibbutz - not physically but mentally .
A good friend of mine over there called Mirav , whom I 've known for 25 years , has a 12 - year - old daughter , Omer , who just stays in her room and cries .
She 's been doing it for three months now and this all began after the fourth Kasam rocket hit her school .
I try to think about her , but shockingly she does n't seem to matter so much any more .
Not at the moment anyway .
Not from here in England with what we 're seeing on television every day .
Everything is dwarfed by the horrors in Gaza .
I 'd seen the ground troops massing up the road from the kibbutz towards the border with Gaza in the days before I left Israel , but I never believed for one second that they would go in .
They did .
In the last few days , I 've stopped watching television and buying newspapers .
For the first time in my adult life I do n't want to know what is going on outside my own front door .
Most Israelis
I know think Hamas wants to annihilate Israel .
A lot of Jews over here think that too .
I do n't know if that 's what Hamas wants : it depends what you read .
I was over there when they blew up buses on Dissenghof Street in Tel Aviv in 1996 .
That act seemed to turn Israel right wing just at the moment the country was mourning the death of Rabin and was , I believe , genuinely committed to peace .
But Hamas is now part of the political process whether Israel , Britain and America likes it or not and dialogue is the only way forward .
Would hatred for Israel stop if it were to return to its 1967 borders ?
Of course not , but Israel has to do it anyway .
It has to do the right thing , to help build a strong Palestinian state where people can live normal lives , work , feed their kids , be happy , safe , have dignity .
That 's what most people want in life is n't it ?
At Shuli 's funeral last May , her son Jonathon , my brother - in - law , gave a speech .
" Where are the doves ? " he asked .
" What is this land worth without someone with a vision ?
Nothing .
Without doves it was n't worth the struggle . "
Jonny is 34 .
He 's an army reservist who is studying to be a neurologist and has a two - year - old son called Boaz .
He did n't scream for blood at his mother 's graveside , he screamed for peace .
In our house we have our own thinking to do .
My eldest son , Jordy , has Israeli citizenship and in two years he will have to choose either to relinquish that citizenship or to fight in the Israeli army .
It can be only his choice .
But , unlike the Palestinians in Gaza , at least he has one .

Iraq is flushing salinity out of millions of acres of land .
The process should breathe new life into dirty rivers and dying soils .
The idea is to restore “ fertile ” to the Fertile Crescent .
You remember : the swath of once - fecund land arching from the Mediterranean across Iraq and down to the Persian Gulf — aka , the Garden of Eden .
But centuries of irrigation and overuse have turned the farmlands of southern and central Iraq saline — aka , the Garden of Apocalypse .
The problem derives from salt collecting in soil when farmers irrigate it with salty water or do n’t drain it properly .
The end result is that Iraq is now so fallow the country imports virtually all its food , paying with oil profits .
Much of the government ’s current budget is spent on food rations , reports Reuters .
Making Iraq fertile suggests there might actually be a post - oil future for that nation .
The plan is to pump out subterranean groundwater .
The process — which has already worked in Australia — will take years .
The work begins with a pumping station in Nassiriya sidelined for decades by the war with Iran , UN sanctions , and the war with the US .
The project is further challenged by an ongoing severe drought and by 55,000 miles of crumbling drainage and irrigation channels .
. .
Suggestion : run the pumps on solar or tidal power and minimize that other problem too .
And while we ’re at it , why not donate the sweat equity of those short - sighted Detroit CEOs ?
They ’ve been part of the problem for long enough .
They could toil in the desert and meditate on their manifold sins .

( Huge h/t to Jane Hamsher )
I flip around the cable channels during the day just to get an idea of what the punditocracy considers big news and I caught the tail end of this segment on Fox yesterday morning and could not stop laughing .
The GOP and their propaganda arm , FOX News , are up in arms over the latest Newsweek cover of Sarah Palin that accompanies this scathing article by Jon Meacham .
The article , that points to Palin's " commonness " as a problem to her credibility as a candidate , is less of a concern to the GOP than the fact that they did a close up of her face and did not retouch it to hide blemishes and pores .
And you may remember , FOX knows about retouching photos for credibility 's sake .
Apparently , they 're not as afraid of their supporters reading as they are of them looking at pictures and realizing that Palin 's skin is n't peaches and cream perfect .
You 've read about some of our favorite games of the year .
Now it 's time for the disappointments .
The games below , chosen by the usual panel of Wired.com contributors , is in no way supposed to be a list of the worst games of 2008 .
Those are all for the Wii , cost $ 10 , are about dogs and / or babies , and we would n't be caught dead playing them .
No , these are the games that let us down the most this year .
Most of them are actually good games .
But they failed to live up to the hype , or did n't deliver on their promises .
Perhaps we were just left wanting more .
Either way , here are our Most Disappointing Games of the year .
10 . Age of Conan* *( PC )
MMO fans tired of World of Warcraft had high hopes for this so - called WoW - killer .
So it 's too bad that its developer vastly overestimated its own capabilities .
Though Conan had great ideas , like the innovative combat system , Funcom shipped the game months before it had ironed out the most glaring bugs or added enough content .
Devotees who had spent months poring over every screenshot and snippet of information prior to release found the resulting product to be an utter mess .

9. Tom Clancy's EndWar ( Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , PC )
At demos and hands - on preview events , this looked like the most accessible and innovative real - time strategy game in years , one that could help the genre find a new audience on consoles .
We loved the stripped - down interface , the nonstop action and the voice recognition system that let you bark orders into your headset and watch your troops respond instantly .
The voice input system was near - flawless , but EndWar was plagued with the same age - old problems : balance issues , spotty AI , janky pathfinding and a weak single - player experience .
Ironically , Civilization Revolution , a console strategy game that did n't set out to reinvent the wheel , ended up making a much bigger splash .

8. Too Human
__ ( Xbox 360 )
No game in 2008 had as much negative word - of - mouth as Silicon Knights ' action RPG .
On release , it neither owned the haters nor made prophets of the believers : Too Human turned out to be a flawed but enjoyable experience .
The most disappointing part about it , though , was that it was over so soon .
Perhaps designing a game as a trilogy is n't the best idea , when it means splitting a storyline into three parts and ending the first the very moment that the plot actually becomes interesting .
— Chris Kohler
7. Stalker : Clear Sky ( PC )
They say you should n't judge a book by its cover , but when we saw the trailers for Stalker : Clear Sky , we could n't help but get excited about the haunting atmosphere , gorgeous visuals and the promise of improved AI .
The finished product was quite pretty to look at , but suffered from a number of flaws that made sitting down and playing a chore .
The first Stalker was interesting because you had to explore the world on your own , but Clear Sky 's all - knowing GPS gadget killed that .
And it was filled with even more bugs than the original — which kind of makes sense , since it 's a prequel .
— Nate Ralph
6. Mirror 's Edge ( Xbox 360 , PS3 )
For pure exhilaration , very few games in 2008 compared to the first - person parkour play mechanics of
Mirror 's Edge .
Unfortunately , the same thing can be said about pure frustration .
The shallow , unnecessary combat and obtuse level design meant that you died over and over ( and over and over ) again .
DICE has created what could be a promising new genre , and we can't wait to play the expansion pack and inevitable sequel .
But it would be irresponsible to celebrate their achievement without mentioning the glaring missteps that marred what otherwise would have been a contender for our Top 10 list .

5. Dead Space ( Xbox 360 , PS3 )
A gorgeous , seamless interface ?
" Strategic dismemberment " ?
Survival horror in space that ( sort of ) does n't involve zombies ?
And a fantastic story penned with help from the esteemed Warren Ellis ?
Dead Space seemed like a guaranteed thrill ride .
Alas , we 've already seen Aliens , and played Doom , so it was more of a second go - round .
The whack - a- mole combat is only barely propped up by a gimmick where leg - shots are the new headshots .
The boss fights are inane and repetitive .
And for the record , dimming the lights and slapping up bloody , gory wallpaper does n't automatically make a game scary .

4. Prince of Persia __( Xbox 360 , PS3 )
The Sands of Time was a masterpiece that ranks among the best videogames of the last decade , but its sequels were not .
In some ways , this reboot got the acrobatic action series back on track :
The graphics , music , and story are pitch - perfect .
But the gameplay has been simplified and streamlined to the point that not only are players never challenged , they are rarely tasked with doing anything other than tapping a predetermined series of buttons to watch canned animations play out .
What 's even more disappointing is that so many gamers are unquestioningly lapping up this ample serving of style over substance ; here 's hoping the inevitable sequel is more balanced .

3. Mario Kart Wii ( Wii )
When Nintendo revealed Wii , it was widely touted as nothing short of a revolution in the way we would experience games .
True to form , Zelda : Twilight Princess and * Super Mario Galaxy *
were both excellent updates that made good use of Wii 's new features .
But when it came time to take its go - kart racing game for another spin ,
Nintendo crashed into a tree .
Not only does Mario Kart Wii
completely fail to innovate in any meaningful way over earlier entries in the series , the awkward wheel peripheral that shipped with the title actually made gameplay more difficult .
And the castrated battle mode was the airbag that failed to deploy .

__2. __Star Wars : The Force Unleashed ( Xbox 360 , PS3 ) ( pictured , top )
LucasArts sunk a bunch of development time into the physics and animation engines that powered what was supposed to be the awesomest Star Wars game ever .
Throwing Stormtroopers off cliffs and destroying environments using Force power was supposed to be like living the movie , but instead it was an utterly pedestrian action game .
The brief glimpses of fun that it offered were drowned out by a host of poor design decisions , and the ridiculous Imperial Star Destroyer segment was the very last straw .

1. Spore ( PC )
After years of unprecedented hype — no small amount of it coming from the pages of Wired magazine and Wired.com — Will Wright 's evolution game Spore was something less than a Big Bang .
While it was fascinating to observe how players created new creatures and shared them with the Sporepedia tool , the actual videogame at the core of all this user - generated content was disappointingly simple .
The primordial soup of assorted gameplay tropes never did give birth to an evolved supergame .
Spore may very well be remembered as introducing concepts that will change the way we play games , but that did n't make it fun .

Editor 's note : Peter Bergen is CNN 's national security analyst .
His most recent book is " The Osama bin Laden I Know : An Oral History of al Qaeda 's Leader . "
Peter Bergen says terrorist attempts to use WMDs have proven to be relatively ineffective .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The congressionally authorized Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism issued a report this week that concluded : " It is more likely than not that a weapon of mass destruction will be used in a terrorist attack somewhere in the world by the end of 2013 . "
The findings of this report received considerable ink in The New York Times and The Washington Post and plenty of airtime on networks around the world , including on CNN .
And the day the report was released Vice President - elect Joseph Biden was briefed on its contents .
So is the sky falling ?
Not really .
Terrorists have already used weapons of mass destruction in the past decade in attacks around the world , and they have proven to be something of a dud .
In the fall of 2001 , the anthrax attacks in the United States that targeted politicians and journalists caused considerable panic but did not lead to many deaths .
Five people were killed .
The alleged author of that attack , Bruce E. Ivins , was one of the leading biological weapons researchers in the United States .
Even this brilliant scientist could only " weaponize " anthrax to the point that it killed a handful of people .
Imagine then how difficult it would be for the average terrorist , or even the above - average terrorist , to replicate such efforts .
Similarly , the bizarre Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo , which recruited leading scientists and had hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank , embarked on a large - scale WMD program in the early 1990s in which cult members experimented with anthrax and invested in land in Australia to mine uranium .
In the end , Aum found biological and nuclear attacks too complex to organize and settled instead on a chemical weapons operation , setting off sarin gas in the Tokyo subway in 1995 that killed 12 commuters .
It is hard to imagine a place better suited to killing a lot of people than the jam - packed Tokyo subway , yet the death toll turned out to be small in Aum 's chemical weapons assault .
More recently , in 2006 and 2007 al Qaeda 's Iraqi affiliate laced several of its bombs with chlorine .
Those attacks sickened hundreds of Iraqis , but victims who died in the assaults did so more from the blast of the bombs than because of inhaling chlorine .
Al Qaeda stopped using chlorine in its bombs in Iraq more than a year ago .
There is a semantic problem in any discussion of WMDs because the ominous term '' Weapons of Mass Destruction ' ' is something of a misnomer .
In the popular imagination , chemical , biological and nuclear devices are all weapons of mass destruction .
In fact , there is only one weapon of mass destruction that can kill tens or hundreds of thousands and that is a nuclear device .
So the real question is : Can terrorists deploy nuclear weapons any time in the next five years or even further in the future ?
To do so , terrorists would have one of four options : to buy , steal , develop or be given a nuclear weapon .
But none of those scenarios are remotely realistic outside the world of Hollywood .
To understand how complex it is to develop a nuclear weapon , it is worth recalling that Saddam Hussein put tens of millions of dollars into his nuclear program with no success .
Iran , which has had a nuclear program for almost two decades , is still years away from developing a nuclear bomb .
Terrorist groups simply do n't have the massive resources of states , and so the notion that they could develop their own , even crude , nuclear weapons is fanciful .
Well , what about terrorists being given nukes ?
Preventing this was one of the underlying rationales of the push to topple Hussein in 2003 .
This does not pass the laugh test .
Brian Michael Jenkins , one of the leading U.S. terrorism experts in a book published this year , " Will Terrorists Go Nuclear ? , " points out that there are two reasons this is quite unlikely .
First , governments are not about to hand over their crown jewels to organizations that are " not entirely under state control and whose reliability is not certain . "
Second , " giving them a nuclear weapon almost certainly exposes the state sponsor to retaliation . "
For the same reason that states wo n't give nukes to terrorists , they also wo n't sell them either , which leaves the option of stealing a nuclear weapon .
But that is similarly unlikely because nuclear - armed governments , including Pakistan , are pretty careful about the security measures they place around their most valued weapons .
None of this of course is to suggest that al Qaeda is not interested in deploying nuclear devices .
Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders have repeatedly bloviated about the necessity of nuking the West and have even implied that they have the capability to do so .
This is nonsense .
Yes , in the mid-1990s when Al Qaeda was based in Sudan , members of the group tried to buy highly enriched uranium suitable for a nuke , but the deal did not go through .
And it is certainly the case that a year or so before 9/11 , bin Laden was meeting with veterans of Pakistan 's nuclear program to discuss how al Qaeda might get into the nuclear weapons business .
But all of this was aspirational , not operational .
There is not a shred of evidence that any of this got beyond the talking stage .
In 2002 , former U.N. weapons inspector David Albright undertook a careful study of al Qaeda 's nuclear research program and concluded it was virtually impossible for al Qaeda to have acquired any type of nuclear weapon .
However , there is plenty of evidence that the group has experimented with crude chemical and biological weapons , and also attempted to acquire radioactive materials suitable for a " dirty " bomb , a device that marries conventional explosives to radioactive materials .
But even if al Qaeda successfully deployed a crude chemical , biological or radiological weapon these would not be weapons of mass destruction that killed thousands .
Instead , these would be weapons of mass disruption , whose principal effect would be panic -- not mass casualties .
So if not WMDs , what will terrorists use in their attacks over the next five years ?
Small - bore chemical , biological and radiological attacks are all quite probable , but those attacks would kill scores , not thousands .
What we are likely to see again and again are the tried and tested tactics that terrorists have used for decades :
The first vehicle bomb blew up on Wall Street in 1920 detonated by an Italian - American anarchist .
Since then , the car / truck bomb has been reliably deployed by terrorists thousands of times .
Assassinations , such as the one that killed Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 , sparking one of the bloodiest wars in history .
Hijackings , such as those that inaugurated the worst terrorist attack in history on 9/11 .
Guys armed with AK - 47s intent on murder and mayhem as we saw in Mumbai , India , brought one of the world 's largest countries to a standstill and generated continuous news coverage around the globe for 60 hours .
Why go the deeply uncertain , and enormously complex and expensive WMD route when other methods have proved so successful in getting attention for terrorists in the past ?
The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism makes all sorts of sensible recommendations .
Among them is creating a WMD adviser in the White House who would coordinate all the issues of WMD proliferation and terrorism , something the Obama administration would do well to implement .
Right now , responsibility for this important job is diffused over numerous agencies , from the Department of Energy to the Pentagon .
But the report 's overall conclusion that WMD terrorism is likely to happen " somewhere in the world " in the next five years is simultaneously stating the obvious -- because terrorists already have engaged in crude chemical and biological weapons attacks -- but also highly unlikely because deploying true WMDs remains beyond the capabilities of terrorist groups today and for the foreseeable future .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
With almost 2.6 million job losses last year , American consumers , once seen as unflappable , pulled back .
On Wednesday , the government is scheduled to report retail sales for December , and economists expect a record sixth consecutive month of declines .
While falling gas prices have relieved consumers to some extent , job losses are pinning down confidence to near - record lows , which translates to weak spending , wrote analysts with CIBC World Markets .
" With the U.S. economy in the throes of its first consumer - led recession since the early 1990s , the 2008 holiday sales season has surely been a dud , " according to CIBC .
" With so many economic indicators pointing to a horrible fourth quarter no one expects this report to bring anything but bad news .
The only real debate is how horrible it will be . "
Analysts polled by MarketWatch are expecting a drop in retail sales of 1.7 % for December , following a decline of 1.8 % in November .
Excluding autos , analysts are looking for a decline of 1.9 % , compared with 1.6 % in the prior month .
" Tumbling household net worth , rising unemployment and depressed consumer confidence continue to have an adverse impact on spending , " wrote Bank of America analysts in a research note .
On Friday , consumer sentiment results come out for early January from the Reuters / University of Michigan survey .
Although the reading improved in December , it remained at relatively low levels with consumers reporting that lower prices provided some needed relief , but continued job losses and income declines were worrisome .
Analysts polled by MarketWatch expect the January data to retreat .
" Deep holiday discounting boosted consumer sentiment in December , but we do not expect this to repeat in January .
Continued volatility in financial market and horrific news with respect to the economy and labor markets should outweigh lower gas prices , " according to a Credit Suisse research note .
Consumer , producer prices
On Friday , the Labor Department will report the consumer price index for December .
Analysts polled by MarketWatch are looking for a drop of 0.9 % on the back on lower gas prices , compared with a drop of 1.7 % in the prior month .
Excluding energy and food prices , analysts expect a second consecutive of no change .
CIBC analysts expect a year - over - year drop for December , which would be the first decline since 1955 .
" The CPI has begun a massive retreat as a global economic recession hammers natural resource prices , " according to CIBC .
" This trend should continue over the coming months , but that being said the U.S. government 's growing fiscal deficit poses huge inflation risks down the road as policy makers move to monetize a national debt load that has ballooned to deal with the current economic crisis . "
On Thursday , the government will report on producer prices for December .
Analysts polled by MarketWatch are looking for a decline of 2.4 % , compared with a drop of 2.2 % in November .
Excluding energy and food , analysts expect the index to fall 0.1 % , compared with a gain of 0.1 % in the prior month .
Lower energy prices mean that the PPI could fall more than 1 % for the third consecutive month , according to Bank of America analysts .
" The risk now is that a worsening in economic conditions brings about deflation , " Bank of America analysts wrote .
Industrial production
Also Friday , the Federal Reserve will report industrial production data for December , and economists are expecting another drop .
A recent report from the Institute for Supply Management showed that U.S. manufacturing activity dropped to a 28 - year low in December .
For November , the Fed reported that output fell 0.6 % on broad - based weakness across manufacturing industries , and analysts polled by MarketWatch expect a December decline of 1.5 % .
" Manufacturing output should see a large decline because of the whopping 2.4 % drop in manufacturing hours worked , " according to Credit Suisse analysts .
" This is consistent with December 's nightmare ISM manufacturing report . "
COLUMBUS , Ohio , Dec. 2 ( UPI ) --
Two Republican
Ohio legislators say they want to plug the kind of personal information leaks that bubbled up on " Joe the Plumber . "
Ohio State Rep. Shannon Jones of Springboro and state Sen. Mark Wagoner of Toledo have proposed legislation that calls for the immediate firing of any state employee who improperly accesses databases containing personal information , the Dayton ( Ohio ) Daily News reported Tuesday .

Ohio Inspector General Tom Charles determined earlier that Helen Jones - Kelley of the Ohio Job and Family Services Department had improperly authorized searches of databases with personal information on Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher of suburban Toledo .
Also known as " Joe the Plumber , " Wurzelbacher had become a key figure in the U.S. presidential campaign after questioning Democratic nominee Sen.
Barack Obama of Illinois about his tax plans .
Jones - Kelley was suspended for a month without pay .
But Jones and Wagoner 's bill would see such employees fired , as well as set new criteria for determining which employees would be allowed to access such information , the newspaper said .
In 709 A.D. , in the Iron Age , a spacecraft crashes in the Viking kingdom of Herot , Norway , and the pilot Kainan ( Jim Caviezel ) survives .
He turns the beacon on ; learns the language and culture of the planet using a machine ; and finds that the predator , Moorwen , that he was transporting , had escaped .
While chasing the alien monster , he finds a village completely destroyed and is arrested by the warrior Wulfric ( Jack Huston ) , believing that he killed the locals .
Kainan is brought to Herot as a prisoner .

I 'm digging the retro throwback of these plates and mugs by Orla Kiely .
Orla certainly has that 70s vibe going on and though some of it may be a little too funky , taken in small doses it comes off fresh .
Launched in 1997 , Orla has carved a niche in the fashion scene with her use of color , geometry and pattern .
To me , she 's like Kate Spade 's groovier older sister .
You know , the one that wears oversize sunglasses , smokes like a chimney and still wears fur coats .
Or maybe she 's a modern day Marcia Brady .
Orla 's Target line is coming out in February .
Just a heads up !

Also worth noting :
The devastating economic malaise gripping the United States has finally infected Canada 's job market , which shed nearly 71,000 positions in November , the largest monthly net loss in 26 years .
The higher - than - expected job losses pushed the country 's unemployment rate to 6.3 per cent , up one - tenth of a percentage point from October .
" If you needed one piece of evidence to prove that Canada has finally entered that slippery slope toward recession , this would be it , " said Michael Gregory , a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets .
Canada posted a net gain of 133,000 jobs in the first 11 months of the year , compared with almost two million jobs lost in the United States over the period .
The picture was especially bleak in Ontario , Canada 's manufacturing heartland , where 66,000 jobs evaporated .
Those losses drove the province 's unemployment rate to 7.1 per cent , up from 6.5 per cent the month before .
And this likely wo n't be the end of gloomy unemployment reports .
With Canada 's economy poised to contract , said CIBC World Markets economist Krishen Rangasamy , " things will certainly get worse before they get better . "
He sees the unemployment rate " creeping up steadily toward 7 per cent , " with another 100,000 job losses expected over the next few months .
Manufacturing was hit particularly hard in November , with net job losses of 38,000 .
The sector has seen employment decline by 388,000 positions since a peak in 2002 , Statistics Canada said .
In Ontario , where barely a day goes by without manufacturers announcing layoffs or plant closures , manufacturing job losses were even steeper , totalling 42,000 last month .
That number is poised to rise after recent layoff announcements take effect , including 850 job cuts at two Magna auto - parts plants in the GTA , and 700 temporary layoffs announced yesterday at General Motors in Oshawa .
The dismal Ontario jobs picture " really is consistent with our thinking that Ontario is the epicentre of the impact of the U.S. slowdown in Canada , " said Glen Hodgson , chief economist at the Conference Board of Canada .
Other sectors that are particularly vulnerable to U.S. fortunes , including transportation and warehousing , also showed substantial job losses , Gregory said .
But the situation is even worse in the United States , which recorded 533,000 net job losses in November , the largest one - month decline since 1974 .
That pushed the U.S. unemployment rate up from 6.5 per cent to 6.7 per cent .
The Bank of Canada is expected to drop its key interest rate by half a percentage point to 1.75 per cent Tuesday as the outlook for Canada 's economy continues to weaken .
The feeble Canadian employment numbers prompted more calls for a government stimulus package , which likely will have to wait until the federal budget , which is slated for Jan. 27 .
Governor General Michaëlle Jean agreed to prorogue Parliament at the request of the Conservative government .
" We needed a massive stimulus package two months ago , not two months from now , " said Jim Stanford , an economist with the Canadian Auto Workers union .
" It 's absolutely jaw - dropping that Parliament has been closed down ... when we should be moving dramatically to try to stop this crisis from getting worse . "
At Queen 's Park , opposition parties said the huge jump in Ontario 's unemployment rate is proof that Premier Dalton McGuinty 's efforts to fight the economic downturn and retrain workers are a failure .
" Everyone could see this coming .
Everyone knew this situation was going to get worse and worse , " NDP Leader Howard Hampton said .
Economic Development Minister Michael Bryant acknowledged the jobless numbers were " brutal " but said Ontario 's effort at boosting the economy is " not intended to , nor can it , address the global economic crisis . "
Hodgson said job losses in Canada probably wo n't last as long as in the U.S. due to widely expected stimulus packages in both countries .
But , he said , " even with a big Obama package in the United States , the U.S. economy is going to have a really , really tough 2009 .
And if you 're sitting in Ontario , that translates into weak sales for whatever you do . "

One might also ask whether US demand is playing a role in higher prices .
Below the fold I show a few graphs that seem to indicate that US demand is really not up much yet .
WTI has recently been trading at a discount to Brent .
The shift in the inventory situation may help get this relationship back to a more normal relationship , with WTI priced above Brent .
The price of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) oil finally seems to be rising .
At least part of this may be occurring because inventories at Cushing finally seem to be drawing rather than increasing :
Gasoline Demand
Figure 2 . EIA Gasoline Demand ; Actual through November 08 ; December , January and February estimated based weekly data
One can see from this graph that January and February are months where little discretionary driving is done .
January and February 2009 demand is only a bit lower than demand for the same months for 2006 , 2007 , and 2008 .
If we look back at 2008 , we see that the big drop in demand was during the summer months , when a lot of discretionary driving is done .
There was also a big drop in demand ( or really , gasoline available ) in September 2008 , after the hurricanes hit .
Demand bounced a little in October , as customers refilled their empty tanks .
November and December 2008 demand seems to be down about 3.5 % from a year earlier .
While January and February 2009 are closer to demand of prior years , their absolute level is not very high .
Demand for Other Petroleum Products ( Diesel , Jet Fuel , etc. )
Figure 3 . Demand for Petroleum Products Other than Gasoline , Based on EIA Data .
Actual through November 08 ; December , January and February estimated based on weekly
One can see that demand for petroleum products other than gasoline was down during all of 2008 .
Demand in the first two months of 2009 seems to be down even more .
Exports play a fairly big role in the " other that gasoline " category , and these are difficult to estimate accurately , so my estimates for December 2008 , January 2009 and February 2009 are subject to change .
Total Petroleum Products Demand
If one adds together the demand graphs for gasoline ( Figure 2 ) and for other petroleum products ( Figure 3 ) , one gets this demand graph :
Figure 4 . Total Petroleum Products Demand , Based on EIA Data .
Actual through November 08 ; December , January and February estimated based weekly
Total demand still seems to be down in the 19 million barrel a day range .
This is quite low for the US .
Refiners are adapting gasoline supply to today 's reduced demand level .
The lower supply is tightening inventories , and tending to keep gasoline prices higher .

Israel 's three - day offensive failed to stop Palestinian militants firing rockets and mortars into Israel yesterday , killing three civilians and a soldier in a series of attacks .
Hamas claimed to have fired 43 homemade rockets , 17 longer - range Grads and six mortars across the border .
The deaths brought the tally of civilian fatalities from rocket strikes to 19 since 2002 , when militants in Gaza first began firing missiles at Israeli towns .
An Israeli - Arab labourer was killed and 10 other people were wounded yesterday morning when a Katyusha rocket struck a building site in Ashkelon , 10 miles from Gaza .
It was the first death in the southern seaside town , whose residents have grown increasingly anxious since rockets began exploding around it two years ago .
" You can hear them whistling , you do n't know where it 's coming from and where it 's going , or where it 's going to land , " said the head of Asheklon 's community services , David Wolfson .
Fifteen rockets have exploded in the centre of the city since Saturday and scores more have landed on the city 's outer limits .
Shai Biton , 15 , whose family moved from Sderot to Ashkelon two years ago to escape the daily attacks , said : " I never know when a rocket is going to land . "
While some residents have fled , most have remained , though few stray out of doors .
Last night one person was killed and another seriously wounded in the Nahal Oz kibbutz near the Gaza border .
Soon afterwards , a woman was killed and two others injured when another rocket struck a bus stop in the port city of Ashdod , north of Ashkelon .
An Israeli soldier was killed in a mortar attack , the first to be killed in the latest round of violence .
The bigger , Grad - style Katyushas are said to have a range of up to 50 miles , which means they fly much further than the Qassams that typically bombard towns closer to Gaza , such as Sderot .

For the last few months I ’ve been spending much of my spare hacking time learning to code iPhone applications .
I ’ve found Objective C to be a surprisingly pleasant language , and Cocoa is one of the best frameworks I ’ve ever worked with .
I ’ve reached a point where I feel I can go fairly quickly from simple app ideas to sketching in real code .
I ’m a web developer at heart , and a scripting language user by preference .
Coding for the iPhone does n’t feel as fluid in text handling or HTTP access as the environments I ’m used to .
Fortunately I ’ve been able to find some fantastic open - source libraries and wrappers that make up the difference .
Here are my favourites so far :
GTMHTTPFetcher from Google Toolbox for Mac
The iPhone ’s native HTTP handling is capable , but low - level and verbose .
Rather than handling the many callbacks , NSData objects and options I prefer this wrapper .
It has a ton of convenience methods allowing you to specify POST data and basic auth , follow redirects automatically , keep cookies over a session , set headers , and have two simple callbacks for success and error handling .
In many ways it ’s comparable to jQuery ’s $ .ajax ( ) one - hit function .
Having got some data over HTTP from a web API , chances are that it ’s available in JSON format .
This simple framework extends NSString with a JSONValue method to convert any legal JSON string to nested NSDictionaries and NSArrays .
To go the other way , dictionaries and arrays gain a JSONRepresentation method .
libxml2 wrappers for XPath over XML and HTML
Perhaps your web API returns XML , or perhaps you ’re getting your data by screenscraping HTML .
Did you know that the iPhone ships with libxml2 , which has high - performance XML and HTML parsing and a high - quality XPath implementation ?
Do n’t struggle with Cocoa ’s NSXMLParser or get bogged down in the complex libxml2 docs ; use these two simple wrapper functions , PerformXMLXPathQuery and PerformHTMLXPathQuery , to pull out the structured data you need in a Cocoa - friendly representation .
RegexKitLite for regular expressions
Where would scripting be without regular expressions ?
Luckily they ’re available on the iPhone , but buried deep within the ICU libraries .
RegexKitLite extends NSString with core regex string handling , including ‘ split ’ ( known as componentsSeparated ByRegex ) and a search - and - replace operator ( stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfRegex and replaceOccurrencesOfRegex ) .
FMDB , an Objective C wrapper for sqlite
Every scripting language has convenient database driver wrappers .
I was very happy to find that sqlite is available on the iPhone , but unfortunately its interface is all bare - metal C .
The simplest wrapper I ’ve found so far is FMDB .
Apparently somewhat inspired by JDBC , it gives you connection and resultset objects , along with one - liner convenience functions allowing code like [ db intForQuery : @" SELECT COUNT (*) FROM things " ] .
And there ’s more …
I ’ve used all of the above in a real project , but I ’ve got yet more things to explore on my todo list .

With the Pittsburgh Steelers ' 20 - 13 win over the Dallas Cowboys , Samuel Louis - Charles of North Miami Beach , Fla. , has reached 25 straight wins in ESPN's Streak For The Cash game .
The pick was worth $ 1 million for the 31 - year - old package handler .
The victory did n't come easily for Louis - Charles , who registered himself as Bigsam1122 .
The Steelers trailed the Cowboys for much of the game and were in trouble late .
But Pittsburgh came storming back , outscoring Dallas 17 - 0 in the last seven minutes of the game .
Deshea Townsend 's interception return for a 25 - yard touchdown capped the comeback .
Louis - Charles , who grew up in Brooklyn , worked methodically .
He won his 23rd straight game on Nov. 24 , and got his 24th win last Sunday when Tampa Bay beat New Orleans 23 - 20 on a field goal in the final two minutes .
Many in Australia , and those overseas interested in censorship would have now read a post from the Australian Minister for Censorship Stephen Conroy responding to concern over the implementation of the Great Firewall of Australia .
I wo n’t rehash what ’s already been reported , but having read it several times since publication , it ’s what ’s left out that makes the proposal even more scary .
Free Speech
The Minister has stated that political speech will not be filtered under the proposal , but fails to define acceptable free speech and does nothing more to articulate his previous comments that “ unwanted ” material will be filtered under the scheme .
The problem here is the extraordinary mish - mash of Australian laws relating to open speech .
In Victoria for example inciting religious hatred is an offense , so theoretically arguing against a particular religion would constitute hate speech instead of fair political speech .
Australia has a long track record of banning books , but for all the hatred are we now not better today having access to something like Mein Kampf so we can understand how wrong it is .
There is a blurred line between political and hate speech , and blocking such speech on the internet will not stop people accessing it .
Conroy is disingenuous in suggesting that the Government is pro-free speech , yet pro-censorship : the price of free speech is that we must put up with the stuff we do n’t like .
The alternative system is not free speech , it ’s totalitarianism .
Adult Games
Australia still has the bizarre situation of refusing to categorize video games for adults .
The Minister says nothing of such games online , so we can still only presume that adult games online that would be refused categorization in Australia will be blocked under the filter .
Such games include online virtual world Second Life among many .
It should be remembered that Australia is a country that refused classification to Duke Nukem 3D , let alone far more seriously violent games .
Pornography
Whether you like pornography or not , the hypocrisy of the Governments proposal remains the same .
Senator Conroy continues to point to existing guidelines being extended to International content , but ignores the absurdity in the current guidelines .
R rated pornography is legal in Australia and can be purchased at newsagents or service stations .
Under the guidelines proposed , R rated pornography online would be illegal unless those pages included a thorough adult verification scheme .
That does n’t mean enter your date here to proceed : as has previously been the case for age requirements for mobile content and R rated content hosted in Australia ( of which there is little to none ) that would include handing over credit card details , or in some cases being forced to register with the provider first , including the provision of adequate identifying measures to prove ones age .
The net affect is that 99.99 % of R rated pornography , or any R rated material under this proposal will be blocked by the filter , as overseas providers will not bend over backwards to cater for a small market like Australia .
Secondly : Australian ’s will be none to keen to hand over details to these sites should they meet the criteria .
X Rated pornography is treated more strictly in Australia currently , but is quite legal , and available for purchase from the ACT and Northern Territory .
X rated material under this proposal will be completely banned : so while it is legal to possess , look at or own in print or video , it will now be completely blocked online .
Again : whether you agree with porn or not , the hypocrisy is rich .
In terms of freedom of speech it also raises other issues : who is the Government to play moral guardian online over a picture of two consenting adults having sex ?
Presuming they are doing nothing illegal , why in the 21st century does the Government seek to prevent others seeing it ?
Government finally got out of the bedroom in the 80s when homosexuality became legal , some would argue that X Rated porn is no different again .
Secret Blacklist / Due Process
The Minister points out that the blacklist to be maintained by ACMA will remain a secret , and cites legislation supporting this .
His reasoning , as it seems to be for everything , is that it ’s all about kiddie porn
Publishing the title or internet address of child abuse material would constitute distribution of illegal material and is therefore protected from release .
To do otherwise would allow a person to view and download the material in jurisdictions where ISP - level filtering was not implemented .
That may well be the case , but the Minister fails to address concerns about due process should a site be added to the list .
If there is no access to the list , there is no way to appeal a site being blocked incorrectly .
Imagine a commenter leaving a lurid comment or pic on this blog , or a forum , and the site being added to the list based on this one instance .
No transparency can only equal unfair and arbitrary justice that remains the hallmark of totalitarian Government .
Selection Criteria
The Minister refers to the National Classification Scheme , a system where by content providers must seek classification of content prior to publication .
He then refers to content complaints being made to ACMA , and ACMA making the call on classification .
One again the Minister fails to address properly the selection criteria under the scheme : will website owners need to seek classification on content prior to publication ?
If so , this would be an onerous burden on new media owners and businesses in Australia , costing time , money and putting those businesses at a strict competitive disadvantage compared to overseas operators .
If ACMA will decide on content classification , will they only act on complaints as is currently the process ( again the Minister swaps and changes between the current and proposed system ) .
If so , how exactly will the filter know what is acceptable and not acceptable content given the millions of porn sites alone that may fall under the censorship regime .
Likewise , will the filter then decide to block content based on keywords ?
Could we not see the case , as has happened before that a site about breast cancer is blocked because the filter considers breasts to be pornographic ?
Overblocking
The Minister notes that in the last round of tests , overblocking , that is filters blocking legal content came in at 3 - 6 % .
He only notes that this is an advance on previous tests , but fails to address the very serious implications .
Under the scheme , three to six percent of perfectly legal content gets blocked .
Anything other than a 0 % rate is unacceptable .
Imagine the Australian Government waking up one morning and deciding that 6 % of Australian businesses could no longer open their doors to their customers , and the outcry this would cause .
This is EXACTLY what this proposal will do to online businesses , and companies with a primarily Australian focus online could find themselves out of business for no other reason that the Government ’s filter has decided to block them , even though they were doing no wrong .
BitTorrent
The Minister now states that P2P filtering technology is in the mix , despite its relative infancy .
The question then becomes one of “ unwanted . ”
Will the Government now extend the censorship regime to content presumed to be in breach of copyright as well ?
We can bet with absolute certainty that the Record and Movie Industries already have a letter on the Ministers desk .
Like general filtering , the question then becomes one of identification and process .
How does the Government identify “ unwanted material ” and given that the blacklist or decision process is secret , what happens when content is incorrectly tagged .
As we know the music and record industries do n’t have a great track record of respecting existing copyright laws when it comes to accusations ( for example , the defense of Fair Use , or Fair Trading in Australia ) .
Further will P2P network speeds be adversely affected for legal traffic ?
Internet Speeds
The Minister notes falsely once again that in other countries running ISP filtering using blacklists that there was no discernable decrease in speed , despite noting the tests here proving otherwise .
What the Minister continues to fail to mention is that the countries running blacklists he mentions were running child porn blacklists in some cases on non-compulsory feeds .
What the Minister is proposing is far more reaching than anything any of these countries are running , and every time he quotes those figures it ’s a lie of context .
Conclusion
While it ’s a positive that the Minister has finally spoken on some of the points raised by the Great Firewall of Australia proposal , it ’s what he does n’t answer that makes the proposal even more scary .
The implementation of this scheme can and will take Australia into an elite club of totalitarian societies that value state control over free speech .
The Rudd Government seems hell bent on implementing a scheme with no recourse , that may kill legitimate businesses , and slow internet speeds so that Australia can truly take its place as an online backwater in the digital age .
Today I am ashamed to be Australian , ashamed that my Government should seek to implement draconian 19th century style censorship laws over the marvel of the modern age : The Internet .
Free Speech may not be totally dead in Australia yet , but it ’s about to be placed on life support .
Conroy can say all he wants that this is n’t about free speech , but speech censored by Government is n’t free , no matter which way you want to spin it .
Three short years ago , the first partial face transplantation was performed in France and recently the first of these procedures to be conducted in the United States was successfully accomplished .
This was only the fourth operation of its type but experts estimate that perhaps as early as next year the first complete face transplant will be attempted .
It is one thing to receive a donation of an organ such as a heart or liver , which is inside of one ’s body and never seen , but quite another to look into the mirror everyday and see someone else ’s face .
While the underlying bone structure of the affected patient will largely determine the facial construct , the knowledge of the organ ’s origins may be too much for some to bear psychologically .
In addition , there may be some difficulty convincing the family members to allow the use of their loved one ’s face for transplantation purposes .
Herein lays the ethical dilemma of this groundbreaking procedure .
Faces are considered to be individualistic ; they express feelings and show personalities .
However , this must be balanced by imaging the psychological consequences of the patient going through life with a disfigured face .
Whether we care to admit it or not , humans are judged on their appearance , so being able to interact with society and continue normal daily activities and conduct their everyday life is essential .
Some may even argue that the damaged face is not theirs either and transplantation offers them the chance at a normal life .
In December 2007 , the 18 month follow - up of the index transplantation patient in France was reported in the New England Journal of Medicine with good medical results .
Psychological support was given at regularly scheduled intervals as part of her recovery protocol .
Although no formal psychological testing was conducted , she reported being pleased with the aesthetics and felt comfortable interacting with other people .
Reading about these advances also reminded me of a medical condition called prosopagnosia or “ face blindness ” .
This is a neurological condition where affected persons do not recognize faces , sometimes including their own .
It can be caused by brain damage to the occipital and temporal lobes and there is some evidence of a congenital form of the disease .
Studies have shown that patients have great anxiety in social situations and may become reclusive as a result .
What happens when the face is not actually your own ?
Organ transplantation is already a difficult procedure medically , requiring the patient to take lifelong immunosuppressive drugs .
Combine this with the many unanswered ethical questions and facial transplantation becomes even more complicated .
Therefore patient selection for this surgery must focus not only on organ compatibility but also on the emotional and mental capacity of the individual .

Reports of George Bush 's death have been exaggerated
A South African TV station mistakenly broadcast that former US President George Bush had died during one of its news bulletins .
For three seconds ETV News ran a moving banner headline across the screen saying " George Bush is dead " .
The " misbroadcast " happened when a technician pressed the " broadcast live for transmission " button instead of the one for a test -run .
The station said test banners would now be done in " gobbledegook " .
The mistake happened when a senior staff member wanted to see how a rolling banner headline looked .
' Wrong button '
" The technical director pressed the wrong button , it took a second for the words to appear and then the words were on screen for only three seconds before they were taken off , " said spokesman Vasili Vass .
He said he could not comment on whether the person responsible would face disciplinary action .
" We 've learned from it , all test banners will now be done in gobbledegook , " he added .
The mistake was first reported on by the Afrikaans language newspaper Beeld , and on the media group 's website , News24.com .
" Its unfortunate , because we never comment on their mistakes , " said Mr Vass .
The life cycle of a new hot web application platform looks something like this : 1 . the platform launches amid a lot of hype , 2 . advertisers and speculators swoop in , 3 . the platform is flooded with applications , most of which are silly or useless , 4 . as a result the good applications get obscured , and people lose interest because discovery becomes such a big problem .
The flood of applications that inevitably follows the launch of a hot new web app platform leads to what we ’ve termed app fatigue .
Once the number of apps hits a saturation point , people start feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of applications they ’re presented with in the given app store or application gallery .
That in turn leads to increased selectivity and the potential for people to dismiss the entire platform as just a collection of trivial time wasters .
This is what happened to Facebook .
When the platform launched , there was a huge amount of buzz around the potential for advertisers and app developers .
Subsequently , a huge number of applications were created on the platform and users were faced with a rising tide of apps that demanded their attention .
End result : app fatigue .
We started seeing app fatigue set in less than a year after the platform ’s launch when there were just over 15,000 total applications — there are now over 53,000 apps on the Facebook platform , according to Adomonics .
Facebook has done some things to try to address the app fatigue and discovery issues — via design tweaks and rules on how apps can spread , but nothing has so far worked very well .
Eventually , people who were once heavily invested in the success of the Facebook platform actually declared it dead .
The same thing looks like it might be happening with the much vaunted iPhone platform .
In November we reported that the iPhone platform had crossed the 10,000 app mark , but we wondered how many are really worth your time .
“ The comparison with the Facebook platform is unavoidable , ” we wrote in November .
“ Though there are clearly many differences ( iPhone developers can charge for apps , for example , and iPhone users , since they paid for the phone and monthly service , are likely more willing on the whole to pay for apps ) , there are also similarities , so the comparison is warranted .
As more and more developers flock to these platforms to try to make a quick buck , the noise level inevitably rises .
We ’re seeing it on Facebook , where the number of apps continues to grow steadily , but user engagement has leveled off . ”
( Note : there are about 5,000 new apps on the Facebook platform since November 30 when we ran that post , according to Adomonics numbers . )
The number one paid app right now in the iTunes App Store is iFart Mobile ( iTunes ) , an application that simulates farting noises .
Clearly , there must be some market for this $ 0.99 app , but it is also the type of silly / useless application that pushes down the good stuff while raising the noise level and might ultimately lead the iPhone application platform down the same path that Facebook ’s has taken .
A recent survey from Compete found that 45 % of iPhone owners had added 11 or more apps from the App Store .
Compete concluded then ( November ) , that “ part of the application appeal may be how easy it is to find and add them to the iPhone . ”
By controlling distribution of applications , Apple has made it simpler for users to find and install apps on their phone platform .
It ’s a model that others are starting to emulate — there are now app stores available or coming from Microsoft , Blackberry , Google / Android , Nokia , Yahoo ! , O2 , and Palm .
The flood of applications is already becoming a problem , though .
“ With such a wide variety of platforms , stores , and applications , discovery is actually becoming the big problem these days , ” writes Mobile Advertising News .
The big issue for these platforms is n’t so much how many apps are worth your time — with tens of thousands of applications there are undoubtedly a large number of good ones — but rather , how to weed out worthwhile apps from the fluff .
With such a high level of noise , the signal is being lost and fatigue is setting in , causing users to lose interest .
We ’re not sure what the solution is , but clearly app fatigue is already visible on the horizon for iPhone users , and it ’s already plaguing Facebook users .
We predicted in October that fluff apps would start to fade away on the Facebook platform as developers determined that the opportunity to make a quick buck had passed , and eventually useful applications would rise up in their place to form a smaller , but more valuable application ecosystem .
It was a nice theory , but so far nothing has happened to make us think that will actually come to pass .
Perhaps , though , that ’s just the necessary evolution of any new web app platform — launch , hype , land grab , overload , fatigue , fall off … then , rebirth ?
We ’ll see .
Let us know your thoughts in the comments .
How many apps have you installed on social networks or on your smartphone ?
With the sheer number of apps available are your starting to feel overloaded ?
Are you starting to notice discovery becoming a problem as noise levels rise ?
I just got around to going back for this clip but it 's worth sharing .
Jon Stewart smacks down John Sununu for Republican hypocrisy over their sudden new found religion on deficits now that it's for domestic spending and trying to get our economy out of a free fall , not wanting to regulate industry as well as their lack of concern for our future generations paying back what the occupation in Iraq and the Bush tax cuts have added to the deficit .
John Amato :
Stewart also asks Sununu if Judd Gregg just learned that he was a conservative ?
Would n't he have known that two weeks ago ?
And then Jon talks about how the Bush tax cuts killed the Fed budget and , well ... you know ...
Stewart : I 'm not an economist , but let 's say I start out with a surplus and I say lets have a tax cut to stimulate the economy , lets make it 1.2 trillion dollars and that surplus turns into a deficit .
Why would I at that point go , hey you know what could fix that ?
A tax cut .
Heather :
As much as the villagers are trying to protect the Republicans over their Bush behavior , the only ones that are left to expose them are the late night comedy / talk show battles as of late .
Whether anyone thinks SNL's skit of the Republican leadership was funny or not , which I actually did n't think was all that funny , does n't really matter and that was not what I was trying to convey by posting it .
I posted it because like this clip , their two faced concern over how our tax payer dollars are spent is being made a mockery of as it should be .
It 's just sad that our MSM is so corrupted they 're not reflecting how they should be scorned for their actions and it's taking our comedians to call them out for it , whether anyone thinks they are funny or not .
Yes , he smoked it .
But Michael Phelps has not gone to pot just yet .
There ’s a “ Phelps backlash ” out there .
Fans and sympathizers have issued a cheeky call to boycott Kellogg ’s , the cereal and snack megamanufacturer that dropped the Olympic swimmer ’s lucrative endorsement contract after his experience with marijuana became public a week ago .
“ Kellogg ’s has profited for decades on the food tastes of marijuana - using Americans with the munchies .
In fact , we believe that most people over the age of 12 would not eat Kellogg ’s products were they not wicked high , ” reads a multipart petition written by Lee Stranahan , a Los Angeles writer and filmmaker .
Pop -Tarts , Cheez - Its and other junk - food favorites of marijuana users figure prominently in the drive , along with mentions of the “ freaky ” lifestyle of John Harvey Kellogg , who founded the company in 1906 .
Mr. Stranahan ’s petition was featured Friday at the online Huffington Post and elsewhere .
“ I was cracking a bunch of jokes about it on Twitter , ” he said , referring to the popular Internet social network that showcases instant reports from millions of visitors .
“ Then came a serious tipping point .
It became evident that more people than not thought that what happened to Michael Phelps was ridiculous .
It ’s not like he was standing on the street in a Snoop Dogg T - shirt , smoking a joint .
His privacy was violated , ” Mr. Stranahan said .
“ What makes people mad is that Kellogg ’s knew he had a driving - under - the - influence charge when he was 19 , and yet they still sponsored him . ”
The fuss has sparked controversy over Mr. Phelps ’ fitness as a role model , the state of marijuana laws , the commercialization of sports figures and the health risks for a swimmer who inhales recreational smoke .
“ People who abuse marijuana are at risk of injuring their lungs through exposure to respiratory irritants and carcinogens found in marijuana smoke , ” said the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which also noted that users are more susceptible to psychoses , depression , anxiety , chest colds , coughs , bronchitis and spikes in normal heart rate of up to 50 beats per minute .
Kellogg ’s , which announced late Thursday that it would not renew Mr. Phelps endorsement contract at the end of the month , has already set up an toll - free line for consumers who want to weigh in on the situtation , pro or con .
He has been formally disciplined as well .
USA Swimming , the national governing body for the sport , suspended Mr. Phelps from swimming competitively for three months .
Among the sponsors , Kellogg ’s stands alone in its harsh judgment so far .
Others commercial backers — including Speedo , Omega and Visa — appear satisfied with Mr. Phelps ’ public apology for “ regrettable behavior ” and “ bad judgment , ” which was made after a British tabloid published a photo of the record - breaking Olympic athlete smoking marijuana at a college house party in November .
None have canceled their reported million - dollar sponsorships with Mr. Phelps , who won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and has 14 Olympic gold medals overall — both records .
“ We have spoken with Michael , and he has expressed regret for the situation , has committed to being accountable and improving his judgment in the future , ” Visa said .
“ We intend to support him as he looks to move forward . ”
Some athletes also are coming to his defense .
Mark Spitz , who won seven swimming medals in the 1972 Munich Olympics , expressed his sympathy for Mr. Phelps this week to the press , though he prefaced his feelings with the phrase , “ as strictly a fan , ” and offered no further comment .
“ It is obvious that all sportsmen should set an example to youngsters , but Phelps has asked for forgiveness and faced up to things , ” Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo said .
Jon Urbanchek , a University of Michigan coach who worked with Mr. Phelps before the 2008 Olympics , said Friday that he had not “ lost the support of the Michigan family , ” according to the Detroit Free Press .
“ He needs guidance , ” Mr. Urbanchek said .
“ Businesses look at him as a commodity .
But Michael is more than a commodity to me .
He ’s a human being and he needs love and affection , and periodically he needs a shoe up his you know what .
That ’s how kids are . ”

Court grants motion to search White House computers and preserve emails Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday January 14 , 2009
Print This Email This Update : Justice Department lawyer says missing emails may have been found Hours after a District Court judge ordered employees of the president 's executive office to search for missing White House emails from 2003 - 05 , a Justice Department lawyer disclosed that a successful search for the emails has already been concluded .
The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Helen H. Hong had stated at a court hearing that " private contractors had helped find the e-mails by searching through an estimated 60,000 tapes that contain daily recordings of the entire contents of the White House computers as a precaution against an electronic disaster . "
The judge 's order came in response to a lawsuit by two watchdog groups .
Anne Weisman , the counsel for one of those groups , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , responded to the Justice Department announcement by saying , " I 'll believe it when I see it . "
She noted that officials have not described the procedures used to recover the emails and that she hoped their results could be verified by an independent expert .
The district court had granted an emergency request for an extended order " to protect missing White House e-mails , " according to a press release from the second group , the National Security Archive , an independent non-governmental research institute .
With President - elect Obama 's inauguration looming just days away , the District Court of the District of Columbia issued the directive instructing the Executive Office of the President ( EOP ) to search its computers and ordering EOP staff " to surrender any media in their possession that may contain e-mails from March 2003 to October 2005 . "
In February of 2008 , a former Bush administration employee said at a congressional hearing that the White House 's " primitive " archiving system may have lost more than a million emails over 1,000 days .
Soon after Bush was first elected , as RAW STORY reported last November , the White House dismantled the records management system that President Bill Clinton had implemented , replacing it with an unreliable system that led to the massive number of email deletions from White House servers .
Similar communications losses apparently struck former top Bush adviser Karl Rove , when a Republican National Committee lawyer admitted in 2007 that at least four years of emails sent by Rove had " gone missing . "
The admission came as Congress investigated the controversial dismissals of US Attorneys by the Bush Justice Department .
Presently , all remaining Bush White House records are scheduled for transfer to the National Archives and Records Administration in less than a week .
" There is nothing like a deadline to clarify the issues , " said the institute 's director .
" In six days the Bush Executive Office of the President will be gone and without this order , their records may disappear with them .
The White House will complain about the last minute challenge , but this is a records crisis of the White House 's own making . "
Excerpts from the Archive press release , available in full at this link , follow ...
###
Counsel for the Archive , Sheila Shadmand from Jones Day made clear : " The White House has been on notice since we filed our lawsuit a year and a half ago that they would have to retrieve and preserve their e-mail .
Instead of coming clean and telling the public what they have been doing to solve the crisis , they refused to say anything .
At this point , it is critical to preserve evidence that can help get to the bottom of the problem and prevent it from happening again . "
Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola has scheduled an emergency status conference today at 2 p.m. to consider additional measures that may be necessary to protect the records during the transition .
( Courtroom 6 of the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse )
The Archive filed its emergency motion for an extended preservation order on March 11 , 2008 .
After considering the objections of the White House , Magistrate Judge Facciola issued two reports , on April 24 and July 29 , 2008 , recommending that District Judge Henry H. Kennedy issue an order requiring search , surrender and preservation of the computer workstations and external media devices , such as CDs , DVDs , memory sticks , and external hard drives .
Today 's order adopts those reports and recommendations , granting in part the Archive 's emergency motion .
The National Security Archive filed its lawsuit on September 5 , 2007 against the Executive Office of the President and NARA , seeking to preserve and restore missing White House e-mails .
A virtually identical lawsuit filed subsequently by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) has been consolidated with the Archive 's lawsuit .

Sad news today : Word has come that actor Ricardo Montalbán , most famous for his portrayals of Mr. Roarke on the TV show " Fantasy Island " and Khan Noonien Singh in Star Trek , has passed away at the age of 88 .
The cause of his death has not been released as yet .
And more sad news , alas , for Patrick McGoohan , the star ( and sometimes writer ) of the cult TV series " The Prisoner , " has passed away ( yesterday ) at the age of 80 after a short illness .
The Science Fiction world is reeling from both losses .
" The Prisoner " is not a well - known series outside of geekdom , but I think it 's fair to say that without its influence the character of the better TV dramas today would be quite different , and McGoohan was the main reason for its success and status as a cult classic .
And the world would surely be a different place without Montalbán 's contributions as one of the most instantly recognizable actors ( with one of the most instantly recognizable voices ) of his , or possibly any generation .
We at GeekDad extend our sincerest condolences to the families and friends of both men .
The world is surely a poorer place for their loss .
Rest in peace , gentlemen .
Do you ever get the feeling that things are , oh , I do n't know , a tad unbalanced in this country ?
A majority of America 's largest publicly traded companies and the U.S. government 's largest federal contractors -- including some receiving millions in federal bailout money -- use multiple subsidiaries in offshore tax havens to conduct business and avoid paying U.S. taxes , a new report finds .
The new Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) report , released today by Sens. Byron L. Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) and Carl M. Levin ( D - Mich . ) , lists Citigroup and Morgan Stanley as having set up hundreds of tax haven subsidiaries , along with American International Group and Bank of America .
Also in the tax - haven list are well - known companies and such federal contractors as American Express , Pepsi and Caterpillar .
GAO , searching publicly available data filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , determined that 83 of the 100 largest publicly traded corporations and 63 of the 100 largest federal contractors maintain subsidiaries in countries generally considered havens for avoiding taxes .
Dorgan and Levin said they requested the updated report from one several years ago because they are focused on combating offshore tax abuses , which they estimated cause $ 100 billion in lost U.S. tax revenue each year .
GAO auditors did not review the companies ' transactions to independently verify that the subsidiaries helped the companies reduce their tax burden .
The GAO said only that the companies had subsidiaries located in jurisdictions considered tax havens and that historically the purpose of those subsidiaries is to cut tax costs .
The practice is legal , but Dorgan and Levin are hoping to gain the support of President - elect Barack Obama for legislation that would outlaw it .
To illustrate the problem , Levin said the report found that Citigroup has set up 427 tax haven subsidiaries to conduct its business , including 91 in Luxembourg , 90 in the Cayman Islands and 35 in the British Virgin Islands .
He said other havens include Switzerland , Hong Kong , Panama and Mauritius .
Prince Harry and Chelsy Davy Split
After five years of an on again , off again relationship , the royal palace has confirmed thatand Zimbabwe bornhave ended their relationship , stating that the union has run its course and the two will remain friends .
That 's what they all say - friends schmends !
Chelsy , daughter of a millionaire safari operator , is going to embark on a career in law and finds dating the Prince to be very limiting .
Others are saying it had everything to do with Harry 's ' playboy ' ways .
Recently Prince
Harry came under fire for making racist remarks ( check out the video here ) .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A paralegal , recently laid off , wanted to get back at the “ establishment ” that he felt was to blame for his lost job .
So when he craved an expensive new tie , he went out and stole one .
The story , relayed by psychiatrist Timothy Fong at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute and Hospital , is an example of the rash behaviors exhibited by more Americans as a recession undermines a lifestyle built on spending .
In the coming months , mental health experts expect a rise in theft , depression , drug use , anxiety and even violence as consumers confront a harsh new reality and must live within diminished means .
“ People start seeing their economic situation change , and it stimulates a sort of survival panic , ” said Gaetano Vaccaro , deputy clinical director of Moonview Sanctuary , which treats patients for emotional and behavioral disorders .
“ When we are in a survival panic , we are prone to really extreme behaviors . ”
The U.S. recession that took hold in December last year has threatened personal finances in many ways as home prices fall , investments sour , retirement funds shrink , access to credit diminishes and jobs evaporate .
It is also a rude awakening for a generation of shoppers who grew up on easy access to credit and have never had to limit purchases to simply what they needed or could afford .
Instead , buying and consuming have become part of the national culture , with many people using what is in their shopping bags to express their own identity , from the latest gadgets to designer handbags .
For those who need to abruptly curtail spending , that leaves a major void , said James Gottfurcht , clinical psychologist and president of “ Psychology of Money Consultants , ” which coaches clients on money issues .
“ People that have been ... identifying with and defining themselves by their material objects and expenditures are losing a definite piece of their identity and themselves , ” he said .
“ They have to learn how to replace that . ”

DEPRESSION TRIGGER
Beth Rosenberg , a New York freelance educator and self - professed bargain hunter , said she stopped shopping for herself after her husband lost his publishing job in June .
She is now buying her son toys from the popular movie Madagascar for $ 2 at McDonald ’s , and is wearing clothes that have hung untouched in her closet for years .
She said it has been stressful to stick to an austere budget after she used to easily splurge on $ 100 boots .
“ I miss it , ” she said of shopping .
Resisting temptation now could be even more difficult , as struggling retailers roll out massive discounts to lure shoppers during the holiday season .
Fueled by easy access to credit , a housing market boom and rising investments , U.S. household spending accelerated in much of the past decade while the savings rate declined .
After the attacks of September 11 , 2001 killed thousands and shuttered U.S. financial markets , consumers were encouraged by politicians and business leaders to spend as a way of saving the economy and proving capitalism could not be crushed .
“ We ’re getting these messages that it is , in effect , patriotic to spend money , ” said Stuart Vyse , a psychology professor and author of “ Going Broke : Why Americans Ca n’t Hold On To Their Money . ”
The United States is deeply dependent on such spending , with consumption generating two - thirds of economic activity .
But problems arise when consumers become dependent on buying goods and services to cope with their emotions , Vaccaro said .
“ We have difficulty handling our internal emotional state in other ways when we ca n’t do that , ” he said , prompting some to seek out immediate gratification through drugs or alcohol .
MOURNING A WAY OF LIFE
Besides an increase in shoplifting , psychologists said retailers need to be prepared for more instances of violent behavior like that seen at a Wal - Mart store in Long Island , New York the day after Thanksgiving .
“ I would n’t be surprised if we see an uptick in crime , related to stealing , ” said UCLA ’s Fong .
“ I would n’t be surprised if we see more workplace violence and more violence at the malls . ”
A throng of shoppers seeking rock bottom prices on flat - screen TVs and computers surged into the Wal - Mart store in predawn hours , trampling and killing a worker in the process .
Fong said many shoppers have never stopped to think about why they were buying items , and it was easy to ignore looking deeper during a boom that support such spending .
But now , patients that can no longer shop to relieve stress have become anxious or depressed , he said .
Others fume : “ ‘ I used to be able to afford that , I should be able to afford that now , I deserve that stuff , ’ ” he said .
But Vaccaro said the downturn could be a time for shoppers to pause and study what they are attempting to achieve or what void they are attempting to fill by spending .
“ We do n’t buy products , we buy feelings , ” Vaccaro said .
“ We ’re buying the anticipation of the feeling that we think that product or service is going to give us . ”
Gottfurcht said he encourages clients to take a walk or do some deep breathing before making a purchase to avoid an impulsive buy .
He also recommended that clients keep a journal , noting how they felt when bought an item .
He said clients should then check the list a week later to see if the “ glow ” of that purchase has worn off , and it only satisfied an immediate want , not a true need .
The greater opportunity of the downturn , Vaccaro said , is that it represents a chance to move away from “ irrational ” and “ careless ” consumerism toward “ a more discerning consumer . ”
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Israeli forces shelled a house where they had ordered about 100 Palestinian civilians to take shelter , killing about 30 people and wounding many more , witnesses told the U.N .
Ambulance drivers wait for Israel and the Red Cross to give them the green light Thursday to leave Gaza City .

Israel Defense Forces said it is looking into the allegations .
" Credible eyewitness accounts " described the incident , which occurred in the volatile Gaza City suburb of Zeitoun , said Allegra Pacheco , deputy head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for the Palestinian territories .
Pacheco spoke to CNN on Friday .
Witnesses reported that " about 100 civilians were evacuated " to a house Sunday , and the structure was shelled Monday , she said .
The witnesses told the U.N. that two of the survivors said their children died .
" There was no order given to move civilians from one building into another , " Israeli security sources said .
However , Pacheco said , " The eyewitness accounts that we have received state that the IDF ordered them to go into this house . "

Officials are simply passing along witness reports and not making " accusations of deliberate actions or any legal conclusions on the part of the IDF , " Pacheco said .
" There needs to be further fact - finding on what occurred in this house , " she said , adding that U.N. officials have yet to speak to the IDF and the Israeli government .
Her remarks came a day after the International Committee of the Red Cross issued a blunt press release saying ambulances obtained access to several houses in Zeitoun " affected by Israel shelling , " days after they asked to go into the neighborhood .
The release slammed Israel -- an uncharacteristic move for the agency , which is known for its neutrality and quiet , behind - the - scenes activities .
According to the release , the ICRC had wanted " safe passage for ambulances " to the neighborhood since Saturday , but did n't receive IDF permission until Wednesday .
The ICRC and the Palestine Red Crescent Society " found four small children next to their dead mothers in one of the houses .
They were too weak to stand up on their own .
One man was also found alive , too weak to stand up .
In all , there were 12 corpses lying on mattresses , " the ICRC said .
Watch how the conflict is taking a toll on children »
Rescue teams found 15 wounded people and three corpses in other houses , said the ICRC , which casts the shelling as a single incident .
" The ICRC believes that in this instance the Israeli military failed to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuate the wounded .
It considers the delay in allowing rescue services access unacceptable , " the ICRC said .
Pacheco said she could not say if the incident witnesses described to the U.N. was the same incident in the ICRC report .
But they took place in the same area , she said .
" In the Zeitoun area , it 's been a closed area , and there has been fighting and there have been injured .
There are other homes and buildings where there were injured who were not evacuated , " she said .
Witnesses told the U.N. they had been calling for ambulances to collect dead and wounded people in the Zeitoun buildings , she said .
" This was very much similar to what the ICRC reported yesterday as to what the medical personnel found when they went into the neighborhood , " Pacheco said .
The Israeli army built earthen walls that made ambulance access to the neighborhood impossible , the ICRC said .
" The children and the wounded had to be taken to the ambulances on a donkey cart , " the ICRC said .
Pierre Wettach , the ICRC's head of delegation for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories , called the shelling incident " shocking . "
See how the Gaza conflict unfolded »
" The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded .
Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestine Red Crescent to assist the wounded , " he said in the ICRC news release .
Pacheco on Friday described " a serious protection crisis " in Gaza where civilians are " very vulnerable " to death and injury .
" There is no safe space for civilians .
There are no bomb shelters , safe havens , places to flee , " she said .
Research Box Title
Brown dwarfs , objects that are less massive than stars but larger than planets , just got more elusive , based on a study of 233 nearby multiple - star systems by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope .
Hubble found only two brown dwarfs as companions to normal stars .
This means the so - called " brown dwarf desert " ( the absence of brown dwarfs around solar - type stars ) extends to the smallest stars in the universe .
Sergio Dieterich of Georgia State University in Atlanta and team leader of the study is reporting the results today at the 213th meeting of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) in Long Beach , Calif .
" We still did not find brown dwarfs around small red stars whose mass is only slightly above the hydrogen burning limit .
Especially when we consider the fact that brown dwarfs binaries do exist , the fact that there are very few binaries whose components lie on different sides of the hydrogen burning limit is significant , " says Dieterich .
The 233 stars surveyed are part of the RECONS ( Research Consortium on Nearby Stars ) survey meant to understand the nature of the sun 's nearest stellar neighbors , both individually and as a population .
The current primary goals are to discover and characterize " missing " members of the sample of stars within 32.6 light - years ( 10 parsecs ) of Earth .
RECONS searches for nearby stars through analyzing existing all - sky surveys , combined with observations by a variety of telescopes in both hemispheres .
A total of 12 brown dwarfs are currently known within 32.6 light - years of Earth , as compared to 239 red dwarf stars ( stars that are largely 20 percent the mass of our sun and are roughly half its diameter and temperature ) .
In fact , the number of known brown dwarfs is close to that of known extrasolar planets .
However , the number of exoplanets known in this region so far is very likely only a lower limit as smaller - mass exoplanets are not within our capability of detection at present .
The Hubble survey , taken with Hubble 's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer ( NICMOS ) , provides strong statistics pointing to the fact that brown dwarfs do not exist around even the least massive stars .
" If mass ratio was the driving factor we would expect to find more brown dwarfs around small red stars than around solar type stars , " says Dieterich .
These results are complementary to another study also being reported at the AAS meeting by Micaela Stumpf of the Max - Planck - Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg , Germany .
The results imply that brown dwarfs tend to hang out with their own kind .
Nearly ten years ' worth of NICMOS observations , combined with recent ground - based adaptive optics results , have provided a first estimate of the orbit of the double brown dwarf system Kelu - 1 AB .
The eccentric orbit is tilted nearly edge - on to Earth and the dwarfs complete an orbit every 38 years .
Based on the orbital dynamics , the total mass of the system is estimated to be 184 Jupiter masses .
But , based on spectroscopic and photometric measurements , the two brown dwarfs are no larger than 61 and 50 Jupiter masses , respectively ( a star is no smaller than 75 Jupiter masses ) .
Stumpf is reporting that there may in fact be a third member of the system to account for the " missing mass . "
This would make it potentially the first - ever confirmed triple brown dwarf system .
All - sky surveys planned for the next decade , with advanced telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope , promise to ultimately solve the puzzle of the " brown dwarf desert " by doing deep infrared searches for the underlying brown dwarf population .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Citigroup
Inc faced growing uncertainty on Wednesday about whether it could ever function well , leading investors to drive its shares down below $ 5.00 to their lowest level since the bank won a government rescue in November .
More bad news is expected on Friday , when the bank plans to report quarterly results , six days ahead of schedule .
A fifth straight multibillion - dollar loss is expected .
The bank is also widely expected on Friday to provide details on a comprehensive downsizing designed to ensure its survival .
Rival JPMorgan Chase &
Co also moved up its earnings release six days , and is due to report on Thursday .
Once the world ’s largest bank , Citigroup is expected to shrink by about a third as it focuses on corporate , investment and retail banking and trims its trading operations , a person familiar with the plan said .
Citigroup will also put businesses and assets it no longer wants into a separate structure , with an eye toward eventual sales , the person said .
This follows infusions of $ 45 billion of taxpayer funds from the Treasury Department ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program , including $ 20 billion in a November 23 bailout where the government agreed to share in losses in exchange for preferred stock and warrants .
That helped avoid a collapse , on the heels of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc bankruptcy on Sept 15 .
“ I really do n’t know how the unraveling finishes , ” said Henry Asher , president of Northstar Group Inc in New York .
“ It looks like the government is forcing a controlled descent , without going the full monty as it did with Lehman . ”
Shareholders are showing little patience .
In afternoon trading the bank ’s shares were down $ 1.32 , or 22.4 percent , to $ 4.58 .
They earlier hit their lowest level since the bank won the second government lifeline .
Citigroup is part of the Dow Jones industrial average .
Citigroup spokesman Michael Hanretta declined to comment .
ABOUT - FACE FOR CEO
Getting rid of major assets marks an about - face for Chief Executive Vikram Pandit , who had wanted to shrink the bank while retaining large parts of the “ financial supermarket ” model promoted by Sanford “ Sandy ” Weill , who created Citigroup in a 1998 merger .
Pandit turned 52 on Wednesday .
On Tuesday Citigroup announced plans to combine its Smith Barney brokerage and other units with Morgan Stanley ’s wealth management unit .
Morgan Stanley would pay $ 2.7 billion and take a 51 percent stake in the joint venture , with the ability to buy the rest after five years .
While the transaction would bolster Citigroup ’s balance sheet and result in a $ 5.8 billion gain , the decline in the bank ’s stock resembled the downdraft last November 17 - 21 , the week before Citigroup got the second TARP infusion .
Shares fell 60.4 percent that week , including 20 percent on Friday .
“ We continue to be concerned that weakness in Citigroup ’s share price may lead to lack of customer ( or government ) confidence , ” Barclays Capital analyst Jason Goldberg wrote on Wednesday .
A drumbeat of analysts has questioned whether regulators or Citigroup itself will give Pandit time to finish the job .
“ Regulators are concerned about the quality of the management that got us where we are in the banking industry , ” said Nancy Bush , an independent banking analyst and managing member of NAB Research LLC .
“ At Citigroup , the government has far more influence than on any other bank in the industry , and that ’s why there may be more force to bear there . ”
OUT OF TIME ?
Pandit became chief executive in December 2007 and inherited many problems from predecessor Charles Prince .

The bank has reported $ 20.3 billion of net losses , and taken more than $ 64 billion of credit losses and writedowns , since Pandit took over .
Oppenheimer & Co analyst Meredith Whitney , who was earlier than most analysts in recognizing the bank ’s problems , called the brokerage venture with Morgan Stanley merely “ a way for Citigroup to raise cash ” before releasing quarterly results .
She expects further asset sales and spinoffs .
But in tight credit markets , Citigroup ’s ability to spin off assets may be limited .
“ We question where the buyers will come from , since few are both large enough and strong enough , ” wrote David Trone , an analyst at Fox - Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller .
Trone rates Citigroup “ in line , ” while Whitney rates the bank “ underperform . ”
Critics have said Pandit , known from his days as a top Morgan Stanley executive as a brilliant but cautious leader , was not aggressive enough in tackling the morass that Citigroup ’s $ 2 trillion - plus balance sheet had become .
“ Many parts of Citigroup ’s business are wonderful and will get through this , ” Asher said .
“ But for Citigroup as a holding company , I do n’t think so . ”
Ten analysts who issued estimates in the last week forecast on average that Citigroup would report a fourth - quarter loss of 94 cents per share , according to Reuters Estimates .
The annual cost of protecting $ 10 million of Citigroup debt against default for five years rose to $ 410,000 on Wednesday from $ 265,000 on Tuesday , according to Phoenix Partners Group .
yeah i played this a month ago , but i DL'd it hoping to see something different .
unfortunately nothing changed .
RE4 was awesome .
this is " RE4 turbo remix . "
i'm calling it now - reviewers will complain that :
1. controls are crap .
which they are , but honestly it would n't be RE without crap controls .
2. it 's not scary .
at all .
RE4 had a few good moments , and 5 will likely be the same .
the uneasy feeling that a RE game SHOULD give you has n't been there since RE2 .
3. your partner is an idiot .
she is indeed dumb , but you really owe it to yourself to play this via online co-op .
4. enemy AI is beyond stupid .
hopefully this changes , but having an enemy run up to you with an axe , screaming , only to stop just before coming into contact with you is hilarious .
OMG he 's running at me !
oh wait , he stopped for me so i can headshot him .
SFist reader Jennie H. sends us this image she snapped up , telling us " I saw this while riding the train yesterday afternoon .

The family of an 89 - year - old man shot with a Taser stun gun by police yesterday spoke of their anger at his treatment .
Officers fired the 50,000 - volt weapon at the war veteran after he disappeared from his care home and threatened to cut his throat with a piece of broken glass .
He is the oldest man to have had a Taser used on him .
Police said they had taken the decision to stun him for his own safety .
Shocking :
The pensioner was stunned by the gun , like above , after threatening to cut his own throat with broken glass ( file picture )
But yesterday relatives demanded an inquiry saying it was amazing that he had n't suffered a heart attack .
The retired carpenter , who has not been named , is now recovering in hospital .
He was found wandering around Llandudno , North Wales , early on Saturday morning in a confused state .
After he threatened to kill himself , police shot him with the gun , which fires darts attached to lengths of wire which carry an electric charge , causing temporary paralysis .
He was treated for minor injuries caused by the shard of glass that he was holding , before being referred to a psychiatric unit where he is said to be traumatised by his ordeal .
North Wales Police said they were not referring the incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission , but yesterday his family said they were determined to force an inquiry .
His sister - in - law said : ' It 's diabolical what they did to an old man .
I 've told officers : " How would you like it to happen to your old Dad ? "
I 'm lodging an official complaint . '
The man 's nephew , an engineer , added that his uncle had gone into a residential home three weeks earlier , apparently suffering from the onset of Alzheimer 's disease .
' He did n't like it there and walked out a few days later , and then again on Saturday , ' he said .
' We 've been to see him in hospital and he seems better than for a long time .
He can remember what happened with the Taser .
He says the pain was excruciating and that he was frightened to death .
' The police say he was holding a shard of glass to his neck but we think they should have tried persuasion .
It 's a miracle he did n't have a heart attack on the spot .
Of course we are angry .
We 've been told his arms were handcuffed behind his back , which we do n't think is the way to treat an old man who had never been in trouble in his life . '
A police spokesman said : ' In the circumstances the specially trained officers made the judgment , in order to protect the life of the man , that the use of Taser was the safest and most appropriate option . '
The IPCC said it would investigate if it received a complaint .
Hailed as a non-lethal alternative to firearms , Tasers , which have a range of around 20ft , have been linked by human rights groups with hundreds of deaths in the U.S. and Canada .
Experts have warned against using them on children and vulnerable adults because of the risk that they can trigger a heart attack .
However , they are now widely used , with the Government in the process of issuing forces around the country with a further 10,000 .
The giant moa was one of 10 or so species of moa birds that lived in New Zealand and went extinct some 600 or so years ago .
Giant birds camping out in caves and rock shelters thousands of years ago left behind enormous feces , reaching nearly half a foot in length .
The preserved poop reveals what the now - extinct birds munched on so long ago .
The fossilized feces — more than 1,500 pieces — were discovered beneath cave floors and rock shelters in remote areas across southern New Zealand .
The feces primarily came from species of the extinct giant moa , flightless birds that weighed up to 550 pounds ( 250 kg ) and stood at nearly 10 feet ( three meters ) .
The researchers analyzed some of the feces thought to belong to moa due to the large size , picking through the defecated material for bits of plants , seeds and leafy material .
DNA analyses found some of the feces came from at least four moa species , including the South Island giant moa ( Dinornis robustus ) , upland moa ( Megalapteryx didinus ) , heavy - footed moa ( Pachyornis elephantopus ) and stout - legged moa ( Euryapteryx gravis ) .
The researchers suggest all moa were probably eating a variety of plants , dominated by herbs and sub - shrubs ( shrubs less than about 3 feet , or 1 meter , tall ) .
" Surprisingly for such large birds , over half the plants we detected in the feces were under 30 centimeters ( 1 foot ) in height , " said study researcher Jamie Wood of the University of Otago in New Zealand .
" This suggests that some moa grazed on tiny herbs , in contrast to the current view of them as mainly shrub and tree browsers . "
He added , " We also found many plant species that are currently threatened or rare , suggesting that the extinction of the moa has impacted their ability to reproduce or disperse . "
Feces recovered in the same area likely came from other extinct birds , including the South Island goose ( Cnemiornis calcitrans ) and Finsch 's duck ( Chenonetta finschi ) .
" When animals shelter in caves and rock shelters , they leave feces which can survive for thousands of years if dried out , " said study researcher Alan Cooper of the University of Adelaide in Australia .
" Given the arid conditions , Australia should probably have similar deposits from the extinct giant marsupials .
A key question for us is , ' Where has all the Australian poo gone ? ' "
The research is published in the December issue of the journal Quaternary Science Reviews .
This chapter introduces and explains all the key regular expression concepts and shows pure regular expression syntax , and then shows how to use regular expressions in the context of Python programming .

Python ’s Regular Expression Language
The Regular Expression Module
A regular expression is a compact notation for representing a collection of strings .
What makes regular expressions so powerful is that a single regular expression can represent an unlimited number of strings — providing they meet the regular expression ’s requirements .
Regular expressions ( which we will mostly call “ regexes ” from now on ) are defined using a mini-language that is completely different from Python — but Python includes the re module through which we can seamlessly create and use regexes .*
Regexes are used for four main purposes :
Validation : checking whether a piece of text meets some criteria , for example , contains a currency symbol followed by digits
Searching : locating substrings that can have more than one form , for example , finding any of “ pet.png ” , “ pet.jpg ” , “ pet.jpeg ” , or “ pet.svg ” while avoiding “ carpet.png ” and similar
Searching and replacing : replacing everywhere the regex matches with a string , for example , finding “ bicycle ” or “ human powered vehicle ” and replacing either with “ bike ”
Splitting strings : splitting a string at each place the regex matches , for example , splitting everywhere “ : ” or “ = ” is encountered
At its simplest a regular expression is an expression ( e.g. , a literal character ) , optionally followed by a quantifier .
More complex regexes consist of any number of quantified expressions and may include assertions and may be influenced by flags .
This chapter ’s first section introduces and explains all the key regular expression concepts and shows pure regular expression syntax — it makes minimal reference to Python itself .
Then the second section shows how to use regular expressions in the context of Python programming , drawing on all the material covered in the earlier sections .
Readers familiar with regular expressions who just want to learn how they work in Python could skip to the second section ( starting on page 455 ) .
The chapter covers the complete regex language offered by the re module , including all the assertions and flags .
We indicate regular expressions in the text using bold , show where they match using underlining , and show captures using shading .
Python ’s Regular Expression Language
In this section we look at the regular expression language in four subsections .
The first subsection shows how to match individual characters or groups of characters , for example , match a , or match b , or match either a or b .
The second subsection shows how to quantify matches , for example , match once , or match at least once , or match as many times as possible .
The third subsection shows how to group subexpressions and how to capture matching text , and the final subsection shows how to use the language ’s assertions and flags to affect how regular expressions work .
Characters and Character Classes
The simplest expressions are just literal characters , such as a or 5 , and if no quantifier is explicitly given it is taken to be “ match one occurrence ” .
For example , the regex tune consists of four expressions , each implicitly quantified to match once , so it matches one t followed by one u followed by one n followed by one e , and hence matches the strings tune and at tuned .
Although most characters can be used as literals , some are “ special characters ” — these are symbols in the regex language and so must be escaped by preceding them with a backslash ( \ ) to use them as literals .
The special characters are \.^$ ?+*{ } [ ] ( ) | .
Most of Python ’s standard string escapes can also be used within regexes , for example ,
for newline and \t for tab , as well as hexadecimal escapes for characters using the \x HH , \u HHHH , and \U HHHHHHHH syntaxes .
String escapes 62
In many cases , rather than matching one particular character we want to match any one of a set of characters .
This can be achieved by using a character class — one or more characters enclosed in square brackets .
( This has nothing to do with a Python class , and is simply the regex term for “ set of characters ” . )
A character class is an expression , and like any other expression , if not explicitly quantified it matches exactly one character ( which can be any of the characters in the character class ) .
For example , the regex r[ ea ] d matches both red and rad ar , but not read .
Similarly , to match a single digit we can use the regex [ 0123456789 ] .
For convenience we can specify a range of characters using a hyphen , so the regex [ 0 - 9 ] also matches a digit .
It is possible to negate the meaning of a character class by following the opening bracket with a caret , so [ ^0 - 9 ] matches any character that is not a digit .
Note that inside a character class , apart from \ , the special characters lose their special meaning , although in the case of ^ it acquires a new meaning ( negation ) if it is the first character in the character class , and otherwise is simply a literal caret .
Also , - signifies a character range unless it is the first character , in which case it is a literal hyphen .
Since some sets of characters are required so frequently , several have shorthand forms — these are shown in Table 12.1 .
With one exception the shorthands can be used inside character sets , so for example , the regex [ \dA - Fa-f ] matches any hexadecimal digit .
The exception is .
which is a shorthand outside a character class but matches a literal .
inside a character class .
Table 12.1 Character Class Shorthands
Symbol Meaning .
Matches any character except newline ; or any character at all with the re.DOTALL flag ; or inside a character class matches a literal .
\d Matches a Unicode digit ; or [ 0 - 9 ] with the re.ASCII flag \D Matches a Unicode nondigit ; or [ ^0 - 9 ] with the re .
ASCII flag \s Matches a Unicode whitespace ; or [ \t
\r\f\v ] with the re.ASCII flag \S Matches a Unicode nonwhitespace ; or [ ^ \t
\r\f\v ] with the re.ASCII flag \w Matches a Unicode “ word ” character ; or [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 _ ] with the re.
ASCII flag \W Matches a Unicode non -“ word ” character ; or [ ^a - zA - Z0 - 9 _ ] with the re .
ASCII flag
Meaning of the flags 451
Quantifiers
A quantifier has the form { m , n } where m and n are the minimum and maximum times the expression the quantifier applies to must match .
For example , both e{1,1}e { 1,1} and e{2,2} match f ee l , but neither matches felt .
Writing a quantifier after every expression would soon become tedious , and is certainly difficult to read .
Fortunately , the regex language supports several convenient shorthands .
If only one number is given in the quantifier it is taken to be both the minimum and the maximum , so e{2} is the same as e{2,2} .
And as we noted in the preceding section , if no quantifier is explicitly given , it is assumed to be one ( i.e. , { 1,1} or { 1} ) ; therefore , ee is the same as e{1,1}e { 1,1} and e{1}e{1} , so both e{2} and ee match f ee l but not felt .
Having a different minimum and maximum is often convenient .
For example , to match travelled and traveled ( both legitimate spellings ) , we could use either travel { 1, 2}ed or travell {0 , 1}ed .
The {0,1} quantification is so often used that it has its own shorthand form , ? , so another way of writing the regex ( and the one most likely to be used in practice ) is travell?ed .
Two other quantification shorthands are provided : + which stands for { 1 , n } ( “ at least one ” ) and * which stands for {0 , n } ( “ any number of ” ) ; in both cases n is the maximum possible number allowed for a quantifier , usually at least 32 767 .
All the quantifiers are shown in Table 12.2 .
Table 12.2 Regular Expression Quantifiers
Syntax Meaning e ? or e {0,1} Greedily match zero or one occurrence of expression e e ?? or e {0,1} ?
Nongreedily match zero or one occurrence of expression e e + or e { 1 , } Greedily match one or more occurrences of expression e e + or e { 1 , } Greedily match one or more occurrences of expression e e +? or e { 1,} ?
Nongreedily match one or more occurrences of expression e e * or e {0 , } Greedily match zero or more occurrences of expression e e *? or e {0,} ?
Nongreedily match zero or more occurrences of expression e e { m } Match exactly m occurrences of expression e e { m , } Greedily match at least m occurrences of expression e e { m , } ?
Nongreedily match at least m occurrences of expression e e { , n } Greedily match at most n occurrences of expression e e { , n } ?
Nongreedily match at most n occurrences of expression e e { m , n } Greedily match at least m and at most n occurrences of expression e e { m , n } ?
Nongreedily match at least m and at most n occurrences of expression e
The + quantifier is very useful .
For example , to match integers we could use \d + since this matches one or more digits .
This regex could match in two places in the string 4588.91 , for example , 4588 .91 and 4588 .
91 .
Sometimes typos are the result of pressing a key too long .
We could use the regex bevel+ed to match the legitimate beveled and bevelled , and the incorrect bevellled .
If we wanted to standardize on the one l spelling , and match only occurrences that had two or more ls , we could use bevell+ed to find them .
The * quantifier is less useful , simply because it can so often lead to unexpected results .
For example , supposing that we want to find lines that contain comments in Python files , we might try searching for #* .
But this regex will match any line whatsoever , including blank lines because the meaning is “ match any number of # s ” — and that includes none .
As a rule of thumb for those new to regexes , avoid using * at all , and if you do use it ( or if you use ? ) , make sure there is at least one other expression in the regex that has a nonzero quantifier — so at least one quantifier other than * or ?
since both of these can match their expression zero times .
It is often possible to convert * uses to + uses and vice versa .
For example , we could match “ tasselled ” with at least one l using tassell*ed or tassel+ed , and match those with two or more ls using tasselll*ed or tassell+ed .
If we use the regex \d + it will match 136 .
But why does it match all the digits , rather than just the first one ?
By default , all quantifiers are greedy — they match as many characters as they can .
We can make any quantifier nongreedy ( also called minimal ) by following it with a ?
symbol .
( The question mark has two different meanings — on its own it is a shorthand for the {0,1} quantifier , and when it follows a quantifier it tells the quantifier to be nongreedy . )
For example , \d+? can match the string 136 in three different places : 1 36 , 1 3 6 , and 13 6 .
Here is another example : \d ?? matches zero or one digits , but prefers to match none since it is nongreedy — on its own it suffers the same problem as * in that it will match nothing , that is , any text at all .
Nongreedy quantifiers can be useful for quick and dirty XML and HTML parsing .
For example , to match all the image tags , writing < img . *>
( match one “ < ” , then one “ i ” , then one “ m ” , then one “ g ” , then zero or more of any character apart from newline , then one “ > ” ) will not work because the .* part is greedy and will match everything including the tag ’s closing > , and will keep going until it reaches the last > in the entire text .
Three solutions present themselves ( apart from using a proper parser ) .
One is < img [ ^ > ]*>
( match < img , then any number of non- > characters and then the tag ’s closing > character ) , another is < img .*?>
( match <img , then any number of characters , but nongreedily , so it will stop immediately before the tag ’s closing > , and then the > ) , and a third combines both , as in < img [ ^ > ]*?> .
None of them is correct , though , since they can all match < img > , which is not valid .
Since we know that an image tag must have a src attribute , a more accurate regex is < img\s + [^>]*? src=\w +[^>]*?> .
This matches the literal characters < img , then one or more whitespace characters , then nongreedily zero or more of anything except > ( to skip any other attributes such as alt ) , then the src attribute ( the literal characters src= then at least one “ word ” character ) , and then any other non- > characters ( including none ) to account for any other attributes , and finally the closing > .
Grouping and Capturing
In practical applications we often need regexes that can match any one of two or more alternatives , and we often need to capture the match or some part of the match for further processing .
Also , we sometimes want a quantifier to apply to several expressions .
All of these can be achieved by grouping with ( ) , and in the case of alternatives using alternation with | .
Alternation is especially useful when we want to match any one of several quite different alternatives .
For example , the regex aircraft |airplane |jet will match any text that contains “ aircraft ” or “ airplane ” or “ jet ” .
The same thing can be achieved using the regex air ( craft|plane ) |jet .
Here , the parentheses are used to group expressions , so we have two outer expressions , air ( craft|plane ) and jet .
The first of these has an inner expression , craft|plane , and because this is preceded by air the first outer expression can match only “ aircraft ” or “ airplane ” .
Parentheses serve two different purposes — to group expressions and to capture the text that matches an expression .
We will use the term group to refer to a grouped expression whether it captures or not , and capture and capture group to refer to a captured group .
If we used the regex ( aircraft|airplane|jet ) it would not only match any of the three expressions , but would also capture whichever one was matched for later reference .
Compare this with the regex ( air( craft|plane ) | jet ) which has two captures if the first expression matches ( “ aircraft ” or “ airplane ” as the first capture and “ craft ” or “ plane ” as the second capture ) , and one capture if the second expression matches ( “ jet ” ) .
We can switch off the capturing effect by following an opening parenthesis with ? : , so for example , ( air ( ? : craft|plane ) | jet ) will have only one capture if it matches ( “ aircraft ” or “ airplane ” or “ jet ” ) .
A grouped expression is an expression and so can be quantified .
Like any other expression the quantity is assumed to be one unless explicitly given .
For example , if we have read a text file with lines of the form key=value , where each key is alphanumeric , the regex ( \w + ) =(.+ ) will match every line that has a nonempty key and a nonempty value .
( Recall that .
matches anything except newlines . )
And for every line that matches , two captures are made , the first being the key and the second being the value .
For example , the key=value regular expression will match the entire line topic = physical geography with the two captures shown shaded .
Notice that the second capture includes some whitespace , and that whitespace before the = is not accepted .
We could refine the regex to be more flexible in accepting whitespace , and to strip off unwanted whitespace using a somewhat longer version :
[ \t ] *( \w + ) [ \t ] *=[ \t ] *(.+)
This matches the same line as before and also lines that have whitespace around the = sign , but with the first capture having no leading or trailing whitespace , and the second capture having no leading whitespace .
For example : topic = physical geography .
We have been careful to keep the whitespace matching parts outside the capturing parentheses , and to allow for lines that have no whitespace at all .
We did not use \s to match whitespace because that matches newlines (
) which could lead to incorrect matches that span lines ( e.g. , if the re.
MULTILINE flag is used ) .
And for the value we did not use \S to match nonwhitespace because we want to allow for values that contain whitespace ( e.g. , English sentences ) .
To avoid the second capture having trailing whitespace we would need a more sophisticated regex ; we will see this in the next subsection .
Regex flags 460
Captures can be referred to using backreferences , that is , by referring back to an earlier capture group . *
One syntax for backreferences inside regexes themselves is \ i where i is the capture number .
Captures are numbered starting from one and increasing by one going from left to right as each new ( capturing ) left parenthesis is encountered .
For example , to simplistically match duplicated words we can use the regex ( \w+ ) \s+\1 which matches a “ word ” , then at least one whitespace , and then the same word as was captured .
( Capture number 0 is created automatically without the need for parentheses ; it holds the entire match , that is , what we show underlined . )
We will see a more sophisticated way to match duplicate words later .
In long or complicated regexes it is often more convenient to use names rather than numbers for captures .
This can also make maintenance easier since adding or removing capturing parentheses may change the numbers but wo n’t affect names .
To name a capture we follow the opening parenthesis with ?
P< name > .
For example , (? P < key >\w + ) =(? P< value >.+ ) has two captures called " key " and " value " .
The syntax for backreferences to named captures inside a regex is ( ? P= name ) .
For example , (? P < word >\w + ) \s+(?
P=word ) matches duplicate words using a capture called " word " .
Assertions and Flags
One problem that affects many of the regexes we have looked at so far is that they can match more or different text than we intended .
For example , the regex aircraft|airplane|jet will match “ waterjet ” and “ jetski ” as well as “ jet ” .
This kind of problem can be solved by using assertions .
An assertion does not match any text , but instead says something about the text at the point where the assertion occurs .
One assertion is \b ( word boundary ) , which asserts that the character that precedes it must be a “ word ” ( \w ) and the character that follows it must be a non“ word ” ( \ W ) , or vice versa .
For example , although the regex jet can match twice in the text the jet and jetski are noisy , that is , the jet and jetski are noisy , the regex \bjet\b will match only once , the jet and jetski are noisy .
In the context of the original regex , we could write it either as \baircraft \b| \bairplane \b|\bjet\b or more clearly as \b (?:aircraft|airplane|jet ) \b , that is , word boundary , noncapturing expression , word boundary .
Many other assertions are supported , as shown in Table 12.3 .
We could use assertions to improve the clarity of a key=value regex , for example , by changing it to ^( \w + ) = ( [ ^
]+ ) and setting the re.
MULTILINE flag to ensure that each key=value is taken from a single line with no possibility of spanning lines .
( The flags are shown in Table 12.5 on page 460 , and the syntaxes for using them are described at the end of this subsection and are shown in the next section . )
And if we also want to strip leading and trailing whitespace and use named captures , the full regex becomes :
^[ \t ] *(? P< key >\w + ) [ \t ] *=[ \ t ] *(? P< value > [ ^
] + ) (?<![ \t ] )
Table 12.3 Regular Expression Assertions
Symbol Meaning ^ Matches at the start ; also matches after each newline with the re.MULTILINE flag $ Matches at the end ; also matches before each newline with the re.
MULTILINE flag \A Matches at the start \b Matches at a “ word ” boundary ; influenced by the re .
ASCII flag — inside a character class this is the escape for the backspace character \B Matches at a non -“ word ” boundary ; influenced by the re .
ASCII flag \Z Matches at the end ( ?= e )
Matches if the expression e matches at this assertion but does not advance over it — called lookahead or positive lookahead ( ?! e )
Matches if the expression e does not match at this assertion and does not advance over it — called negative lookahead ( ?<= e )
Matches if the expression e matches immediately before this assertion — called positive lookbehind (?<! e )
Matches if the expression e does not match immediately before this assertion — called negative lookbehind
Regex flags 460
Even though this regex is designed for a fairly simple task , it looks quite complicated .
One way to make it more maintainable is to include comments in it .
This can be done by adding inline comments using the syntax ( ?# the comment ) , but in practice comments like this can easily make the regex even more difficult to read .
A much nicer solution is to use the re.VERBOSE flag — this allows us to freely use whitespace and normal Python comments in regexes , with the one constraint that if we need to match whitespace we must either use \s or a character class such as [ ] .
Here ’s the key=value regex with comments :
^ [ \t ] * # start of line and optional leading whitespace (? P< key >\w + ) # the key text [ \t ] *= [ \t ] * # the equals with optional surrounding whitespace ( ? P< value > [ ^
]+ ) # the value text ( ?<![ \t ] ) # negative lookbehind to avoid trailing whitespace
In the context of a Python program we would normally write a regex like this inside a raw triple quoted string — raw so that we do n’t have to double up the backslashes , and triple quoted so that we can spread it over multiple lines .
Raw strings
62
In addition to the assertions we have discussed so far , there are additional assertions which look at the text in front of ( or behind ) the assertion to see whether it matches ( or does not match ) an expression we specify .
The expressions that can be used in lookbehind assertions must be of fixed length ( so the quantifiers ? , + , and * cannot be used , and numeric quantifiers must be of a fixed size , for example , { 3} ) .
Regex flags 460
In the case of the key=value regex , the negative lookbehind assertion means that at the point it occurs the preceding character must not be a space or a tab .
This has the effect of ensuring that the last character captured into the " value " capture group is not a space or tab ( yet without preventing spaces or tabs from appearing inside the captured text ) .
Let ’s consider another example .
Suppose we are reading a multiline text that contains the names “ Helen Patricia Sharman ” , “ Jim Sharman ” , “ Sharman Joshi ” , “ Helen Kelly ” , and so on , and we want to match “ Helen Patricia ” , but only when referring to “ Helen Patricia Sharman ” .
The easiest way is to use the regex \ b ( Helen\s + Patricia ) \s + Sharman\b .
But we could also achieve the same thing using a lookahead assertion , for example , \b( Helen\s + Patricia ) (?=\s + Sharman\b ) .
This will match “ Helen Patricia ” only if it is preceded by a word boundary and followed by whitespace and “ Sharman ” ending at a word boundary .
To capture the particular variation of the forenames that is used ( “ Helen ” , “ Helen P. ” , or “ Helen Patricia ” ) , we could make the regex slightly more sophisticated , for example , \b( Helen ( ?:\s +(?: P\. |Patricia ) ) ? )\s+(?
=Sharman\b ) .
This matches a word boundary followed by one of the forename forms — but only if this is followed by some whitespace and then “ Sharman ” and a word boundary .
Note that only two syntaxes perform capturing , ( e ) and ( ? P< name > e ) .
None of the other parenthesized forms captures .
This makes perfect sense for the lookahead and lookbehind assertions since they only make a statement about what follows or precedes them — they are not part of the match , but rather affect whether a match is made .
It also makes sense for the last two parenthesized forms that we will now consider .
We saw earlier how we can backreference a capture inside a regex either by number ( e.g. , \ 1 ) or by name ( e.g. , ( ? P= name ) ) .
It is also possible to match conditionally depending on whether an earlier match occurred .
The syntaxes are ( ? ( id ) yes_exp ) and ( ? ( id ) yes_exp | no_exp ) .
The id is the name or number of an earlier capture that we are referring to .
If the capture succeeded the yes_exp will be matched here .
If the capture failed the no_exp will be matched if it is given .
Let ’s consider an example .
Suppose we want to extract the filenames referred to by the src attribute in HTML img tags .
We will begin just by trying to match the src attribute , but unlike our earlier attempt we will account for the three forms that the attribute ’s value can take : single quoted , double quoted , and unquoted .
Here is an initial attempt : src= ( [ " ' ] ) ( [ ^ " '> ]+ ) \1 .
The ( [ ^ " '> ]+ ) part captures a greedy match of at least one character that is n’t a quote or > .
This regex works fine for quoted filenames , and thanks to the \1 matches only when the opening and closing quotes are the same .
But it does not allow for unquoted filenames .
To fix this we must make the opening quote optional and therefore match only it if it is present .
Here is the revised regex : src= ( [ " ' ] ) ? ( [ ^ " ' > ]+ ) ( ?
( 1) \1 ) .
We did not provide a no_exp since there is nothing to match if no quote is given .
Now we are ready to put the regex in context — here is the complete img tag regex using named groups and comments :
< img\s + # start of the tag [ ^ >]*?
# any attributes that precede the src src= # start of the src attribute ( ? P< quote > [ " ' ] ) ?
# optional opening quote ( ? P< image > [ ^ " '> ]+ ) # image filename ( ?( quote ) ( ?
P=quote ) ) # closing quote ( matches opening quote if given ) [ ^>]*?
# any attributes that follow the src > # end of the tag
The filename capture is called " image " ( which happens to be capture number 2 ) .
Of course , there is a simpler but subtler alternative : src= ( [ " ' ] ? ) ( [ ^ " '> ]+) \1 .
Here , if there is a starting quote character it is captured into capture group 1 and matched after the nonquote characters .
And if there is no starting quote character , group 1 will still match — an empty string since it is completely optional ( its quantifier is zero or one ) , in which case the backreference will also match an empty string .
The final piece of regex syntax that Python ’s regular expression engine offers is a means of setting the flags .
Usually the flags are set by passing them as additional parameters when calling the re.compile ( ) function , but sometimes it is more convenient to set them as part of the regex itself .
The syntax is simply (? flags ) where flags is one or more of a ( the same as passing re .
ASCII ) , i ( re .
IGNORECASE ) , m ( re. MULTILINE ) , s ( re. DOTALL ) , and x ( re .
VERBOSE ).*
If the flags are set this way they should be put at the start of the regex ; they match nothing , so their effect on the regex is only to set the flags .

* Gitit has been optimized ( thanks to the efforts of Gwern Branwen ) : - Pages are now gzipped whenever possible .
- Expire headers are set so that CSS , images , and javascripts will be cached by the browser .
-
Those previously mentioned elements have been optimized for space , and rearranged in the generated pages for faster rendering .
*
A new configuration option allows reStructuredText to be used instead of markdown ( thanks to a patch from Simon Michael ) .
* Gitit now sports a ' Go ' box .
You can now either search through Search , or go to a specific page title via Go. * Search is smarter , and can also return page titles .
* Revisions are better formatted : the author field now include the user 's email as well .
* Diffs are of much higher quality , thanks to filestore .
* UTF8 - related fixes .

JavaScript for Cheminformatics - Cross -Compiling Java to JavaScript with GWT Revisited 2009-01-06T00:00:00.000Z
Would n't it be great to be able to cross - compile your Java cheminformatics source code to plain old JavaScript files to be used in your Web applications without plugins ?
JavaScript is the most widely - deployed runtime environment in existence ; on today 's Web it 's one of the few things you can count on being there .
Java is one of the most advanced programming languages in existence , with a mountain of developer tools and libraries .
All of which makes the development of software in Java and its deployment via JavaScript an attractive option .
Until recently , very few examples of using JavaScript for low - level cheminformatics functionality were available .
This is starting to change .
Demonstrations
Last month , Duan Lian showed that cross-compiling Java cheminformatics libraries to JavaScript is indeed now possible .
His two proofs of concept give hints as to what may soon become routine :
MX - GWT
An online demo shows that molecular weight can be calculated from a molfile without any plugins .
Demo Molecule Structure Rendering
This remarkable online demo uses a pure - JavaScript cheminformatics toolkit to render color 2D chemical structures from molfiles independent of a Java runtime .
Both of these demos make use of MX , the lightweight , platform - independent , cross-language ( link , link ) cheminformatics toolkit .
Using the Google Web Toolkit ( GWT ) , Duan compiled MX into pure JavaScript that can be run in a browser without any plugins .
Still More Demonstrations
Recently , Noel O'Boyle upped the ante by demonstrating a spinning 3D molecular model created in pure JavaScript .
His demonstration does n't yet parse a molfile but rather manually creates the graphical representation .
In a comment on Noel 's work , Richard Hall announced a simple 2D molecular renderer in pure JavaScript .
What all of these demonstrations could benefit from is a robust , low - level , pure - JavaScript cheminformatics toolkit .
The Problem : Simple Java to JavaScript Cross- Compilation
When used in its most popular mode , GWT is n't just a Java to JavaScript cross-compiler ; it 's a full - blown method for developing Web sites complete with GUI APIs , HTML and JavaScript output , and a complete project structure .
In other words , GWT is overkill for the job at hand , which is simply to convert a Java library consisting of a set of source files into one or more JavaScript files .
I 've been trying to understand how to access GWT 's low - level JavaScript cross-compiler functionality without the rest of the GWT , with mixed success .
The good news is this appears to be one of the ways the creators of GWT envisioned it to be used ; the bad news is I 've found no documentation describing exactly how to do it .
Surprisingly , getting this seemingly obvious use case to work is anything but obvious .
Most documentation dives right into using GWT to build fancy websites .
What 's needed here is far more basic .
What would be most helpful would be a step - by - step procedure for compiling a simple HelloWorld .
java class into a HelloWorld.js JavaScript file , preferably using only command - line tools :
public class HelloWorld { public String sayHello ( ) { return " hello " ; } }
The result could then be used in client - side JavaScript by including the HelloWorld.js file and invoking the HelloWorld .sayHello method .
If you have any experience in this area , I 'd be very interested to hear about it .
If no guides to solving this simple problem exist , then the first may appear here !
Conclusions
A reliable method for cross-compiling Java libraries into JavaScript libraries with GWT would open many new avenues for cheminformatics Web applications .
Future articles may detail how this can be accomplished .

Credit Crisis Watch : Gaining Positive Traction
In order to gauge the progress being made to unclog credit markets and restore confidence in the world ’s financial system , I monitor a range of financial spreads and other measures .
By perusing these , as summarized in this “ Credit Crisis Watch ” review , one can ascertain to what extent the various central bank liquidity facilities and capital injections are having the desired effect .
First up is the LIBOR rate .
This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for one - month , three - month , six - month and one - year loans .
LIBOR is an acronym for “ London InterBank Offered Rate ” and is the rate charged by London banks .
This rate is then published and used as the benchmark for bank rates around the world .
After having peaked on October 10 at 4.82 % , the three - month dollar LIBOR rate declined sharply to 1.09 % .
LIBOR is therefore trading at 84 basis points above the upper band of the Fed ’s target range – a great improvement , but still steep compared to an average of 12 basis points in the year before the start of the credit crisis in August 2007 .

Importantly , US three - month Treasury Bills have started making their way higher to 0.12 % after momentarily trading in negative territory in December as nervous investors were in desperate search of safety .
US three - month Treasury Bill yield

The TED spread ( i.e. three - month dollar LIBOR less three - month Treasury Bills ) is a measure of perceived credit risk in the economy .
This is because T - bills are considered risk - free while LIBOR reflects the credit risk of lending to commercial banks .
An increase in the TED spread is a sign that lenders believe the risk of default on interbank loans ( also known as counterparty risk ) is increasing .
On the other hand , when the risk of bank defaults is considered to be decreasing , the TED spread narrows .
Since the TED spread ’s peak of 4.65 % on October 10 , the measure has eased to a five - month low 0.97 % – well above the 38 - point spread it averaged during the twelve months prior to the start of the crisis , but nevertheless a strong move in the right direction .
Source : Fullermoney
The difference between the LIBOR rate and the overnight index swap ( OIS ) rate is another measure of credit market stress .
When the LIBOR - OIS spread increases , it indicates that banks believe the other banks they are lending to have a higher risk of defaulting on the loans , so they charge a higher interest rate to offset that risk .
The opposite applies to a narrowing LIBOR - OIS spread .
Similar to the TED spread , the narrowing in the LIBOR - OIS spread since October is also a move in the right direction .
Source : Fullermoney
Despite the interbank lending rates having declined from their peaks , banks have significantly curtailed the amount of money they are actually lending .
The US Depository Institutions Aggregate Excess Reserves continue their ascent at levels far in excess of the amount that banks need to keep on deposit to meet their reserve requirements ( see chart below ) .
This measure indicates that the balance sheets of banks remain under pressure , especially in view of the fact that the value of some assets is not known .
As mentioned before , a peak in the Excess Reserves graph should coincide with a turning point in the recovery of banks .

Not illustrated by a chart , the spreads between ten - year Fannie Mae and other Government Sponsored Enterprise ( GSE ) bonds and ten - year US Treasury Notes have also tightened significantly over the past few weeks .
The national average rates for a US 30 - year fixed mortgage yesterday declined to 5.08 % from 5.33 % a week ago and 6.46 % in October last year .
However , the rate is still 399 basis points higher than the three - month dollar LIBOR rate .
According to Bloomberg , this spread averaged 97 basis points during the 12 months preceding the crisis , indicating that lower rates are not being passed on to consumers .

As far as commercial paper is concerned , the A2 / P2 spread measures the difference between A2 / P2 ( low quality ) and AA ( high quality ) 30 - day non-financial commercial paper .
The spread has declined markedly to 2.23 % from almost 5 % at the end of December .
Source : Federal Reserve Release – Commercial Paper
Similarly , junk bond yields have also declined , as shown by the Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index .
The Index dropped by 22.9 % to 1,682 from its record high of 2,182 on December 15 .
This means the spread between high - yield debt and comparable US Treasuries was 1,682 basis points by the close of business on Tuesday .
With the US 10 - year Treasury Note yield at 2.32 % , high - yield borrowers have to pay 19.12 % per year to borrow money for a ten - year period .
At these exorbitant rates it is extremely difficult for companies with a less - than - perfect credit status to conduct business profitably .

The excellent gains of the iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond Fund ( LQD ) ( +25.8 % ) and High Yield Corporate Bond Fund ( HYG ) ( +23.1 % ) since their October / November lows , provide more evidence that the credit markets are moving in the right direction .
However , from a short - term technical point of view , the rallies seem overdone and pullbacks will not come as a surprise .

Another indicator worth monitoring is the Barron ’s Confidence Index .
This Index is calculated by dividing the average yield on high - grade bonds by the average yield on intermediate - grade bonds .
The discrepancy between the yields is indicative of investor confidence .
There has been an up - tick in the ratio since its all - time low in December , showing bond investors are growing a little more confident and have started opting for more speculative bonds over high - grade bonds .
Source : I - Net Bridge
Deutsche Bank reports that the implied default rates on corporate bonds are at an extreme level , but that it is not inconceivable that especially high - yield bonds could see defaults remaining high for long enough to see a cumulative five - year default figure above the 30 % to 35 % range of the early 1990s and early part of this decade . “… the chances are far higher of such an occurrence than seeing the investment - grade cumulative five - year rate climbing into double digits , ” the bank said .
According to Markit , the cost of buying credit insurance for European , Japanese and other Asian companies has shown a further improvement since the previous “ Credit Crisis Watch ” of three weeks ago , as shown by the tighter spreads ( expressed in basis points ) for the five - year credit derivative indices listed in the table below .
The notable exception has been the US where the CDX Investment Grade Index and the CDX High Yield Index both edged up .
The increase of 29 basis points in the High Yield spread means an increased cost of $ 29,000 ( up from $ 1,233,000 to $ 1,262,000 ) to insure $ 10 million of debt annually over five years .
• CDX ( North America , investment - grade ) Index : up from 211 to 218
• CDX ( North America , high - yield ) Index : up from 1,233 to 1,262
• Markit iTraxx Europe Index : down from 181 to 169
• Markit iTraxx Europe Crossover Index : down from 1,008 to 978
• Markit iTraxx Japan Index : down from 295 to 291
• Markit iTraxx Asia ex Japan IG Index : down from 347 to 307
• Markit iTraxx Asia ex Japan HY Index : down from 1,263 to 1,132
The graphs of the CDX indices are shown below , with the red line indicating the spreads easing over the past month .

As far as the outlook for the credit derivative indices are concerned , Markit said : “ Optimists have been declaring that all of the bad news has been priced into spreads , and we are set for a lengthy rally .
The implausible default rates implied by current spread levels give this theory a measure of support .
But the coming weeks are likely to see a torrent of negative news , and it is improbable that the CDS market can continue its stoic resistance .
The upcoming US earnings season will be key , as will the progress of Obama ’s fiscal stimulus package through Congress .
We have already seen several defaults this year , and we are sure to see many more in the coming months . ”
Lastly , the tables below show some country CDS statistics , again courtesy of Markit .
These prices represent the cost per year to insure $ 10,000 of debt for five years .
For example , Italy is in most trouble among the G7 countries with a cost of $ 155 per year to insure $ 10,000 of debt .
It is noteworthy that Germany , Japan and France at the moment all have a lower default risk that the US .
It now costs $ 55 per year to insure $ 10,000 against US default for the next five years .
Although this is down from $ 65 a month ago , the corresponding numbers were $ 8 early last year and $ 36 in November .
As in the case of the US , UK CDS spreads are also trading close to record levels as unease over the level of national debt takes its toll on their sovereign credit risk .
Not shown in the table , three of the weaker members of the eurozone ( Spain , Ireland and Greece ) yesterday saw their CDSs come under renewed pressure following negative rating agency action .
Spain ’s spread widened by 13 basis points to 112 basis points , whereas Ireland and Greece are trading at the widest levels of any eurozone member .
The past few weeks saw steady progress on the credit front , with the TED spread , LIBOR - OIS spread and GSE mortgage spreads having narrowed markedly since the record highs , although spreads are still elevated compared to pre-crisis levels .
More recently , corporate bonds have also seen a strong improvement , but high - yield spreads remain at distressed levels .
Furthermore , the CDX and iTraxx credit derivative indices have mostly shown a solid improvement since the peaks in November .
And even US Treasury Bills have started edging up from panic levels .
Action taken by the Fed and other central bank has resulted in ongoing progress being made to fix the broken credit machine .
Although the credit markets are gaining some positive traction , interbank lending has not really picked up and the financial system is still fragile .
In short , the thawing of the credit markets has a way to go before liquidity starts to move freely and the world ’s financial system functions normally again .
The Fed ’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey will provide a useful update on credit conditions when it becomes available on February 2 .

Iran Threatens to Break Israel 's Gaza Blockade

It is hard to imagine how much worse the situation could get , but the confrontation in Gaza could see a dangerous escalation in the coming days as Iran threatens to break the Israeli blockade and deliver urgently needed medical supplies and other aid to the coastal strip .
If the ground offensive currently underway in Gaza becomes a full - fledged occupation with the resultant removal of Hamas from authority , then the arrival of the MV Iran Shahed in the Mediterranean will be something of an anti-climax .
Too little , too late .
But while even a small stretch of beach remains under Palestinian control , there is the frightening possibility that Iranian Red Crescent volunteers might attempt a landing .
There is no denying that what has long been described as a humanitarian crisis in Gaza is rapidly descending into a humanitarian catastrophe .
Despite the Israeli " withdrawal " from Gaza in 2005 , the Jewish State controls all border crossings , airspace , and the coastline -- creating what critics have described as the largest open air prison in the world .
Following the victory of Hamas in parliamentary elections in 2006 , the territory was essentially placed under siege , with increasing shortages of even the most basic of daily necessities .

Iran has been a vocal critic of Arab nations , Egypt in particular , for not doing enough to break the Israeli siege and help the 1.5 million people of Gaza , and it seems they have now taken things into their own hands .
Even at the best of times Iran 's action would have been interpreted by US and Israeli authorities as a deliberate provocation .
But given the rapid deterioration in the security situation over the past week , there are those who would accuse of Tehran of seeking a direct and possibly violent confrontation .
But whatever their motive , nobody should be surprised that Tehran is making a move .
" In recent years , in part due to poor US foreign policy decisions , Iran has been rising a power in the Middle East , " says US - based political analyst and activist , Kevin Zeese .
" By taking this type of action , they will be admired by many people of Arab and Persian descent , " he said .
Describing it as a " judo move " --
Zeese said through this non-violent action Iran will strengthen itself , and Israel will be weakened .
" It is a judo move that uses Israel 's strength against them . "
Zeese said it is a no-win situation for the Jewish State .
" If they block the supplies it will make them look more inhumane , " he said , " but if they let them through it will simply highlight the need for such humanitarian supplies . "
Professor Paul Sheldon Foote from California State University says it is time for decent people to act .
" Iran is correct for taking a stand , " he said , " Iran and other Islamic countries should do even more , such as breaking diplomatic relations with Egypt and Saudi Arabia unless the leaders of those countries end the Israeli siege , massacres , and invasions of Gaza . "
International human rights lawyer , Francis A. Boyle , however , doubts that any Arab countries have the stomach for a confrontation with Washington .
" As for the leaders of the Arab states , most of them are in the pocket of the United States , " he said , " Look at the Arab League , a worthless talking shop . "
He accused the Arab League only putting out meaningless statements in an attempt to convince their own people that they are doing something , but he said , " the Palestinians have always been on their own , and they know it . "
Boyle , who has offered his services to the government of Iran to represent them in a lawsuit against Israel , says there are measures the international community should immediately consider to halt the bloodshed .
" A World Court lawsuit against Israel for genocide ; reconvening the Emergency Special Session for Palestine by the UN General Assembly under the Uniting for Peace Resolution ; comprehensive economic and other sanctions against Israel ; and the suspension of Israel from all UN General Assembly activities , such as it did to South Africa and Yugoslavia . "
The Emergency Special Session for Palestine was first convened in 1997 and officially remains " adjourned . "
Hamas came to power in January 2006 through a fair and open election process .
But according to many experts on the issue , their success had more to do with a deep dissatisfaction with Fatah rather than any particular support for Hamas policies .
Fatah 's failure to strike a firm and lasting deal with the Israelis and allegations of endemic corruption were the prime factors that decided the outcome of the election .
The United States , the European Union and Israel immediately insisted that Hamas recognize the Jewish State and renounce violence .
Within a month , the US and Europe had cut off all aid to the Palestinians .
Also in February 2006 , Israel illegally began to withhold tax revenues due to the Palestinian Authority .
These actions , among others , led to increasingly deep divisions between Hamas and Fatah , with the former accusing the latter of failing to stand up for the rights of the Palestinian people .
The knee - jerk reaction of Israel and the US to isolate a democratically elected government -- simply because it did n't follow an " Israel - first " agenda -- made a mockery of the so - called democracy that Washington claims to promote in the Middle East .
The US and Israel have had multiple opportunities since the election of Hamas to cut a deal with Fatah .
In fact , Middle East experts have consistently and repeatedly said the best and possibly only way to effectively undermine the authority of Hamas is to deal in an open and fair way with Fatah .
But , those same experts say , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is continually made to look like a fool and a puppet by his US and Israeli negotiating partners .
By weakening the authority of Fatah , they say , they are simply strengthening Hamas .
They have accused Israel of deliberately working to create divisions among Palestinian factions and of provoking confrontation with the Palestinians in order to maintain the status quo and avoid having to deal with " final status " negotiations leading to an independent and Palestinian state .
In fact , a well - placed source in Egypt once told the author , a Palestinian state is the last thing that Israel is considering .
He said he'd once been present during a discussion between Middle East peacemakers Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Golda Meir of Israel .
The Israeli leader had been adamant , he said , there would never be a Palestinian state .
He pointed to the fact that while there have been Israeli settlers living in Golan and previously in Sinai and Gaza , the level of infrastructure development in those regions has never matched the widespread construction and permanent settlement activity seen in East Jerusalem and the West Bank .
The reason , he said , is simple .
Israel always planned to give back Golan and Sinai in return for peace with the nation states of Syria and Egypt .
The West Bank is , and will always remain , under Israeli occupation .
However , analyst Zeese believes that despite their military superiority and massive support in Washington and Europe , Israel will ultimately lose the battle against the Palestinians .
" In the end , Gaza will have been bloodied , but the Palestinians will live to fight another day , " he said , " and they will have even more allies than they had prior to Israel 's most recent actions . "
Zeese said Israel 's friends should tell them they are making a huge mistake .
" Israel needs a paradigm shift in their policy toward the Palestinians as well as to their Arab and Persian neighbors , " said Zeese .
The only possible alternative to the two - state solution -- the alleged aim of the existing negotiating partners -- is a one - state solution in the region where the Jewish State of Israel would effectively cease to exist .
" Israel 's actions are creating self - inflicted wounds , " Zeese said , " and they are creating new enemies .
They are losing respect and planting the seeds whose harvest will mean their demise . "
I was scheduled to deliver a keynote speech next month to more than 1,000 business executives on the topic of whether ethical capitalism is possible .
The event organizers , a Tokyo - based consultancy that specializes in corporate social responsibility , had the foresight to pose this question last fall .
Ironically , the intervening events of the global economic downturnâ€ ” caused by misguided incentives , greed , and moral lapsesâ€ ” forced the company to cancel the event .
For me , this recession has been defined by frustrating paradoxes .
Easy money , overcapacity , and reckless consumption are what got us into this mess , yet governments must react by lowering interest rates and pushing through enormous fiscal stimulus packages with the hope that the housing , retail , and investment markets wo n't fall much more .
Similarly , long - term sensible investments in clean energy and social welfare are hindered by falling oil prices , a lack of funding , and fresh anxiety about corporate bottom lines .
From these developments , one could conclude that the global economic system is inherently flawed , that it is unethical and doomed to destroy itself .
In fact , what is critically needed is moderation , a middle ground between total freedom and principled action .
The incoming Obama Administration calls it " smart policies . "
The alternative is protectionism , a rolling back of the open global economy , and political if not armed conflict .
Instilling the practice of ethical capitalism is possible and practical .
Consumers increasingly demand products that coincide with their moral awareness .
Likewise , politicians are under pressure to implement policies that mitigate the stresses of globalization .
These forces can come together to produce products that are recycled , carbon neutral , free range , or fair trade , and policies that battle climate change , poverty , and global diseases .
Non-action is highly risky .
Looking at climate change alone , the possible long - term risks include a shift in arable land ; sharpening competition for energy resources ; and the emergence of climate change refugees from island nations or low - lying areas , who may carry with them or engender political violence and unrest , even terrorism .
Given that carbon emissions are primarily related to business activities , how can business models become more sustainable ?
Global human civilization has all the moral tools it needs .
As Peter David Pedersen of E - Square has noted , we neither have the time nor the need for another ideology or " ism . "
Ethical principles that emphasize reciprocal rights and responsibilities have long characterized human societies .
The Golden Rule is a feature of more than 100 world religious and cultural canonsâ € ” " Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . "
The ancient Egyptians and Greeks alike pointed to the moral worth of not doing to your neighbor " what you would take ill from him . "
The Golden Rule is found in both the Old and the New Testament , with the Great Commandment found in Leviticus : " Love thy neighbor as thyself . "
For Islam , the Golden Rule was offered in the last sermon of Muhammad : " Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you . "
Variations and extensions of the principle are also found in Buddhism , Hinduism , Taoism , and Jainism .
For many of these Eastern faiths , the Golden Rule extends beyond one 's fellow man to encompass all creatures , because sentience exists in a spectrum .
The original interpretation of humankind 's relationship with nature was that of stewardship , as outlined in the Old Testament and Hebrew Scriptures .
If the Golden Rule acts to codify one 's rights and responsibilities toward others , the principle of the Golden Mean helps them to be achieved .
As a key concept in Chinese , Greek , and Indian philosophy , the Golden Mean emphasizes tolerance , moderation , and pluralism .
Aristotle 's maxim " nothing in excess " and Confucius 's idea of equilibrium speak to modern concepts of sustainable living .
In the 1980s , the Brundtland Commission presented sustainability as an integration of economic , social , and environmental spheres to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .
This is simply a special case of the Golden Rule :
Do unto future generations as you would have them do unto you .
Encompassed in this definition are not only the traditional relations of sustainability to energy , natural resources , and emissions , but also a notion of sustainability that is extended to community relations , working conditions , and succession planning .
If heeded , these basic ethical principles require individuals to consider the consequences of their actions , as they apply not only to their peers but also to their environments .
Today there are promising signs of a more ethically minded business culture .
Many businesses are shifting away from narrow , profit - driven models to models with a greater focus on environmental and social issues .
Corporate social responsibility , although not a new concept , is gaining currency in the mainstream marketplace , as governments , consumers , and shareholders demand better products and conduct from companies .
Corporate social responsibility and its financial counterpart socially responsible investing have risen substantially as a concern for global executives .
These two fields , devoted to the creation of an ethical and sustainable business mode , encompass within them everything from funding local community projects to securing employee benefits in the workplace , reducing poverty , and preserving the health of the environment .
Part of the reason for this shift is that companies are being held to account by their constituents .
The reach of the Internet has produced ready access to information and a new means of voicing objections and suggestions .
With the ease of new technology and a more resolute brand of activism , stakeholders are better able to create open lines of communication to corporate management circles , forming the grassroots campaigns of the new millennia .
These concerns about redirecting capitalism toward the public good are perennial .
In 1909 , Herbert Croly , one of the founders of theÂ New Republic , published Â The Promise of American Life .
His book , which influenced Presidents Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson , and Franklin Roosevelt , pointed to the need for a stronger central government to check greed , corruption , and unfair distribution of wealth .
In the interconnected global community of today , organizations and individuals are banding together across cultural and geographic divides to solve common problems .
They are voicing the need for a renewed and moderate normative framework that will define the way humans live and interact in the 21st century .
In anticipation of the February event in Tokyo , I asked United Nations Special Representative John Ruggie whether ethical capitalism is possible .
" Well , sure , " he said with a grimace .
But it wo n't occur unless policies and regulations provide the right incentives , he continued .
The role of ethics is in shaping those regulatory regimes .
The Obama Administration has a big job ahead in reminding the American people of their ethical roots .
During his inauguration speech this week , President Obama said that although we all face new challenges , core ethical principles , like honesty , loyalty , and fair play , are " old " and " true . "
Fortunately , and again paradoxically , the new president also knows that a crisis is not to be wasted .
Daniel Schuurman and Abigail Paris contributed to this essay , which is dedicated to the team at E - Square Inc .
Governments do n't want to own businesses , do they ?
They have tried hard to avoid full nationalisation of the banks here , through they have legal control of Royal Bank of Scotland and de facto control of Lloyds and HBOS .
In the United States there has been similar reluctance by the new Administration to nationalise the big banks and even more so , the big car companies .
This is pretty universal , irrespective of the political make - up of the governments concerned .
When in the early 1990s several Scandinavian banks were rescued by governments , they sold them back to the private sector as soon as they had been nursed back to health .
And in China , hardly a capitalist country even now , they are selling shares in the formerly state - owned banks off to the public as fast as the market will bear .
Yet here the proposed sale of 30 per cent of the Royal Mail to a foreign buyer , the Dutch TNT , is causing huge concern .
That raises three questions .
Why the resistance to the sale ?
Why , given the opposition , is the government so determined to push it through ?
And how will the debate about the appropriate balance between private and public sector move in the next few years ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The first is easy .
Some people have a political vision of the Royal Mail as a collective good that should be state - owned , while others have political aversion to state ownership in any form .
But our postal system has a special place thanks to its historical role in pioneering a universal postal service .
This was the heroic age of Sir Rowland Hill 's introduction of the penny post and Anthony Trollope 's development of the pillar box , two of the three great 19th century advances in postal communication .
( The third was the invention of the letter box , tricky as it meant persuading people to cut slots in their expensive front doors , but essential as it saved the postman having to wait for an answer when delivering mail . )
So the Royal Mail was a pioneer of public ownership , showing that the state could do things better than the private sector , and it was invented here .
Our present service may have become a shadow of what it was but it does carry an unbroken tradition of public service .
Rather like that other great 19th - century invention , the police , there may be evidence of sub - standard performance but people are understandably twitchy about over - turning a model that has lasted for a more than 150 years .
So why is the government so determined to push on ?
The narrow argument advanced by Lord Mandelson that the pension burden makes it impossible to support the present structure seems odd .
The pensions have to be paid some way or another , irrespective of the ultimate ownership .
We are only talking about a minority stake , in any case , so I can't see this as a deal - breaker either way .
Nor can it be a need to get the investment programme off the government 's balance sheet , because there are other ways of doing it .
The only thing I can think of is a sense of frustration that , despite putting in good people at the very top , the business is still losing money and at times like this it is not reasonable to make the taxpayer stump up for managerial failure .
TNT could bring outside experience and cut through the knots .
If this is right it is really the reverse of the 19th - century experience , where the public sector really could manage things better than the private sector , or at last manage this thing .
We have lost faith in the ability of the state to do this job well .
Or to put the point more directly , politicians have become fed up with taking the blame for something beyond their control .
That has a ring of truth about it , for it squares with the experience with the banks .
The one bank that the public fully owns , Northern Rock , has been busy cutting its loan book ; in other words it has been doing exactly the opposite of what the government has been urging on the rest of the banking system .
That has not been changed and Northern Rock will do some new lending but the government has had to put in new capital to enable it to do so .
But you see the point .
The state owning some commercial enterprise does not mean that the enterprise will automatically follow state policy .
Paradoxically the government is probably more likely to get an organisation to do what it wants if it does not own it than if it does .
Regulation is a more effective method of control than ownership .
This is not completely clear - cut , of course .
I suppose the old British Airports Authority was under tighter control than the now foreign - owned BAA .
But Heathrow was not a place of wonder and delight when it was owned by the state , and the solution now , to break up the monopoly , will probably eventually deliver a better service than anything else to date .
But even if it does n't , the government do not carry the direct blame .
But whether politicians see passing things to the private sector as a way of avoiding blame , or whether they find they can achieve a better outcome with a combination of private - ownership and regulation , the conclusion is the same .
There are no prizes for government taking control of businesses , and there are a lot of practical pressures on them to unload anything they do find themselves running as fast as decently possible .
There is also the little matter of money .
We do n't yet know the scale of the increase in public debt that will take place worldwide as a result of the recession and the measures to counter it .
All we know is that it will climb everywhere , and Britain 's national debt will at least double .
The size of the national debt , and the need to set aside significant revenues to service it , has not been a concern for a generation .
You really do n't want to add to it by taking on the burden of financing banks , the postal service , indeed anything you do n't have to finance .
The result here will be that the next government will have to struggle to get its debt under control .
There will be a lot of pressure to move yet more functions towards the private sector and to sell off any under - used assets that have not been released to date .
But the cupboard is quite bare .
The easy sales have been made and in any case the private sector will be in no position to find money for investment until the banking system gets going again and world financial markets recover .
So this will be a slow business .
Over the next decade governments around the world will first have to get their finances in order .
Then they will have to figure out to what extent it is in their self - interest to run all sorts of functions that they do at present or whether they would be better to contract them out .
As they do so they will look over each other 's shoulders to see which governments are achieving better outcomes with fewer resources .
Our government is not particularly bad by world standards at delivering value for money .
But it is by no means good – according to the OECD , we are about two - thirds of the way down the league table of developed countries .
One way forward is to learn from others , and even , more radically , by getting them to help us .
So see the notion of the Dutch running the Royal Mail , as I expect they will in the end , as a sign of something bigger , maybe much bigger , to come .
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) -
In the city of the future , could power suppliers be rivaled by construction firms ?
An embryonic movement is growing in Europe to build “ smart cities ” that will challenge the status quo .

The vision is fueled by the fear of climate change and the need to find green alternatives to dirty coal , unpopular nuclear power and unreliable gas imports from Russia .
Such cities would become self - contained units , their buildings gleaning energy from the powerful weather systems sweeping across their roofs and feeding it down to homes below and vehicles in the streets .
Electric cars in the garages would double up as battery packs for when energy supplies are scarce .
Every scrap of waste food , garden trimmings and even sewage would be used to ferment gas .
Facing up to the end of their traditional business model , utilities are mapping a long - term survival strategy .
“ A very different business model will emerge over time , ” said Gearoid Lane , managing director of British Gas New Energy , the UK utility ’s green division .
“ If any energy company ignores the long - term impact on future fossil - fuel backed energy sales , they will be in for a shock . ”
The idea of self - sufficient cities is gaining currency in the European Union , which has set itself the ambitious task of cutting carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions to a fifth below 1990 levels by 2020 -- the biggest cuts anywhere in the world .
“ In 25 years from now , millions of buildings ... will be constructed to serve as both ‘ power plants ’ and habitats , ” says writer and economist Jeremy Rifkin , who has advised governments and corporations on tackling climate change and energy security .
At the hub of the system would be a “ smart electricity grid ” that allows electricity to flow where it is needed most and dissipates the energy spikes as weather systems sweep through .
“ The more fluctuating energy you have from renewables , the more it makes sense to have a smart grid , ” Markus Ewert from the new technologies team of German utility E.ON told Reuters .
“ It would help stabilize the energy flows , so you do n’t come up against the limits of the grid .
“ Electric vehicles could be connected to the grid and could store energy at times when too much is produced -- and they could feed it back into the grid when there ’s not enough . ”
SUSPICION
While utilities such as E.ON are looking for opportunities , there is also strong suspicion that others are trying to preserve their vested interests and slow the pace of change in Brussels , the main driver of European climate regulation .
That was fueled last month when a plan to put 500 million euros ( $ 645.5 million ) into researching smart cities was scrapped .
“ It ’s stunning that funding was kicked out , and it ’s pretty clear the big electricity utilities were not innocent , ” said Green party member Claude Turmes who last year helped draft EU green energy policy .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
“ Their influence on policy - making is tremendous , ” he added .
The reason the funding was dropped is not clear , but the challenge facing Europe ’s big power generators is obvious -- insulating or rebuilding Europe ’s rickety housing stock could cut heating bills any where between 30 and 80 percent , which would slash demand for their product .
Not only would smart cities slowly reduce energy needs , they would also start producing their own over time .
Much of the technology needed is still a distant dream -- but not all of it .
French construction company Bouygues is working on an office in Meudon , western Paris , which uses 4,000 square meters of solar panels to meet not only its own energy needs but also to export surplus energy back to the power grid .
“ We have entered an era of breakthroughs and of a technological revolution in the construction sector , ” said Eric Mazoyer , deputy managing director of Bouygues Immobilier .
“ Because tenants will pay 60 percent less in electricity bills , we can charge higher rents and we will sell the surplus of electricity back to ( French utility ) EDF , ” he added .
OUTSIDE THE BOX
Myriad other examples exist throughout Europe , but at the heart of the plan is the philosophy that energy , ideas and enthusiasm are most easily shared in densely populated areas .
“ Cities are a perfect for promoting change and renewable energies , ” said the politician , Turmes .
“ Cities can serve as innovation platforms , creating clusters of businesses around green energy , and they control urban planning and parking slots , so they can promote electric transport systems . ”
Environmentalists see another advantage to local entities -- they have a degree of autonomy beyond the reach of federal government and can often make tough decisions : for example , California ’s climate goals and London ’s congestion charging .
This week , the mayors and deputies of more than 300 mainly European cities are due in Brussels to sign a covenant pledging to cut their cities ’ greenhouse gas emissions above and beyond the EU targets .
“ It ’s a very new way of doing things , ” said Gerard Magnin of Energie - Cites , a group of green local authorities .
“ It ’s about giving power to society , so society can put pressure on the institutions .
By demonstrating people are ready for change , the cities will help the governments . ”
European Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs estimates the cities involved will together save $ 10 billion a year in fuel .
So how do energy companies cope with such upheaval ?
Much can be learned from other sectors undergoing similar revolution , such as telecoms which suddenly hit fierce competition from cable and internet providers , or the music industry which is struggling to cope with digital MP3 uploads .
“ The MP3 was the first open platform that the music industry could n’t control , ” said Tim Hole of Audio Authority Management , a London music manager who is trying to keep pace with change .
“ It took a company from a completely different sector to step in and take control of things -- Apple coming from the computer industry to deliver iTunes and the iPod , ” he added .
“ You may see that start to happen in the energy sector . ”
“ To survive , you have to get closer to your customers , so you can keep up with their changing expectations , ” he added .
Many in the energy sector already expect their new rivals to be constructors or property developers like Bouygues .
“ We have had some interesting discussions with developers , ” said Lane of British Gas .
“ Whether they will develop the expertise in - house , or work in partnerships with energy companies remains to be seen . ”
“ We have 10,000 engineers out there every day , installing and servicing boilers , ” he added .
“ There ’s a relationship of trust already .
That model will become more and more valuable when it comes to selling renewables and microgeneration . ”
E.ON ’s Ewert says one winning technology could be biogas , which can be fermented from farm and domestic waste or even sewage and then be piped through existing gas networks .
“ Biogas can be produced at a much smaller scale than natural gas , and without such huge investments , ” he said .
“ From our point of view it makes absolute sense to feed the biogas into the gas grid .
The infrastructure is already there . ”
Rejecting suggestions utilities are slowing progress , he pointed to the Swedish city of Malmo , where E.ON already provides a cluster of 1,500 homes with renewable energy and Masdar City in Abu Dhabi where it is also involved .
“ We want to understand where are the opportunities in smart cities and where are the limits , ” he said .

WASHINGTON , Jan 26 ( Reuters ) - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton named a special envoy on Monday to lead U.S. efforts to fight global warming and forge new international accords on reducing carbon emissions and developing clean energy .
The appointment -- which accompanied other energy policy steps announced by President Barack Obama -- signaled a break from the Bush administration 's climate policies , and Clinton 's pick promised " vigorous , dramatic diplomacy . "
Todd Stern , a senior White House official under former President Bill Clinton , will be the administration 's principal adviser on international climate policy and strategy and its chief climate negotiator .
" With the appointment today of a special envoy we are sending an unequivocal message that the United States will be energetic , focused , strategic and serious about addressing global climate change and the corollary issue of clean energy , " Clinton said at a State Department ceremony .
Stern 's appointment came as Obama announced moves to force auto makers to produce more fuel - efficient and less polluting cars , including telling the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a California request to impose strict limits on vehicle carbon dioxide emissions .
[ ID :nN26491768 ]
" As we take steps at home , we will also vigorously pursue negotiations , those sponsored by the United Nations and those at the sub-global , regional and bilateral level , that can lead to binding international climate agreements , " Clinton said .
" No solution is feasible without all major emitting nations joining together and playing an important part , " she said .
Stern coordinated climate change policy from 1997 to 1999 in her husband Bill Clinton 's administration , acting as the senior White House negotiator in the Kyoto talks .
About 190 countries are trying to craft a broader climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol that binds wealthy nations to emission targets between 2008 and 2012 .
The new deal is supposed to be wrapped up in Copenhagen by December .
" The time for denial , delay and dispute is over .
The time for the United States to take up its rightful place at the negotiating table is here , " Stern said .
" We can only meet the climate challenge with a response that is genuinely global , " he said .
" We will need to engage in vigorous , dramatic diplomacy . "
From 1999 to 2001 , Stern advised the U.S. Treasury secretary on economic and financial issues and supervised the department 's anti-money laundering strategy .
He is a partner in a Washington law firm and a senior fellow at Center for American Progress think tank , which is home to many veterans of the Clinton administration .

Police ' secretly taped Damian Green arrest '
Press Association
guardian.co.uk , Wednesday 24 December 2008 02.47 GMT [...]
The Met said : " A tape sound recording was made of the MP 's arrest and subsequent period in police charge , without his knowledge , prior to arrival at Belgravia police station from Kent .
" This was authorised at superintendent level to provide an accurate record of anything that may have been said by officers or the MP over a period of nearly two and a half hours .
" This was done with the best of intentions but to ensure total transparency this matter has been voluntarily referred to the Office of the Surveillance Commissioners for their advice . "
" The Crown Prosecution Service are also aware of this information which would be fully disclosable if any proceedings were to take place . "
It is not good enough to spin and claim that " This was done with the best of intentions " , it is still in contravention of the existing Statutory Codes of Practice , and is probably enough on its own , to get the whole case against Damian Green MP , such as it is , thrown out in a court of law .
The Office of Surveillance Commissioners , is meant to be consulted before the use of covert electronic bugging devices .
Only in fast moving tactical situations , e.g. an ongoing kidnap / ransom etc. is it permissible to " fill in the paperwork " immediately afterwards .
That obviously does not apply to the arrest of Damian Green MP .
This secret audio bugging is obviously a contravention of the existing Police and Criminal Evidence
Act statutory codes of practice , where recording of interviews by the Police , requires , firstly that they are not secret , and that two copies of the tape or other recoding media are produced , which are sealed and then signed , with one copy being given into the custody of a Police officer who is not involved directly in the investigation .
PACE Code E : Code of Practice on audio recording interviews with suspects ( .pdf )
2.1 Recording of interviews shall be carried out openly to instil confidence in its reliability as an impartial and accurate record of the interview .
That is to provide a legally robust audit trail , and to prevent sneaky editing or forgery of the taped interview by the Police or others - such abuses have happened in the past .
None of those PACE safeguards apply to secret recordings as described in the Metropolitan Police statement above .
As usual , some Obvious Questions , which the mainstream media journalists etc. should be asking :
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
During the presidential campaign , Barack Obama tempered his pledge to substantially raise taxes for high earners with an important proviso :
He 'd simply restore rates to their levels during the Clinton Administration .
The implication was that families in the upper brackets would see their total tax bite go back to the levels of the 1990s , but no higher .
Now , it sure looks like Obama is reneging on that promise .
The burden will indeed go far higher than in the Clinton years via a technicality -- one that will come as a rude shock even to the taxpayers already braced for a soaking .
The group that 's hit hardest are the taxpayers I call the HENRYs , for " High Earners Not Rich Yet . "
The HENRYs are families who make between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 a year .
I wrote about the HENRYs in a Nov. 17 Fortune cover story , " Who Pays for the Bailout ? "
They 're among America 's most productive , hard - working citizens : our doctors , attorneys , architects , and entrepreneurs , the owners and builders of cleaning companies , delis and security franchises .
( Read the original HENRY story here . )
Though President Obama brands them as rich , they 're usually far from it .
" Rich " means personal wealth , or net worth , not income .
These HENRYs are already strapped by a combination of high income taxes , soaring property tax levies , and college savings for the kids .
Their chance of accumulating the couple of million dollars needed to qualify as rich were virtually nil even before Obama took the stage .
Now , their prospects are dimmer than ever , courtesy of a new , laser - like proposal specially designed to zap the HENRYs .
Most of the 5 million or so HENRYs are trapped in the notorious parallel tax system , the AMT , or Alternative Minimum Tax .
In fact , the AMT might be dubbed " the HENRYs ' tax , " since it 's targeted to skip the middle class , but aimed straight at the $ 250,000 - to $ 500,000 crowd .
All taxpayers are required to calculate their liability two ways , under the regular tax system and under the AMT , and pay the higher amount .
The AMT was originally designed to prevent high earners from pocketing outsized benefits from big deductions , and the HENRYs have plenty of those deductions , especially state and local income taxes , and property taxes .
Put simply , if the taxpayer has loads of deductions , they 'll have to pay a lot more under the AMT than the regular tax system .
That 's why everyone who pays it hates the AMT .
The AMT , however , allows two principal forms of deductions , those for mortgage interest and charitable contributions .
Guess what ?
Under his new plan , Obama is radically reducing the breaks that high - earners get from precisely those two tax breaks .
Here 's how the HENRYs will get hammered .
Say a family earns $ 300,000 a year , and pays $ 50,000 a year in mortgage interest ; the family also contributes $ 5,000 to Boy Scouts , Red Cross and other charities .
Under the AMT 's top effective tax rate of 35 % , they benefit from savings of $ 19,250 on those deductions .
But under Obama 's new plan , the share of that $ 55,000 that HENRYs can deduct is no longer 35 % .
It 's capped at 28 % .
Hence , their tax bill rises by almost $ 4,000 .
That 's a jump in their marginal tax rate , the crucial share of an extra dollar of income they get to keep , from 35 % to over 37 % .
The limitation on deductions is scheduled to take effect in 2011 , the same year Obama plans to raise tax rates back to their levels in the Clinton Administration .
Amazingly , many HENRYs thought they would n't suffer much from the higher rates , since they were already paying more in the AMT than they would even under the new tax regime .
Now , they 're no longer protected .
Their taxes will rise sharply , courtesy of this laser - like strike aimed straight at their wallets .
In light of the new tax plan , I think I 'll change my acronym for the high earners to a Gallic version .
Let 's call them the HENRIs , " High Earners Not Rich Indefinitely . "

Google Inc. said it is laying off 100 recruiters and is closing some engineering offices , as the downturn continues to take its toll on the Internet giant .
The layoffs , disclosed Wednesday in a company blog post , are a very rare step for Google , which said in October that it is still hiring but much more cautiously .
The company has also recently let go a significant number of contractors in areas ranging from public relations to engineering .

As heavily reported elsewhere , a 22 - year - old going by “ Natalie Dylan ” is auctioning off her virginity through the legal Bunny Ranch brothel in Carson City , Nevada .
Well , the auction has reached $ 3.8 million , but one offer seems more peculiar : a zookeeper has offered a live tiger .
This raises quite a few questions :
What zoo does this guy work at ?
Would it be legal to exchange said tiger for sex ?
How long will it be until PETA takes a position ?

“ I get really , really off the wall stuff , ” Dylan said .
“ I get some really out there ones like this one guy who works at a zoo and he offered to break out a tiger — then there ’s this guy who offered to divulge medical secrets . ”
While stealing a tiger would clearly be illegal , selling tigers in the US is allowed with some rules , including many localities that ban the practice altogether .
The federal Captive Wildlife Safety
Act prevents selling big cats across state lines and requires the animals be given adequate space , but does not outlaw owning tigers as pets .
Anyone know what the going rate for a tiger is ?
I ’m guessing it ’s less than $ 3.8 million .

Mr. Martin , in a series of interviews , did not dispute his influence in Obama rumors .
“ Everybody uses my research as a takeoff point , ” Mr. Martin said , adding , however , that some take his writings “ and exaggerate them to suit their own fantasies . ”
As for his background , he said : “ I ’m a colorful person .
There ’s always somebody who has a legitimate cause in their mind to be angry with me . ”
When questions were raised last week about Mr. Martin ’s appearance and claims on “ Hannity ’s America ” on Fox News , the program ’s producer said Mr. Martin was clearly expressing his opinion and not necessarily fact .
It was not Mr. Martin 's first turn on national television .
The CBS News program " 48 Hours " in 1993 devoted an hourlong program , " See You in Court ; Civil War , Anthony Martin Clogs Legal System with Frivolous Lawsuits , " to what it called his prolific filings .
( Mr. Martin has also been known as Anthony Martin - Trigona . )
He has filed so many lawsuits that a judge barred him from doing so in any federal court without preliminary approval .
He prepared to run as a Democrat for Congress in Connecticut , where paperwork for one of his campaign committees listed as one purpose “ to exterminate Jew power . ”
He ran as a Republican for the Florida State Senate and the United States Senate in Illinois .
When running for president in 1999 , he aired a television advertisement in New Hampshire that accused George W. Bush of using cocaine .
In the 1990s , Mr. Martin was jailed in a case in Florida involving a physical altercation .
His newfound prominence , and the persistence of his line of political attack  updated regularly on his Web site and through press releases  amazes those from his past .
“ Well , that ’s just a bookend for me , ” said Tom Slade , a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party , whom Mr. Martin sued for refusing to support him .
Mr. Slade said Mr. Martin was driven like “ a run-over dog , but he ’s fearless . ”
The Cleveland Browns continue to move closer to the hiring of former Jets coach Eric Mangini after the team received permission to interview Baltimore Ravens pro personnel director George Kokinis for their general manager 's vacancy .
The Browns have continued their search process , interviewing other candidates , but sources say Mangini had a " compelling " interview and owner Randy Lerner is fascinated with him .
If Mangini gets the job to replace the fired Romeo Crennel , the sources said the favorite to become the team 's general manager would be George Kokinis , who is the director of pro personnel for the Baltimore Ravens .
The Browns received permission to speak with Kokinis after the Ravens beat Miami 27 - 9 on Sunday to advance in the AFC playoffs .
Kokinis and Mangini each were members of the Browns organization when Bill Belichick was coach .
Mangini formally joined the staff as an assistant coach in 1995 .
Kokinis was a scout from 1991 to 1995 before moving with the team to Baltimore .

Enlarge By Charles Rex Arbogast , AP A company spokeswoman said the dolls ' monkers were chosen because " they are beautiful names , " not because of any resemblance to Malia and Sasha Obama .
CHICAGO ( AP ) 
The company that makes the popular Beanie Babies is hoping for two more big winners with dolls named " Sweet Sasha " and " Marvelous Malia . "
But , no , the names do not refer to President Barack Obama 's daughters , a Ty Inc. spokeswoman says .
Honest !
Ty released the 12 - inch dolls as part of the company 's " TyGirlz Collection . "
The Sasha doll has pigtails and wears a white and pink dress with hearts .
The Malia doll has a side ponytail and a long - sleeve shirt with capri pants .
The Oak Brook - based company chose the names because " they are beautiful names , " not because of any resemblance to Malia and Sasha Obama , said spokeswoman Tania Lundeen .
" There 's nothing on the dolls that refers to the Obama girls , " Lundeen said .
" It would not be fair to say they are exact replications of these girls .
They are not . "
The dolls have bronze skin and " real doll hair , " Lundeen said .
They were introduced in early January and a limited supply has been shipped to retailers .
In the real world , 7 - year - old Sasha and 10 - year - old Malia have been the focus of intense interest .
A throng of reporters followed their first day at school , and news reports detailed what they wore on Inauguration Day .
First lady Michelle Obama 's press secretary , Katie McCormick Lelyveld , said Thursday that it was " inappropriate to use young , private citizens for marketing purposes . "
That fascination will make the dolls a success , said Denise Gary Robinson , president of DollsLikeMe.com , an online specialty doll boutique that specializes in ethnic dolls , toys and gifts .
" Girls all over the world , of all colors , will be looking for these dolls .
They want to identify with these two girls , " Robinson said .
Among the 30 other TyGirlz pictured on Ty 's website are ones named Lindsay , Britney , Paris , Hillary and Jenna ( but no Barbara . )
The collection was introduced in 2007 .
Public figures have a legal right to control their how their images are used , but Lundeen would not comment on legal issues or if the company 's lawyers have become involved with the dolls .

One of the big problems facing VR is the issue of mobility -- how do you allow users unrestricted movement in virtual reality , while keeping them relatively static inreality ?
Omni-directional treadmills have been tried in the past , and now researchers at the University of Tsukuba in Japan have developed something called CirculaFloor .
The system uses four robotic tiles that constantly shift position , ensuring that there 's always a tile in the direction you 're headed .
Additionally , the entire assembly moves slowly backwards , giving one the impression of movement while they 're actually standing relatively still .
The tiles also incorporate lifts , for simulating staircases and the like .
While this research is promising , there 's still plenty of work to be done -- for instance , the tiles still move awful slowly , and while they seem sturdy enough for a leisurely stroll , a Left 4 Dead implementation is not likely to happen any time soon .

Anthrax spores do n't match dead researcher 's samples John Byrne
Published : Thursday February 26 , 2009
Print This Email This Poisonous anthrax that killed five Americans in the weeks after the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks does n't match bacteria from a flask linked to Bruce Ivins , the researcher who committed suicide after being implicated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation , a scientist said .
Spores used in the deadly mailings " share a chemical ' fingerprint ' that is not found in the flask linked to Bruce Ivins , " Roberta Kwok wrote in Nature News , citing Joseph Michael , a scientist at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , New Mexico .
Michael analyzed letters sent to the New York Post and offices of Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy , and found a distinct " chemical signature " not present in the flask known as RMR - 1029 , which Ivins could access in his laboratory at Fort Detrick , Maryland .
``Spores from two of those show a distinct chemical signature that includes silicon , oxygen , iron , and tin ; the third letter had silicon , oxygen , iron and possibly also tin , '' Kwok wrote .
``Bacteria from Ivins ' RMR - 1029 flask did not contain any of those four elements . ''
The results do n't necessarily exonerate Ivins .
The mailed spores could have been removed from the flask and grown under different conditions , resulting in varying chemical contents , Jason Bannan , a microbiologist and forensic examiner at the FBI 's Chemical Biological Sciences Unit in Quantico , Virginia , told Kwok .
" It does n't surprise me that it would be different , " said Bannan .
The FBI has asked the National Academy of Science to perform an independent review of the anthrax investigation data .
The two sides are working on a contract for the study .
Ivins , 62 , a biodefense researcher who spent years searching for a better anthrax vaccine , overdosed on Tylenol and Codiene last year after learning that the FBI was preparing to indict him on murder charges .

Unify and Notify : Shuttleworth Explains Proposed Notification Changes
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 24 , 2008
Related Blog Posts Tips for New Netbook Owners
If you were unable to attend ( or follow along with ) the events at the Ubuntu Developer Summit , the highlights and more controversial proposals are now being discussed in the wider community .
One proposal for Ubuntu's Jaunty release was to unify notification display and interaction between GNOME and KDE .
It 's an idea that 's been met with nearly every reaction imaginable , but Mark Shuttleworth has a very reassuring post on his blog that explains some of the reasoning behind this proposal .
I am going to share my own little bias here : I find notifications that require action irritating , but they 're rather low on the list of life 's irritations .
I find the idea that I might not be able to make a notification go away exactly when I want irritating as well .
Again , low on the list of annoyances , and it's a sad fact of life that I can't have everything both ways .
Higher on the " irritating " list are two far more important things , and Shuttleworth addresses them in a straightforward , honest manner .
They have little to do with notifications , and everything to do with developing software in the smaller sense , and having a successful project in the larger sense .
Shuttleworth calls these proposals " constructive experiments " that have as much potential for success as failure , and its not really possible to tell what the outcome will be until everything is tested , and the data and input collected and analyzed .
Unlikely ideas can work surprisingly well , and concepts that seem sure - fire winners can turn out horribly wrong .
Getting vested in any of these ideas , or writing them off prematurely , sells the software ( and ultimately , the users ) short .
He establishes that these are experiments -- not done deals , not foregone conclusions .
That 's a great approach .
He also states that these experiments should be positive , successful , first time around , and that if mistakes are made , they should be called as such :
" ... We should not inflict bad ideas on our users just because we ’re curious or arrogant or stubborn or proud .
Despite being occasionally curious , arrogant , stubborn and proud ... "
If I can't have the notifications both ways , there is comfort in the idea that if the approach is fundamentally flawed , those involved and affected -- from the user , through the developers , all the way up to Ubuntu 's founder , are willing to acknowledge and fix mistakes , or rethink the idea entirely .
That being said , this proposal is less likely to impact the end - user as it is application developers .
Notifications being simply notifications -- not critical messages -- the idea that the messages simply appear for a time , and disappear without requiring action ( with multiple messages queued for display one at a time ) might take a day or two for an end - user to adjust to .
The older notification system , Shuttleworth says , will be offered in upcoming Ubuntu releases so that users can test these against each other -- and choose the one they prefer .
Developers with applications using existing notification methods might balk a bit more .
There is some consolation here , though .
The proposal is based on a specification that 's been in the works in the freedesktop.org community .
Some features in the notification spec are deprecated , Shuttleworth says , but overall , the proposed changes for Jaunty will be compatible with current notification APIs .
Shuttleworth does n't foresee libnotify needing any changes , although there may be some additional work needed to make alerts that use features the proposal deprecates display through the libnotify API .
Another bright spot for developers : common code is good , but native desktop framework is still very important .
The goal for the new notification agent is that it can be built with Qt on KDE and GTK on GNOME .
This way , there is a significant amount of streamlining , but the system will feel -- and behave -- " natively . "
The proposal -- and the reactions -- highlight how small , almost " thoughtless " sorts of desktop behaviors make the user experience , and how crucial it is to think through every last behavior and interaction , no matter how trivial it seems .
The beauty is that this is being done with this proposal , but what makes it as near perfect as a developing project can be is the openness of the discussion , the transparency of the process , and the opportunity users and developers have to participate , or simply watch and learn .
Some Say Cuban Embargo Helps Castros United Nations votes for 17th time that the U.S. blockade of Cuba is illegal .
NEW YORK , Oct. 29 , 2008  -- Cuba 's warm sunsets have been chilled by the Cold War breeze of strict economic sanctions for nearly 50 years now : The American embargo policy that started with President John F. Kennedy has outlasted nine American presidents , and even Fidel Castro 's rule .
And today , it was condemned as an illegal blockade for the 17th year in a row at the United Nations .
Cuba 's communist government says it has cost the island $ 90 billion in trade -- and hurts the Cuban people , not Castro .
At a cardiac hospital in Havana , Neida Toribio frets over her daughter 's delicate condition .
Danai Toribio , 26 , has a heart condition that has required three operations because the medical equipment that could fix her problem is embargoed .
" I wish to have a baby and not have to be operated on anymore , " Danai Toribio says .
Equally frustrated are those tasked with the care of people like Toribio .
Dr. Francisco Carballes Garcia , a cardiology specialist , says the blockade limits his ability to treat patients and often he must improvise .
" Sometimes we have to make inventions , " he says , " to find some measures so that they can stay with us with an acceptable quality of life . "
Critics like Wayne Smith , a former American envoy to Cuba and now an ABC News consultant , believe the embargo has actually worked against freedom .
They believe it hurts the people of Cuba and allows Fidel and Raul Castro to use American sanctions as an easy excuse for a poorly performing economy .
" Fidel uses it to his advantage all the time , " says Smith .
" Any time he has some kind of economic problem he can say , ' Well , it 's largely because of the U.S. embargo . "
In the United States , the embargo is losing support even among the Cuban exile population , which according to a 2007 Brookings Institute poll supports unrestricted travel to Cuba and the sale of medicine and food -- even diplomatic relations .
The Cuban American National Foundation , a hard - line exile group , politically influential and vehemently anti-Castro , is one of the few voices left supporting the embargo .
According to Aldo Leiva , with CANF in Miami , there is no reason to lift the embargo given that in Cuba political prisoners are still in prisons and there are few human rights .
" The embargo is a strategy that must be used to promote democracy in Cuba , " Leiva says .
" It 's not so much a stick .
It 's more a carrot .
It 's there to offer the Cuban government if it institutes changes that will bring democracy to Cuba . "
But that is an isolated view , especially at the U.N. , which sees America 's embargo as a relic of the Cold War .
" Look , we have no support whatever in the world " Smith says .
" Everyone regards it as absurd .
Last year , the vote in the U.N. was 182 against the embargo . "
The four in favor were the United States , Palau , the Marshall Islands and Israel .
But because of U.S. veto power at the UN , four votes are enough to keep the 90 - mile divide between the United States and Cuba impassable .
Soon - to - be - President Barack Obama has appointed animal advocate Cass Sunstein to head the relatively obscure , yet powerful Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs .
The regulatory czar , as the position is generally called , is responsible for every regulatory agency in the country , such as the EPA , and will oversee all administration rules .
Sunstein is best known for his balanced views between government regulations and cost - benefit analysis and for his theory of behavioral economics and he is widely considered to be a great choice for the office .
However , a new controversy is arising over his views on animal rights and animal welfare .
[ social_buttons ]
Sunstein , a vegetarian , co-authored the book Animal Right : Current Debates and New Directions , and has advocated for much stricter regulations of almost every industry that uses animals , including entertainment , clothing , science and agriculture .
The Center For Consumer Freedom claims that he will even attempt to outlaw meat - eating and hunting .
What some are criticizing the most is Sunstein ’s argument that animals should be entitled to legal representation in court - a bold claim that , if enacted , would drastically change the role that animals hold in this country .
Sunstein advocates banning hunting unless it is for food and says that animal suffering needs to be a priority of humans .
But before people worry that Sunstein is going to force everyone in our country to go vegan , it should be noted that his views are rooted in pragmatism , and that animal suffering is his primary concern , not necessarily animal liberation :
If we focus on suffering , as I believe that we should , it is not necessarily impermissible to kill animals and use them for food ; but it is entirely impermissible to be indifferent to their interests while they are alive .
So too for other animals in farms , even or perhaps especially if they are being used for the benefit of human beings .
While I would be more than happy with a leader in Washington who does openly advocate animal liberation , I understand that on a sensitive issue like this , any progress is a big stride .
Maybe Proposition 2 was just the beginning of a new wave of animal welfare concerns ?
I can only hope .

Science fiction is n't ( as a rule ) about predicting the future , and science fiction writers are n't trying to predict it .
" No sensible science - fiction writer tries to predict anything , " says Frederick Pohl , whose work includes the classic The Space Merchants ( written with Cyril M. Kornbluth ) , MAN PLUS , and most recently The Last Theorem , co-authored with the late Arthur C. Clarke .
" Neither do the smartest futurologists .
What those people do is try to imagine every important thing that may happen ( so as to do in the present things which may encourage the good ones and forestall the bad ) and that 's what SF writers do in their daily toil . "
Accurate Predictions
Even When They Were n't Trying
Getting to the moon by shooting a manned capsule out of a way big cannon — Jules Verne , From The Earth To The Moon .
Getting to the moon courtesy of an anti-gravity metal — H.G. Wells , The First Men In The Moon courtesy of Cavorite , an anti-gravity metal .
Automatically controlled sliding doors ( and dozens of other things ) — Hugo Gernsback .
The telecommunications satellite — the late Arthur C. Clarke .
Tele - operated robotic hands , and waterbeds — Robert Heinlein .
... and even more Predictions From Science Fiction .
But many science fiction stories are set in the future , which means they need to include the future of technology ( or present reasons why things have n't changed ) .
That is , they have to extrapolate from " what / where things have been and are " to " what / where might be . "
CIO invited noted science fiction authors Larry Niven , Robert Sawyer , Nancy Kress and Charles Stross to share their thoughts on technology - related predictions , including lessons learned in the " business " of imagining what the future might be like .
Here 's what they had to say ( via e-mail ) .
What have you learned about predicting technology 's future ?
From ramscoops and brain pleasure implants ( " drouds " ) to Romulan - class warrior cats ( " Kzinti ) and Earth - orbit - sized habitats ( the Ringworld ) , few science fiction writers have given us bigger visions than Larry Niven .
Niven has written or co-authored over 50 books , including the Ringworld series , and with co-author Jerry Pournelle , The Mote In God 's Eye , The Gripping Hand and Oath of Fealty .
Niven has won five Hugo Awards ( awarded annually by science fiction fans ) and a Nebula Award ( awarded annually by the Science Fiction Writers of America ) .
His most recent books include Juggler of Worlds ( with co-author Edward M. Lerner ) and the upcoming Escape From Hell ( with Jerry Pournelle ) , a sequence to their Inferno .
Niven 's science fiction includes a wide range of technology we do n't ( yet ) have , from room - temperature supercomputers ( Ringworld ) to " stepping disks " ( manhole - sized unenclosed teleportation units ) .
Here 's what Niven has to say regarding techniques for predicting a valid future technology :
Look for the goals humankind will never give up .
Instant travel , instant education , longevity .
Then try to guess when it will appear and what it will look like .
Pay close attention to parasite control .
There is always someone who wants the money for something else .
You 're obliged to predict not just the automobile but the traffic jam and the stranglehold on gas prices .
Nobody invents anything unless there is at least the illusion of a profit .
The only science fiction movie that did this right , according to Niven ( it was n't clear whether he was referring to the last point , or all his bullet points ) , was the 1983 film Brainstorm , in which , according to Niven , " a valid technology was followed from its inception to its limits . "
" This goes right back to the Space Race , and the movie 2001 , " ( directed by Stanley Kubrick , written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke ) says Robert J. Sawyer .
Sawyer has written over 20 science fiction books , including his Neanderthal trilogy , Factoring Humanity , and Mindscan , plus numerous stories .
His most recent novel is Rollback , and he has a trilogy in progress ( the first volume due April 2009 ) in which the Web wakes up .
Sawyer is one of only seven writers in history — and the only Canadian — to win all three of the world 's top Science Fiction awards for best novel of the year : the Hugo , the Nebula , and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award .
" No one predicted in 1969 , when the first man walked on the moon , that the last man would walk on the moon just three years later , " Sawyer points out .
" When Arthur C. Clarke depicted all those wonders — artificial intelligence , suspended animation , floating hotels , cities on the moon , manned interplanetary travel — in the 1968 movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey , those seemed like reasonable predictions for the dawn of this century , but none of them came to pass . "
" The trap we science and space buffs always fall into is thinking that everybody will want the things that we want , " Sawyer explains .
" They do n't ; they have their own agendas , and ultimately , as in everything , it 's the economy , stupid .
Just because you personally want something does n't mean there 's a market for it .
Just because we technically could do something does n't mean that 's how others want to see their tax dollars spent . "
" Future tech can only be predicted short - term — say , 10 or 15 years ahead , " states Nancy Kress .
Kress is the author of 25 books , including 16 science fiction or fantasy novels , two thrillers , four story collections and three books on writing .
Her most recent books are Nano Comes to Clifford Falls and Other Stories and the present - day bio-thriller Dogs .
Forthcoming is Steal Across the Sky , " an SF novel of galactic crime , genetic engineering and alien atonement . "
Kress has won every major award in science fiction , including four Nebulas given by the Science Fiction Writers of America .
Yes , Clarke got communication satellites right , Kress says " — but he missed computers in , say , the classic Childhood 's End .
When writers extrapolate from existing trends , that leaves out the wild card , which is where the most interesting tech often comes from —
Alexander Fleming noticing a contaminant on lab bacteria , Steve Jobs tinkering in his garage . "
Talking lobsters ?
Post - singularity hyper -tech ?
Inherited parallel world - hopping ?
Bank robberies in virtual reality ?
Who else could this be but Charles Stross ?
In addition to dozens of articles for Computer Shopper and other computer publications on the subjects of Linux , Perl and other topics , Stross has written dozens of stories and 16 science fiction novels to date , including Saturn 's Children , Halting State and his Merchant Princes series .
" Donald Rumsfeld was right , " states Stross .
" That is to say , his point about the known unknowns and unknown unknowns nailed the problem of predicting the future spot-on .
We can point to extrapolations of current technological and social trends , but we can't extrapolate on the basis of stuff that has n't been discovered yet .
For example :
In 1962 it was possible , just about , to see the future of integrated circuitry ( and even , if you were very far - sighted , to glimpse Moore 's Law and its implications ) , but the CD player was right out of the picture — solid state lasers lay at least a decade in the future . "
What one or two predictions do you feel you got right — or way wrong ?
" The one I 'm proudest of is predicting the YouTube user - generated video revolution , " says Robert Sawyer .
" That was in 1998 's Factoring Humanity ( in which I called it ' desktop TV , ' as a parallel to ' desktop publishing ' ) ; Factoring Humanity was a Hugo Award - finalist . "
On his " missed " list , says Sawyer , " The notion that we'd have flying cars by 2030 ( which I have in my 1999 novel , FlashForward .
Granted , 2030 has n't rolled around yet , but I now think that flying cars are as unlikely as eating pills instead of full meals , the other big prediction that ' The Jetsons ' made ; both of those things are cartoon ideas , not reasonable predictions . "
Nancy Kress says , " My novel Beggars in Spain postulated sleeplessness , and although we 're not yet there , the drug modafinil brings us much closer .
My short story " Evolution " is based on the resistance of disease to every antibiotic we can throw at it — a prediction just starting to come true and likely to become far , far worse .
On the other hand , I hope I 'm dead wrong about Stinger 's creation of genetically engineered pathogens that can target a specific population , and also about the ultimate extent of global warming in Nothing Human .
We 'll know in 100 years . "
If you were writing one of your novels or stories today , would you change anything about the predictions you made ?
" In my most recent novel , Rollback , published in 2007 , I predicted that humanoid household robots would be common within 40 years , " says Robert Sawyer .
" I 'd revise that figure way downward now .
Having been to MIT recently , and looking at what 's coming out of Japan , I suspect we 'll see them much sooner than that .
People want household help ; people hate anything that makes them conscious of class and past injustices .
Robots are the answer , and they 'll be here soon . "
Nancy Kress would n't change anything .
" The short - term predictions have proved true , and the long - term ones can't yet be verified or disproven .
Literary safety in avoiding the mid-range timescale ! "
What advice do you have for writers — or technologists — trying to make five to twenty year predictions and forecasts ?
" The standard advice is to be aggressive in your predictions ; there 's this notion that the future always comes faster than you think it will , " suggests Robert Sawyer .
" But , actually , I think a lot of us underestimated social inertia , " he adds .
" Most of us predicted a secular 21st century , and it 's anything but that .
The world is like a person :
It does n't change as it gets older .
Rather , it simply becomes more obviously what it always was .
People always liked having phones and portable music , but most people never wanted to lug a camera , or an ebook reader , or a PDA around .
The future is adding functionality to those things we 've already admitted into our lives , not trying to convince people they need new categories of things ; the iPhone — the all - in - one device that is , first and foremost , something familiar — is the correct paradigm . "
Charles Stross says , " We are living in interesting times ; in fact , they 're so interesting that it is not currently possible to write near - future SF . "
( See Stross ' essay , Living through Interesting Times for more on this . )
Nancy Kress advises those who are trying to predict the future to " Study the cutting edge of the specific field .
Create wild cards .
And then do n't worry about being wrong — it 's science fiction . "
One thing we personally feel safe in predicting :
You 'll enjoy reading what these authors have to say .
And what could be cooler than reading science fiction as part of your job ?
Daniel P. Dern is a freelance technology writer based in Newton Center , Mass .
His website is www.dern.com and his technology blog is TryingTechnology.com .
In a thorough and serious - minded commentary spanning four pages in the journal Nature , published in advance online on Sunday , six scientists from of the world 's best universities along with the Nature editor himself advocate for the use of cognitive - enhancing drugs by healthy individuals .
What comes to mind when reading this , however , is , what were they smoking ?
Their argument begins with the fact that " healthy " college students are illegally taking drugs such as Ritalin and Adderall , prescribed for attention deficit disorders , to boost their concentration .
Almost a whopping 7 percent do this , they estimate , just shy of the 97 percent that get drunk or high ( yes , my back - of - the - envelope estimate ) .
First , if you are thinking about taking their advice tomorrow , you may want to think again .
Ritalin is riddled with side effects , such as heart problems , and Adderall adds all the more to the mix , such as the risk of chemical dependency .
Their reported minimal boost in cognitive ability is anecdotal .
The Nature commentary is ivory tower intellectualism at its best .
The authors state that society must prepare for the growing demand of such drugs ; that healthy adults should be allowed drugs to enhance cognitive ability ; that this is " morally equivalent " and no more unnatural than diet , sleep , or the use of computers ; that we need an evidence - based approach to evaluate the risks ; and that we need legal and ethical policies to ensure fair and equitable use .
Sounds good on paper .
What the authors failed to address — perhaps for lack of cognitive - enhancing drugs , or perhaps too many for too long — is the implications of such a drug - dependent culture .
For now there are no studies on the long - term effects of these drugs on healthy people .
The drugs affect the brain , which is kind of important for many people .
This is n't an experiment in controlling ingrown toenails .
And what 's good for someone with a disorder is n't necessary better for someone without the disorder .
But , if we find in 10 or 20 years that the drugs do n't do damage , what are the benefits ?
These are stimulants that help with concentration .
College students take such drugs to pass tests ; graduates take them to gain professional licenses .
They are akin to using a calculator to solve an equation .
Do you really want a doctor who passed his boards as a result of taking speed — and continues to depend on that for his practice ?
Next , if these theorized safe and effective pills do n't just get you through a test or the day 's daily brain task but also make you smarter , whatever smarter means , then what ?
Where 's the boundary between genius and madness ?
If Einstein had taken such drugs , would he have created a better theory of gravity ?
Or would he have become delusional , chasing quantum ghosts with no practical application , or worse yet , string theory .
( Please use " string theory " in your subject line for easy sorting of hate mail . )
Next , if these drugs make you smarter precisely the way you want them to make you smarter — in some creative and productive way — who gets them ?
How will they be priced ?
How soon before the penis enlargement industry produces herbal stimulants to profit from everyone 's cognitive shortcomings ?
While the commentary makes effective arguments — that this is n't cheating , because cheating is based on what the rules are ; that this is fair , because hiring a tutor is n't outlawed for being unfair to those who can't afford it ; that this is n't unnatural , because humans with computers and antibiotics have been shaping what is natural for millennia ; that this is n't drug abuse anymore than taking multivitamins is — the authors seem divorced from reality in the examples they provide of effective stimulant use today .
For instance , they point to the U.S. Army 's use of stimulants for soldiers to stave off sleep and to stay sharp .
But the Army cares little about the long - term health effects of soldiers , who come home scarred physically or mentally , if they come home at all .
It 's a risk - benefit decision for the Army , and in a life - or - death situation , stimulants help .
Most surprising about the commentary is that no thought is given to the concept that if you replace the words " cognitive - enhancing drug " with " genetic manipulation , " you 're talking about eugenics .
Drugs can act at the DNA level , after all , inducing chains to unwind and proteins to do their magic .
We 've come rather far with our brains .
We may find that it is harder for our healthy legs to walk with crutches .

8 GM Firebird III
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Why is it Awesome ?
Jets were still new to the world in the 1950s , and GM's Firebird III was intended to address the big question on everyone 's mind :
How can we strap a jet engine into a family sedan ?
Thus , the Firebird III housed a Whirlfire turbine engine .
If you 're not sure how exactly a turbine engine works , just focus on the word " Whirlfire , " and you 'll get a sense of it .
And if it 's got what is essentially a jet engine inside it , it might as well look like a jet , right ?
Damn right .
Along with the obligatory tail fins , nose fins and sharply contoured hood , the car included two separate , clear plastic , bubble canopies .
Nothing seems quite as cool as rocketing down the highway of tomorrow with your head peeking out of a plastic bubble , eyes sharply honed on the bogeys / cars around you .

The best part of the Firebird III , though , is that there is no steering wheel .
Because really , what kind of jet has a steering wheel ?
Instead , all control of the car is down to a single , disc - shaped joystick .
Push the stick side to side to steer , forward to accelerate , back to brake and twist to change gears , just like a real - live airplane !
We 'd definitely ask for the extra feature where pushing down on the joystick fires twin .50 caliber machine guns .
" Why can't I buy one ? ! ? "
Despite the turbine engine 's inherent coolness and bevy of advantages over a piston driven engine , including the fact that it can run on almost anything that 's combustible ( including tequila ! ) , it has always been an impractical option for powering a car .

But ... but look at it .
Gasoline powered turbine engines produce nitrous oxide in large amounts , a major greenhouse gas that eventually forms acid rain , making ozone killing carbon emissions seem tame .
Also , a turbine engine sounds more like a loud , high pitched vacuum cleaner than the iconic , rumbling purr of an American V8 .
Oh , and there was a small additional problem where failing to follow the correct start - up procedure while in a drunken haze could wreck the engine in seconds and render it useless .
Oops .
On behalf of the Data .
Text team , I am delighted to announce the release of preview versions of two new packages :
text 0.1
Fast , packed Unicode text support , using a modern stream fusion framework .
text - icu 0.1
Augments the text package with comprehensive character set conversion support and normalization ( and soon more ) , via bindings to the ICU library .
These packages fill out critical pieces of functionality for the Haskell platform , without compromising on either performance or safety .
Stream fusion offers the possibility of writing text manipulation code in a clean , high - level way , with intermediate allocations and traversals being fused away .
We are referring to these as preview releases because although the text package in particular has been quite heavily tested , it has not been thoroughly tuned , and we have not yet implemented a chunked lazy text representation suitable for streaming gigabytes of data .
The APIs are pretty conventional , but are still subject to change .

Turning your personal computer into a media server means that you will be able to play video ( AVI , MPEG , MPEG - 2 , DivX , XviD , MKV , WMV , MP4 or even DVD ISOs or VIDEO_TS folders ) and audio files ( MP3 , OGG , FLAC or WMA ) or view your favorite photos ( JPG , PNG , GIF , TIFF ) stored on your PC's hard drive on a big screen TV set or LCD / Plasma high - definition display , via a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 console .
The following tutorial will teach you how to set up such a media server , step - by - step , from configuring your PC and gaming console , to installing and setting up the media server software in your Linux box .
We 've offered two media server installations , so you can choose whichever fits you best .
STEP 1 - Setting up your Linux machine for Media Serving
Set up the PC network connection
You will need to have :
1. Two 10/100 or 10/100/1000 ( recommended ) network cards ; 2 . An Ethernet cable ( it has to be as long as the distance between the PC and the console ) .
Assuming you already have a network card on your PC :
· Insert the second network card into an empty PCI slot on your motherboard .
· Connect one head of the Ethernet cable on the second network card and the other one into the gaming console .
· Hit ALT +F2 and type the following command :
gksu gedit /etc/network/interfaces
· Enter your password when asked .
· A text file will open .
Add the following lines ( copy and paste ) to the end of the file :
# The secondary network interface auto eth1 iface eth1 inet static address 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255 network 192.168.1.0
· Save the file and reboot your PC .
Set up the console network connection
For PlayStation 3 :
· Go to Settings -> Network Settings -> Media Server Connection ->
Enable
· Go to Settings -> Network Settings -> Internet Connection Settings .
· Select " Yes " when asked if you want to perform Internet connection settings .
· Select " Easy " and wait for the wizard to check the network configuration .
· Select " Manual " and enter the following :
IP Address : 192.168.1.10 Subnet Mask : 255.255.255.0 Default Router : 192.168.1.1 Primary DNS : ( type the first DNS from your provider ) Secondary DNS : ( type the second DNS from your provider )
Editor 's note :
To see the DNS of your ISP ( Internet Service Provider ) type the following command in a terminal : cat /etc/resolv.conf .
The two IP addresses can be used in the above configuration .
· Select " Automatic " for MTU .
· Select " Do Not Use " for Proxy Server .
· Select " Enable " for UPnP .
· Hit X to accept the settings and test the connection .
For Xbox 360 :
· Go to System Blade of the Xbox 360 dashboard and select Network Settings .
· Click Edit Settings , then go to Basic Settings .
You will see IP Settings , DNS Settings and other options .
· Click IP settings and select " Manual " to set the IP address , subnet mask and gateway manually :
IP Address : 192.168.1.10 Subnet Mask : 255.255.255.0 Gateway : 192.168.1.1
· Go back to the previous menu and select DNS settings .
· Select " Manual " to set the DNS addresses manually .
STEP 2 - Installing and configuring a Media Server
Method One - uShare Media Server
Advantages :
· Works with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 ; · Very easy , one - time configuration .
Disadvantages :
· Command - line only ; · You will be able to play ONLY the video / audio / image files supported by the consoles .
The GeeXboX uShare is a free UPnP Audio / Video & DLNA Media Server for Linux platforms .
It works with Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 gaming consoles .
uShare is very easy to install ; just open your package manager software , search for ushare , libdlna and libupnp , and install them .
Installing uShare in Ubuntu :
Open Synaptic from System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
Enter your password when asked and search for ushare .
Mark the " ushare " package for installation ...
Click the " Mark " button when asked if you want to install the " libdlna0 " required package :
Click the " Apply " button to install the packages .
Close Synaptic when the installation is complete .
Configure uShare :
The uShare configuration file will be found under the /etc folder .
To edit the file , hit ALT + F2 and type the following command :
gksu gedit /etc/ushare.conf
Enter your password when asked .
The configuration file has no more than 10 ( ten ) settings .
The following 5 ( five ) are the ones you need to edit :
1. USHARE_IFACE=eth1
( Put here the name of the network interface you use for sharing ( see STEP 1 ) .
Usually it's the second one , eth1 ) .
2 . USHARE_PORT=49200
( Put here the port you want uShare to use for serving media .
49200 is fine ! ) .
3 . USHARE_DIR = ( Put here the path of the folders you want to share .
For example , let 's say you want to share your home folder 's Video folder ... just type : USHARE_DIR=/home / YOURUSERNAME/Video) 4 . ENABLE_XBOX=yes
( Type yes here if you have an Xbox 360 gaming console .
Otherwise leave it as it is ) .
5 . ENABLE_DLNA=yes
( Type yes here if you have a PlayStation 3 gaming console .
Otherwise leave it as it is ) .
Save the configuration file when you 're done .
Hit ALT +F2 and type the following command to start the uShare media server :
gksu /etc/init.d/ushare start
For an easy usage of the uShare media server , it 's a very good idea to create a desktop shortcut of the reload function .
Otherwise , you will always have to open a terminal and type the reload command when you add / delete files to the shared folder .
Right click on your desktop and select Create Launcher ...
Type " uShare Media Server " ( without quotes ) in the " Name " field and then paste the following line in the " Command " field :
gksu /etc/init.d/ushare reload
You can also add a nice icon if you click on the left icon box .
Various icons can be found under the /usr / share / icons / Human / scalable folder .
Click OK to create the launcher .
Editor 's note : Every time you will add or delete files in the shared folder ( remember that from now on you will use ONLY the folder (s ) you 've set up in the uShare configuration file , for storage of the videos you want to play ) you must reload the uShare media server by double clicking on the desktop shortcut .
Method Two - PS3 Media Server
Advantages :
· Has Graphical User Interface ; ·
You will be able to play all of the video file formats ; · Has auto - refresh ; · Flickr / Picasa photo viewing support ; · DVD ISO image playback ; · Multi-platform .
Disadvantages :
· Works ONLY with PlayStation 3 .
The PS3 Media Server is a DLNA compliant UPnP Media Server for the PlayStation 3 gaming console .
PS3 Media Server is written in Java , therefore it can be used on Linux , Windows and Macintosh platforms .
It does n't require any installation !
Even if the PS3 Media Server is able to play all the video files out there , some of them ( the ones that are not supported by the PlayStation 3 , yet ) will require real - time video transcoding .
For the transcoding operation you will need to have at least an Intel Core 2 Duo processor and 1 GB of RAM , especially for 720p / 1080 p high - definition files , such as the MKV ones .
Installing PS3 Media Server in Ubuntu :
As we 've mentioned above , the PS3 Media Server does not require any installation , just grab the latest version from here and extract the archive on your home folder .
It is written in Java , so make sure that you have a valid Java installation in your PC .
For an easy usage , we will create a desktop shortcut of the PS3 Media Server executable ( otherwise , you will always have to open the home folder and double click the executable , in order to start it ) .
ATTENTION : The Mplayer , Mencoder and FFMpeg packages need to be installed in your Linux box .
Ubuntu users can install them using the Synaptic Package Manager or by issuing the following command in a terminal : sudo apt - get install mplayer mencoder ffmpeg
Right click on your desktop and select Create Launcher ...
Type " PS3 Media Server " ( without quotes ) in the " Name " field and type the path where you 've extracted the PS3 Media Server archive in the " Command " field :
/home / YOURUSERNAME/pms-linux-1.03/PMS.sh
Note :
You need to replace YOURUSERNAME in the above line with your username ( e.g. /home/ marius/pms-linux -1.03 / PMS.sh ) .
You can also add a nice icon if you click on the left icon box .
Various icons can be found under the /usr / share / icons / Human / scalable folder .
Click OK to create the launcher .
Configure the PS3 Media Server
Just like the " installation " part , the PS3 Media Server does not require any configuration .
Once started , the server will immediately appear on the XMB ( PlayStation 3's interface ) .
However , we suggest the following settings :
1 . Set the character encoding of your PlayStation 3 , under the " General Configuration " tab .
To see what charset your PS3 is using , go to System settings -> Charset on the XMB .
2 . Under the " Navigation / Share Settings " tab check the following options : Hide # Video Settings # Folder ,
Hide file extensions ,
Hide trancoding engine names .
3 . Under the " Navigation / Share Settings " tab add the folders where you keep your video , audio and image files that you want to play on the PlayStation 3 , in the " Shared folders " box .
Otherwise , the PS3 Media Server will list the entire file system !
4 . Under the " Transcoding Settings " tab you can change the Video quality settings to :
keyint=1:vqscale=1:vqmin=1 /*
Lossless Quality , Crazy Bitrate */ ( for 720 p video files ) keyint=1:vqscale=1:vqmin=2 /*
Best Quality */ ( for 1080 p video files )
Also , setting the Audio to " 2 channels Stereo " is a good idea .
ONLY if you own a HDMI 5.1 capable receiver you can switch to the " 6 channels 5.1 " option .
5 . When everything is set up , and ONLY if the PS3 Media Server window is " bothering " you ( because it does n't have a tray icon yet ) , you can check the " Start minimzed " option under the " General Configuration " tab .
However , this will hide the PS3 Media Server interface .
To get it back , you need to edit the PMS .
conf file in your home folder , and replace the " true " value of the minimized option with " false " ( without quotes ) .
That 's it !

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - Despite a record drop in prices , sales of new homes fell 10.2 % in January to a record - low seasonally adjusted annual rate of 309,000 , the Commerce Department estimated Thursday .
Sales were down 48.2 % compared with a year earlier , the government reported , an indication that the downturn in the housing market was still accelerating as the recession headed into its second year .
Sales were weaker than expected .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch were looking for a sales pace of about 320,000 .
See Economic Calendar .
Builders cut their median sales prices by a record 9.9 % in January compared with December in a bid to move unsold homes .
Median sales prices are down 13.5 % in the past year , the largest year - over - year decline in 38 years .
The average sales price has fallen a record 17.6 % in the past year .
Builders are faced with intense competition from foreclosures and distressed sales of older homes .
Buyers are faced with declining wealth and an uncertain labor market , offsetting lower mortgage rates that are improving affordability .
Inventories of unsold homes fell by 3.1 % to 342,000 , the 13th consecutive decline .
However , sales are falling even faster .
The inventory at the end of January represented a record - high 13.3 month supply at the January sales pace .
Nearly half the homes for sale have been completed .
The builders ' overstock " will keep prices falling for the rest of this year at least , " wrote Ian Shepherdson , chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics .
On Wednesday , the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes fell to a 12 - year low in January .
See full story .
Government statisticians have low confidence in the monthly report , which is subject to large revisions and large sampling and other statistical errors .
In most months , the government is n't sure whether sales rose or fell .
The standard error in January , for instance , was plus or minus 15.4 % .
Read the full government report .
The government says it can take up to five months to establish a new trend in sales .
Over the past five months , sales have been on a 374,000 annual pace , 42 % slower than a year earlier .
In all of 2008 , 483,000 homes were sold down , from 776,000 in 2007 and 1.05 million in 2006 .
The release was the third economic report of the day that was weaker than expected .
" It 's getting uglier by the day , " said Harm Bandholz , an economist for UniCredit Markets .
In other reports , the Labor Department said initial jobless claims rose to a 27 - year high of 667,000 while a record 5.1 million were collecting state unemployment checks .
See full story .
Also , the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods dropped 5.2 % in January , a record sixth decline in a row as U.S. factories suffer from falling demand from consumers , businesses , and foreign markets .
See full story .
Details
Sales fell in three of four regions , led by a 28 % decline in the West to a record low 59,000 .
Sales fell 6.5 % in the South and fell 5.6 % in the Midwest .
Sales rose 12.5 % in the Northeast , plus or minus 93 % .
Inventories fell 3.1 % overall .
Inventories of completed homes dropped 4 % , inventories of homes under construction fell 5 % , and inventories of homes yet to be started were flat .
Completed homes represented 49 % of all homes for sale , up from 40 % a year ago .

Nathan
Hale has long been enshrined as a patriotic American icon for his last words before his hanging by the British , “ I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country . ”
M. William Phelps , who is the author of the new book The Life and Death of America ’s First Spy : Nathan Hale , believes Hale never uttered those exact words .
But in Phelps ’s view , that would n’t in any way take away from the significance and importance of Hale ’s legacy .
One of the defining projects of any Hale biographer would be to make an attempt at separating the folk - lore from reality , and Phelps does a fine job in this account .
Phelps also focuses on how defining Hale ’s Christian faith was in his brief life asserting “ even at a young age , he put Christian values before all else . ”
Phelps describes
Hale as a man who enjoyed his scholarly pursuits and friendships at Yale .
The picture that is drawn of Hale is a young man who is committed to his faith , to his family , and serving others .
In fact , after his graduation from Yale he went on to serve as a teacher in order to better prepare young minds for the world .
One of the many moving accounts of Phelps ’s book is the wonderful things people say about Hale as a teacher , as a Christian , and as a man of character .
An acquaintance noted , “ His capacity as a teacher , and the mildness of his mode of instruction , was highly appreciated by Parents & Pupils ; his appearance , manners , & temper secured the purest affections of those to whom he was known . ”
Phelps also makes note of how he impressed people with his ability to express and explain the importance of liberty , and the oppression of the English Crown .
His words were magnified even more because he chose them carefully and spoke from the heart .
Hale decided to take a leave of absence from teaching to join Washington ’s Army .
He was commissioned a lieutenant , and he wrote to his father to say , “ A sense of duty urged me to sacrifice everything for my country . ”
Hale ’s father already had five of his eight sons taking up arms against the British .
Hale distinguished himself on the battlefield just as he did as a teacher by being focused on sacrifice , service , and his commitment to being a professional officer .
With Washington ’s Army in New York , more information was needed about the British troops in the area .
Hale enthusiastically volunteered to go undercover to obtain the necessary information .
Fellow officers tried to talk him out of it declaring the mission a “ death sentence , ” and declared that spying was unbecoming of the character of an army officer .
Phelps notes :
I.W. Stuart described a spy as a ‘ companion of darkness . ’
There was no way of dressing the job up to appear less dishonest than it was .
‘ If he moved in the light , ’ Stuart wrote , ‘ it is behind walls , in the shadow of trees , in the loneliness of clefts , under the cover of hills . . . skulking with the owl , the mole , or the Indian . ’
One of the problems Nathan faced as a spy was that , on his best day , Nathan Hale was none of those .
He embodied the spirit of that compassionate man Asher Wright described : the one who knelt by the bedside of a fellow , a devoted Christian who prayed for a soldier dying next to him in the marsh .
He was not an impostor , an actor .
However , Nathan ’s commitment to the cause overrode any of the hazards .
He had made a decision and saw it as his duty as an American soldier to follow through with it .
Phelps in his account also reinforces the fact that a well educated man was needed for the mission in order to procure the proper sketches and notes for General Washington .
Hale went behind enemy lines disguised as a Dutch school teacher in farm clothes .
Phelps tries to put to rest the often cited account that Hale was spotted and turned in by a loyalist cousin named Samuel Hale , arguing instead new evidence favors that he was tricked into admitting his spying by a ruthless and savvier British Colonel , named Robert Rogers .
In any event , on his way back to the American line , Hale was caught and disclosed the details of his mission and was sentenced to death by hanging the next morning for espionage .
Hale was refused the presence of a chaplain and a bible before execution , which he had asked to be granted to him .
Several British accounts testify to the immense courage
Hale displayed and faced even with the certainty of his earthly demise .
He warned the onlookers “ to be prepared to meet death in whatever shape it may appear . ”
A captain in the Continental Army , Hale was only twenty - one when he was executed .
Phelps declared of Hale :
Nathan accepted his sentence .
He stood proudly , head tilted skyward , posture firm , hands tied behind his back .
Then , in a phrase that has been misquoted throughout the centuries and turned into a slogan for patriotism , he said , ‘ I am so satisfied with the cause in which I have engaged that my only regret is that I have not more lives than one to offer in its service . ’
This is perhaps the most often misremembered moment in the Nathan Hale story :
What did he say moments before he was executed ?
The line attributed to him – ‘ I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country ’ – is only a paraphrase of what Nathan actually said , which was reported in the Independent Chronicle on May 17 , 1781 , as part of an article many believed William Hull narrated to the reporter .
But contemporary scholars and historians have said the apocryphal quote was derived from the popular Revolutionary War play Cato .
This poetic line fit with the heroism being created around Nathan ’s legacy at the time it became popular decades after his death .
His peers wanted him to be remembered not as a failed spy , but as a hero who spoke with patriotic self - worth at the moment of his death .
In contrast , the Essex Journal , on February 2 , 1777 , reported Nathan ’s final words as ‘ You are shedding the blood of the innocent .
If I had ten thousand lives , I would lay them all down , if called to do it , in defence of my injured , bleeding country . ’
Hale was left to hang for three days , then cut down and buried in a shallow unmarked grave somewhere “ near present - day Third Avenue , between Forty - sixth and Sixty - sixth streets , ” according to Phelps .
His body was never recovered .
Phelps has crafted a story that helps to make Hale ’s life remarkable outside of what he is most assuredly known for , his heroic death .
His life confidently testifies to devotion to his Savior first , his country , and liberty .
Phelps movingly concludes his biography by asserting :
They 're the most powerful national entity ( read : mafia with a flag ) on the planet , so you 'd think they could handle some well meaning criticism of their collective persons employed and absurd policies without putting a person on a “ No - Fly ” list .
Nope , not these misnamed bumbling gaggle of public servants , as they dare consider themselves our masters .
So I took an herbal supplement that those ghouls at the FDA dislike and I 've went off and offended the state by seeking to prolong or improve the quality of my life .
Leaping lizards , there 's a penalty attached to such a use !
Who'd a thunk it ?
I 've hurt their teeny tiny little feelings .
I got a bill from those fatheads at the IRS .
My first impulse as an anarchist is to tell them to stuff it down their shorts .
Offend is what I set out to do and offend I 've somehow done against their fleecing racket when I 've politely asked them geography questions such as if they would know “ where the sun does n't shine ” when I told them not to put the notice to pay in my mailbox and they asked where instead it should go .
Feel like engaging the services of a “ flash mob ” for a quickie public protest ?
What 's the matter with you ?
Are you just begging some cop and the horse he rode in on to trample both your First Amendment rights and your lumpy head ?
They 're a thin skinned gang of louts without question .
As powerful as they are reaching throughout the world flexing their muscles as if they were posing for girls on the beach , they still can't take even a single individual thumbing their nose at their supposed might .
Sorry pal , federales will sift through your trash and luggage if you dare take an honest poke at their so - called “ leaders ” while they dream of a way to make it legal to have the likes of liberty activists such as myself fouling up a cage at Gitmo .
Yeah , I offended the state , and I 'm going to keep offending them .
What you going to do about it , chum ?
With Liberty ,

I ’ve been testing Microsoft Windows 7 Beta for the last few months .
It ’s pretty solid .
Just got news today that PC contractor Compal ( Acer , HP , etc… ) will be building systems with Windows 7 and shipping in September .
“ According to current planning , it should be late September or early October , ” said Ray Chen , president of Taipei - based Compal Electronics Inc. the maker of laptop personal computers for Hewlett - Packard Co. and Acer Inc .
Back in April 2008
Bill gates said that they would have a new operating system ready in a year .
I ’m actually really confident in this because I feel that this OS is solid with just minor bugs which are being ironed out as you read this .
Microsoft dominates 90 % of the market but has been losing points in the last couple of years to Mac .
They need this operating system to come out now .
Yes technically it ’s supposed to be released 3 years after Vista was launched but what can you do when you have something a lot better sitting on a shelf ?
If there is anything that business owners should be interested in , it is the opinion of other people about their business .
When the opinion of other people is positive , they would gladly and always patronize the organization .
If on the other hand , the opinion is negative , then it would also show in the reluctance of people to patronize the organization .
Some people might be satisfied with the local opinion about their business and decide to ignore what people from other countries think about their business .
This article would discuss why you should know and be concerned about what foreigners things about your business .
Might affect your local sales
If your business is local , the opinion of foreigners could easily change the opinion of the local people .
The Internet has made it very easy to access a wide range of information from all over the world .
The implication is that if the local opinion of your business is low and a foreigner has a positive opinion about your business , a single post on the Internet seen by just one local person could quickly spread .
The same applies to if you have a positive impression locally , but a foreigner has something bad to say about your company .
Thus , even if you are just a local store , you should try as much as possible to have a generally positive impression both locally and internationally .
One of the ways you can build a positive opinion locally and internationally is through an international review system , where people can review your company .
Might facilitate the establishment of a branch in that country
If you find out that your company has a positive opinion in another country or city even with no presence , then you know it is the right time to start a business there .
This is how so many companies started to spread and they started boasting of hundreds and thousands of stores across the world .
Trying to make sure positive opinions preceded them to those cities , such that they were able to become instantly successful in those foreign cities and countries .
Thus , customer opinion is very important to your business .
Could boost your online sales
If you have an online store where your products and services can be bought , the foreign positive opinion would mean that you can make sales in those other places easily as well .
You would get regular orders from other cities where people know about your business and have a positive opinion about your products .
Would help you improve your company
In some cases , you might be reaching out to just the local populace and you are trying to meet their needs .
However , if you know the opinions of other people about your business , you could get a new perspective and dimensions that could improve your products and services .
Such improvements would be useful for your local customers .
Furthermore , it would also start to attract foreigners .
With a little time , you might start to get foreign orders and you could be approached to expand to their areas because their opinion coupled with your initial local flavor is attractive to them .
Of course , there is the possible awkwardness of a man used to having someone light his cigar for him suddenly finding himself on the other end of the match .
But Mr. Greenhouse said he was used to riches - to - rags sorts crossing his threshold : “ Divorcees coming in who were married to multimillionaires .
All of a sudden they need to go to work and they come to us looking for a personal assistant job : ‘ Oh , I know about this because I ’ve had the rich lifestyle myself .
I know how to take care of rich people ’s affairs . ’
Image Anthony Cee , at the Three Little Indians Cigar Shop at Florios in Little Italy , says Wall Streeters could sell cigars , but there are no openings .
Credit ... Michael Appleton for The New York Times
“ I ’ve had people that come from all sorts of career paths and all of a sudden they want to be a butler , ” he added .
Speaking of cigars :
Sell cigars .
Great idea , said Anthony Cee , manager at Florio ’s in Little Italy , which contains the Three Little Indians Cigar Shop .
The image of the Wall Street big shot , the Gordon Gekko type , is exactly what his store likes to project .
“ Most of them are cigar smokers , so the education is there , ” he said .
“ If you smoke cigars , I would say frequently you know a little bit about cigars .
Professionalism is everything .
‘ Dress to impress , ’ that ’s my motto . ”
One little problem : no one is buying cigars .
“ We have no openings at all , ” Mr. Cee said .
“ Different times , we help everybody .
We had a lot of regulars who are out of work right now . ”
Shred documents .
No one knows sensitive paperwork like a Wall Street veteran .
Just ask Al Vari , a salesman with Code Shred , whose service area includes Lower Manhattan .
“ I spent 25 years on Wall Street , and now I ’m in the shredding industry with two friends of mine , ” he said .
“ It ’s not an easy business .
It ’s a service industry .
It ’s a trucking company .
You send out trucks to shred documents for people who have to shred them by law , or are , in a sense , paranoid . ”
Mr. Vari warned , however , that this is not a career for a person who has pushed a pencil all his life .
“ It ’s done by a truck driver , ” he said .
“ It ’s a labor job . ”
He considered a possible Wall Street applicant .
“ These guys , the worst thing that ’s happened to them is lead poisoning or deteriorated livers . ”
Someone , however , does have to sell the service .
“ To be an outside salesman , to have contacts in the industries , they could probably make a living , ” Mr. Vari said .
“ Not what they were making on Wall Street though , I ’ll tell you that . ”

Coalition of human rights groups call for panel to probe alleged torture under Bush John Byrne
Published : Thursday February 19 , 2009

The pressure on President Barack Obama to investigate alleged abuses under the presidency of George W. Bush is growing .
On Thursday , a coalition of human rights groups , including an organization at the New York University School of Law , called for Obama to establish a non-partisan independent commission to probe allegations of torture in the wake of wholesale roundup of terror suspects following the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
The announcement came from the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at the NYU School of Law .
The Center is part of a group of non-governmental organizations who joined to issue a group statement calling for a commission " to examine policies and actions related to the detention , treatment , and transfer of detainees after 9/11 . "
In addition , the Center asked Obama to begin prosecutions of those accused of abusing detainees .
Such prosecution seems to be unlikely , since Obama 's nominee for CIA director said during his confirmation hearings that CIA employees accused of harsh interrogations would not be targeted .
" Independently of the collective statement , CHRGJ supports efforts to immediately begin investigations into criminal conduct alongside other accountability mechanisms , which should include reparations for victims and other measures to restore justice , " the Center said in a release .
" As the new administration deals with the legacy of the Bush administration , the Center believes a commission is necessary -- but not a substitute -- for criminal investigations and prosecution of secret detention , extraordinary rendition , and coercive interrogation practices . "
The Center was part of a coalition of human rights groups that obtained Pentagon documents proving that detainees were tortured to death .
The American Civil Liberties Union released two pages of a Defense Department document concerning the deaths of two prisoners at an Afghan air base last week .
" In both cases , for example , [ prisoners ] were handcuffed to fixed objects above their heads in order to keep them awake , " they wrote .
" Additionally , interrogations in both incidents involved the use of physical violence , including kicking , beating , and the use of ' compliance blows ' which involved striking the [ prisoners ] legs with the [ interrogators ] knees .
In both cases , blunt force trauma to the legs was implicated in the deaths .
In one case , a pulmonary embolism developed as a consequence of the blunt force trauma , and in the other case pre-existing coronary artery disease was complicated by the blunt force trauma . "
" Victims do n't stop being victims and criminal acts are not simply absolved just because the United States has a new President , " Jayne Huckerby , Research Director of the New York University center , said in the Thursday release .
" The victims and the public deserve to know the truth about what was done in the name of U.S. national security and those responsible must face justice .
We need the new administration to make good on its promise of a return to human rights standards and accountability , not to engage in willful amnesia . "
Huckerby 's group , which represents two former CIA ' black site ' detainees , seems critical of Obama 's approach not to formally investigate the previous Administration 's policies and practices .
" Although the new administration has taken steps to close its ' black site ' prisons and Guantánamo Bay detention facilities , and has indicated it would ban the practices of extraordinary rendition and torture , it has failed to address questions of criminal responsibility and has made no mention of redress for victims , " the group said .
" The organization believes that a commission of inquiry is only one of several components required to make a real break with abusive policies and practices of the past . "
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) recently called for a " Truth Commission " to investigate alleged Bush Administration abuses , but the Obama Administration seemed cool to his proposal , and the senator has not yet introduced a bill to create the panel .
The Center released a bullet point list of their raison d'etre for torture probes and prosecutions , which follow .
* The American public has a right to know what violations were committed in the name of defending its national security  and to see justice done .
Public demand for the truth is growing by the day and evidence about past abuses continues to mount , yet there are still more questions than answers about past abuses .
Accountability mechanisms assist to identify the victims of abusive policies and what has happened to them ; establish responsibility for abuses ; propose institutional reforms to ensure abuses do not recur ; and can recommend tangible programs of redress for victims .
* Victims have a right to know the truth about what was done to them and to see those responsible held to account .
An unknown number of people were subjected to enforced disappearance , countless individuals were tortured , and many were sent to other countries where they were interrogated under torture or other cruel treatment .
Those victims and their families have a basic right to the truth and to forms of redress , an apology , and pursuit of criminal justice for those responsible .
These rights are unchanged by the fact that the majority of victims are non-U.S. citizens and that a number of crimes were committed overseas .
* International law requires countries to investigate and punish grave crimes .
There is abundant evidence in the public domain including admissions from the U.S. government itself that violations of United States and international law were committed in connection with U.S. detention , interrogation , and transfer operations .
This evidence imposes duties on the U.S. to investigate and punish .
A commission of inquiry and other accountability measures such as prosecutions , would play complementary functions to allow the U.S. to fulfill its duties .
* Either prosecutions or a commission , by themselves , would be insufficient .
When abuses have been adopted as a matter of policy , criminal prosecutions are necessary but not sufficient .
Because criminal prosecutions are aimed at establishing the culpability of individuals , rather than exposing system crimes ,  a broader strategy is needed to augment criminal prosecutions and uncover the workings of an abusive system .
A commission of inquiry tasked with evaluating the policies adopted , the systemic failures that led to the adoption and use of such policies , and the human toll of such abuses on victims and perpetrators alike is required .
* There is no reason that criminal prosecutions and a commission of inquiry could not proceed at the same time .
Each process has different purposes , but together they can help end a culture of impunity and denial .
Where issues of overlap or conflict are likely to arise , forward - looking policies such as the adoption of a conflict - resolution process can ensure that efforts are complementary .

Today ’s solar cells are mostly made from silicon , which can be costly to refine and purify , or from thin films of cadmium telluride , which contain relatively rare or toxic elements , making it difficult or impossible to scale them up to provide all of the world ’s electricity .
According to researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory one of the best materials for making cheap solar cells is iron pyrite ( better known as fool ’s gold ) .
They recently published an article in Environmental Science and Technology that surveys 23 semiconducting materials with properties that make them promising for converting sunlight into electricity .
They evaluated the cost and abundance of these materials to determine which would work well for low - cost solar cells that could be made in numbers large enough to supply the world ’s electricity needs .
The researchers argue that research should be directed at materials that are cheap and abundant enough to easily supply the world ’s energy needs .
Iron sulfide ( pyrite ) , or fool ’s gold , stood out from all the other options , followed closely by amorphous silicon , a material used in some solar cells today .
They estimate that these materials could provide 100 to 1,000 times the world ’s current electricity needs .
While in theory , fool ’s gold may shine as a solar - cell material , achieving the theoretical performance levels will be challenging .
As reported in a study published in 2000 :
About 20 years ago pyrite ( FeS2 ) was proposed as a promising candidate for [ prospective ] usage as photovoltaic absorber material for thin film solar cells .
Among its physical properties –the very high absorption coefficient and a suitable energy bandgap ( Eg?0.95 eV ) for photovoltaic energy conversion–also its nontoxicity and its composition from abundant elements were considered as particular advantages of pyrite .
However , the promises could not be fulfilled .
Though the quantum efficiencies and the photocurrents were reasonably high for single crystalline pyrite samples , the open circuit voltages never exceeded about 200 mV at room temperature , much too low compared to the band gap of pyrite .
The highest efficiency reported so far is about 2.8 % .

I recently posted about discovering a wonderful band called Arizona .
I found them while attending PopAsheville in January and I wrote - “ I was invited to give the keynote speech this year .
I spent an hour reminding the musicians in attendance that they are no longer in the music business , they are in the T - shirt business and they all seemed to agree .
They also agreed that the music industry is not hurting , it ’s the cd business that is in decline . ”
The whole post is here .
I am not being facetious when I say that bands are in the T - shirt business as I believe very strongly that as music slips down to zero in dollar value then artists must move quickly to find different ways to make money from their art .
[ The ‘ value ’ of music is based more than ever these days in emotion and much less in dollars . ]
Those slides below are from my presentation .
Its the part where musicians begin to squirm , especially the ones who have n’t grasped the notion that free really works .
In another part of the presentation I discuss the idea of increasing CD and T - shirt sales at shows by never having prices posted for each item at the point of sale or “ merch ” table .
My thinking here is that those fans that really like the band and are leaning towards buying will ask what the price of a CD is .
And the answer should be “ how much do you want to pay ? ” I guarantee that the answer will be somewhat along these lines - “ I only have $ 4 , ” “ I ’d like to give you $ 10 , ” “ You guys were great , here ’s $ 20 , ” “ I have no money . ”
You should sell your CD at those prices to all of those folks and give one to the guy with no money .
They will never forget the experience they had and they will tell their friends that you are the coolest band on earth for doing that .
I know you think I ’m crazy , yet one of the bands who attended the conference and heard me speak gave it a try at there next show .
They are called Violet Vector and the Lovely Lovelies - and it worked - see below .
And for you doubters out there I ’m sure if you click through that link to the band ’s MySpace you can message them directly .

Hi
Dave !!!
This weekend we played our first show since popAsheville and were able to test out your merch idea of not putting prices on anything .
I am writing to tell you that it totally works .
People were giving us $ 10 and $ 20 for the 5 song EP we usually sell for $ 5 .
We just had a sign that said “ Name yr. own price ! ” and people totally rocked because they actually wanted to give us more .
You were right !
I will never price our stuff again !!!
Amanda
There are many interesting comments to this article on my blog too .

Apple has opened up the Apple Developer Forums for talking about iPhone software development .
The free forums , currently in beta testing , are available to anyone signed up for iPhone development via its three programs : standard , enterprise , and university .
Standard developers pay a $ 99 fee , which includes the right to submit software for release through the App Store , while businesses pay $ 299 for the right to develop software that ’s distributed within a company .
Those signed up just to access the iPhone Software Development Kit ( SDK ) , which requires no payment , are not allowed access .
Apple was widely criticized by programmers for keeping a non-disclosure agreement ( NDA ) in place following the release of the iPhone 2.0 software .
This NDA prevented any public discussion of development issues , restricted the distribution among companies of software code , and put a damper even on private interactions , many developers said .
The NDA was dropped informally a few weeks ago ( see “ Apple Allows Developers to Talk about iPhone Software , ” 2008 - 10 - 01 ) and the legal agreement was updated last week .
The removal of the NDA covers only software and features that have been publicly announced and discussed , such as the current release of the iPhone operating system .

( " Okay John , let me bring you up to speed .
When Ben went into the Orchid Station , he blew apart the vault that the Dharma Initiative used for time - traveling experiments , and descended into the core of the Island where he found this frozen donkey wheel that pretty much navigates this place through time and space .
So anyway , he spun the wheel , warp - whistled himself to the Sahara Desert , and left this place stuttering across the Universe , with us along for the ride .
At this point , you 're going to be thrust fairly violently from one date to the next while Ben tries to round up all of your Oceanic 6 buddies for an Island reunion , including your future corpse .

Everything . " )
The firstof Season 5 is finally upon us .
Make with the ha-ha , Joke Monkey !
Before we jump into this week 's episode , two quick thoughts .
First off , like most of you , I was worried that this new storytelling element of ' shattering the laws of logic to pieces and no longer making any sense ' was going to ... you know ... instantly ruin the show in a hundred different ways at once .
But you know what ?
logic , becauseis just as good as it's ever been , only now , the writers have stepped into an evenbrilliant gear , actually overlapping old storylines with this cocksure attitude of , " See ? See ?
We knew what we were doing the whole time , you pessimistic , faithless pantloads . "
I loved every second of the season premiere , completely understand where they are and where they are headed , love the simultaneous on and off - island plotlines , and absolutely cannot wait for next week , and the next week after that .
After years of nervously waiting for the shark - jumping shoe to drop on , I think it 's due time that we just sit back and purely enjoy the greatest Television drama of all - time .
Secondly , I am officially boycotting the Academy Awards due to their Best Picture snub of .
When you make that much money , exceed every one of the already - astronomical expectations , break such new ground and essentially be the sole savior of a faltering Hollywood for 2008 , you 'd think that you 'd receive a Best Picture nod on general principle .
Nope .
Apart from Heath Ledger 's near - automatic Supporting Actor nomination , is up for nothing but technical Oscars ( deservedly so ) ; not even a Best Director nod for the incomparable Christopher Nolan .
This is ridiculous , unacceptable , and indicative of the Academy 's tradition of voting for films that theygood voting for , in lieu of films that were actuallyandmay have been good films to say the least , but to denytheir due with at least ais unnecessary , elitist bull - rip that flies in the face of anything resembling taste and logic .
Handing an Oscar tois like putting a ribbon around the neck of a Special Olympics participant .
It 's a feel - good moment for the organization , it rewards the tireless efforts and uplifting spirit of the athlete and looks good on the front page of the paper , but we all remember that the poor kid was left in the dust seconds after the gun went off .
Remember in 1998 wheninexplicably won Best Picture overand , two of the most breathtaking war films ever created ?
Yeah , and they wonder why fewer and fewer people tune into the Oscars each year .
I 'm through talking about this nonsense .
And ... Here ... We ... Sound off in the comments section , start the discussion and enjoy your day .
A couple of weeks ago , fishermen off the coast of Newfoundland , Canada , pulled up a 20 - pound lobster .
At that weight , the crustacean was somewhere around 140 years old .
But old age did n’t prevent him from being deported , and he was eventually sold to the City Crab and Seafood restaurant in New York for $ 100 .
There he was named George and became the restaurant ’s mascot , living the New York life ensconced in a fish tank and having his photo taken with tourists .
PETA convinced the restaurant to return George to the sea , though , and this past weekend he was released off the coast of Kennebunkport , Maine .
And he should really consider staying there .
That ’s because Maine not only has a minimum size requirement ( 3 1/4 " carapace * ) for lobsters caught in its waters , but the state also has a maximum size limit ( 5 ” carapace ) .
The minimum gives the lobsters a chance to reproduce before their demise .
The maximum , though , ( and the additional practice of preserving reproductively successful females regardless of size ) is possibly best explained by Trevor Corson in his book The Secret Life of Lobsters :
throwing back any lobster with a carapace over five inches , the lobstermen were populating a sort of sex resort for retirees , open to both male studs and experienced females .
When a young female reached puberty , she could keep getting pregnant and earn several punches on her reward card , allowing her to retire to the sex resort for the rest of her days .
Having secured membership in the lobstermen ’s brood stock , she might easily go on mating and making eggs for another fifty years .
Indeed , for the male lobsters that made it to the sex resort , it was probably more like entering lobster heaven .
The lobster population needs the big , old lobsters to keep reproducing and ensure that there are future lobsters .
The state of Maine appears to have figured that out and set their rules accordingly .
So , welcome , George , to lobster heaven .
Stay in Maine and have lots of lobster babies and we ’ll have many yummy lobster meals in the years ahead .
* The carapace is the part of the shell that covers the thorax , that is , the big piece that is n’t the tail .
I 've got nothing at all against EarthLink , its managers , or its general business reputation .
On the contrary : it seems an admirable company .
But I 've come to dread getting any email with an @earthlink .
net return address , and here 's why :
If I go to the bother of hitting Ctl - R ( in Outlook ) and sending a response , I know that I 'll then be put to several rounds of further bother , because of EarthLink 's annoying and narcissistic ( and optional ) " challenge - response " anti-spam system .
I previously complained about this in the Atlantic .
The system works by keeping a " white list " of approved email senders .
If someone writes in from any non-white address , EarthLink 's filter bounces back a note to the effect of , " Who the hell are you ? "
You then have to fill out forms or interpret cryptic characters to prove you 're a real person , not an e-bot , so that your message may be granted a writ of certiorari for consideration by the recipient .
After the jump , samples of two such messages I have received in the last hour .
I get a lot of mail from people who write in about articles in the magazine or posts on this site .
Mail comes in via the " Email " button you see to your right on this screen .
If I write back , I do so from one of my normal email accounts .
Very rarely is that address already entered on an EarthLink sender 's white list .
So the resulting cycle is : you write me on EarthLink ; I take the time to write back ; then Earthlink sends me an annoying message and asks me to do more work ( like decoding the text in the box below , taken from an actual Earthlink challenge screen ) before it deigns to disturb the sanctity of your inbox .
Why do I consider this narcissistic ?
Because it assumes that the other person 's time and tranquility are more valuable than mine .
Six years ago , the tech economy had crashed , the economy was stalled , and 9 - 11 had radically altered the nation ’s mood .
The New Year came around , always a time of introspection and goal - setting .
At that very moment , my article , and my book by the same name , “ What Should I Do With My Life ? , ” were simultaneously published , triggering an enormous response : the vast majority were inspired to challenge their thinking , while at the same time there was a healthy push - back to the article ’s thesis .
1. First , most people are not the architects of their own change .
Extremely few are quitting as a result of career ennui .
Rather , most people struggling with this question were pushed into it , forced into it , because they were laid off — or because they could n’t make ends meet on their paycheck , or their job never allows them to see their children , or because their new boss ( post - merger ) is an absolute asshole who does n’t value them — and they need to find a new career simply because there are no jobs anymore in the field they developed their expertise in .
They are not naïve idealists , they are people simply trying to get by .
Note that the article offered no economic or statistical evidence to back this suggestion up ; it was pure theory , with a few individual case studies that proved nothing , merely illustrated the concept .
But there was a scene in the book , near its very end , which is worth summarizing .
Michael Dell had invited me down to its annual meeting of The Business Council , and I was put on a panel with several other CEOs , which was moderated by the tremendous journalist Michael Lewis .
The topic of our panel was , “ What Do Employees Want ? ”
And the CEOs took their turn describing all the benefits they gave their employees , and how they gave out free M&Ms on Wednesdays , and appeased them with stock options and free parking spaces .
When I spoke , I thought everyone would laugh at me , snickering “ How indulgent !
How naïve ! ”
Because my point was essentially a variation on the theme of this Fast Company article — employees do n’t want M&Ms , they want to love what they do .
Highly - motivated people are the productive engine of modern civilization .
But rather than laugh at me , the tone in the ballroom changed dramatically , and the roomful of CEOs stood up , one by one , to agree with me : the value in their companies came from the employees who were motivated to be there , and one passionate employee was worth ten dispassionate ones .
But the article itself flipped that connotation inside - out .
It argued that with the economy in a tailspin , it was unsound economic theory to have millions of drone workers shuffling to work every day doing jobs at quarter - speed they did n’t care about , so they were n’t very productive at , and certainly did n’t add value at .
The economy would never get kick - started if our workforce was uninspired and did n’t innovate .
So the article — really a manifesto — suggested that the way to get business going again was for its basic building blocks — the workers — to do something they were really good at , or were inspired by , or cared about , where they would work extra hard , and innovate their way out of this black hole .
Now it was not a permission slip to quit your job , nor a doctor ’s note to take a year off ( I ’ve never taken more than two weeks off in 23 years ) , but it did suggest the economy might be better off , long - term , if the square pegs found their square holes and the round pegs found their round holes , rather than everyone just wondering where the next big thing would be and gravitate to it like moths .
Generally , when people simply see the phrase “ What Should I Do With My Life ? ” in print , it conjures a notion of deep introspection that is implicitly economically - self - indulgent — the guy who quits his job for no reason other than a bout of career - ennui , who lays around on the couch wondering where he belongs , or even more indulgently , spends his precious savings traveling abroad to find his purpose , while his friends and family muttered , “ How pathetic — you were lucky to have a job .
Any job . ”
2 . I hear all the time , “ I ’d love to quit my job to follow my purpose , but I ’ve got responsibilities ! ”
This artificial distinction is misleading .
Your responsibilities are not keeping you from your purpose , they are part of your purpose , often the very most important part .
Envisioning your responsibilities as being outside the circle of “ purpose ” will lead you to make bad decisions about your life .
3 . Pervasive in our society the last six years was what I call , “ The Modern Dream Machine Industry . ”
Media companies made a killing selling content to consumers ( # 1 example : The Secret ) that used the term “ passion ” loosely and vaguely , and made false claims that a dream life was right around the corner if you just dusted off your fantasies and pursued them .
This was what I condemn as “ selling transformation irresponsibly . ”
My book unfortunately , by some , was lumped into that — but it could n’t have been more different and more antithetical .
My book was not a fantasy ; it examined the lives of a thousand real people , and told the story of fifty — it asked how real people did it , and told their story honestly .
For those who want it boiled down to Seven Simple Steps ?
Step One : stop pretending we ’re all on the same staircase .
4. The Fallacy of Intrinsic Fit .
There is this notion around calling that you should love the mere act of what you do every day so much that by virtue of it just being Monday morning and you ’re at your job , the act of doing it causes neurotransmitters of joy to drip on your brain all day .
That is not how real people do it .
All jobs have shit work .
All jobs have things you hate about them .
But real people feel fulfilled by the overall purpose of their organization that the shitty parts are worth putting up with .
It ’s not what you do , it ’s what you ’re working towards .
5 . There ’s an old parable about the three bricklayers .
They ’re laying bricks all morning , and when they finally get a break , one guy asks the other two , “ Why are you doing this job ? ”
The first guy says , “ I ’m doing it for the wages . ”
The second guy says , “ I ’m doing it for my wife and kids . ”
The third guy looks up at what they ’ve been constructing all morning , which is a church — a place to get in touch with one ’s highest self — and says , “ I ’m helping to build a cathedral . ”
Now , most people hear this parable , and they think the third guy has the right answer , and the first two guys have the wrong answer .
That ’s the simplistic lesson that most people jump to , led their by their mythic notions of calling .
But that is not the lesson of the parable .
In fact , all three men have a sense of purpose — have a “ cathedral , ” if you will .
The first guy has the Cathedral of Spirituality .
Good for him .
But the second guy has his too .
The Cathedral of Family .
And the third guy has the Cathedral of Self - sufficiency .
Those are all good purposes .
Those are all right answers .
The real lesson of the parable is , notice what no man answered .
Not one of the three said , “ I just love laying bricks . ”
Doing something for the sheer love of it is not what real people mean when they say their work provides a sense of purpose .
That is not how they construct a sense of meaning and rightness .
Looking for it , in that form , is incredibly illusory .
6 . There is no one - perfect - thing each of us is meant to do on this planet .
Give me a break .
Where ’d that myth come from ?
If someone repeats it , throw a glass of water on them .
For each of us , there are dozens , hundreds of careers , any one of which could provide you a sense of meaning and goodness .
You do n’t have to find “ The One , ” you just have to find any one .
The biggest mistake is being seduced by the myth that you ’re looking for the right answer , as if there is only one answer .
It ’s just so damn easy to look upon someone else and jealously think , “ Wow , he sure got lucky . ”
Real people did not have great opportunities fall in their lap .
Mostly , crappy opportunities come along , and in the meantime , you make the best of them .
But that skill and habit , of making the best of your situation , is essential training .
Because one day , a good opportunity will come along .
And if you make the best of it — if you ’re good at making the best of things — you will turn it into a great situation .
A “ calling ” is not something you know , the moment you see it .
For real people , in the real world , a sense of “ calling ” is something you grow into , over the course of your life , by having an impact on your organization and the community around you .
In this way , it provides a sense of belonging and relevance .
Or in the terminology of engineers , one enters a phase of “ positive feedback experience ” that makes you feel good about being where you are .
7 . Do n’t tell me you do n’t know what you want from your life .
Do n’t ever say that , do n’t ever fool yourself into that stupor .
Of course you know what you want — you know the feeling you desire — fulfillment , connection , responsibility , and some excitement .
The real problem is figuring out how to get it — how to find a path that does n’t suffocate those natural feelings in you .
Which is hard .
Of course it ’s hard .
It ’s supposed to be hard .
If it were n’t hard , you would n’t learn anything along the way , and thus you would never get there .
If you do n’t know how to make the best of a bad situation , you will never get there .
If you are not willing to put up with some shit work , you will never recognize that a good opportunity is staring you in the face .
If you are not willing to be humble and repeatedly be a beginner in new areas and learn the details faster than the next guy , you are not capable of transformation .
“ We were just deluged , ” Mr. Ehrlich said , with “ tens of billions ” coming in without the need to call around and pitch services .
“ We were working very hard to accommodate clients , and trying at the same time to make sure we did n’t screw anything up in processing record volumes . ”
Even for the strongest financial institutions , banking is not an easy business to be in right now and it could well get worse .
And once the current crisis is over , banks in both the United States and Europe will be subject to more regulation and tighter capital requirements , a sure - fire recipe for lower profits .
Even before a new framework is sorted out , leading European banks  like the surviving American giants Bank of America , Citigroup , Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase  are preparing to take advantage of their more diversified stature .
Klaus - Peter Müller , chairman of Commerzbank and the Association of German Banks , said the universal bank model was looking better by the day , thanks to the multiple pillars that support its business .
“ Usually when one pillar suffers , the others do better , ” Mr. Müller said .
“ Seldom do all sectors of a universal bank do badly . ”
Barclays , the British banking giant , acquired the North American investment banking and capital markets units of Lehman , along with its New York offices , for $ 1.75 billion late last month .
That is far less than such businesses were worth only a few weeks ago .
On Wednesday , the French bank BNP Paribas completed its acquisition of Bank of America ’s prime brokerage unit , giving it new entree in a business long dominated by the likes of JPMorgan , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs .
“ People are now coming to us , ” said BNP ’s chief executive , Baudouin Prot .
And if they are not coming , European banks are not shy about going after them .
Deutsche Bank ’s poaching of prime brokerage clients from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs was forceful enough that it got a polite but firm word from regulators , an executive with the bank said .
With the crisis this bad , Deutsche Bank was told , we need you to ease off .
First they said it was a war against al - Qaeda .
Then , when they failed to find Osama bin Laden and his henchmen , they said it was a war to topple the Taliban and liberate women from the burqa .
Now , as Western troops continue to dig themselves into Afghanistan more than five years after 9/11 , they ’re calling it a “ war on drugs . ”
One of the key justifications for the continuing presence of American , British , Australian , Spanish , Italian , and other forces in Afghanistan is to stem the growth of poppy fields , which reportedly provide the raw materials for 90 percent of the world ’s heroin .
According to Condoleezza Rice , if this “ drug economy ” is left unchallenged Afghanistan might well become a “ failed state ” and threaten stability around the world with its ceaseless export of narcotics .
Nothing better sums up the folly of Western intervention in Afghanistan than this latest metamorphosis into a “ war on drugs . ”
In targeting Afghanistan ’s poppy cultivation , America and Britain in particular are effectively externalizing their own social problems on to faraway fields .
They are attempting to tackle the disillusionment and decadence within their own societies  which is what gives rise in the first place to a steady demand in the West for escapist and trip - inducing narcotics  by eradicating Afghan farms and severely punishing Afghan farmers who are merely responding to that Western demand .
Not for the first time in recent years , Western powers are using brute military force overseas in an attempt to resolve a deep social and political malaise at home .
A large part of both Britain and America ’s intervention in Afghanistan is now geared toward trying to eradicate drug production .
Earlier this year 3,000 British troops arrived in southern Afghanistan to “ assist ” Afghan security forces in the eradication of poppy fields .
According to one report , the British are “ leading the anti-narcotics campaign . ”
They ’re focusing their efforts on the Helmand province in the south in particular , which apparently produces a third of the world ’s heroin .
The British air assault force , led by the Parachute Regiment , provides cover and backup to Afghan troops who seal off suspected poppy - growing areas and then call in Afghan police to use tractors and plows to destroy the fields .
On the ground , the eradication effort is led by Gen. Daud Daud , the former military commander of the Northern Alliance who now plays a leading role in the U.S. - and British - backed Ministry of Counter Narcotics .
Not surprisingly , given that many poor farmers in the south rely on poppy cultivation for their livelihoods , these British - led efforts to wipe out poppy farms have intensified local conflict .
It is reported that Islamic militants , including Taliban members who once opposed poppy cultivation , have now joined forces with drug traders to hold back British and Afghan security forces .
As one Helmand resident and Taliban fighter said defiantly earlier this year : “ Would the British let us send soldiers to take over their country ? ”
Western governments have pumped an estimated $ 2 billion into the counter - narcotics industry in Afghanistan since 2001 , helping to turn the country into one of the most authoritarian regimes on Earth when it comes to dealing with drug - related crimes .
The Bush administration alone has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the “ war on drugs ” : it funds programs to eradicate poppy fields and “ educate ” farmers about alternative crops , the building of high - security prisons for drug offenders and traffickers , and the training of special anti-narcotics police officers , prosecutors , and judges .
With American backing and money , the Karzai government has brought in some harsh anti-drug laws .
The Counter Narcotics Drug Law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan , brought in by Karzai in 2005 , decrees that , “ No person shall cultivate , produce , process , manufacture , trade , distribute , possess , supply , traffic , transport , transfer , acquire , purchase , sell , import , export , or transit prohibited plants and substances with no medical use [ or ] strictly controlled plants and substances with a medical use , ” unless they have a license from a “ special committee . ”
You break these laws at your peril : those found in possession of 5 kg or more of heroin , morphine , or cocaine ( or “ any mixture containing those substances ” ) will be sentenced to life imprisonment ; even those found in possession of 10kg or more of cannabis , a relatively harmless drug that is widespread in the West , can be imprisoned for between 10 and 15 years .
Last weekend , a man was found guilty of possessing 37 pounds of heroin ; it had been discovered in his car as he drove across Afghanistan to a city near the border with Iran .
He claimed he did n’t know the heroin was there .
No evidence was presented against him , there were no witnesses , and according to one account , “ there were glaring gaps in the police report . ”
Yet the judges in this juryless special narcotics court  one of those set up at the behest and with the funding of Western governments  sentenced him to 16 years in one of Afghanistan ’s grim prisons .
American and British leaders said they ventured to Afghanistan after 9/11 in order to liberate it from the grip of al - Qaeda and the Taliban .
This does n’t look much like liberation .
The Western - backed Karzai government has effectively criminalized millions of its own citizens by making poppy cultivation and drug - selling into the worst offenses in the New Afghanistan ; it has also brought in a raft of hugely illiberal laws and courts to punish those citizens who refuse to toe the line .
At the same time , Afghan security forces , backed by British fighter planes , harass poppy farmers and destroy their fields .
This has massively exacerbated divisions in Afghanistan , especially between Karzai ’s Kabul and the south of the country .
Many have expressed surprise that Islamic militants and Taliban members , who previously were violently opposed to drugs , have joined forces with drug barons in the south .
In fact , it seems logical .
Western powers and their allies in Afghanistan have made poppy eradication into their defining mission , and used it to justify increasingly stringent security and legal measures  so it is not surprising that those who oppose the West and the Karzai regime should decide to take the side of the poppy cultivators and drug dealers .
Earlier this week , President Bush said that poppy eradication remained a priority for Western forces and their allies in Afghanistan .
He argued that “ failure to act decisively now could undermine security , compromise democratic legitimacy , and imperil international support for vital assistance . ”
In Bush ’s narrow view , it is the drug industry that is causing instability , both in Afghanistan and also internationally .
This gets things entirely the wrong way around : in truth , it is the instability wrought by America and Britain ’s war that allowed poppy cultivation and drug - trading to flourish once more .
The Taliban , also through brute force and threats of death , outlawed poppy cultivation in 2001 .
As a consequence , the number of acres under poppy cultivation in Afghanistan fell from more than 200,000 in the year 2000 to just 19,800 in 2001 .
Following the fall of the Taliban , the number of acres used for growing poppies has risen exponentially , from around 180,000 in 2002 to 200,000 in 2003 , and from 256,900 in 2005 to a whopping 407,600 in 2006 .
Between 2005 and 2006 the number of Afghan workers involved in poppy cultivation rose from 2 million to 2.9 million , and production levels rose from 4,500 tons to 6,700 tons .
The drug industry in Afghanistan is not the cause of instability ; rather it has been a beneficiary of the West ’s postwar instability .
Following America and Britain ’s invasion and the victory of the Northern Alliance in 2001 , the country fragmented , with various “ warlords ” and tribal chiefs asserting their authority in different provinces .
This meant that profitable poppy growth could be kick - started once more , benefiting both poor local farmers and also tribal leaders .
The West ’s transformation of Afghanistan into a battlefield in the war on drugs is likely to exacerbate tensions further between Kabul and local leaders , stirring up potential conflict for the future .
In declaring war on drugs in Afghanistan , Western governments are trying to rein in the instability unleashed by their own invasion , while storing up bigger problems for themselves in the future .
More to the point , it is ludicrous to believe that Western powers can resolve today ’s “ drug problem ” by using force and emergency measures in a faraway land .
The reason why nearly 3 million Afghans are employed in the poppy - cultivation business is because it is profitable  and the reason it is profitable is because there is a demand for drugs primarily in the West itself .
It is estimated that 90 percent of the heroin dealt on British streets comes from Afghanistan .
This suggests there is a drug problem in Britain rather than in Afghanistan , a demand and a desire for drugs among British youth that Afghan farmers are merely offering to satisfy in order to make a living .
A report from the UK Home Office provided a breakdown of the number of “ occasional ” drug users in Britain : apparently 3.2 million use cannabis , 358,000 use cocaine , 432,000 take ecstasy tabs , 270,000 take heroin , and 178,000 use crack .
Drug use is also widespread in parts of America , especially among the young .
Of course , these figures must be taken with a very large dose of salt ; governments are good at exaggerating their own drug problems in order to justify police and legal intervention into people ’s lives .
However , the growth of the “ drug culture ” in the West over the past four decades does point to a problem : it captures the lowered horizons and diminished expectations of contemporary Western society , where so many feel the need to turn to drugs for a thrill or a sense of meaning .
The drug problem has its origins not in the poppy fields of Afghanistan , but in Western society itself , where some try to compensate for the deficiencies of contemporary life and politics by submerging themselves in the artificial ecstasy provided by drugs .
In Afghanistan , Western governments are effectively seeking to resolve their own crises of legitimacy and purpose , which has allowed an alternative , anti-mainstream drug culture to emerge , by destroying poppy fields and harshly punishing poppy farmers .
It is a displacement activity of quite breathtaking proportions , which does nothing to address drug problems within the West but an awful lot to intensify tensions and divisions in Afghanistan .
We have been here before : in the early 1990s , George Bush Sr. took part in a “ war on drugs ” in Colombia , sponsoring local vigilantes to hunt down and execute drug barons who were supplying narcotics to America .
This intervention , too , provoked further instability in Colombia while failing to address what it is about contemporary America that creates a high demand for the artificial highs provided by illicit substances .
The current war on drugs in Afghanistan provides a clear snapshot of what motivates Western military intervention today : not any genuine commitment to democracy and liberation , but rather a desperate search for a sense of meaning in battles overseas because there is little at home .
But if the American and British governments really believe they can resolve their own profound political and moral crises by punishing poppy farmers thousands of miles away , then they must be on something .
