WMR has learned from a senior Democratic congressional source that the Bush family , most notably former President George H. W. Bush , is reaping windfall profits from the transfer of title of public federal and state lands to private hands .
The elder Bush , according to our sources , has a vested financial interest in land title companies that specialize in the transfer of public lands to private interests .
The revelations represent the first evidence that the elder Bush has benefited from the transfer of public lands to private hands in a giant scheme to defraud federal and state governments , as well as the American taxpayers and Native Americans .
The land - grabbing scheme primarily involves the transfer of federal lands , including Native American lands and national forest system lands , in the Rocky Mountain West , state lands in Texas , and both federal and state lands in California , Mississippi , and Florida to private entities .
The scheme is also at the center of the scandal surrounding jailed GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff who conspired to privatize federal lands and assets around the country to benefit his corporate clients .
( Article continues below )
In 2004 , under pressure from Abramoff and the White House , Senators Harry Reid ( D - NV ) and Jim Gibbons ( R - NV ) shepherded the passage of the Western Shoshone Distribution Act , which was quickly signed by President George W. Bush .
The act settled federal violations of the Ruby Valley Treaty of 1863 with the Shoshones and compensated them a mere $ 135 million for 24 million acres of Shoshone land illegally seized by the federal government in Nevada , California , Utah , and Idaho .
The Shoshones cried foul , saying their land is rich in gold reserves .
Gibbons , who is now governor of Nevada , instantly moved legislation to privatize the former Shoshone lands .
Reid , Gibbons , and Senator John Ensign ( R- NV ) , all received lucrative cash contributions to their campaigns from Abramoff clients .
Bush White House official Jennifer Farley urged passage of the bill claiming that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were personally interested in its enactment , further adding that the legislation was considered “ hot . ”
Cheney paid a visit to Nevada as the Senate voted to pass the bill .
The Washington Post reported that Farley and Karl Rove were recipients of sporting event tickets from Abramoff ’s assistant Kevin Ring , arrested and jailed this past week for his involvement in the Abramoff bribery scandal .
Farley termed tickets as “ fruit ” in her conversations with Ring .
Abramoff , already serving a prison sentence for a guilty verdict from a Florida case , received an additional four years in prison last week for his role in the scandal , which has tainted a number of Republicans in Congress , as well as senior members of the Bush administration .
Tony Rudy , another Abramoff assistant and a former deputy chief of staff to former Texas Republican Representative Tom DeLay , pleaded guilty in the bribery scandal .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
WMR has also learned that the Bush administration ordered a number of California and other Western state forest wildfires purposefully set with the intention of damaging and destroying federal and state forestlands , thus making them ripe for exploitation and sale to private interests .
California Republican Representative John Doolittle , also under investigation in the Abramoff bribery scandal , promoted the passage of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act , which permitted national forests to be purposefully thinned by timber companies to make them less susceptible to the fires , exacerbated by global warming , that were being set by others within the Bush administration .
The purposeful destruction of federal forests was carried out with the knowledge of top officials of the Interior Department under both Interior Secretaries Gale Norton and Dirk Kempthorne .
In 2003 , California law enforcement concluded that a number of devastating fires that destroyed 718,000 acres in the state were the result of arson .
Some within the Bush administration suggested that “ Al Qaeda ” terrorists could be behind the blazes .
It now appears that it was the Bush administration that was the actual terrorists in carrying out the arson to enrich their friends in the real estate , Indian gambling casino , mining , and other exploitation industries .
In Florida , under both Governors Jeb Bush and Charlie Crist , the St. Joe Company , a firm that has close financial ties to both Jeb and George H. W. Bush , has steadily encroached on lands adjacent to state and federal wildlife management preserves , state forests and parks , and national forests .

Dell XPS 13
squirrel_widget_172161
The XPS 13 really is that good and has recently been updated with an even more improved model .
The new model features a more refined design and even manages to squeeze the webcam into the top bezel - gone is the weird perspective of having the camera at the top of the keyboard .
If you 're not a Mac user , there 's no better all - round mobile workhorse .
Apple MacBook Air
squirrel_widget_193481
Last year , the MacBook Air got the update it deserved and since then there 's been an additional improvement recently with the addition of a True Tone display and a lower entry - level starting price .
The latest MacBook Air delivers a lot of what people have been waiting for – more resolution , thinner bezel , a smaller footprint – in a long - lasting and largely great package .
But there are issues .
The third - generation butterfly keyboard is problematic for many users and is the subject of an ongoing recall programme .
The lack of an SD card slot is also an irritation but it 's easily solved with the dongle .
Microsoft Surface Laptop 3
squirrel_widget_168114
The Surface Laptop 3 is an absolute powerhouse that 's also gorgeous to look at , well built , silent in operation and with an excellent screen and decent battery life to boot .
The Surface Laptop finally has USB-C connectivity but sticks with Surface Connect for charging .
It 's a formidable package .
Dell XPS 15
squirrel_widget_334897
For years
Dell has been making really , really great laptops that not only look the part , but act the part too .
That 's the great thing about the latest XPS series with Infinity Edge display : it squeezes more into their small form factor than its 15 - inch screen resolution might suggest .
Plus battery life is up there among the best .
In addition to appearing stylish , the XPS 15 is a powerful beast , too .
Fully equipped with the latest processors , all the ports you 'd need , plus discrete graphics if you want , this Dell machine leaves no stone unturned .
Apple MacBook Pro
squirrel_widget_171234
All new model MacBook Pros now have the TouchBar control strip along the top of the keyboard ( rather than a touchscreen ) and Touch ID fingerprint login while the recent 16 and 13 - inch updates have improved keyboards .
Both MacBook sizes include brighter screens than earlier models , have exclusively USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 connectivity and powerful specs across the board .
More so now than ever , each MacBook Pro option is a perfect workhorse - there 's no underpowered entry - level model any longer .
Huawei MateBook 13
squirrel_widget_148555
Although Huawei has had recent woes in the mobile market due to trade wars , there 's no reason to not buy a Huawei laptop because it runs Windows 10 which is unaffected .
OK , so the design is a bit derivative but the price alone is a reason to recommend - you can snap one of these up on awesome deals .
Aside from the MacBook Air , the HP Envy 13 above is the key rival for the MateBook 13 because the HP has better connectivity and a discrete graphics card .
Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga
squirrel_widget_265147
With a superb keyboard , high - quality screen options and excellent performance , this convertible laptop has a huge amount to offer .
However , some other options offer better power for the money .
Mind you , it does n't skimp on the processor - there 's no low power CPU here .
Although the ThinkPad line has branched out in the years since Lenovo bought IBM 's laptop business , you still get the same understated design and TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard .
Surface Book 3
squirrel_widget_238285
A more powerful update than its predecessor , the Surface Book 3 boasts latest - generation processors and graphics and is available in 13.5 and 15 - inch variants .
It all adds up to make this Microsoft laptop - tablet hybrid a seriously powerful contender to Apple 's MacBook Pro ( also on this list ) .
The Book 3 is more versatile , for starters , given its touchscreen and multi-function screen positions .
Which you choose is a matter of personal taste , of course .
LG Gram 17
squirrel_widget_265552
The only 17 - inch laptop we 've come across that not only works as a functional " desktop replacement " but also seems made for life on the road .
It 's powerful enough for most uses , has solid battery life and has an excellent keyboard .
There are two downsides though , and that is that there are more powerful processors available on the one hand , while it also clocks in at a slightly expensive price point .
Microsoft Surface Pro 7
squirrel_widget_168122
Is it a tablet , or is it a laptop ?
Well , the Surface Pro is the best of both worlds .
And it 's the 2 - in - 1 device to beat in its category .
Many have tried - from Acer to Samsung and beyond - but it 's Microsoft that still has the upper hand .
The Surface Pro is the best built , offers exceptional performance with near - silent operation - whatever loadout you choose - and has a pin-sharp 12.3 - inch PixelSense screen ( which , at 2,736 x 1,824 , is ultra- high resolution ) .
Ok , so it does n't come with a keyboard as a default - although bundle deals are available you 'll need to get that separately .
And the battery life is n't as out - and - out good as a dedicated and larger device , but the Surface Pro has defined a whole category for good reason .
It 's certainly one for creatives who want to use the - also optional - Surface Pen for drawing , painting or sketching .
Lenovo Yoga C930
squirrel_widget_145564
It 's not thin and light or ultraportable , but this premium laptop has it all - it's a reliable , long - life workhorse with decent sound and HDR visuals .
It 's brilliant to type on , the display looks great and the battery life is solid at over 12 hours for video
There 's plenty of ports , too , while a speaker in the hinge ensures excellent Dolby - enhanced sound that 's right in front of you .
The only real disadvantage is that we wish there were better graphics options .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The FBI is investigating Indymac Bancorp for fraud , a source tells CNN .
The California - based bank was taken over by federal regulators last week .
Indymac 's collapse was the second - largest bank failure in U.S. history .
A source said the federal government is looking into whether the bank engaged in fraud when it made home loans to high - risk borrowers .
The source said the investigation is focused primarily on the company , not individuals .
Meanwhile , Josh Hochberg , the former head of the U.S. Justice Department 's fraud section , said that any investigation of Indymac would probably look into whether the bank used false information to give loans to people who would n't have otherwise been eligible .
" I would suspect they are looking at bad appraisals , bad underwriting , which would mean false statements on loan applications , some of which require federal forms to be filled out -- so they can be prosecuted for the false statements , " he said .
" I would also suspect they would look at false statements to the investing community for securities fraud violations . "
In a written statement , the FBI did n't specifically comment on Indymac but noted that it is investigating 21 corporations in the subprime lending market for possible mortgage fraud .
" We receive information from a variety of sources on a daily basis , and we have an obligation to review each allegation on its own merits , " the statement said .
" Given the volatility of today 's subprime market , we have seen an increase in subprime related complaints . "
The statement said that in order to protect the integrity of its investigations , the bureau does not comment about or confirm specific companies that may be under scrutiny .
Friday 's closure of IndyMac bank sparked investor panic that sent shares of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a wild ride and fueled speculation of a government rescue .
See a timeline of other banks that have failed »
IndyMac , which reopened Monday under federal supervision , was once one of the nation 's largest home lenders .
Thanks in part to the nation 's mortgage crisis , it lost hundreds of millions of dollars this year and in 2007 , and concerns about the bank led customers to withdraw $ 1.3 billion in the last two weeks , prompting the government takeover .
On Sunday , the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve announced steps to make funds available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if necessary .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were created to help individuals realize the American dream of home ownership , but they now find their survival at risk in the U.S. mortgage crisis .
About 95 percent of the $ 19 billion in deposits in Indymac bank are insured , but that leaves $ 1 billion that was not covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantees , according to CNNMoney .
According to the FDIC , 10,000 IndyMac customers could lose as much as half of that amount , or $ 500 million .
The agency says the failure will cost the Deposit Insurance Fund between $ 4 billion and $ 8 billion , based on preliminary estimates .
" This will certainly be a costly failure .
Whether it's the costliest , we just do n't know at this point , " FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair said late Friday night .
The failure of Indymac could also affect premiums paid by all banks for deposit insurance , she added .
IndyMac grew rapidly during the real estate and home building boom .
Its specialty was so - called Alt - A loans , those for which home buyers were asked to produce little or no evidence of income or assets other than the house they were buying .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Denmark is the world 's most content nation , according to a new study on global wellbeing , but the good news is , despite the credit crunch and rising fuel and food prices , all of us are getting happier .
Researchers at the University of Michigan said Denmark 's prosperity , stability and democratic government placed the country at the top of the rankings , with Colombia , Canada , Puerto Rico and Iceland all in the top 10 .
The United States -- the world 's richest nation -- ranked 16th among 97 countries , while Britain was placed 21st .
Zimbabwe , with its soaring inflation and continuing political crisis , unsurprisingly ranked 97th .
TOP 10 HAPPIEST COUNTRIES Denmark , Puerto Rico , Colombia , Iceland , N. Ireland , Republic of Ireland , Switzerland , Netherlands , Canada , Austria
" I strongly suspect there is a strong correlation between peace and happiness , " said Ronald Inglehart , a political scientist at the University of Michigan 's Institute for Social Research .
" There is also a correlation between democracy and peace .
Democracies are less likely to fight each other than non-democracies . "
Almost all the countries at the bottom of the list struggle with legacies of authoritarian rule and widespread poverty , the survey found .
10 MOST MISERABLE COUNTRIES
Zimbabwe , Armenia , Moldova , Belarus , Ukraine , Albania , Iraq , Bulgaria , Georgia , Russia
Moldova and Armenia -- with long histories of repressive government -- trumped Iraq for misery , which placed seven in the U.S. - funded research .
Respondents were asked two questions to gauge their happiness :
Taking all things together , would you say you are very happy , rather happy , not very happy , or not at all happy ?
All things considered , how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days ?
Researchers say that compared to a similar survey 20 years ago , everyone is a lot happier .
" Ultimately , the most important determinant of happiness is the extent to which people have free choice in how to live their lives , " Inglehart adds .
( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain on Monday is campaigning through Pennsylvania with former governor and vice presidential contender Tom Ridge .
John McCain 's campaign is trying to portray the senator as a maverick who is willing to reach across the aisle .
Ridge , the first Homeland Security secretary , grew up in Erie and began his political career in the northwest Pennsylvania city , where McCain 's two - day trip began .
McCain kicked off his day with a tour of a General Electric Co. plant , followed by a town hall meeting with workers .
A GE employee asked McCain what his plans would be for his first 90 days in office .
" Call Tom Ridge to Washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work , " McCain answered , to much applause .
Selecting Ridge , a Catholic and former two - term governor of Pennsylvania , could boost McCain 's chances in this swing state .
But Ridge is also pro-choice , a factor that would probably turn off segments of the Republican base .
McCain heaped praise on Ridge , saying he was " proud to be in his company . "
According to CNN 's electoral map , Pennsylvania 's voters are leaning toward Sen. Barack Obama .
Watch what 's on the political agenda this week »
But some Pennsylvania Democrats say the only way Obama can take the state is by picking former rival Sen. Hillary Clinton as his running mate .
Much of that sentiment comes from Clinton supporters who have yet to give up their dream of a joint ticket .
Clinton won the state 's primary in April .
The state 's governor , Ed Rendell , is still making the case that she should be Obama 's No. 2 .
" I do n't know any other talked - about contender who would have an impact in anything more than one state .
Sen .
Clinton would have an impact in 10 or 15 states and could make the difference in those states , " he said .
Obama 's campaign said Sunday that when Obama does pick his running mate , the announcement will come via text message and e-mail to any supporters who sign up to receive the alert .
The campaign said a message will be sent out " the moment Barack makes his decision . "
The Democratic contender is vacationing in Hawaii this week .
He does n't have any public events scheduled , but so far , he 's made appearances on both days of his vacation .
Meanwhile , Obama 's campaign on Monday released a new ad that tries to paint McCain as a Washington insider with ties to lobbyists .
The ad starts by saying that " for decades , he 's been Washington 's biggest celebrity .
And as Washington embraced him , John McCain hugged right back . "
The ad , called " Embrace , " flashes multiple images of McCain hugging President Bush , as well as clips from McCain 's appearances on " The View " and late - night talk shows .
iReport.com : Share your VP picks
The spot concludes by saying that McCain is " a Washington celebrity playing the same old Washington games . "
McCain was first to use the " celebrity " label in a negative ad .
He has made the charge a common theme in his attacks on Obama .
McCain 's campaign has been trying to show that the senator has crossover appeal as a " maverick . "
The campaign will probably tout an endorsement coming from a New Jersey Democrat to help them make that case .
Richard Gerbounka , mayor of Linden , is expected to announce his support of the Arizona senator Monday afternoon , according to two Republican sources .
Gerbounka was first elected in 2006 as an independent .
He later became a Democrat , and is now reaching across the aisle to back McCain as the senator ramps up efforts to appeal to independent voters .
New Jersey is one of several battleground states that McCain and Obama are both pushing hard to win .
An average of recent polls shows the Democrat is up by about 10 points in the state .
CNN 's Peter Hamby , Ed Henry and Jim Acosta contributed to this report .

The Best SNES Fighters in the USA
Note from racketboy :
Our newest contributor , Ack , has been on a recent quest to track down a copy of every US - released fighting game on the Super Nintendo .
After playing through the good and the bad , he was kind enough to share his recommendations .
( even if there are better ports out there )
The 16 - bit generation was really the heyday of the 2D fighter .
It was the genre that defined the arcade of the late 80s and early 90s , fueled much of the gaming violence debate through the decade , and holds within its ranks the title that many point to when debating how Nintendo ultimately won the generation ’s console war over Sega .
And in the United States , we ate it up .
For many of us , dreams of the hits that sucked us into gaming came from our arcades , and ports of those same titles brought us to love our home consoles .
Unfortunately , the US did n’t get all the fighters that would populate the Japanese market .
We did n’t see great titles like Gundam Wing : Endless Duel on our shores .
But that does n’t mean we did n’t get some great games .
Here ’s some titles you might have missed while waiting to get that import - ready SNES off eBay .
Power Rangers : The Fighting Edition
Based on the television series Mighty Morphing Power Rangers , this title is really a giant monster fight .
It features 8 playable characters from the start , 4 good megazords and 4 villains .
It ’s a 4 - button fighter , features the original Power Ranges theme , and various stages designed to emphasize that you are fighting in giant size .
Unfortunately it also runs into problems because of these same perks .
While the stages emphasize size , there ’s a lack of them in the game .
All the Megazords use the same “ Zordon ’s Hideout ” stage as their base .
To make matters worse , Zordon ’s stage uses the Power Rangers theme song as background music .
The Power Ranger ’s theme constitutes about 70 % of what you ’re going to hear in this game .
The game does have some interesting other features , however .
The player can pick Story Mode , Fighting Mode , or Trial Mode .
Fighting Mode is the name for Player vs. Player , and Trial Mode lets the player pick any character and play the CPU .
Story Mode only allows the player to pick from two Megazords , and they then fight all 8 opponents before finally facing Ivan Ooze .
Whenever a monster is defeated , the player is treated to a cut scene where the Rangers finish off the villain .
Also , if the player happens to lose , they get to see a pretty interesting continue screen , where Lord Zedd ’s finger taps on the option you ’re currently selecting .
As far as losing is concerned , I did n’t mind too much considering how interesting it looked .
The game also features a new way of building power .
Each character ’s power bar fluctuates on the bottom of the screen , filling from nothing to full , then dropping to nothing again .
When a special move is used , it will be more or less powerful , depending on how full the bar was when the move was executed .
If the bar is full , it changes color next time it fills up .
After the player uses a special move 3 times when the bar is full , their character enters a special mode where they can use special attacks as much as they want at their most powerful setting , for a limited amount of time .
Each character ’s play style and special attacks are unique , making for a well - diversified cast .
This title is definitely worth a look .

Street Fighter Alpha 2
First off , Street Fight Alpha 2 is well known , but not on this console .
Why ?
It saw an extremely late release , coming out in arcades and for the SNES in 1996 .
More people played it for Playstation and Sega Saturn , where it was released in 1997 .
As far as SNES fighters go , it ’s the most expensive American fighting release , averaging nearly double what other good fighters on the console cost .
It also lacks many of the secret characters from the arcade title .
The game was manufactured using the S - DD1 chip for graphic decompression , making it gorgeous and hard to emulate , as the chip doubles as copy protection .
The title brings many staples of later 2D Capcom fighters to the end of the 16 - bit era , including the three - level Super Combo bar , counters , fall breaking , and a particular favorite of the writer , air - blocking .
It ’s a deep game with 18 playable characters , not including an alternate version of Chun Li that can be unlocked in the title .
It ’s a well - designed 6 button fighter , combining much of the classic Street Fighter characters with the Alpha series , and introducing Sakura ’s first apperance .
Backgrounds are detailed , the music is great , and for the most part , sound effects are well done .
This does not mean the game is without its problems .
The limited size of the cart caused a lot of frames of animation that could not be ported .
Alpha 2 also suffers from some pretty nasty pauses while trying to load .
Every time the announcer says “ Fight ! ” the game will pause for a moment to load .
Any load screens will cause the game to freeze for a second or two .
While it does n’t get in the way of gameplay , it does swiftly become annoying .
Sound effects have trouble too , especially if two are played at the same time , say from two characters executing special moves .
The game wo n’t pause , but one effect will briefly override all other effects .
In general , sound quality is also diminished .
Again , it does n’t effect gameplay , but it is noticeable .
And in a last bit of censorship , Alpha 2 is one of the last SNES titles to go under Nintendo ’s knife .
Apparently Nintendo of America disliked the biblical implications of one character ’s name , so in this title , Sodom is called Katana .
This has never been repeated in any other Street Fighter game .
Finally , the game lacks the options of the first two titles I ’ve mentioned above .
All the player can do is Arcade and Versus .
That is all that ’s available .
Of course the two modes you get are excellent , but it really does have to be weighed against the high price tag the game carries .

World Heroes 2
The World Heroes series has had a bit of a bad run in the United States .
When the original title appeared on the screen , it featured characters and controls similar to Street Fighter , causing the series to be written off as just another SF clone .
The series would only see two more releases , and only the first two titles would appear on the Super Nintendo in the United States .
World Heroes 2 is the better of the two titles .
It ’s a 2 or 4 - button fighter , depending on the options you pick at the beginning .
The game features only Two play modes from the beginning , Single Player and VS .
This is where the game becomes quirky .
Indeed , World Heroes 2 is all about Quirkiness .
There are actually several different game modes , depending on options selected at various points .
For a different experience , the player can start by selecting Arcade or SNES controls , being 2 and 4 button control schemes respectively .
The player can also set the health bar to arcade , normal , or seesaw , the last causing health to go back and forth between fighters .
Do more damage , get more health .
Also , when picking Single Player , after selecting a character , the game asks if the player wants Normal Mode or Survival .
The cast features 14 playable characters from around the world , and the game gets even more wacky when considering who to pick .
Do you want the German military commander who ’s also a robot ?
How about the football player from America ?
The Pacific Islander with a giant Tiki mask named Mudman ?
Why not the pirate captain , who is apparently not from a country at all ?
Each character is more bizarre than the last , and it makes for some excellent fun while using an engine that ’s as deep as the game is weird .
Also note , projectiles can be reflected back at targets , possibly multiple times .
Can you think of a better way to piss off your buddies while proving you ’re number one ?

Power Instinct
Power Instinct is the English name for Gōketsuji Ichizoku , or The Gōketsuji Clan , a fighting game released on the console in 1993 by Atlus .
While its sequel would be released in 1994 , it did n’t see another console port until the Playstation .
Power Instinct follows a family tournament of the Gōketsuji , who fight every so many years or so to see who should control the clan .
The game focuses on a strange blend of fighting and comedy , and though some of the humor was lost in translation , the game ’s about as quirky and bizarre as World Heroes 2 .
It ’s a 4 button fighter featuring 8 selectable characters and one boss who is a palette swap of one of the main characters .
The game features a Vs. Mode , “ Life Attack , ” which is basically a survival mode , a standard arcade mode , and two different practice modes , one where the CPU stands or sits , and the other where they fight back .
The game ’s got some interesting moves .
Double jumps and double dashes make mobility a must in the game , and players can knock their opponent through barriers on both sides of the stage , making it larger .
The SNES version also looks and sounds better than the Sega version .
Unfortunately the game does have issues with material being cut out .
Character endings were removed , as well as character bios that originally appeared between game demos .
In fact , the game intro demo was removed .
But perhaps the worst loss of all was the Karaoke Mode that was removed from the SNES port , prohibiting American Nintendo fans from singing along .
Still , we do get to use Otane , the old woman .
She has perhaps the greatest projectile in all of gaming history ( Hint : it ’s her dentures ) .

Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3
The Mortal Kombat series was possibly Street Fighter ’s biggest rival in American in the early 90s .
It popularized digitized sprites , proved palette swaps could still be made fairly unique , and got the gaming industry into a fair bit of trouble with its rampant bloodshed and violence .
Of the four MK titles released on the SNES , Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 had it all .
The same 4 button high punch / low punch / high kick / low kick system as the arcade .
23 characters . 2 on 2 Vs matches .
8 player tournament mode .
Unlockable boss characters for two - player fights .
There was even an option to turn blood and fatalities on or off .
The game also featured some interesting additions not found in the arcade .
The Brutality , where a player would wail on their opponent until they exploded , was invented for the SNES port .
Many of the characters hidden in the arcade were playable from the start .
There was even an easter egg where the player could access up to three different cheat menus , changing gameplay , watching character endings , accessing hidden content on the cart , and so on .
But the title did lose some things just to get all this on the cart .
The character Sheeva ’s animation data was removed , though she can technically be played through some glitches .
Many backgrounds from Mortal Kombat 3 were removed .
Certain characters fatalities were edited , and in some cases removed entirely .
And finally , the announcer does not say character names when selected .
For the most part , however , gameplay remains intact .

Fatal Fury Special
Unfortunately for the Fatal Fury series , the series was plagued by allegations of ripping off Street Fighter 2 from day one , even though the first title was in development by the time Street Fighter 2 was released in arcade .
Nevertheless , Fatal Fury was well built and inventive from the get go , becoming known for its two - lane fighting system .
Players could jump and attack between lanes for quick escapes or reprisals , and could also throw their opponent into the other lane if desired .
The series would see its next installment a year later in Fatal Fury 2 , and an update a year later in Fatal Fury Special .
Fatal Fury Special featured all the playable characters from Fatal Fury 2 , plus the four bosses as playable characters , and three more from the original Fatal Fury , totaling 15 available from the get go .
The title also features one unlockable character , Ryo Sakazaki , from Art of Fighting .
Fatal Fury Special is a 4 button fighter , with R and L serving as “ 3D Move ” and “ 3D Attack , ” allowing a quick switch to a different fighting lane .
The game features a single player arcade mode , V.S. Game , and an option called Count Down , where the player has infinite health and 3 minutes to defeat as many CPU opponents as possible .
On a bit of a surprising note , the game also features Dolby Surround Sound .
There are a few problems .
Jumping sometimes feels a bit floaty , taunts have strange controls , and the lane system is n’t quite there yet in this title .
But it features a unique cast with varied characters , mixes up the lane system by throwing a few stages into the mix that do n’t have a second lane , and decent controls .
If you ’re a fan of SNK , this game is a must .

Unfortunately when this title was released , the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were waning in popularity , so this game went largely unnoticed .
It ’s a 4 button fighter , featuring 10 playable characters .
The game sports a Tournament Mode , VS Battle , Story Mode , and a Watch mode , to view CPU battles .
Tournament
Mode serves as the standard arcade battle , where players can select any of the ten characters to fight others for cash .
Story Mode is a bit more deep , making the player select one of the four turtles , then moving them from location to location to fight villains while trying to rescue April O’Neil and Master Splinter .
It ’s unfortunate that this title sees so little recognition , as its fighting system is actually well developed .
TMNT Tournament Fighters was one of the first games to ever use a power bar that is charged by fighting .
Build up enough energy , and the player is able to unleash a powerful super move on their opponent .
This feature would become a staple of the 2D fighting genre .
The game is also great for nostalgia purposes , both for its TMNT characters as well as the use of character bios after Demo fights .
It ’s deep , controls well , has great music , and a very unique attitude that lives up to its namesake .
There are a few issues with names and grammar in Story Mode , but these can be easily overlooked .
On a side note , this was also released on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis .
The Super Nintendo version is considered the best of the three .

Killer Instinct
Killer Instinct was a great game in the arcade , and its success lead to a release on the SNES less than a year later .
It was a 6 button fighter that borrowed some of the best elements of other popular series at its time , and then added its own into the mix .
Techniques such as Automatic Combos , Combo Breakers , and even Ultra Combos going over 80 hits were all on the playing field .
Killer Instinct was known for its dual health bars .
You do n’t win rounds in Killer Instinct , you pummel the other guy down , give him a breather , then pummel him some more .
If the player was hit before beating him down , that ’s no problem .
The player still have all that health left over when the other guy gets back up .
And once the player had beaten down their opponent , the screen flashes red and finishing moves become available .
The Humiliation finisher was always a particular favorite of mine .
Of course , some changes had to be made to the game so it could run on a Super Nintendo cartridge .
First of all , all character sprites had to be toned down , in both size and quality .
Previously 3D stages were changed to straight 2D , and some were completely dropped .
The game ’s camera was also changed to be more static .
And in perhaps the most heinous of cuts , the full motion videos for victory poses were changed to static images .
Heart - breaking , but necessary .
To make up for it , Rare added new game modes .
An 8 player Tournament Mode was put in , similar to what Mortal Kombat fans would see on their SNES carts .
Killer Instinct also featured a Practice Game , essentially a training mode where the player wails on Fulgore in a random stage .
Stage finishers and character bios during the game demo were also left in the game .
Killer Instinct also has three particular notes of interest .
First , it was released in a black cartridge in Australia , Canada , Europe , and the United States , not the standard gray for most SNES titles .
Second , the game was never released in Japan .
And third , and perhaps most important of all , the game came packaged with a 16 track CD of songs taken straight from the game , titled Killer Cuts .
The CD was later sold via Nintendo Power , where it could also be ordered in cassette format .

Super Street Fighter 2 : The New Challengers
When talking fighters on the Super Nintendo , most point to Street Fighter 2 Turbo as the genre and era defining fighter .
But a year later , Capcom would release a new version of Street Fighter 2 on the SNES .
Many believe this game was released to early , and another tweaked version called Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo would be released a little while later , but it would never make it to the shores of the United States , probably in part due to the failure to sell Super Street Fighter 2 .
Commercially , it tanked .
Too much supply , not enough demand .
Super Street Fighter 2 is a 6 button fighter , much like its predecessor .
It featured a similar arcade mode , called Super Battle .
Versus Battle , Group Battle , and Tournament Mode all served as multiplayer options .
Group Battle and Tournament Mode were both for handling multiple fighters or players beyond the second .
Want 8 individuals to play in random pyramid chart ?
Tournament Mode .
Want to duel 8 characters vs. 8 characters with your best friend ?
Group Battle .
A Time Challenge mode was also included , where the player picks their character and their CPU opponent , then tried to beat them as quickly as possible .
But beyond extra game modes , what else was there ?
Quite a bit , actually .
New character portraits were devised for the game .
Characters had 8 palette swaps to choose from by pressing different buttons to select a fighter .
Chun -Li ’s ending was changed , and the bosses all had new endings put in .
New animations for special moves were also put in for a few characters , including Chun Li ’s fireball .
But that is n’t all .
Capcom took the time to put in a fully fleshed out combo system , keeping track of the number of hits and adding bonus score , while also awarding bonus points for things like getting the first hit .
Reversals were added into the game , to help combat some of the issues found in Street Fighter 2 .
Character bios were interspersed with game demos at the start of the game .
New characters were brought in , including Cammy , bringing the total up to 16 playable characters , each with their own unique stages and fighting styles .
The game also featured an updated intro , one that is quite possibly my favorite of the entire Street Fighter series .
The only real downside was that the game was slowed down , back to speed with Street Fighter 2 : Champion Edition .

Additional Recommendations
But just because I recommend these titles does n’t mean you should stop there .
Here ’s a few more recommendations for all your fighting needs ( And just to let you know , most of these were left off of the above list because I wanted to only included one installment from each series ) .
Art of Fighting
Fatal Fury
Fatal Fury 2
Fighter ’s History
Mortal Kombat
Mortal Kombat 2
Mortal Kombat 3
Samurai Shodown
Street Fighter 2
Street Fighter 2 Turbo
Of course , there are even more fighters to be found on the SNES .
You can see my quest to collect each on on this forum thread .
I 'm working on an interface that uses drag - n - drop to arrange how some fields appear on the page .
The page basically has two containers — a canvas and a toolbar .
You drag fields from the toolbar to the canvas , and then you can position the fields in the canvas to order them anyway you want .
To remove a field , just drag it from the canvas back to the toolbar .
One of the things I wanted to implement was to always make sure the fields in the toolbar stayed in alphabetically ordered .
While I knew it would be easy enough to whip up a sorting function , I decided to first search the jQuery Plug -ins to see if I could find something that was already written .
That 's when I found the TinySort jQuery Plug-in .
This plug - in allows you to sort an number of sibling DOM elements and you can sort by either it 's text , an attribute or even a child element .
Here 's some examples ( taken from the Sjeiti website : )
// sort by the element 's text
$ ( " ul#people > li " ) .tsort ( ) ;
// sort by a child 's text
$ ( " ul#people > li " ) .tsort ( " span.surname " ) ;
// sort by the img element , order descending using the img's " alt " attribute
$ ( " ul#people > li " ) .tsort ( " img " , { order : " desc " , attr : " alt " } ) ;
// sort 's element , but puts the sorted items at the end of the parent element
$ ( " ul#people > li " ) .tsort ( { place : " end " } ) ;
The " place " option ( as seen in the last example ) is interesting because it allows you to control how the matching siblings are ordered in context to their non-matching siblings .
In most cases you 're probably sorting all of the children items of an element , but there may be times when you 're ignoring certain elements ( like disabled items . )
There are lots of working examples on the authors home page .
If you need a way to quickly sort some elements on the page , I definitely recommend checking this plug - in out .
It seems to have every option one would need to implement some basic sorting to some generic elements on a page .
What does it feel like to release a game ?
People talk a lot about what game development is like , but a lot less about the process of releasing a game .
Cynically I might suggest this is because so many games get canned that release experience is much rarer .
In practice , the people in charge of the process have shareholders and can't possibly admit to anything but excited optimism about the sure - fire hit they surely have on their hands .
I 'm currently a few days away from releasing my latest indie game , , and it 's probably going on sale by the time you read this .
How does this make me feel ?
Well the emotions are many and varied but the primary one has to be terror .
If you talk to people at big studios , the primary emotion come release time is one of tired relief .
Endless periods of crunch , unmovable deadlines , projects that seem to go on forever ( I remember the list of developers who had become parents during 's development being circulated ) means that for most developers , the feelings are relief , tiredness and an almost Zen - like state of calm .
The calmness comes from the fact that it has passed out of your hands now .
Marketing people and sales people will take over ; your work here is done .
For me though , that flow of logic and emotion does n’t hold up .
I 'm not just the programmer whose job is coming to an end or the designer whose job should have ended weeks ago .
I ’m also the finance director and head of marketing .
As I 've taken the first two hats off , the other two get firmly strapped to my head .
There is nobody else to blame , nobody I can lean on while I kick back and chill out .
Suddenly it 's close to D - day , the day on which I find out if the last year ( and the development budget ) was well spent , or if it would have been better invested in sub - prime loans .
For big budget retail games , you will already have a rough idea if you are sitting on an instant hit or a disaster , because pre-orders will have been taken and there will thus be some guaranteed sales .
However , the flip side of this is that you will need to wait a few weeks before you actually see how the game is selling in stores , and what your chances are of breaking even .
With online direct - sales like mine , the feedback is instant .
When someone buys a game direct from my site , I get an email the minute the payment company takes the money .
I can see how many games I sold in the last hour – one copy of , to someone in Richmond , UK , just 20 minutes drive from me , small world .
All of which is scary as hell , because on Wednesday when I finally push the right button and make the purchase link live , I 'll be getting near instant feedback on whether the game is a dud or a hit .
When you talk to other indie developers , you find everyone suffers from the same anxiety over sales .[ separator ]
If you only got sales reports once a week , you could forget about them for six days and just code , but like all indie devs , the first thing I check in the morning is the sales emails , and it 's the last thing I check at night too .
My mood , and how disposed I am to spending money has become directly hard - wired into the sales emails .
I 'm pretty sure I could chart endorphin levels alongside sales and see a scary correlation over time .
If I meet a mate for lunch and order steak , he knows sales are good .
A baguette though is a bad sign .
If you think I 'm over - dramatizing it , think of it like this .
Imagine you have n't been paid a penny by your employer for the last year .
You have been living off your savings .
On Wednesday , he will put your entire salary on a random stock on the stock market .
You will start getting paid dividends from that day onwards .
Will he pick the next Google ?
Or the next Lehman Brothers ?
If you actually have a physical job like I used to , the earnings fear is n't so bad .
A boat that 's been nailed together is a boat that 's been nailed together .
It might sell for a lot , or it might sell for a bit less .
A game that is n't fun though is n't just slightly less valuable than a fun one , it 's worth nothing .
Zero .
Some games really do sell fifty times or a hundred times better than others with the same budget .
It 's pretty much all fixed costs , and the amount recouped could go from zero to a billion dollars .
Now fortunately , as indie devs go , I do better than many ( though not nearly as well as some ) , so if the worst comes to the worst and I do n't sell a single game , it 's unlikely I 'll actually starve .
I 'm a pretty cautious guy and always try to keep some cash in the bank from games that do sell , anticipating that I 'll hit a dud at some point .
Being your own boss is fantastic , and I would n't choose a different life by any stretch , but it 's always easy to say that when the cheques are coming in and the metaphorical sun is shining .
Creatively , developinghas been fantastic fun , exciting and rewarding .
Whether or not it was actually a good idea in terms of paying the rent will be decided in the next few weeks .
Wish me luck , I 'll be the guy staring at his inbox biting his nails .
Stephen Harper vowed Monday that a re-elected Conservative government would reduce protections under the Youth Criminal Justice
Act for young people convicted of serious crimes .
Under the Conservative leader 's proposal , young people 14 and over found guilty of crimes such as manslaughter , murder or aggravated assault would face tougher sentences , and no longer have their identities protected .
The act currently forbids the release of young offenders ' identities , unless the accused are found guilty and handed adult sentences .
Judges would also be allowed to decide whether a young offender who is convicted again for a less serious crime should be identified .
" Of course offenders have rights , " said Harper while campaigning in Ottawa for the Oct. 14 federal election .
" But we believe those rights must be balanced with responsibilities , and that victims have rights too . "
The Conservatives also vowed to extend the youth gang prevention fund established in early 2007 and increase its budget to $ 10 million a year .
The fund provides communities with money to combat street gangs .
Liberals , BQ against
Tory youth crime plan
Harper said the tougher sentences would act as a deterrent for would - be criminals .
" In this new legislation , the main purpose will be not only to rehabilitate young offenders , but also to protect society , and the primary goal of sentencing will be to deter others from violating the law , " Harper said at an event .
The Conservative leader acknowledged that crime rates have fallen in many areas in recent years , but said violent crime by young offenders increased 30 per cent between 1991 and 2006 .
Almost 40,000 youths were accused of serious and violent crimes in 2006 .
The crimes included nearly 160 murders or attempted murders , 2,100 sexual assaults and 4,500 robberies .
" Frankly , you cannot rehabilitate somebody unless you drive home to them the seriousness of very violent crimes , " said Harper .
Liberals said the Conservative proposal wo n't make Canada safer and compared it to attempts in several U.S. states , where they claim slapping young people with harsher sentences failed to reduce crime rates .
" It 's the wrong approach , " Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion said in French after unveiling his party 's platform in Ottawa .
Dion said his party 's platform contained a crime - reduction strategy based on the approaches of previous Liberal governments , which he said have brought the lowest crime rate in 20 years .
Bloc Leader Gilles Duceppe also decried the Tory plan .
" This is the Republican way of the United States , more people in prison , more arms in circulation , " Duceppe said Monday .
" I do n't want to live in that society . "
Canada an ' island of stability ' : Harper
Harper also addressed the latest economic news from the U.S. , where the government has proposed a $ 700 - billion bailout to try to stem the credit crisis .
The plan would constitute the biggest restructuring of Wall Street since the Great Depression .
The Conservative leader stressed that Canada has been an " island of stability " since it does not face a similar regulatory environment and has a stronger financial system .
" Obviously , what we 're asking for is a mandate to ensure we stay an island of stability rather than becoming part of the problem by raising taxes and running deficits , " said Harper .
He added that the next few years will pose " tremendous challenges " for both the new Canadian and American governments .
The U.S. administration and Congress are still hammering out details of the bailout plan , which would allow the government to buy up a mountain of bad mortgage loans weighing down financial companies since they became engulfed in a severe credit crisis over a year ago .
The U.S. administration and Congress still need to hammer out details of a $ 700 - billion bailout plan to buy up non-performing mortgage - backed commercial paper and other toxic financial assets from ailing financing companies at a fraction of their face value .
( LifeWire ) -- " What do you do all day ? " is a question Anne Marie Davis , 34 , says she gets a lot .
Stay - at - home wives represent a growing niche , according to the author of " The Secrets of Happily Married Women . "
Davis , who lives in Lewisville , Texas , is n't a mother , nor does she telecommute .
She is a stay - at - home wife , which makes her something of a pioneer in the post - feminist world .
Ten years ago , she was an " overwhelmed " high school English teacher .
" I did n't have time for my husband , " she says , " and I did n't have a life . "
She presented the idea of staying home to her husband , a Web engineer .
" I told him it was something I wanted to do , and he supported it .
It was a great relief . "
Dr. Scott Haltzman , author of " The Secrets of Happily Married Women , " says stay - at - home wives constitute a growing niche .
" In the past few years , many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home , " he says .
While his research is ongoing , he estimates that more than 10 percent of the 650 women he 's interviewed who choose to stay home are childless .
Daniel Buccino , a Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine clinical social worker and psychotherapist , says stay - at - home wives are the latest " status symbols . "
" It says , ' We make enough money that we both do n't need to work outside the home , ' " he says .
" And especially with the recent economic pressures , a stay - at - home spouse is often an extreme and visible luxury . "
June Cleaver , minus Beaver and Wally
Davis says her life is n't luxurious .
" Tuesdays are my laundry day , " she says .
" I go grocery shopping on Wednesdays and clean house on Thursdays . "
Mondays and Fridays are reserved for appointments and other errands .
But her schedule also allows for charity work and leisure : reading , creative writing and exploring new hobbies , like sewing .
It 's a lifestyle , Davis says , that has made her happier and brought her closer to her husband .
" We 're no longer stressed out , " she says ; because she takes care of the home , there are virtually no " honey - do " lists to hand over .
Stay - at - home guilt
" If you told me years ago that I was going to be a stay - at - home wife , I would have laughed at you , " says Catherine Zoerb , 27 .
Yet after the Wichita , Kansas , resident finished graduate school in 2005 , she found herself unemployed , childless -- and strangely happy .
With her husband 's support , Zoerb decided to just stay home .
" I was able to clip coupons , do all the chores and make nice dinners , " she says .
" I was much less stressed and tense . "
But she was concerned , too -- about not using her master 's degree in English and how future employers would view her work history .
" I worried about gaps in my resume , " she says .
And there was something else : " I thought about the feminist movement -- all those women who worked so hard so that I could go out and have a good career , and I was kind of saying ' no thanks . ' "
Recently , Zoerb took a temporary job at an engineering firm .
It will boost her resume , and although the Zoerbs do n't need the money , it will help pay down their mortgage .
Still , she hopes to return to stay - at - home wifedom soon .
" I 'd never say that a woman should n't work , " she says .
" But I do n't see what good it would do to work in a job that I could n't stand , and if I have the choice not to , why would n't I take that opportunity ? "
Retro marriage , 21st century - style
" Everyone seems to be OK with women staying home when they have kids , " says Davis , who currently does n't plan to have children .
" I 've actually heard people say that women who do n't work are a drain on society . "
Do n't be too quick to judge , says Haltzman .
Women might give up a job to focus on an advanced degree , pursue artistic or creative goals , or deal with health issues .
Surprisingly , though , Haltzman says the biggest draw is homemaking itself .
" Many women I talk to take care of the household seriously , and they want to focus on caring for the home , whether or not it involves children . "
Sometimes a wife 's desires do n't align with her husband's .
" I hear frustration from men whose wives choose not to work , " Haltzman says , " but only if there are financial stresses .
One of the realities is that few men appreciate the scope and difficulties of managing a household . "
Kirk Zoerb is an exception :
The 27 - year - old engineer says he 's happiest when his wife is jobless .
" When Catherine stays at home , I feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in - depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden , " he says .
" She also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores , garage sales and at grocery stores . "
As a couple , he says , " we have more energy and are generally emotionally healthier . "
Still , " I do n't believe that the woman has to be the exclusive cook , cleaner or shopper , and I do n't believe the man must be the breadwinner .
I would n't mind staying at home while Catherine works ! "

1st a desceased person who coult not reply - now the President -
Posted by P. Shahir on 2008 -07 - 19 00:19:34 ( very swiftly improvised pls excuse spelling etc )
This is a horrible article , you knowing that private documents are unavailable - and compact a collection of very cruel accusations !
Advice : USe energy to help RESOLVE problems we are facing - to get US consumers use less gas - to inform people that they have to be PROUD of stopping Saddam !!!!!
Is this a challenge to the right to peace of mind of any member of the human race ??
That would be illegal breach of human rights and systematic psychological warfare - based on MANY MANY presumptions and unclear claims that appear to be lies mixed with some chronology of events not properly understood or investigated !
In one article , you initially chose to use demonising language on a hard working and much appreciated White House Spokesman Mr Tony Snow , and now you find it ' fun ' to make multiple accusations formulated to insult as much as you can .
You found that since Mr Tony Snow , Press Secretary had passed away , he could no longer answer you questions , since he had passed away !!
May peace and joy be on his Soul !!
Now you find that the private issues of the present President are confidetial ( as most people prefer = - and you therefore try to abuse this thruough numerous accusations - to trigger off a conspiracy theory , trying to make people guess falsely on what hs not !! .
One cannot permit this to be done on ANY one on earth -
If you yourself state that details are private , such as medical records or certain tabloids propaganda , does not mean that it is right to gather ALL the hurt you can find in order to throw it at a President of a Great Nation , while he is in office .
I am entirely free of any party political affiliation .
When certain cruel rhetorics got psychologically cruel , I raised my concerns , during Hon.
President Bill Clinton 's presidency , as I am concerned for the happiness and wellbing of ANY human , let alone , one in position of President of All Americans .
Now , here , this appears to be much worse !
Perhaps you would like to prove to the world how tolerant and untiring the Honorabe US President has been through most horrific attacks that never took place in US history .
If this is to prove the extreme form of ' freedom of speech ' trying your limits , I feel this is so wrong , that I condemn this mindset in strongest possible terms .
As the Very Honorable US President G. W. Bush reiterated recently on an event welcoming new US citizens , the President underlined the freedom of speech and expression .
However , when it gets clearly systematically cruel , it is the responsiblity of every human of conscience to protest .
In a previous article I wrote a couple of days ago , that freedoms such as freedom of speech have been squandered , while there are narcocartel criminals who are seeking distraction so they could get awayu - and the same goes for the remaing hostages of the FARC , whom whe have to strive to have set free as soon as possible , and find ways of convincing those cruel despotic narcto terror rings to stom their terror and cruelties .
We hope andpray that all will think seriously about not squandering freedoms such as freedom of speech to concoct insults on a most hardworking President , so weight down by extreme problems - problems left unsolved ever since WTC attack in 1993 - and letting Saddam off the hook .
I like ot discuss onwhat I personally know - and keep the tone humane and with a kind layer of mind - and shpw greatest respect towards people who have suffered .
PS I misspelled squandering of freedom of speech as ' quandering ' .
Shortly afterwads , it seems that other media picked up and wrote about the squandering of the freedom of speech .
Allthis hatred and mudslinging , in my humble view , must stop , and give way to ealthy dialogue .
IF laws of applied , the site could be shut down - I hope however that you find the critical information that YOU yourself has thought through , and get a positive article going , and not only me , but many others may want to comment andparticipate in the debate .
Best of luck towats improvements - and greatest respects for the sitting President of ALL Americans !!
Regretting , as many others around the world can be astonished .....
BTW
Are you in the USA - or associate ??
This crosses the border of Internet ethics .
Try inquring one issue at a time and with a purpose of helping Humanity - Not squander the Internet and freedoms to hurt feelings - Try Sudan and how to protect and defend the Darfurinas from being pushed to their mass deaths through being pushed out of their shelters and homes and into dry desert and certain mass death !!
Try taking themes that could help find alternative energy resources and start an enterprise that can employ others ....
As a non-political , I reserve the right to react when a fellow human is insulted so vehemently - and that , regarding the sitting tolerant US President - but I am not sure if USDOJ , FBI or other special departmetns will find that correct or just -
There mauy be paragraphs protecting people from cybermobbing and harassment on Internet - wheter one be a Security Guard , OR a hardworking President of Great Nation - subjected to the greatest dangers of terror schems that have been fomented apparently ever since before 1993 WTC - when people said then - '
Let poor Saddam go !
- we can stil do buuusiness with him ----
Please read of ' The Atrocities of Saddam ' by typing thosw words on Google .
May the US President be blessed forever for removing such a horrific despot .
The insurgenceies of locals is Al - Qaeda and Hezbollah / Hamass insitigated - and is a generation gap of people who thought and lived that way for generations .
A protectorate arrangement to take care of the Iraqi geosegment and entire region is essantial !
With sincere wishes for progress and for thoughtful and positive dialogue for all - free from cyber-intimidation and cruel scheming to systematically defame other hardworking who did all they could under pressure and in aftermath of a most horrific terror attack !! ,

Did you just google the most wonkish words you could find and cut and paste segments from a political blog to fill in the gaps ?
I utterly fail to understand how you freely use words such as ' protectorate ' yet in the same sentence are unable to correctly spell ' essential ' .
Your reply makes no sense , you go off at idiotic tangents which have no relation to the presidency of G.W Bush .

The very fact that our country can come so close to being a dictatorship is very real .
If ever the country had puppet government it is now .
Each day the ruthless people that put Mr. Bush in the White House manage to find a way to reduce more liberties and tighten their control on the wealth of this nation .
The real sad part is that a man could sell out a whole nation of a little glory and money .
Blessed for removing Saddam ?
What do you suggest that he does with the leaders of China killers of millions , or of Saudi Arabia where human rights are non-existent and now that North Korea is our friend we can just forget about the millions of people who starved to death
Many present leaders make Saddam look like a boy scout .
The human right to react to many whole sale personality attacks

Due to eyesight problems etc , I have an understandable right to swift formulation spelling errors . '
Pls Excuse me ! - for what I am ' - and the right to defend myself too !
- but my posting was delayed over 1 day as comments section was made unavailable .
@Jamie : I do not respond swiftly ( after a long day ) just to show off whether I use a spell checker or not .
I reserve the right to feel rightous indignation when media is merely used to insult , and when ' pile upon pile ' of accusations are piled against persons in public office .
I agree that ordinary people of no political lobby or faction ( just with own peaceloving convictions - ) should be protected from intimidation - but the minimum the same dignity of respect has to be applied to persons ' high or low ' - but there are understandably laws to protect persons in office , carrying out their duties - as for example - defense against a most horrific attack on civil society ever in recent history .
Open Internet is not an open opportunity to abuse and squander freedoms to vilfy persons who may not have the time or energy to get involved in mudslinging contests .
First , a post humous accusation on a hardworking person of office - and now , instead of finding a specific theme , a wholesale personality attack and ' media assassination ' .
Extreme lobbyism can truly blind people - whichever party people may tend to ...
I can assure you that the only ' mind altering '
I ever get is quite simple exhaustion , eyesight pains , and righteous indignation .
So I recommend that the website providers ( - and ' moderators ' ) should take care of not allowing personality attacks on posters either .
One can not put up an extreme slanderous and insulting postulate as a thread theme , and then attack any reply to that ( and even manipulate with the posting board by re-editing previous replies !! )
Just after I ' replied ' here in indignation , I received ' a reply ' on another thread related to whole sale post humous insults on Press Secretary Mr Tony Snow , who recently passed away .
His funeral had not even taken place yet , when a cruel demonizing title was published here .
On Farris , I can kindly point out that the US naturally deals with the immediate threat to security where there is a gathering point of ' triggers ' and dangers .
Saddam was abusing the poverty and low price of labor in North Korea to obtain silkworm missiles and other sensitive technology .
We must all stop murderous tyrants that terrorise innocent and even non-lobbyist persons .
An emerging International Court must have a non-political agenda of jurisprudence that realizes the predicaments of great and powerful magnanimous nations and their feelings of duty to act - when nobody else has been capable of that .
Any progress on International Courts will have to consider that as core basis of any International justice .
Popular protests must continue on all drug cartel marketeering , corruption , and abuse of world resources in a most dangerous buildup by abusers of oil resources - while some rich cartels play ' father christmas ' turning the poorest nations into hostage ' puppets ' struggling to survive .
Even a recent AU meeting had to take place outside Africa .
President G.W. Bush has had to deal with a problem unresolved and even misunderstood ever since the previous decades - on who the Jihadis in fact were , and the huge and broad diversity of jihadis centered in Saddam 's Iraq .
Whatever people may say , the USA had the right and moral duty to react on Saddam 's repeated racheting against the USA - or would one suggest that a President should ask for a ' friendly meetings , respectively , with Saddam and OBL full of regrets , saying : ' Oooh can we have a nice dialogue highlevel together ? , discuss a good price for hostages , and payment of ' protection money ' ??? - or ' let us take a hubble bubble and talk about things - so you continue your oil - for - weapons - & - narco extortions while we get more and more isolated in realities of world trade ?? ... or should a president have said ' Ooh ' Sorry our buildings ( Twin Towers were ever built & ' we will offer you free social networking so our citizens can be infiltrated with cyberwarfare ' ?
- just if we could have a cosy ' dialogue ' and could ' scratch each others backs ' ?? ( ie with tyrannic extortionist henchmen ) .
Narco - terrorists as OBL and Saddam 's sons listen to & and understand no hospitality !!
( Drugs are a driving force of evil abuse , and ALL forces of humanity should unite to fight this scourge !! )
President Bush dealt very accordingly by stopping the cruel narco - playboy Uday Hussein !!
( who was Saddam 's son , his executive director , PR and his main strategic deputy while he was chronically ill ! )
Here it has been a big segment of the world who have been powerless to stop tyranny and terror and misinformed by media and Internet hijackings by extremist interests ' and cartels ' covert fundings
I suggest that there should be an apology by hosters and co-hosters for delayed proper sanctioning of whole sale cyber - attack & insults on ANY persons , whether in office - or any posters who have the International right to react to insults .
Calling for reason and fair dialogue without mudslinging - either on President Bush , President Clinton , Senator Ted Kennedy - or Press Secretary Mr Tony Snow - peace be upon his watching Soul .
As well founded non-political protest , but in kindest intention to all good people ,
- kindly , from P. Shahir
( PS US Federal DA has overall right to intervene , if requested , to ratify issues and defend a just cause to protest . )

This said , although African Union ( AU ) was hosted outside Africa , I wish to express profound appreciation for efforts of the host , Egyptian President Mubarak in helping bring people together - , and the long standing constructive dialogue with the US President G.W. Bush , and the friendship of Egyptians evergrowing towards USA .
Working partners who want to see peace in the region , know the value of a President who honestly stands up for his convictions !
( - and no matter certain ruthless cyber - mudslingings about ' peoples great grandfathers ' ) , ALL present day living leaders have the right to struggle in the present realities , and to statuate that there is no place for cruel repression by state tyranny platforms supporting and hosting terror cartels .......
PS China never massacred millions !!!!
but world dire neglect !!
Posted by P. Shahir on 2008-07-20 21:05:42 @ Farris - Sudan 's role in hosting OBL training camps was intensfied in the 1990s .
A new International Code of Trade Ethics appears to be gradually emerging .
Until then , the horror is that ' business is business ' for multinational economical interests .
The US demanded sanctions against Sudan ... even long prior to 9/11 2001 .
For example , Danish Police Intelligence had rightfully arrested a shipment of arms ( from a European country ) , headed for Sudan , LONG before 9/11 - but ultranationalists got angry and demanded immediate release of the shipment , as they claimed they did not want to do ' choirs for the USA '
Who was right ?
History proved dire neglect , ignorance and lack of understanding from so many around the world !!
Good people among the Powerful and weak must join hands NOW !! ( - and not do hate crime choirs against a US President who took the brunt of a horrific surprise attack !!)
ALL people must wake up and help unite all against tyranny !

Just ' cause the guy disagrees with you , you do n't gotta go saying he 's on drugs .
A lot of stuff in this article is inaccurate , and a lot of it has nothing to do with Bush at all .
Continuing to hate Bush is n't going to bring your beloved Gore into office .
I mean , the guy lost THREE TIMES to Bush .
Quit pouting already .
It 's been 8 years .
Name : ( change name for anonymous posting ) Title : Comments : 1 Article displayed .
He 's giving you access , one document at a time
California 's building codes , plumbing standards and criminal laws can be found online .
But if you want to download and save those laws to your computer , forget it .
The state claims copyright to those laws .
It dictates how you can access and distribute them -- and therefore how much you 'll have to pay for print or digital copies .
It forbids people from storing or distributing its laws without consent .
That does n't sit well with Carl Malamud , a Sebastopol resident with an impressive track record of pushing for digital access to public information .
He wants California -- and every other federal , state and local agency -- to drop their copyright claims on law , contending it will pave the way for innovators to create new ways of searching and presenting laws .
" When it comes to the law , the courts have always said there can be no copyright because people are obligated to know what it says , " Malamud said .
" Ignorance of the law is no excuse in court . "
Malamud is spoiling for a major legal fight .
He has begun publishing copies of federal , state and county codes online -- in direct violation of claimed copyright .
On Labor Day , he posted the entire 38 - volume California Code of Regulations , which includes all of the state 's regulations from health care and insurance to motor vehicles and investment .
To purchase a digital copy of the California code costs $ 1,556 , or $ 2,315 for a printed version .
The state generates about $ 880,000 annually by selling its laws , according to the California Office of Administrative Law .
Malamud is n't just targeting California .
He posted safety and building codes for nearly all 50 states , and some counties and cities such as Sonoma County and Los Angeles .
This is not uncharted territory for Malamud .
In 1994 , he pushed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to post corporate filings online , opening the door for companies such as Google and Yahoo to create elaborate financial Web sites .
In June , Malamud helped convince the state of Oregon to stop claiming copyright over its laws .
Now Malamud wants to do the same for California -- and everywhere else .
And he 's willing to go to court to make his point .
He thinks the court system will rule in his favor , establishing a precedent that all government agencies must follow .
" If that happens , it opens the doors to innovation , " Malamud said .
To get the California Code online , he digitally scanned a stack of documents that weighed 150 pounds .
Now anyone can download the 33,000 pages , and print whatever they want from his Web site , public.resource.org .
Traditionally , governments provided publishing companies such as LexisNexis copies of laws to print and bind for people .
It was practically the only way to get the laws distributed to people .
LexisNexis claims to have the " world 's largest collection of public records . "
But the Internet has changed how people can share information .
Increasingly , government agencies -- including Sonoma County -- contract with LexisNexis and other publishers to post their laws online .
" Most of the county staff now just look up the codes on the Internet , " said Jennifer Barrett , Sonoma County 's deputy planning director .
" You can quickly search for keywords or a section .
It 's quite easy to find what you are looking for . "
But LexisNexis does not format the online laws for easy printing or downloading , Malamud said .
And that hampers how people can access the laws .
Civil rights ?
Women ’s rights ?
Liberals went to the mat for them time and again against ugly , vicious and sometimes murderous opposition .
They should be forever proud .
Image Bob Herbert
The liberals who did n’t have a clue gave us Social Security and unemployment insurance , both of which were contained in the original Social Security Act .
Most conservatives despised the very idea of this assistance to struggling Americans .
Republicans hated Social Security , but most were afraid to give full throat to their opposition in public at the height of the Depression .
“ In the procedural motions that preceded final passage , ” wrote historian Jean Edward Smith in his biography , “ FDR , ” “ House Republicans voted almost unanimously against Social Security .
But when the final up - or - down vote came on April 19 [ 1935 ] , fewer than half were prepared to go on record against . ”
Liberals who did n’t have a clue gave us Medicare and Medicaid .
Quick , how many of you ( or your loved ones ) are benefiting mightily from these programs , even as we speak .
The idea that Republicans are proud of Ronald Reagan , who saw Medicare as “ the advance wave of socialism , ” while Democrats are ashamed of Lyndon Johnson , whose legislative genius made this wonderful , life - saving concept real , is insane .
When Johnson signed the Medicare bill into law in the presence of Harry Truman in 1965 , he said : “ No longer will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine . ”
Reagan , on the other hand , according to Johnson biographer Robert Dallek , “ predicted that Medicare would compel Americans to spend their ‘ sunset years telling our children and our children ’s children what it was like in America when men were free . ’ ”
Scary .
Without the many great and noble deeds of liberals over the past six or seven decades , America would hardly be recognizable to today ’s young people .
Liberals ( including liberal Republicans , who have since been mostly drummed out of the party ) ended legalized racial segregation and gender discrimination .

Historically one JavaScript property that ’s seen a lot of use ( mostly due to its convenience ) is that of __proto__ .
It ’s a quick - and - dirty way of accessing the original prototype property of the object ’s constructor function .
For example , the following is true :
" test " .__proto__ === String.prototype //
Another alternative , not using __proto__ //
Only works when constructor is n't changed " test".constructor.prototype === String.prototype
This feature has been codified in the upcoming ECMAScript 3.1 specification as a new method : Object.getPrototypeOf( object ) ( and is implemented in the latest Firefox nightlies ) .
So how can we make use of this , now standardized , functionality ?
instanceOf
If you wish you could implement your own version of the instanceof operator , using pure JavaScript .
function instanceOf ( object , constructor ) { while ( object != null ) { if ( object == constructor.prototype ) return true ; object = Object.getPrototypeOf( object ) ; } return false ; } instanceOf ( " test " , String ) ; instanceOf ( true , Boolean ) ;
In this example we traverse up the prototype chain , checking each constructor along the way .
It ’s an effective method and allows for great expressiveness in our code .
Super Methods
We could use this function to call a super method , while doing some inheritance .
function Person ( ) {} Person.prototype.kick = function ( type ) { alert ( type + " kick ! " ) ; } function Norris ( ) {} // Inherit properties from Person Norris.prototype = new Person ( ) ; Norris.prototype.kick = function ( ) { Object.getPrototypeOf( this ).kick ( " Roundhouse " ) ; } ;
In the above code we use Object.getPrototypeOf( this ) to tap in to the original , inherited , kick method .
Since we have since overridden the method we do n’t have direct access to it , but using getPrototypeOf we can capture , and utilize , it again .
Cross -Browser Implementation
The obvious question now becomes :
How do we begin using Object.get PrototypeOf today if most browsers do n’t have it implemented yet ?
In the meantime we can use something like the following code for some form of compatibility :
if ( typeof Object.getPrototypeOf !== " function " ) { if ( typeof " test " .
__proto__ === " object " ) { Object.getPrototypeOf = function ( object ) { return object .
__proto__ ; } ; } else { Object.getPrototypeOf = function ( object ) { //
May break if the constructor has been tampered with return object.constructor.prototype ; } ; } }
While it ’s not 100 % spot - on ( since the .constructor property is mutable on any object – it ’s fully possible that it could ’ve been manipulated by the user at some point ) the above code should serve as a “ good enough ” solution to tide you over until browsers have good ECMAScript 3.1 compatibility .
Why Object.getPrototypeOf ?
A common question at this point ( and one that ’s sure to come up often as new features start to trickle in from ECMAScript 3.1 ) : Why is the method Object.getPrototypeOf ( " test " ) and not " test".getPrototypeOf ( ) – or even just a property , like __proto__ ?
While having a method , or property , on every object would certainly be more convenient to use it ends up being impractical for generalized use .
For example , take the following case into consideration :
var obj = { getPrototypeOf : " blah " } ;
Any attempt to call its getPrototypeOf method would end in failure , forcing the developer to always have to fall back to using the generalized Object.getPrototypeOf .
Since most uses of getPrototypeOf would be required to work in the general case the fallback would always have to be used .
Thus it ’s not necessary to include it as an extra property of every object .
DIGG THIS
It was the singular achievement of Murray Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression to have demonstrated that the Great Depression was a crisis manufactured and prolonged by the attempts to stop an inevitable downturn .
The policy response — creating more money , propping up prices , ginning up employment , and a host of other devices — took a stock - market price collapse and a banking liquidation and spread the mess throughout every sector of the economy .
What might have lasted a year to 18 months instead lasted 16 years .
At the time , Ludwig von Mises tried to warn against intervention .
See his Causes of the Economic Crisis .
So did F.A. Hayek .
See his Prices and Production .
So did Lord Robbins .
See his book The Great Depression .
And yet , that is not the conventional wisdom .
The conventional wisdom is that the Depression was a natural disaster , a hurricane that swept through society that had to be fixed by the government .
Another view , found in the work of the monetarists , is that it was caused by the failure of the government to create oceans of paper .
This seems to be the view of Bernanke .
America is now imprisoned by these fallacious views of cause and effect .
For this reason , we see virtual unanimity that the bailout ( call it what you want : conservatorship , nationalization , socialization , whatever ) of Freddie and Fannie must take place .
On the day following the nationalization , a day that will live in infamy , the Wall Street Journal editorialized against the Democrats and their reform efforts , but did n’t actually oppose the bailout ; instead it observed that we are all somehow “ on the hook . ”
The paper also published a piece by McCain / Palin which said that the bailout is “ sadly necessary . ”
The New York Times called it “ a reasonable and reassuring move . ”
The Los Angeles Times wrote that the bailout was “ inevitable , ” and complained that Freddie and Fannie should only help 20 % and not half of borrowers .
Steve Forbes in his magazine wrote that “ drastic action ” had to be taken because a default would “ have triggered the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression . ”
It ’s interesting , is n’t it , that all these people believe that waving the magic money wand can make reality just go away .
That incredible superstition seems to be the official position of the entire US establishment .
And we like to flatter ourselves into believing that we live in an age without illusions !
As for those who should know better , Greg Mankiw , author of the leading economics textbook , writes that because “ it was likely to happen eventually ” it is “ better to get on with it . ”
The supposedly free - market economics blog Marginal Revolution warns that without the bailout , “ most of the U.S. banking system would be insolvent , ” failing to point out that a system that needs a bailout with fiat money is already insolvent .
The Cato Institute agrees that the Treasury had to bail out the mortgage industry because it " was forced to do so , ” and since Fannie and Freddie are indeed " too big to fail . "
The Heritage Foundation agrees that it was a " necessary step " and a " vital move toward reform . "
Sure , these people have plenty of recommendations about what should have been done in the past , and lots of ideas about what should be done in the future .
As for the present , they are ready to propagandize for the largest socialist operation in American history .
In all of these latter cases , we are looking not at a problem of economic education , but rather the courage to stand up to the state when it is needed most .
Pretty much alone in both predicting the calamity and actually opposing the bailout are those who have learned from the Misesian tradition , people such as Nouriel Roubini of the RGE Monitor , investor Jim Rogers , and of course our own scholars such as Mark Thornton , George Reisman , and pretty much all of our adjunct scholars who have said plainly and clearly that this is a dreadful error , one that will worsen the present meltdown .
Let us address this claim that not bailing out the system , and not nationalizing the mortgage market , would lead to a financial meltdown on the level of the Great Depression .
It makes no sense to warn that we will repeat the past if we fail to do the things that actually made the past as bad as it was .
The truth is exactly the opposite : to avoid another Depression - length downturn , we need to avoid the mistakes of the past , among which were the policies that attempted to keep failing firms and industries afloat in difficult economic times .
What should have happened in 1929 is precisely what should happen now .
The government should completely remove itself from the course of action and let the market reevaluate resource values .
That means bankruptcies , yes .
That means bank closures , yes .
But these are part of the capitalistic system .
They are part of the free - market economy .
What is regrettable is not the readjustment process , but that the process was ever made necessary by the preceding interventions .
Let me state this very plainly : I do not believe for one second that if the government fails to nationalize Freddie and Fannie , that the world as we know it will come to an end .
Those who are saying that are trying to scare the population , the same as with every other major demand by the regime .
It was the same with Nafta , the WTO , the war on terror , the war on bird flu , the nationalization of airport security , and everything else .
If the government did nothing but sell off the assets of the mortgage giants , we do not know for sure what would happen , but the market has a way of finding value and readjusting .
I would expect about 18 months of difficulties .
Banks would fail just as many businesses in the free market fail every day .
Housing prices would fall more , just as all market prices are subject to change .
But the process of readjustment would be smooth and rational .
Most important , we would all stop living a lie and believing an illusion .
Contrary to what the blogging heads say , there is nothing that makes this nationalization inevitable .
If we had more Ron Pauls , leaders with courage , who understand economics , who can think about the long run , we would let the market handle the entire process , come what may .
I guarantee that this solution is a better one than creating another trillion or so to bail out failing enterprises .

Landline vs VoIP : How to Decide Which Is Right for Your Business
Are you currently wrestling with the decision of which phone system to choose for your business ?
It ’s not a decision to be taken lightly .
There are many things to consider when deciding between landline vs VoIP and the choice is n’t always as simple as it sounds .
Each one offers unique benefits so the best option will depend on the specific needs of your company .
The Technology of Landline vs VoIP
Landline telephone service may seem like antiquated “ technology . ”
And it is , to some extent .
A landline phone relies on a dedicated copper wire network called the Public Switched Telephone Network ( PSTN ) .
Meanwhile , a VoIP phone service converts the audio of a voice call to digital data , then sends that data over the network in the same manner as other data , such as images or video streams .
It does this by utilizing your existing local area network and public internet infrastructure to place voice calls .
Essentially , a VoIP protocol “ shakes hands ” with another VoIP device to create a connection for the phone call .
From there , it manages the audio data sent between the caller and receiver until the call is complete .
VoIP Is More Cost - Effective
Of the two systems , VoIP takes the lead in cost - effectiveness .
In fact , it takes a considerable lead .
VoIP has smaller setup fees and maintenance costs , as well as lower call charges .
So if you ’re currently using a traditional landline , you ’ll find that these costs will be significantly lower .
Plus , as your business grows , adding VoIP lines is simpler and more cost - effective than with a landline .
Other Benefits of VoIP
Bringing more users onto a VoIP system requires that you only add more handsets and phone numbers to your service plan .
This makes VoIP more scalable .
VoIP is also far more portable than a landline .
You ’re able to receive calls on a VoIP device in any place where you ’re connected to the internet .
Plus , VoIP seamlessly integrates with other communication channels that use the internet and digital technologies .
With VoIP , you ’re able to utilize anonymous calling .
And voicemails can be easily converted to text messages or emails .
There are also call forwarding , recording , and analytic services available .
And if you opt for a PBX system , your VoIP system will do much more than transmit voice signals .
This technology enables companies to manage video calls , conference calls , instant messages , and much more .
Where Landlines Shine
The PSTN mentioned above is very reliable .
This is not to say that VoIP systems are n’t .
But since the PSTN relies on an alternate energy source , a landline is far less susceptible to power outages .
Plus , since the 911 network was developed when landlines were the only option , they tend to offer better access to emergency services .
Finally , there are security issues .
Of course , landlines can be physically tapped .
But since they do n’t rely on software , servers , or data , they ca n’t be hacked .
Security software usually alleviates this though .
Which Phone System Will You Choose ?
When it comes to the battle of landline vs VoIP , there ’s something to be said for tradition .
But then again , VoIP appears to be the wave of the future .
Hopefully , you now have a better sense if which is right for you .

Sean Hannity , like his conservative talk radio brethren , does n't mince words when describing coverage of the presidential campaign .
" The mainstream media , or journalism as we once knew it , " he recently said by phone , " died in 2008 . "
If Hannity is right , his listeners wo n't be mourning its passing .
The mainstream media -- that perennial whipping boy of the right -- is being knocked around even more this cycle by radio hosts convinced that the press holds a soft spot for Barack Obama .
The top talkers and their legions of listeners have countered with a harsher take .
Long before fiery clips of the Rev. Jeremiah
Wright made the rounds on YouTube or former Weatherman William Ayers was featured in a question in a Democratic primary debate , Hannity had been spreading the gospel against Obama on ABC Radio Networks ' " Sean Hannity Show . "
Other talk radio hosts have played Obama 's " bitter " comments on an endless loop , dissected his wife 's comments for any hint of elitism or anti-American sentiment and expounded on how the Democratic candidate is the greatest Marxist since , well , Karl Marx .
Many hosts have also warned listeners that an Obama presidency , coupled with Democratic control of Congress , would mean re-establishment of the Fairness Doctrine -- and with it , they say , the end of conservative talk radio itself .
Until the FCC struck it down in 1987 , the doctrine required holders of broadcast licenses to devote airtime to controversial issues of public importance and -- the kicker where right - wing radio is concerned -- to present differing views on them .
It 's not clear , though , that talk radio hosts still have the same clout they enjoyed during the 1990s , when the talk radio message machine , led by Rush Limbaugh , took much of the credit for the 1994 takeover of the House -- and was even made an honorary member of the GOP .
After nearly a decade devoted to Monica Lewinsky and the Whitewater scandal , talk radio's power was affirmed by George W. Bush 's win in 2000 and again in 2004 , when talk of John F. Kerry 's Swift - boating and flip - flopping moved quickly from the fringes into the mainstream .
But in the 2006 midterm elections , the Democrats seized control of Congress , and the Republican brand became tarnished by Beltway scandals , an unpopular president and seemingly endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform and a leader of the conservative movement , said that talk radio hosts " sidelined themselves " in 2006 .
" Talk radio ended up talking about Iraq and immigration , two issues that did n't move votes for Republicans , " Norquist said .
Norquist said that the industry 's strength was n't on display during the Republican presidential primaries , either , because " if you had to pick the candidate who the talk radio show hosts were least excited or comfortable about , [ it ] was McCain . "
With hosts preoccupied with other candidates , Norquist said , McCain -- whose campaign had seemed to derail in 2007 -- stayed under the radar until his victory in the New Hampshire primary .
All of a sudden , talk radio's frustration with McCain entered the mainstream , and Newsweek devoted a February cover to the drama playing out on the airwaves .
But a few weeks of hysterics did n't stop McCain .
Conservative hosts cut into their Barack bashing to recite the Republican 's litany of offenses : supporting immigration reform and campaign finance reform , opposing Bush 's tax cuts , and crossing the aisle to work with Wisconsin Sen .
Russ Feingold , Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and other leading liberals .
Limbaugh , who 's now reluctantly supporting McCain , previously warned his listeners that if the Arizona senator became the GOP nominee , it could " destroy the Republican Party . "
Such on - air laments prompted elder statesmen of the party to get involved .
Former Rep. Jack Kemp ( R - N.Y. ) , in an open letter to the major talk show hosts that was published shortly after Mitt Romney ended his campaign , acknowledged that McCain had " faults " and " failures " but urged hosts to offer their criticisms in " measured ways that will not damage his ability to win in November . "
With Election Day approaching , Norquist said the hosts will come around , because " Obama is completely unacceptable to every radio talk show host . "
" McCain is not as conservative as Sean Hannity , " Hannity said .
" I say this to my audience all the time .
There are going to be many occasions where Sean Hannity would be critical of a President McCain . "
However , Hannity said , " I do n't find that I ever agree with Sen. Obama . "
So while McCain may gin up less enthusiasm than Bush , radio hosts still can use the election as a referendum on Obama , picking apart the candidate day after day .
And Hannity , whose audience of more than 13 million is second only to that of Limbaugh , is in a prime position to do so .
On July 31 , Jerome Corsi , who co-authored the Swift - boat manifesto and anti-Kerry best - seller , " Unfit for Command , " gave his first interview to promote his new anti-Obama book , " The Obama Nation , " on Hannity 's radio show .
With little play in the mainstream media -- except , of course , an appearance later that night on Fox 's " Hannity & Colmes " -- Corsi 's book shot to No. 1 on Amazon and soon grabbed the top spot on The New York Times ' best - seller list .
Within days , Hannity began touting David Freddoso's " The Case Against Barack Obama , " and that book also quickly shot up Amazon 's top - seller list .
During the Democratic primaries , everyone from Karl Rove to John Kerry noticed the success of Limbaugh 's " Operation Chaos , " where the host urged listeners to vote for ( of all people ! )
Hillary Rodham Clinton in an effort to further drag out the hotly contested Democratic primary .
Michael Harrison , publisher of Talkers magazine , said that talk radio clearly has influence and speaks to a very devoted -- and politically active -- audience .
Harrison said that , in a study , his magazine estimated that " over 70 percent of listeners voted in the last election , " a higher percentage than that among devotees of other forms of media .
" News talk radio is where the voters are , " Harrison said .
" I do n't set out to do the radio show to deliver an impact in terms of political decisions or votes , " said Mike Gallagher , a conservative host who reaches more than 4 million listeners daily .
" It should be evolutionary rather than revolutionary . "
Gallagher said he uses the medium for spreading ideas , such as the need for offshore drilling , which often filter into the mainstream and then affect the political debate .
Gallagher also zeroes in on Obama 's stances that he perceives as far left .
" If you 're any kind of conservative Republican , you would reject 99.99 percent of what Barack Obama stands for , " Gallagher said , mentioning that he did n't know how " any self - respecting conservative could talk about never voting for McCain . "
One prominent conservative talker , though , has done just that .
Michael Savage , whose 8 million daily listeners trail Limbaugh 's and Hannity 's , repeatedly rants against Obama 's " far left past , present and future " -- but he has yet to fall in line with the presumptive Republican nominee .
" I can keep McCain from being elected , " Savage wrote in an e-mail to Politico .
" My audience is not only enormous but highly motivated .
If they do not come out in droves to vote for McCain , he can not win .
John is making a huge mistake in disregarding what should be his core base , i.e. , conservative voters ! "
Savage said that McCain has n't accepted an offer to appear on his show ; however , the candidate has been grilled by other conservative hosts , such as Hannity , Michael Medved and Hugh Hewitt .
Michael Goldfarb , McCain 's deputy communications director , said the campaign monitors talk radio and has a liaison working with the top shows .
" We obviously try and reach out to any audience that we think can be useful to our supporters , " Goldfarb said , adding that the " interaction is not that much different than with the cable news channels . "
But then again , CNN does n't have a regular feature like the one on Hannity 's show : " Stop the Radical Obama Express . "

Russian nuclear bomber flies undetected to within 20 miles of Hull
A Russian nuclear stealth bomber was able to fly within 90 seconds of the British coast without being picked up by radar , it was revealed today .
The supersonic ‘ Blackjack ’ jet flew completely undetected to within just 20 miles from Hull in one of the worst breaches of British security since the end of the Cold War .
RAF radar eventually picked up the plane , but the only two pairs of fighter jets used for air alerts were on other duties .
A Tupoloev ' Blackjack ' bomber similar to the jet that flew within 20 miles of the British coast completely undetected
The embarrassing breach late last year has called into question Britain 's defence capabilities after four jet squadrons were cut from the RAF ’s budget four years ago .
One senior RAF pilot told The Sun : ‘ The Russians made us look helpless .
It was a disaster - it basically gave the Russians the green light to fly wherever they want . ’
The supersonic jet had taken off from Engel 's Air Base near Saratov on Russia 's Volga delta .
The Ministry of Defence confirmed the incursion took place but said it had a ‘ multi- layered ’ approach to deterring enemy aircraft .
A spokesman said in a statement : ‘ We are satisfied we have the flexibility to launch as many aircraft as the situation requires . ’
SNELLING , Calif . 
Most days , the talk here among the farmers and almond growers along this stretch of two - lane blacktop 18 miles from the nearest on - ramp concerns heat units  as hot summer days are known  and the hull split that signals the approach of almond harvest season .
But there is also the Kasteel Noz , the turreted brick castle with two towers and a moat that Casper Noz , a 51 - year - old contractor who was born in the Netherlands , has been obsessively building by himself almost completely by hand on weekends for the past 20 years .
“ They think it ’s odd , but everyone just accepts it now , ” Dan Mallory , who runs the nearby Roberts Ferry Nut Company , said of the ultimate do - it - yourself project in his midst , from which a turret - silhouetted view of Half Dome in Yosemite can sometimes be gleaned through the Central Valley haze .
“ Casper is very meticulous . ”

Mr. Noz , a father of three , has been known to throw an occasional flaming arrow from the top of the castle into a fire pit as a celebratory gesture during birthday parties .
An independent contractor , he specializes in agricultural buildings , including fumigation rooms for almonds and walnuts , as well as modest home additions and remodeling  for which there is still a demand , he said , despite the foreclosure crisis set off by what he calls “ the ‘ have - it - today ’ mentality . ”
A passport , however , may not be undisputed documentation of a gymnast ’s age .
Yang
Yun won two bronze medals at the 2000 Sydney Games , in the uneven bars and as a member of the Chinese team .
The United States team finished fourth .
Afterward , Yang said on state - run television that she was 14 when she competed at the Games .
A Hunan Province sports administration report confirmed that .
“ The medal was supposed to be ours , and we should be given it , ” said Karolyi , the coach of the 2000 United States team , referring to the bronze medal in the team event .
“ Now some girls are left crying forever while nothing is done about the cheaters .
If the I.O.C. is closing their eyes to this , they are proving that they have turned completely political .
Why do n’t they look at the birth certificates ? ”
Nothing has been done about that potential age violation since Yang ’s video recently surfaced on the Internet .
Another I.O.C. spokeswoman , Emmanuelle Moreau , said the committee had “ the mechanism in place ” to deal with a case of an under - age athlete who wins an Olympic medal , but she would not elaborate .
The responsibility remains with the international gymnastics federation , she said .
Officials from the F.I.G. said Saturday that they did not plan to investigate Yang ’s claim that she broke the rules because no documents were involved .
“ As long as the passport ages are the same as in the past as today , there is no reason for the F.I.G. to take any action , ” Andre Gueisbuhler , the secretary general , said .
I ’m a huge rtorrent fan .
I ca n’t imagine why anyone would use anything else , unless there ’s something funky the big - name programs can do , that rtorrent just does n’t handle yet .
This time , instead of introducing you to rtorrent nice and easy , like I did with cplay , I ’m going to give you a brief tour , and then I ’ll show you something very cool you can do with it .
rtorrent is an amazing , complex , powerful program that is at the same time sleek , clean , comprehensive and ultralight — and I ’m giving you just one small idea of its potential .
But first , let ’s scratch the surface .
Like a lot of console - driven programs , the startup screen for rtorrent is … rather dry .
That ’s all you get .
Exciting , is n’t it ? 🙄
To add a torrent , press return and navigate to the torrent file .
In this example , I ’m using one of my favorite Revolution Void albums , “ Increase the Dosage , ” from Jamendo .
I ca n’t guarantee you ’ll like it , but it ’s a free and legal download and it makes for a good example .
You can use tab completion to make your way to it .
Double - tab shows a list of available path options that match the path you ’ve already started .
Your path starts in your home directory ( unless you started it in a lower directory than that ) , so you do n’t have to give it the full root path if you do n’t want to .
Press enter when you ’ve found the one you want , and rtorrent will add it to the list .
Note that it ’s still labeled as “ INACTIVE . ” rtorrent wo n’t start downloading until you tell it to .
Use the arrow up and down keys to highlight the torrent ( it will be marked with a bar of asterisks ) and press CTRL+S .
Now we ’re moving .
The torrent is marked as active , the tracker will be contacted , and provided there are adequate seeds , downloading will start .
That ’s about it , in a nutshell .
There are some customary points that you ’d expect from a torrent client .
Press the right arrow while a torrent is highlighted , to see a detailed breakdown of the information available .
To get back to the main list , use the left arrow .
Bandwidth throttling might be important to you too .
If you ’re used to capping your bandwidth ( I choke my upload speeds to keep my wireless router from having a nervous breakdown ) , try using the a - s-d , A - S - D , z -x -c and Z - X - C keys to trim the speed to your liking .
If you take a few moments to experiment , you ’ll find that pressing the numbers 1 - 6 gives you a revised view , with different filters applied .
That can be useful if you ’ve got 10 or 12 torrents running at a time , and you want a clear list of finished torrents , or stopped torrents .
And most important , you can quit the program with CTRL+Q .
This is where you can stop if you just wanted the short tour .
The next part is for people who really want to put rtorrent to work , and do n’t mind getting their hands dirty . 😈
When you started rtorrent for the very first time , you probably saw a warning message that told you there was n’t a .rtorrent.rc file to follow .
That configuration file is what morphs rtorrent from a mild - mannered , law - abiding console gimmick into an unholy torrent - wrangling banshee .
In Ubuntu , the sample rtorrent configuration file is hiding at /usr / share / doc/ rtorrent /examples/rtorrent.rc .
Copy one for your own perusal , and give it the proper hidden file prefix .
cp /usr / share/doc/rtorrent/examples/rtorrent.rc
~/.rtorrent.rc
Edit , 2010 - 05 - 07 : Please remember that this post was written a few years ago , and the configuration file for the current , vanilla rtorrent may be different from what you see here .
— K.
Mandla
Now open that file in your favorite text editor .
Take a minute or two to peruse the guts .
( I ’ve copied one to the Ubuntu -nl pastebin for reference , or if you ’re reading this at work on your $ 3,000 DRM - crippled Vista rig . 😛 )
You should get an idea of what the file can do ; setting max uploads and downloads , default throttling and IP masking are all options .
But take a closer look at some of these settings .
# Watch a directory for new torrents , and stop those that have been
# deleted .
#schedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start=./watch/*.torrent
#schedule = untied_directory , 5,5 , stop_untied=
What ’s that mean , you say ?
Well , it means rtorrent can watch a directory and add torrents to its list automatically , and stop torrents if the corresponding file disappears .
Now look at this :
# Stop torrents when reaching upload ratio in percent ,
# when also reaching total upload in bytes , or when
# reaching final upload ratio in percent .
# example : stop at ratio 2.0 with at least 200 MB uploaded , or else ratio 20.0
#schedule = ratio,60,60 , stop_on_ratio=200,200M,2000
You can also allow seeding to a specific ratio , a specific total uploaded or both .
So if you get tired of carrying the weight of the Internets on your shoulders , you can limit your sharing on any number of criteria .
That ’s nothing new , you might say .
Azureus does all that , plus it has a feature - rich GUI , is proof of the viability of Java applications and has a cool blue frog as a mascot .
Well , please allow me to retort … with a case study : Imagine you ’ve got two machines :
Your $ 3,000 dual - core , dual SATA - drive , LED - bespeckled laptop straight from Dell , with an array of glossy sheen snap covers , eight USB ports , a gigabit connection and a built - in 802.11a - wireless card .
Your other machine is the lowly 166 Mhz Pentium laptop .
The one with 64 Mb of PC66 and a 3 Gb hard drive .
The one you got from work in 1997 and never took back , even when you left them for another company during the dot - com boom .
Burnt - out pixels , loose hinges and one scratchy speaker .
The one with the Stone Temple Pilots sticker peeling off the lid .
You know what I ’m talking about .
Set up your main rig with a shared network folder ( NFS would be perfect for this ) on a static IP address .
Set up your lowly Pentium machine with a hard line to your router , maybe with a PCMCIA LAN card — something that at least gives you decent access speeds .
Now mount that shared folder directly into your slave ’s home directory , maybe under ./ watch .
Set up the configuration file .
Trigger rtorrent on bootup , and tell it to watch that folder .
Now you surf away in the comfort of your shiny dual - core desktop - replacement laptop , and when you find a torrent you like , save it into the local networked folder — perhaps even sending it to that folder automatically , through Firefox ’s file extension preferences .
When you save it , rtorrent snaps it up and adds it to its list .
It starts downloading it automatically , saving the file locally or perhaps on an external drive .
You can set it to follow a certain bandwidth schedule so it does n’t overwhelm the network , or you could hold all the torrents until the middle of the night , and do all your downloading during the wee hours .
It continues to download until it ’s finished , then seeds for as long as you allow it .
If it reaches the seeding ratio you set , it stops .
If it reaches the upload limit , it stops .
And best of all , if you delete the control torrent file out of your local download directory , it halts all the activity on that torrent and subtracts it from the list .
Download the torrent , and it starts immediately .
Change your mind and delete it , and rtorrent cuts it loose .
Clean and neat , all handled automatically and without the least amount of effort on your part .
It ’s almost like a torrent daemon .
( In my experience , rtorrent never deletes the product files it has already created .
So if you start downloading and change your mind an hour later , rtorrent might take the torrent out of the list , but the target files are still available .
Conceivably , you could change your mind again and re-download the torrent file , and rtorrent would pick up the already downloaded fraction and get back to work on it .
But I ’m not 100 percent sure on that because I do n’t recall ever doing it , so do n’t hold me to that .
🙂 )
I ’ll be honest and say I have n’t used Azureus in more than a year , and so it ’s possible that you could create the same arrangement with Azureus .
But can Azureus run on your leftover Pentium Pro laptop ?
rtorrent is highlighted in yellow in that htop window .
CPU usage is roughly 1.0 percent of my 300 Mhz and the memory profile around 10 percent of my 64Mb , and that ’s while it actively downloads the album I started with when I began writing this .
Add a few more torrents and of course the profile will go up , but the benefit of running without Java , without the X interface and without two dozen Gnome dependencies should be blatantly obvious .
I ’m willing to bet your old Pentium could do it .
Spacewise , rtorrent is going to cost you 314Kb for the download and 860 Kb to install .
libtorrent9 is necessary , so that ’s another 284Kb to download and 788Kb on your drive , so you ’re looking at less than 600Kb of bandwidth and maybe 1.6Mb installed .
Again , I ’ve written letters to Mom that took up more space than that .
I hope this is convincing enough to get you to try rtorrent , and maybe even use it on a regular basis .
I really believe it ’s a better option than most of the prevailing torrent clients , even if it is console - based .
If you want to delve even deeper into this amazing little program , take a spin past the rtorrent wiki , which is one of the best - composed and best - written I ’ve seen in a long time .
The project is very active , and it has the look of it .
Next time : Give up on the Gecko , and browse with elinks instead .

Edit , 2009 - 01 - 23 :
If you ’d like to see this setup on exceptionally low - end hardware , consider this example .
Even at 100 Mhz with only 16Mb for system memory and a lethargic 810 Mb hard drive , it ’s possible to use rtorrent in a networked arrangement and feed it the work of downloading and seeding .
Edit , 2009 - 11 - 14 :
This post is more than two years old now , but is still one of the heaviest draws to this site .
I had to re-upload photos for this page , and likewise had to edit the text slightly to make sure what you saw in the pictures was what you were reading in the text .
My apologies if I overlooked any discrepancies .
Cheers and enjoy .
Edit , 2010 - 05 - 07 :
It ’s ironic that almost exactly on the third birthday of this post , a second image host has expired and I ’ve had to reupload the images again .
I suppose it ’s a testimonial to either this post or to rtorrent ( or maybe Revolution Void ) , take your pick . 😉
Once again , if you see something different from what ’s in the pictures , please let me know .
It might be around for a couple more years still . 😯
P.S. , 2010 - 05 - 07 : Just for the record , the screenshots that you see currently are of the rtorrent - extended package available in Arch ’s AUR .
The system is a 300 Mhz Celeron laptop running only framebuffer applications on Arch Linux , writing downloads directly over USB1.1 to an external hard drive , accessed across a wireless network with ssh and nfs , and managed by a 120 Mhz Pentium laptop running Crux .
This is the part where you try to out - geek me . 😈

In celebration of International Bacon Day we decided to make some extra special sugar cookies with bacon .
We started with Nestle Toll House Sugar Cookies and ended with sweet , bacony goodness .
Here ’s a step by step recap .
Nestle Toll House Sugar Cookies were the base for our Bacon Day treats .
We chose Hormel ’s Real Bacon Bits as the topping for our bacon cookies .
The Hormel Real Bacon Bits are soft and make a great topping for the cookies .
We added the bacon bits to the tops of each cookie square before baking .
We pressed the bits down into the cookie with the back of a fork .
Once all the squares were covered in bacon bits we popped the dough in the oven at 325 degrees for 16 minutes .
Once baked , the cookies were extra delicious .
Just the right hint of salty bacon in a sugary cookie .
Highly recommended !
– Mr. B .

erlSim Beta Released
erlSim , a discrete event simulator written in erlang , has been released and is available at
sourceForge .
This simulation engine takes advantage of erlang ’s high concurrency and speed of execution .
It also includes several random distributions that are typically used in simulations such as the triangular and normal distributions .
Included in the downloadable package are test harnesses for the simulation engine as well as some of the distributions .
These distributions are a work in progress .
Many of them have not even been run let alone tested .
Those that have test harnesses should be working .
The intriguing idea behind using erlang as a discrete simulation environment is that each tool , object , person , etc. in the simulation could be an individual process .
Or , if you wanted , each process that acts on simulation entities could be an erlang process .
The engine does n’t care how you chose to create your simulation .

MICHAEL Jackson ‘s notorious tighty whities are up for grabs .
A pair of size - 28 Calvin Klein white briefs once belonging to Wacko Jacko will be auctioned on eBay tomorrow , with a reserve price of $ 1 million .
The unwashed underpants have a sensational past .
They were part of the evidence confiscated in 2003 by then - Santa Barbara DA Tom Sneddon , who wanted a DNA sample for his unsuccessful child - molestation case against the washed - up King of Pop .
The briefs are part of a stash of Jacko artifacts offered by New Jersey businessman Henry Vacarro , who obtained them in a bankruptcy case .
For extra authenticity , the briefs come sealed in an evidence bag and wrapped with police tape .
Also being sold are the Gloved One ’s handwritten note explaining why he wants an annulment from Lisa Marie Presley and a used half - ounce tube of skin - bleaching cream .
EMS Is Becoming Ghetto Medicine
" We need an expanded community healthcare system "
by Lester Greene
New York City
Lester Greene is a member of the Executive Board of Local 2507 EMT ( Emergency Medical Technicians ) and Paramedics of NYC EMS ( New York City Emergency Medical Service ) .
This article is taken from an interview by Nic Paget - Clarke with Lester Greene in New York at the union 's offices .
In general , because of the poverty level , I think , and the economy , the number of people out of work , there seems to be more and more generally sick people - from elderly to pediatrics
This is basic health care that these people need .
We 're the closest they 've seen to a doctor .
Either the emergency room or the emergency ambulance , - EMS ( Emergency Medical Service ) has become their doctor .
This means these people should actually go to a doctor , if they had a primary physician to go to .
But because most of the population we serve are uninsured people at the lower poverty level , they have no doctor .
Like I say , the way to go to a doctor is to go in an ambulance , that 's what they say .
The large homeless population always go to city hospitals .
EMS is becoming like ghetto medicine
On the average , the EMS system receives anywhere from 2,000 - 3,000 calls a day .
For the whole city , that 's a million calls a year .
Of these calls , major trauma is 20 percent .
Eighty percent is minor injuries , minor sick , chronic sick , things like that .
People will call an ambulance from everything - I have a cold for five days , I have had the flu for five days , people call an ambulance for that type of thing .
And the City of New York has this thing where they must send an ambulance to respond .
We need more primary care physicians , even create a part of the EMS system that would deal with non-emergency type of transport .
If you remember the military days during Vietnam , if you were sick in the morning , you 'd go see the medics .
We should have something like that where you have an ambulance staffed by City workers who'd be at the shelters in the morning and people who were sick would be given medicine or taken to a doctor if necessary .
In other words , expand the whole system .
The significance of this is we should put on more qualified city workers and not farm the work out to the volunteer hospitals .
These hospitals only run ambulances to take people to their hospitals .
They only want to deal with rich and affluent people .
The history of EMS
The history of EMS is that we 've been around for 26 years and the whole system itself is still in its infancy .
The fire and police departments have been around for 100 + years .
We serve the five boroughs ( of New York ) just like the police and the fire department but our staffing levels are a fraction of what theirs is .
Our total street staff is maybe about 2,500 - 2,700 people compared to the police department which is over 50,000 people .
On the average , throughout the city , there are under 100 ambulances on patrol at any one time .
It 's got to be under 100 , 50 - 75 .
Also , it 's projected , nationally , by the year 2000 that the majority of people doing this job will be women and people of color .
In this country , EMS started right after the Vietnam War because the EMS system was developed for the Vietnam War .
You always had medics but in that war you had a large volume of injuries and you had to start a pre-hospital , pre-emergency medical care .
So you had field people .
For instance , there 's something the military uses when you go into shock which infuses blood from your lower extremities to your upper extremities to your heart and lungs so that you can live .
These were developed in Vietnam because of the large injuries in the field and you could n't Medivac people out right away , you had to stabilize them in the field .
That 's when emergency medicine started there .
In a lot of ways the streets have become like Vietnam , especially the inner cities .
I 've been on the job nine years and once it was bad with the heavy drug thing , especially heroin , but since the crack outbreak in the last few years it 's gotten even worse with the proliferation of guns .
People have taken pot shots at the ambulance as it goes by , ambulances have taken bullets .
Luckily nobody has been hit , but windshields have been hit , the ambulance body has been hit .
There 's been times when our crews have been assaulted .
Some of our people wear bulletproof vests .
We have Vietnam vets on the job who actually were in during the fighting time , and a lot of them have become very stressed out on this job .
I do n't know if they feel less control now than they did then , but now they seem like they can't handle it .
In a military situation your whole environment is controlled .
Here you have the job you have to do , but also you have to deal with the home environment .
So if that 's not under control , then the stress from that overlaps .
I think that 's the problem .
If there 's stress at home , you have that situation plus the stress on the job because of the bureaucratic stuff .
You feel unappreciated .
The EMS is a paramilitary organization .
We have a rank structure with lieutenants , captains , chiefs .
Public medicine
From my perspective here at the local , I feel that EMS is public medicine .
I do n't think it 's a real emergency medical service .
We do very good medical work , we 're proud of that , and we 're trained on that .
We can handle most situations .
But it 's like we 're health care workers in the field .
When a person gets shot or stabbed , they need a doctor , that 's what they need , a person that 's trained to stop internal bleeding .
All I can do in the field is stabilize them .
But there 's a saying in the street that a good paramedic is not made by trauma , but by medical calls , sick calls .
For sick calls you diagnose , look at what 's the person signs and symptoms are , and you figure out whether they have an MI , a heart attack , a stroke , whether they 're diabetic , in insulin shock  these are diagnosis calls that you make based on the training you get .
Trauma is like 1,2,3 , - package them and get them to the hospital because that 's what they really need .
So to me , having a broader field , a broader work in medicine would be better for us and it would be job security .
If we were to have smaller clinics , people would n't have to go to emergency rooms .
The emergency rooms have been tied up , and if you 're going to the hospital to spend five to six hours because there 's no stretchers in the emergency rooms , the emergency room is being used like a clinic .
We should have expanded clinics in the communities that EMS people could staff .
This would be possible because often our people cannot work the ambulance anymore because they get hurt on the job .
Many EMS people are hurt with bad back injuries , a good 51 percent of our injuries are back - related injuries .
We need to deal with people in shelters , the homeless , people who do n't have access to medical facilities .
We need to deal with them on a more realistic level so they 're treated prior to their injuries getting out of hand , and in more of an educational way , with clinics .
We should still be an emergency medical service but with an expanded role in community health .

The Percentage Fallacy
There ’s one bit of irrationality that seems like it ought to be in behavioral economics introduction but mysteriously is n’t .
For lack of a better term , let ’s call it the percentage fallacy .
The idea is simple :
One day I find I need a blender .
I see a particularly nice one at the store for $ 40 , so I purchase it and head home .
But on the way home , I see the exact same blender on sale at a different store for $ 20 .
Now I feel ripped off , so I drive back to the first store , return the blender , drive back to the second store , and buy it for $ 20 .
The next day I find I need a laptop .
I see a particularly nice one at the store for $ 2500 , so I purchase it and head home .
But on the way home , I see the exact same laptop for $ 2480 .
“ Pff , well , it ’s only $ 20 , ” I say , and continue home with the original laptop .
I ’m sure all of you have done something similar — maybe the issue was n’t having to return something , but spending more time looking for a cheaper model , or fiddling with coupons and rebates , or buying something of inferior quality .
But the basic point is consistent : we ’ll do things to save 50 % that we ’d never do to save 1 % .
At first this almost seems rational — of course we ’re going to do more to save more money !
But you are n’t saving more money .
With both the blender and the laptop , you have the chance to save $ 20 .
Either way , you ’re going to have another twenty in your pocket , which you can spend on exactly the same things later on .
Yet we behave differently depending on whether we got that twenty by skimping on a small purchase or skimping on a big one .
Rationally , if driving back to the store is n’t worth $ 20 when you ’re buying a laptop , it is n’t worth $ 20 when you ’re buying a blender .
On the other hand , do n’t those small savings tend to add up after a while ?
If you start blowing $ 20 every time you buy a trinket , you ’re soon going to be out of disposable income .
Meanwhile , spending several thousand dollars is much rarer , so is n’t it OK to slack off a bit on such occasions ?
If we work to save 50 % on everything , big or small , that ’s the equivalent of saving 50 % of our money altogether .
Whereas if we only try to save fixed amounts on every purchase , how much we save is dependent on how many things we buy .
So which is the real irrationality ?
I ’m not entirely sure of the answer .

The MSCI World index , which measures global equity market performance , is now up just 68 % ( not total return ) since its bottom on March 12 , 2003 .
After analyzing the performance of various country indices since then , we found some interesting results .
Since the 3/12/03 global market bottom , Brazil , India and Mexico all have total returns of more than 400 % , with Brazil leading the way at 427 % .
Germany has been the best performing Western European country with a total return of 187 % .
At the bottom of the barrel is Japan , with a gain of 68 % , but unfortunately the US ranks second to last at 77 % .
So while much has been made of how well the US has held up during this downturn , it still lags behind pretty much everyone else when looking at the last bull and the current bear .
The most surprising performance number comes from China .
After its bubble and bust from 2005 to present , China 's performance is pretty much right inline with the US at 79 % .
With so much focus on China 's growth this decade , one would think its equity markets would be at the top of the performance ladder with other BRIC countries .
Here 's a must - read article for anyone interested in learning how the pharmaceutical industry really operates .
It 's a case of aggressive marketing gone bad , with a mixture of corrupt physicians , underhanded payola and a near - total disregard for patient health .
And yet it 's business as usual in the pharmaceutical industry : drug maker Schering - Plough , one of the largest drug companies in the world , has been outright bribing physicians to prescribe drugs and operate sham clinical trials .
Here 's how it would work : doctors who prescribed the drug company 's products and avoided competing drugs were paid " consulting fees " of tens of thousands of dollars .
And what kind of consulting did these doctors do ?
The kind of consulting that requires nothing more than signing a blank sheet of paper and cashing the check , of course .
And thousands of doctors participated in this criminal scam , collecting untold sums of money in exchange for hyping Schering - Plough 's pharmaceuticals to patients .
( Medical ethics , anyone ? )
Doctors were paid even more money to conduct fraudulent clinical trials that would require patients to take the drugs for twelve months at a time , which of course rang up even more drug profits for the manufacturer and resulted in more kickbacks to the doctors .
That 's right : they 're literally playing doctor with your life while pocketing the drug money .
If all this sounds outrageous , think again : this is precisely the kind of criminal activity that now typifies the pharmaceutical industry and organized medicine in general .
These companies will do anything to make a buck , including outright bribing doctors with lavish meals , free gifts and even trips to Hawaii and other exotic destinations , all under the guise of " continuing medical education " ( CME ) courses .
It 's all a scam , and the vast majority of physicians just go right along with it , pocketing the benefits and dosing up their patients with whatever drug they 've been told to prescribe .
I 've seen it myself : a room - full of doctors in Hawaii , ditching a drug company sponsored " education " event , where airfare and hotels were provided for free .
Why were the doctors ditching the class ?
Because they wanted to have fun in Hawaii , and attendance was n't required after the first hour .
It 's basically just a paid vacation scam , courtesy of the pharmaceutical company .
And it 's happening every day , right now .
Prescription drugs are so profitable -- some drugs are now sold at more than 500,000 % markup over the actual cost of their raw ingredients -- that drug companies will do practically anything to sell more pills .
They invent fictitious diseases and urge doctors and parents to dose their children with powerful narcotics .
They conduct fraudulent clinical trials , making sure to bury any negative results that would show how dangerous their drugs really are .
They buy the favor of the media by pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into magazine , television , newspaper and online advertising .
They pressure the FDA into delaying the ban on extremely dangerous drugs in order to squeeze out another twelve months of profits even while patients are dying from drug - induced liver failure .
And the scam works : drug profits are up .
Way up .
Meanwhile , the American people are sicker than ever .
Drugs are n't helping the population at large , all they 're doing is turning the United States into a nation of chemical zombies who suffer from the extremely toxic side effects of taking dozens of prescriptions in combination .
It 's the greatest con in American history .
It 's the racket of the millennium .
The drug companies are running the show , cutting off drugs from Canada , monopolizing the U.S. market , running the FDA , bribing doctors and killing patients all the while .
Even based on statistics from conventional medicine , prescription drugs are right now killing 100,000 Americans each year and injuring another two million .
And that does n't count the tens of thousands of additional deaths caused by NSAIDs and over - the - counter painkillers .
It 's not an exaggeration to call this a medical holocaust .
These drug companies seem determined to dose the entire population with as many simultaneous prescriptions as possible , as long as it generates profits for their shareholders .
Business ethics are nowhere to be found in the pharmaceutical industry these days : it 's all about money , profits , power and control .
And the funny part about all this is that these drugs are almost entirely unnecessary .
There 's not a single chronic disease that 's actually cured or reversed from any prescription drug in existence .
All these drugs do is treat symptoms and barely keep the patients alive long enough to write another check to cover their growing medical debt .
Chemotherapy is a sham and has absolutely no scientific merit whatsoever .
( Yes , it shrinks tumors , but it adds nothing to a patient 's lifespan . )
Statin drugs are a con , and yet they 're being over - prescribed for all sorts of chronic disorders that actually need to be treated with nutrition and exercise , not drugs .
And over - the - counter drugs are both extremely dangerous and highly ineffective .
NSAIDs kill some 40,000 patients each year from intestinal bleeding -- and yet offer no real benefit to patients that could n't be achieved from simple changes in diet and exercise .
The FDA , meanwhile , watches all this and focuses its own efforts on discrediting herbal supplements like ephedra .
The agency seems determined to outlaw or regulate all nutritional supplements , thereby making vitamins illegal and practically guaranteeing another decade of outrageous profits for drug companies .
It 's no surprise : most FDA employees used to work for drug companies ( or plan to in the near future ) .
Many FDA employees maintain strong financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry .
They 're simply out to crush the natural health industry and thereby boost their own personal profits from pharmaceuticals .
Modern medicine is in shambles , folks .
It 's a train wreck .
We 're sicker , fatter and more depressed than ever .
And the really good advice that people need is n't reaching them .
Good health is really simple , it turns out .
Get lots of natural sunlight on your skin daily .
Eat superfoods like chlorella and spirulina .
Avoid all refined carbohydrates and processed foods .
Ban soft drinks from your life .
Never touch cigarettes .
Pick up strength training , yoga , pilates , cycling , jogging or some other physical exercise activity .
And breathe , people .
Breathe consciously .
Your body needs oxygen .

In a way , the massive fraud now being exposed in western medicine is a blessing in disguise .
Big Medicine has gone so far over the top with aggressive marketing and downright evil ( if not criminal ) tactics that the whole profiteering orgy is going to come crashing down on them .
Big Medicine will soon be history -- remembered as just a moment of insanity in the history of modern civilization .
Some day , people will say , " Do you remember when the whole country was dosed up on chemicals ? "
They 'll shudder with the thought of it -- how we were all duped by the drug companies , by our family doctors , and by the Bush Administration 's complicity in the whole scheme .
They 'll ask , " How could an entire country go mad like this ? "
And the answer , of course , is that the whole country was doped up on prescription drugs that alter brain chemistry , cloud the mind , and turn ordinary consumers into pill - popping zombies .
It was a brilliant scam .
It generated billions of dollars in profits .
And now the truth is starting to come out : Big Medicine is about to become another sad chapter in the history of human deception .
Good riddance .

Now , here 's the full article on prescription drug bribery originally published by the New York Times , included here for educational and discussion purposes only , under fair use consideration .
Conservationists at the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology ( DICE ) , University of Kent , are celebrating a double achievement – the success of a conservation programme in Rwanda that has helped turn gorilla poachers into ecotourism guides , and a major international award for the programme ’s founder , alumnus Edwin Sabuhoro .
Mr Sabuhoro , a Rwandan national , completed his one - year MSc in Conservation and Tourism at DICE in 2006 with a dissertation titled Ecotourism as a potential conservation incentive for local communities around Rwanda 's Parc National des Volcans .
A dedicated ‘ adventurer , naturalist , educator , guide , tracker , ranger and conservationist ’ , Mr Sabuhoro then put his research findings into action by founding the Iby ’ Iwacu Cultural Village in Northern Rwanda , a community - based ecotourism initiative that was designed to develop incentives for local people to protect gorilla habitats .
Already , the outcomes of his project are astonishing : local people own 100 % of the project ; the cultural village has increased ecotourism by 40 % , generating a sustainable income base from it ; and , most significantly , the poaching of gorillas has been reduced by 60 % as the revenue from ecotourism has encouraged local people to protect them .
It is for this reason that Mr Sabuhoro has just been named Young Conservationist of the Year by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , the world ’s oldest and largest global environmental network .
Nigel Leader - Williams , Professor of Biodiversity Management , Director of DICE and supervisor of Mr Sabuhoro ’s dissertation , was among the first to offer congratulations .
‘ This is a richly deserved award , ’ he said .
‘ Edwin and his family made quite exceptional financial sacrifices to complete his MSc .
His dedication has paid real dividends for gorillas and people in Rwanda by providing tangible benefits from conservation . ’
A sentiment that was reflected by Dr Helen Newing , Convenor of the MSc in Conservation and Tourism , who expressed her delight on hearing the news of Mr Sabuhoro ’s award .
‘ The MSc programme is designed to provide conservation professionals not only with a sound theoretical training but also with the technical skills and understanding to address practical issues on the ground .
Edwin ’s achievement is an outstanding example of the kind of practice the programme aims to promote . ’
Deanne Adams , Acting President of the International Ranger Foundation said : ‘ What impresses me most about Edwin Sabuhoro is that he found a local solution for a serious protected area problem .
He established a way to provide a new economy for local communities that also provides new protection for threatened animals in the area – and this is a source of inspiration for other communities . ’
David Sheppard , Head of IUCN 's Programme on Protected Areas , added : ‘ Edwin ’s outstanding work has benefited gorillas and local people in Rwanda .
It has shown that the involvement of local people with wildlife conservation can result in win-win outcomes . ’
Founded in 1989 , DICE has trained some 475 postgraduate students from over 80 countries , with many going on to make significant international contributions to conserving flagship species or biodiversity in general .
Automattic Acquires Intense Debate
I ’m pleased to announce that Intense Debate is now an Automattic joint .

To NY - based architect - poets and " reversible destiny " philosophers Arakawa & Gins , comfort deserves only a limited role in the home .
In their vision , a home that keeps its inhabitants young and healthy should provide perpetual challenges .
A tentative relationship with your environment , they argue , is key to " reversing the downhill course of human life . "
This video takes a peek inside their Reversible Destiny Lofts in the Mitaka area of western Tokyo .
Designed to stimulate the senses and force inhabitants to use balance , physical strength and imagination , the lofts feature uneven floors , oddly positioned power switches and outlets , walls and surfaces painted a dizzying array of colors , a tiny exit to the balcony , a transparent shower room , irregularly shaped curtainless windows , and more .
For the adventurous , two rental units are now available for 220,000 and 250,000 yen ( $ 2,000 / $ 2,400 ) per month , which is a bit pricey for Tokyo , but not outrageous .
Short - term stays can also be arranged .
There is a useful symposium on Africa at the Boston Review revolving around Ted Miguel 's essay , including contributions by Bob Bates , Paul Collier , and David Weil .
The questions are : what is driving Africa 's recent growth , and how sustainable is it ?
Is growth the result of good policies , democratic governance , Chinese investment , or high commodity prices ?
And is it a blip , or something more permanent ?
Collier offers the simplest answer of all : African policy makers have been learning from their mistakes .
But the growth we are seeing today is not just a result of commodity booms .
I do n’t think that is the key to Kenya ’s pre-election economic success .
There is a process at work that does not depend on democracy and is so simple that analysts generally miss it : learning from mistakes .
Since 1970 African societies have accumulated a huge stock of experience in how not to manage an economy .
For example , from the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s Tanzania adopted regulatory policies that proved to be ruinous .
The knowledge they gained through failure is valuable .
Tanzania is now one of the best - managed of all Africa ’s economies .
The European society with the best record of containing inflation over the past sixty years is Germany .
It has the best record because it used to have the worst : the experience of hyperinflation immunized Germans from macroeconomic folly .
Miguel endorses this view , but spins it differently , focusing on the advantaged of randomized impact evaluations .
While it ’s natural to focus on such success stories , randomized evaluations do n’t always produce positive results about program impacts .
But information on failures is just as useful ; it allows policymakers to shift funding from the projects that do n’t work toward those that do .
This is at the heart of the learning agenda that ... is the key to Africa ’s economic future .
Democracies like those emerging in Africa are particularly good learning environments , settings where impact evaluations can be carried out , their fruits widely distributed , and governments held accountable for applying their lessons to policy .
In nations with weaker governance , rigorous program evaluations can themselves serve as a form of political accountability , empowering decent government officials to push for reform .
With impact - evaluation results in hand , policymakers in poor countries will increasingly be able to rely on hard evidence when deciding how to use their scarce resources .
We now know the benefits of anti-parasitic drugs in improving school attendance in Busia , and as a result the Kenyan national government has included mass school - based deworming in its official school health plan for the country .
Word has spread , and other African countries have expanded their own school deworming plans .
In Ghana , over four million children received anti-parasitic drugs at school in 2007 .
Learning about deworming is a small step forward on its own .
But it will be through many such small lessons — in areas as diverse as health , education , agriculture , governance , and foreign aid — that African countries might learn to sustain and possibly augment their recent economic growth , even after the inevitable fall in global commodity prices .
I think Collier would say that the learning that comes from having followed disastrous macro , trade , and financial policies is much more important than any learning from randomized evaluations -- even though the former hardly qualifies as " hard evidence " in the sense that Miguel uses the term .
I would add that randomized impact evaluations rarely generate usable " hard evidence " for policy makers .
As soon as we generalize , scale up , or extrapolate we are in the business of transforming hard evidence into soft evidence .
I wish Miguel were right when he writes : " With impact - evaluation results in hand , policymakers in poor countries will increasingly be able to rely on hard evidence when deciding how to use their scarce resources . "
Alas , we are doomed to live in a world of soft evidence .
And pretending otherwise may itself end up skewing where resources go .
I ’ve been waiting to blog about this for a long time now .
A fantastic new improvement to Mozilla ’s JavaScript engine ( SpiderMonkey ) has landed .
Code - named TraceMonkey this engine utilizes a techniques , called trace trees ( PDF ) , which adds just - in - time native code compilation to SpiderMonkey .
A major goal of the project has been to set JavaScript up to compete with natively - compiled code , rather than simply against other interpreters .
This means that we ’re starting to see speeds that are completely out of this league when it comes to performance .
Results and Try it Yourself
Here are the results from four benchmarks to give you a taste :
The tests are :
If you want to try these out for yourself , just snag a nightly of Firefox 3.1 , open about : config , and set the following preference to true :
javascript.options.jit.content
You should be , happily , in just - in - time tracing land .
It ’s still buggy ( hence the reason for hiding behind the preference wall ) but it should be good enough to handle most web sites .
What ’s especially exciting is that this code is working on x86 , x86 - 64 , and ARM – which means that these improvements wo n’t be limited to just the desktop – you ’ll be able to receive them on your mobile devices as well .
How Tracing Works
In simple terms tracing works by watching for commonly - repeated actions ( such as loops , function calls , or type checking ) and tries to optimize their resulting native code into the lowest number of actions .
The premise is rather simple – and it ’s an advance that we ’ll probably see proliferate to many interpreters and engines in the upcoming years .
Andreas Gal published a paper ( PDF ) on the subject and Brendan Eich has written up a TraceMonkey - specific explanation .
Some of the improvements made by tracing include :
Function Inlining : Removing the overhead of function calls by simply replacing them with their resulting native code .
Type Inference : Removing checks surrounding common operators ( like “ + ” ) when the types contained within a variable are already known .
This means that the engine will have already pre-determined , for example , that two strings need to be concated when it sees the “ + ” operator .
Looping :
The overhead of looping has been grossly diminished .
It ’s one of the most common areas of overhead in JavaScript applications ( common repetition of a task ) and the constant determining of bounds and the resulting inner code is made negligible .
The code for this project has come from a number of places – one of which is coming from some code contributed to Mozilla , from Adobe : Tamarin Tracing , specifically the nanojit code that ’s able to work a lot of this just - in - time magic .
Development
The work began just about 60 days ago , working with Andreas Gal of UC Irvine , to integrate the nanojit technology into Spidermonkey .
You can hear more about the development from those that were involved : Andreas Gal , Mike Shaver , and Brendan Eich .
The full code can be found in the TraceMonkey mercurial repository ( the commit to merge TraceMonkey into Mozilla core is massive , clocking in at about 4MB ) .
If you want to try running your own copy of TraceMonkey on the command - line , just follow the steps outlined here .
There is still a ton of work to be done .
The incredible speed - ups that we ’re seeing are only just the beginning .
A lot can be done to improve how registers are currently being allocated which will provide even more speed - ups .
Right now there is n’t any tracing being done into DOM methods ( only across pure - JavaScript objects ) – but that is something that will be rectified .
Being able to trace through a DOM method would successfully speed up , not only , math and object - intensive applications ( as it does now ) but also regular DOM manipulation and property access .
Ramification
So what does this all mean ?
It means that JavaScript is no longer confined by the previously - challenging resource of processing power .
With this improvement it ’s leap - frogged any sort of traditional and has gone head - to - head with computationally - powerful languages like C .
I fully expect to see more , massive , projects being written in JavaScript .
Projects that expect the performance gains that we ’re starting to see .
Applications that are number - heavy ( like image manipulation ) or object - heavy ( like relational object structures ) .
One area that I ’m especially excited about is in relation to Canvas .
The primary thing holding back most extensive Canvas development has n’t been rendering – but the processor limitations of the language ( performing the challenging mathematical operations related to vectors , matrices , or collision detection ) .
I expect this area to absolutely explode after the release of Firefox 3.1 as we start to see this work take hold .
Seeing releases like this are absolutely exciting for me .
JavaScript is absolutely the little - language - that - could – continually routing around any of its short - comings and blowing away all of its expectations .
I look forward to using it for many , many , years to come .

Homeland Stupidity

“ Your safety is our priority , ” the Transportation Security Administration web site tells us .
So how does the TSA explain these four ways it ’s keeping air travelers unsafe ?
First , there ’s getting your ticket from the airline .
If you ’re one of the unlucky million people or so whose name matches an entry on the TSA ’s watchlists , you ’re going to have an even stranger experience at the ticket counter .
The TSA has said that airline ticket agents are n’t allowed to tell passengers their name was on the list , or they face fines of $ 25,000 .
The problem , of course , is TSA ca n’t tell the difference between two people with similar names .
Most of us managed this trick before we grew up .
There ’s getting to the checkpoint .
TSA says it ’s going to allow the Registered Traveler program to expand to any interested U.S. airport , and is eliminating the required background check , but at the same time it ’s backing away from the program .
Head idiot Kip Hawley says the background check is duplicative , and the program overall is not “ an effective operational tool ” against terrorists .
So all you get by registering is your personal information taken and stuck in yet another database where it can get lost or stolen , and shorter lines at some airports before you get to the security checkpoint .
Then there ’s the insanity of security screening .
TSA spokeswoman Ellen Howe admits that the agency “ over - hyped ” a story posted on its
Web site about a passenger who built a homemade battery pack to power his DVD player during a flight from Mississippi to Hawaii .
The passenger , described as an engineer , was required to give up the battery pack because running a portable DVD player on external batteries “ could be seen by other passengers as a threat . ”
More likely that other passengers would ask him where to get one of their own .
Here ’s some over - hype :
“ We must treat every suspicious item the same and utilize the tools we have available to make a final determination , ” said Federal Security Director David Wynn .
“ Procedures are in place for a reason and this is a clear indication our workforce is doing a great job . ”
“ But the average person does n’t know what a bomb looks like ; all he knows is what he sees on television and the movies , ” explained the real security expert , Bruce Schneier .
“ And this rule means that all homemade electronics are confiscated , because anything homemade with wires can look like a bomb to someone who does n’t know better .
The rule just does n’t work .
“ And in today ’s passengers - fight - back world , do you think anyone is going to successfully do anything with a fake bomb ? ”
Why should they , when the TSA is so focused on water bottles that it misses real bombs ?
What if someone strips naked , runs up and down the aisles and then tries to open the emergency exit door ?
Or what if someone goes to the lavatory and dies of a heart attack ?
The air marshals will take care of it , right ?
Well , no , they wo n’t , because they were n’t on those flights and they are n’t on your flight either .
Where have all the air marshals gone ?
( In May we reported that air marshals were leaving the agency in droves and the remaining ones being reassigned to short - hop , low - risk flights . )
Back at the loony bin that is Homeland Security headquarters , the TSA is hiring the most unqualified people it can find , such as Sonia Pitt , a new “ transportation security specialist , ” whatever that is .
Pitt , described as a “ belligerent , abusive ” employee , when the I - 35W bridge collapsed a year ago in Minneapolis , Minn. , skipped out and went on an unauthorized trip to D.C. on the taxpayers ’ dime , and a state auditor found she had bilked the state for “ thousands of dollars in excessive compensation for airfare , hotels , mileage and personal cell phone calls , ” the Minneapolis Star - Tribune reported .
Pitt was fired for violating state ethics codes and “ activities that cannot withstand public scrutiny without embarrassment .
. . . do not safeguard the public trust in the integrity of MnDOT , and undermine public trust in the Department . ”
Naturally , as a belligerent , abusive employee who likes to pad the expense account , she ’ll fit right in at the TSA .
( Update : DHS has fired Sonia Pitt after receiving information from Minnesota about the circumstances of her firing there . )
Hopefully you ’ve had an uneventful flight , but if something happens , as it invariably will , just remember , the TSA are the ones who put you in danger .

US Bank Derivative Exposure
Chris Whalen at the Institutional Risk Analyst asks an interesting question : How Much Capital Does a Bank Need ?
The short answer : Alot .
The longer answer depends upon the bank 's derivative exposure .
Chris includes this handy chart to help you figure out just what that cap need might be :
>
Economic Capital is as calculated by IRA .
All figures in $ 000 :

Sources : FDIC / IRA Bank Monitor ; Q1 2008 data shown in “ bank only ” rollup .
WTF ?
$ 90 Trillion dollars derivative exposure for JPMorgan ?
No wonder the Fed " rescue " of Bear Stearns was via JPM -- it was their own derivative exposure that was at risk .

Sources tell us that the upcoming Call of Duty 5 game in development is already playable , and currently going through quality assurance .
Advertisement
Treyarch is also said to be the developer , and the title , we 're told , is set in a WWII Pacific environment and will be using Call of Duty 4's engine , the same engine on which the upcoming James Bond : Quantum of Solace movie game is being built .
Yesterday , on the company 's call to investors , Activision publishing CEO Mike Griffith said CoD5 would be coming to Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , PC and DS , in addition to a return for the franchise to PS2 and Wii for the first time in two years .
LITTLE ROCK ( AP ) 
Unable and unwilling to keep abandoned dogs in a dilapidated shelter , the city of Helena - West Helena is taking strays to a national forest and leaving them on the side of the road .
" They are better off free , " Mayor James Valley said Thursday .
" Pardon the pun , but it was just something that was dogging us .
So it would be easier for us until we get a facility and have a plan that we just not be in the animal shelter business . "
But the St. Francis National
Forest is n't in the animal shelter business , either .
" In the code , it is illegal to release animals , livestock or abandoned personal property on national forest land , " spokeswoman Tracy Farley said .
Valley said the city 's animal shelter was so run down that a regional humane society worker cut its locks last winter and released all the dogs .
The city then temporarily moved its shelter to four uncovered pens at the city sanitation department .
After people complained the animals were still not properly cared for , the mayor decided the animals would be better off in the forest .
The city street director on Wednesday took about 10 dogs to the forest after feeding and watering them .
About three dogs were kept to be put down by a veterinarian , Valley said .
He said the city would need $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 to open a new animal shelter — and also must enforce existing animal - control laws .
" We have a leash law that we 've been trying to work our way into enforcing .
It 's been so lax , " the mayor said .
" People are not buying leashes or tags for the animals .
We could literally pick up every other dog in the city . "
If animal - control officers get a call now , " they 're going to pick the dog up and probably just take them to the other side of town , " Valley said .
" And it 's going to be someone else 's problem .
... or maybe they will take them to the forest . "

Republican nominees John McCain and Sarah Palin have ignored 's request to stop using their song " Barracuda " at political events , CNN reports .
On Tuesday morning ( September 9 ) , the 1977 hit played before McCain and Palin showed up for an outdoor rally in Lebanon , Ohio .
Heart 's Ann and Nancy Wilson initially complained when it was played at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minnesota , before Palin 's appearance last Wednesday and after McCain 's speech on Thursday .
Palin gained the nickname " Sarah Barracuda " while on her high school basketball team , and Republicans are likely using the rock anthem to remind voters of the Alaska governor 's reputation as a tenacious leader .
" The Republican campaign did not ask for permission to use the song , nor would they have been granted that permission , " read a statement from Heart 's camp .
" We have asked the Republican campaign publicly not to use our music .
We hope our wishes will be honored . "
Later , in an e-mail to EW.com , the Wilson sisters said that " Sarah Palin 's views and values in NO WAY represent us as American women .
...
While Heart did not and would not authorize the use of their song at the RNC , there 's irony in Republican strategists ' choice to make use of it there . "
The Republican Party did in fact obtain the necessary license to use the song , which can be played when a venue pays a blanket fee to ASCAP , the organization that protects music copyrights .
While the Wilsons are clearly upset , " Barracuda " co-writer and former Heart guitarist Roger Fisher ( Nancy 's ex ) has a different outlook .
He 's happy to receive the publicity , he told Reuters last week , and he pledged to give part of the royalties from the song 's use to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama 's campaign .

Police officials said that a senior police officer was downgraded after saying that a BMW model car is " black man 's wheels " .
The colleagues of Chris Pretty , an ex-Superintendent , gave him a BMW model car as a present at a party that marked his farewell as chief of training for West Midlands Police .
The party took place in Edgbaston , Birmingham in September of 2007 .
Two police officers criticized the " racist joke " of Mr Pretty , a respected police officer who led an investigation on black - on - black crime .
The officer was brought in front of a misconduct panel .
After the hearing , which took place last week , Mr Pretty was downgraded from Superintendent to Chief Inspector .
Two police officers criticized the " racist joke " of Mr Pretty , a respected police officer who led an investigation on black - on - black crime .
The officer was brought in front of a misconduct panel .
After the hearing , which took place last week , Mr Pretty was downgraded from Superintendent to Chief Inspector .
Anti-racism campaigners were glad of the final results provided by the misconduct panel .
" These particular comments made by a high - ranking police officer merely add fuel to the myth that BMWs are only driven by black criminals .
If West Midlands Police have seen fit to make an example of this officer and discipline him then I welcome that .
But I think the problem of institutional racism within the police force is a deep - rooted one and reflected across society .
It is not going to be conquered overnight , " said Bini Brown , a representative of the Birmingham - based African Caribbean Self Help Organization .
One of the sources said : " Chris collects model cars and he was given one as a leaving present .
He was a former captain in the army and is into hunting and shooting , but toy cars are his main hobby .
When he opened the miniature BMW he joked : " Oh , Black Man 's Wheels . "
It was just a joke .
Cops seem to spend more time investigating each other these days than they do catching criminals .
It 's a complete over - reaction .
They 're obviously more interested in political correctness than letting officers get on with the job of tackling crooks . "
Previously the members of Birmingham 's black community applauded the officer .
There was a time when he led Operation Ventara of West Midlands Police .
They investigated a black - on - black crime .
He was successful in bringing witnesses forward for cases of murder .
West Midlands Police passed on the complaints about Pretty 's racist joke to the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
" He has been dealt with in the appropriate manner .
West Midlands
Police expects the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from all its officers and staff and has robust procedures in place to deal with behavior which falls outside those standards , " outlined a force spokesman .

Let 's say for some reason someone has his or her caller ID blocked and is calling you all the time .
Let 's then say you really want to know who that person is for , you know , whatever reason -- not that we'd know anything about that .
Some crafty phreaker types have come up with a way to do this using an enterprise - spec asterisk box and a SIP trunk provider .
In a demonstration video , a hacker tweaks said asterisk box with some new configurations to strip out privacy flags , forward the call to another number , and ultimately reveal caller ID information which , surprisingly , is still available .
This is n't meant to be easy , but if the terms " prepend , " " SIP trunk , " and " asterisk box " do n't scare you away , go ahead and watch the video after the break .

Warren and Pam Adams lost a house to Hurricane Rita in 2005 , so it seems they'd be relieved to learn their new home withstood Hurricane Ike .
But not when their house is the only one still standing in their section of Gilchrist , Texas .
Ike 's storm surge last week devastated the Bolivar Peninsula town , flattening most of the roughly 200 homes there .
The couple 's yellow house at the beach -- supported 14 feet off the ground by wooden columns -- was the only house on Gilchrist 's Gulf Coast side not to be flattened .

BROOKVILLE --
A quaint western Pennsylvania town and one of its churches are throwing the books at one another .
For Brookville , a town of 4,000 people , the book is the law .
Solicitor Stephen French has taken the church to court for housing the homeless in a commercial district , which he says violates the borough 's zoning regulations .
But the Rev. Jack Wisor , who heads the First Apostles Doctrine Church , says the book he follows -- the Bible -- requires him to help the needy .
So far , the borough -- which is about 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh -- has prevailed .
In August , a district judge fined Wisor $ 500 for allowing three homeless men to live in the 111 - year - old church parsonage .
" I personally think the work he does is wonderful , " French said of Wisor .
" But we 're not going to allow someone to violate the zoning laws because they do it in the name of Jesus Christ . "
Wisor appealed to the Jefferson County Common Pleas Court .
A hearing is scheduled for November .
" When we present the truth and all of the evidence is in order , we know that God is going to be victorious , " the pastor told the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette .
" We should be permitted to have missionaries , guests or anyone to stay in the parsonage under our rights of religious belief .
" Our concern is , what gives them the right to come in and tell you who you can and cannot keep in your home ? "
Wisor said .

Rating : 4 stars A tasty and flavorful restaurant - quality dish .
Do n't listen to some of the other reviewers : some did things to make a sauce / gravy ; this dish is n't supposed to have a gravy .
( Look at the picture I submitted . )
But the concerns about drying out the potatoes and cauliflower are justified .
To solve this , during the times when one is supposed to cook with the pan covered , make sure there is a little water at the bottom of the pan .
Every few minutes uncover and add a little water .
This makes sure everything stays damp and steams as it cooks .
I found it necessary to steam for an extra 5 - 10 minutes to cook the potatoes sufficiently .
Also , I used 50 % more spices than listed .
Salt I added to taste * at the end* , not where recommended in the recipe .
( How would one decide if something tastes right before the vegetables are done cooking ? )
Finally , I forgot about the cilantro and did n't miss it .

Rating : 5 stars I made this according to the directions , but it seemed so dry ...
I added a small can of coconut milk and a diced tomatoe at the end of the cook time , and then simmered an additional 8 minutes or so .
The result was delicious !
I think the tomatoe and coconut milk should really be included in the recipe .
Also , I used curry and a small amount of cumin instead of tumeric .

Rating : 4 stars I 've made this a couple times and it turns out pretty good .
I like this recipe because it's not as involved as recipes for aloo gobi in my Indian cookbooks .
What is with the coconut milk though ?
If you want traditional aloo gobi , stop taking one reviewer 's suggestion and do n't add coconut milk .
It 's not part of this dish , and if you add it , you 're making something completely different , and most likely , something sweet .
Mustard seeds are always a great addition and the more cilantro the better , but if you find that it 's too dry , add a 1/ 2 cup of crushed tomatoes and it will be perfect !

This is a very basic version of the traditional Aloo Gobi recipe .
I did not find it any drier than other versions of this dish .
It is supposed to be very dry ; not all Indian recipies are intended to have a sauce !!
I found the flavor however to be fairly bland though not disagreeable .
This is a minimal recipe that would be good to use on a day - to - day basis not for company .
The exclusion of onions is also regrettable since that eliminates a lot of the traditional flavor .
the paprika is a little different from other Aloo Gobi versions I have tried but I would probably use less of it and add a little more zing via green chili peppers in my own version .

This dish is excellent with a few changes .
Note that this recipe has no liquids which will becomes too dry .
I followed the recipe up to the adding of the potatoes and seasoning but instead of cooking 5 - 7 minutes I put it in my crock - pot with 1 / 2 cup vegetable broth and a can of stewed tomatoes ( because I did n't have diced tomatoes ) .
Cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours ( after the first 30 minutes I added the Cauliflower stirring to saturate with the spices .
I added a little more milk ( maybe 1/4 cup or less ) after 2 hrs and stirred .
The cooking time will depend on how big you cut the potatoes I cubed them about 1 - 2 " wide .
I chose the crock - pot method because I was going to be busy preparing the Chicken Tikka Masala to serve with it .
This turned out delicious !!!
my picky teenager loved both dishes .

Although I cook with minimal oil I will have to say that this recipe requires more than 1 Tbsp as there is quite a lot of cauliflower .
A couple of suggestions - cut the potatoes smaller than the cauliflower as they take longer to cook .
Cover and cook over slow heat .
Add cilantro after the vegetables have cooked and allow to heat through .
This allows the fresh flavour to remain .

Aloo is meant to be dry - it is not a curry so pls do n't follow other reviews of adding coconut milk .

The recipe is really good but it 's missing some things .
First off it was really dry and it should really have some curry to it .
I realized that the colour was n't catching on to all of the cauliflower ... just the tops and bottoms .
I used half of a big cauliflower which might have been more than a pound .
I added tomatoes ( which you really should put in ) and one cup of water .
The water made it lose a bit of flavour and it was still dry .
So after reading the other reviews I added 1/2 can coconut milk and that made a good curry base .
Also I did n't have cilantro so I used parsley instead which worked well .
In total I put in twice the amount of spices that the recipe asked for for the half a cauliflower I used .
This makes the curry rich and flavourful .
You need to simmer the dish on low for about 20 minutes longer as well .
In the end ... it turned out great !

My family and I thought this was delicious .
I added about 1/3 cup half and half like another reviewer and also 1 can of diced tomatoes and the remainder of a bag of peas .
Tasted great .
The only change I would make would be to add the garam masala just about 5 minutes before it 's done cooking otherwise it makes the dish taste a little bitter .
A little lemon juice can cure the bitterness though !

64 - year - old woman 's death linked to COVID cluster
A 64 - year - old woman who was not a member of the church as died of COVID - 19 .
Officials said her death is linked to the Horseheads church cluster .
" I am extremely disappointed that the courts have granted Abu Qatada bail , albeit with very strict conditions , " she said .
An eight - page dossier on the conditions of his bail , made public on Tuesday by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission ( SIAC ) , stated that he would be fitted with an electronic cuff , placed under surveillance and on 22 - hour - a - day house arrest in his West London home .
He was also banned from associating with a long list of named people , including Osama bin Laden , his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri and Rachid Ramda , who was convicted in France of masterminding a series of bombings in 1995 .
Abu Hamza , another firebrand preacher convicted of inciting hatred at a London mosque , was also named .
In addition , Abu Qatada would not be allowed to attend any mosques and was banned from using any communications equipment such as mobile phones , computers or access to the internet .
Abu Qatada won a lengthy appeal against his extradition from Britain to Jordan in April and at the time , the Home Office Minister , Tony McNulty , pledged the ruling would be appealed and he would not be released .
Described by SIAC as a " truly dangerous individual " who has played a central role in major terrorist activities associated with al - Qaeda , Abu Qatada has , in his absence , been convicted twice in Jordan for conspiracy to carry out bomb attacks on two hotels in Amman in 1998 and for providing finance and advice for bomb attacks in Jordan planned to coincide with the millennium .
These convictions were used by his lawyers to argue against extradition in the Court of Appeal on the basis that he could not get a fair trial in his home country .
According to the British Home Office , between 1995 and 1999 , Abu Qatada used a Baker Street , central London social club known as the Four Feathers to oversee fatwas or religious demands to kill non-believers .
He is said to have been a seminal influence on September 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta , who had several Abu Qatada videos in his German flat , and he was said to have advised Rachid Ramda , jailed in France for financing the bombing of the Paris Metro in 1995 and Djamel Beghal , jailed in France for plotting to blow up the American embassy in Paris .
Spanish authorities believe him to be an associate of Abu Dahdah , who ran terrorist safe houses in Spain and was known to be an associate of the Algerian Abu Doha , who was arrested in the UK seven years ago in connection with a planned attack on Los Angeles International Airport .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British confectioner Cadbury has recalled all of its Chinese - made candy products over fears that they may be contaminated with the chemical melamine , a company statement said Monday .
" The products that are affected by this withdrawal include a range of Cadbury chocolate products and Choclairs , all produced in our Beijing plant , " Cadbury said in a statement .
Some or all of the products were exported to Taiwan , Hong Kong , Australia , the Pacific island of Nauru and Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean , according to the company .
Cadbury said that it is implementing new food safety and quality checks at its Beijing plant and that fresh candies will be manufactured .
The candy maker is the latest company to get caught up in China 's tainted - milk scandal .
Melamine was first found in powdered infant formula but has since been traced to dozens of other products .
Nearly 53,000 children in China have been sickened by the formula or other products containing melamine .
Four babies have died , and five Hong Kong children have suffered melamine - related illnesses .
Dozens of countries have banned or recalled Chinese milk products .
Watch how scare affects companies outside China »
Chinese police have arrested 40 people in the tainted - milk scandal , including 22 announced Monday in northern China 's Hebei province .
Nineteen of those were managers of pastures , breeding farms and milk - purchasing stations , the Xinhua news agency reported , citing a panel investigating the case .
Authorities say they raided 41 locations in Hebei and seized 490 pounds ( 222 kilograms ) of melamine .
Eighteen arrests were announced earlier .
They include two brothers who face charges of selling contaminated milk .
The brothers could face death if convicted , according to China Daily , a state - run newspaper .
The raw milk used to produce powdered baby formula had been watered down , and the chemical melamine was added to fool quality checks , the newspaper said .
Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates , wood adhesives , fabric coatings , ceiling tiles and flame retardants .
Some Chinese dairy plants have added it to milk products to make it seem to have a higher protein level .
Melamine is the same industrial contaminant from China that poisoned and killed thousands of U.S. dogs and cats last year .
Health experts say that ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones , urinary tract ulcers , and eye and skin irritation .
It also robs infants of much - needed nutrition .
The following 11 products are included in the recall , according to Hong Kong 's Centre for Food Safety :
• Cadbury Dark Chocette , 45 grams .
• Cadbury Dark Chocette , 80 grams .
• Cadbury Eclairs , 180 grams .
• Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate Pumpkin , 150 grams .

Exposed : McCain team includes 83 Wall Street lobbyists John Byrne
Published : Wednesday September 17 , 2008
Print This Email This As Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) rails against Wall Street while concurrently benefiting from its largesse , some journalists are getting tired .
David Corn -- an investigative reporter formerly with The Nation and currently reporting for Mother Jones -- has printed a list of 83 Wall Street lobbyists he says are working for or have bundled contributions for McCain .
The Democratic National Committee has previously accused McCain of using 177 lobbyists either as campaign aides , advisers or fundraisers .
Corn notes that former Sen. Phil Gramm , the Arizona senator 's onetime campaign chairman and economic adviser , slipped into law a provision that kept credit default swaps unregulated , dramatically kindling to the current financial fires .
" Of those 177 lobbyists , according to a Mother Jones review of Senate and House records , at least 83 have in recent years lobbied for the financial industry McCain now attacks , " Corn writes .
" These are high - paid influence - peddlers who have been working the corridors of the nation 's capital to win favors and special treatment for investment banks , securities firms , hedge funds , accounting outfits , and insurance companies .
Their clients have included AIG , the newest symbol of corporate excess ; Lehman Brothers , which filed for bankruptcy on Monday sending the stock market into a tailspin ; Merrill Lynch , which was bought out by Bank of America this week ; and Washington Mutual , the banking giant that could be the next to fall .
" Among these 83 lobbyists are McCain 's chief political adviser , Charlie Black ( JP Morgan , Washington Mutual Bank , Freddie Mac , Mortgage Bankers Association of America ) ; McCain 's national finance co-chairman , Wayne Berman ( AIG , Blackstone , Credit Suisse , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac ) ; the campaign 's congressional liaison , John Green ( Carlyle Group , Citigroup , Icahn Associates , Fannie Mae ) ; McCain 's veep vetter , Arthur Culvahouse ( Fannie Mae ) ; and McCain 's transition planning chief , William Timmons Sr. ( Citigroup , Freddie Mac , Vanguard Group ) . "
Obama 's anti-lobbyist rhetoric , meanwhile , has irked other reporters , among them Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff .
Isikoff noted that Obama 's chief strategist , David Axelrod , worked for a firm that hoodwinked Illinois consumers by convincing them a California - style crises would befall them unless they increased electric rates .
Axelrod adamantly denied the charge .
" I 've never lobbied anybody in my life , " he said .
" I 've never talked to any public official on behalf of a corporate client . "
Obama also put James Johnson , the former CEO of Fannie Mae , on his vice presidential search committee team .
Johnson resigned in June .
The full McCain list is printed below .

John McCain wrapped up the Republican convention tonight by reaching out beyond the party faithful to the independents who will determine in November whether he or Barack Obama is the next occupant of the White House .
After formally accepting the Republican presidential nomination , he used his prime - time speech to try to steal from his Democratic rival the theme of change , a potent message in an election year in which voters are disillusioned with the George Bush presidency , the Iraq war and the state of the economy .
" Let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second Washington crowd : change is coming , " he said .
Warming to his theme of shaking up Washington , McCain appeared to borrow a phrase from the British prime minister John Major 's last years in power saying he would take the Republican " back to basics " .
Touching on another theme popular with independents , he promised to end the " constant partisan rancour " that has left Washington so often deadlocked .
McCain , the self - styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five - minute standing ovation at the start of his 50 - minute speech and again at the end , as confetti and 200,000 balloons floated from the ceiling , the traditional convention finish .
But , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of Obama in Denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , Sarah Palin .
Some of the loudest cheers of the night were when Palin , the new darling of the Republican party , joined him at the end .
Although the organisers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic .
McCain devoted a large part of his speech to one of his biggest selling points , the period that turned him into an American hero , his five years in a Hanoi jail after his plane crashed on a bombing mission .
As an admiral 's son , he was offered the chance of early release but turned it down , refusing preferential treatment .
The passage on his prison years , which seldom fails to resonate with Americans , earned him four standing ovations , to chants of " USA , USA " .
His time in jail , he said , turned him into a super - patriot .
" I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else 's … I was never the same again .
I was n't my own man anymore .
I was my country's . "
The speech was a high point for McCain , aged 72 , who was watched by his mother , Roberta , aged 96 , and comes a year after he almost had to pull out of the Republican nomination with his campaign close to bankruptcy .
McCain , ignoring the sustained personal - and frequently misleading - attacks on Obama at the convention , chose to present himself as above such tactics , saying he admired his Democratic rival for his achievement in winning his party 's nomination .
" Despite our differences , much more unites us than divides us , " he said , to applause .
" We are fellow Americans , an association that means more to me than any other . "
McCain , aware of his limitations as a speaker , attempted to recreate the intimacy of the townhall meetings with which he is more comfortable by placing the podium in the middle of the audience , but it was a failed experiment , with his delivery as deadening as ever .
The start of his speech was briefly marred by protesters , including one from military veterans opposed to him .
He used the convention to try to win over the millions watching at home with his promise of a bipartisan approach to politics , saying he had a proven record of working with Democrats in the Senate , often in the face of anger from fellow Republicans .
" I have the record and the scars to prove it .
Senator Obama does not , " McCain said .
He is friends with many Democratic senators and has sponsored various bipartisan initiatives in the Senate , including a bill to ease illegal immigration along with the Democrat Ted Kennedy , angering Republicans .
Forseeing a McCain presidency he said : " I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me .
And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability . "
But pointing to other differences with the Democratic nominee , he said there was a gap between them on tax cuts , foreign policy - particularly Iraq - and drilling for oil in US waters .
He issued a warning to Russia over the conflict in Georgia .
" We can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people , " he said .
One of the loudest ovations he received all night was when he spoke about Palin .
" I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington .
And let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second Washington crowd : change is coming , " McCain said .

The Justice Department has opened a formal antitrust investigation into a deal struck last month that would allow Google to provide some search advertising for Yahoo , according to sources familiar with the inquiry .
Investigators are planning to demand documents not only from Google and Yahoo , but also from other large companies in the Internet and media industries , said the sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing .
Google and Yahoo officials have said since the deal 's announcement that they would delay its implementation for a voluntary Justice Department review .
But a formal investigation signals that the department may have found some cause for concern .

Lawyers familiar with similar investigations said that the kind of legal requests being issued by the Justice Department in this case - " civil investigative demands " - are not used for routine matters .
" They do n't do it without having identified significant issues , " said M.J. Moltenbrey , a Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer lawyer who was director of civil nonmerger enforcement in the Justice Department 's antitrust division in the 1990s .
" It involves approval at higher levels within the antitrust division . "
" It does n't mean they have drawn any conclusions , " said Peter Guryan , a partner with Fried Frank and formerly an antitrust lawyer in the Justice Department .
But " it is a significant step beyond a request for voluntary information , " he said .
" It demonstrates that the DOJ clearly has questions . "
Officials with Google and Yahoo declined to comment on whether they have received any formal investigative demands or on any details about their discussions with the Justice Department .
Officials with the Justice Department also declined to comment .
The investigation arises as a high - stakes fight is under way to control Internet advertising , and , by extension , the content it supports .
Mountain View's Google , according to its competitors and critics , could gain a monopoly in Internet advertising if the deal with Sunnyvale 's Yahoo is permitted .
One of the largest chunks of Internet advertising today is search advertising , or the ads that run alongside Internet search results delivered by the major search engines : Google , Yahoo and Microsoft .
Google 's is the dominant search engine , while Yahoo's and Microsoft 's efforts run a distant second and third .
Under the Google - Yahoo deal , announced June 12 , Google would provide search advertising to Yahoo for some Yahoo searches in the United States and Canada .
The two would share the advertising revenue , with Yahoo estimated to receive as much as $ 800 million annually from the agreement .
By proposing to unite the two biggest players in search advertising , however , the agreement quickly aroused critics who said the move would allow Google to become a monopoly for advertising in the new medium .
Shortly after the announcement , the heads of key subcommittees in the House and the Senate reiterated their intentions to look into the Google - Yahoo arrangement .
Even so , attorneys for Google have appeared confident that they could convince Department of Justice reviewers , as well as congressional committees , that the deal would be good for consumers .
" We do feel that it is a pro-competitive deal , " said Google 's general counsel , Kent Walker .
In Google 's view , consumers and advertisers would benefit from the deal because Google 's method of determining what ads to place beside a search query is the best in the industry .
SARAJEVO , Bosnia - Herzegovina ( CNN ) --
The outbreak of war seemed like a joke to Jasmina , then just 19 years old .
She dreamed of being an economist and says she played with her toddler son and baby daughter as if they were toys .
Jasmina says she was raped repeatedly during the rule of Radovan Karadzic : " Every day we were raped . "
But in April 1992 , the Serb soldiers took over her city of Bijeljina , in northeast Bosnia near the border with Serbia , and began to kill , torture and terrorize the Muslims there in a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing .
" Whole families were disappearing during the night .
Sometimes we could see their bodies in the gardens , sometimes not even that , " Jasmina said .
" The men from my family were beaten up the first day .
...
My mother just disappeared .
I never found out what happened . "
Paramilitaries loyal to Arkan , the Serbian ultranationalist later indicted for crimes against humanity , came to the home Jasmina shared with her husband and extended family to search for valuables and weapons .
When they found no guns they started beating her husband , said Jasmina who asked CNN not to use her last name to protect her children .
" Then they started torturing me .
I lost consciousness .
When I woke up , I was totally naked and covered in blood , and my sister - in - law was also naked and covered in blood .
... I knew I had been raped , and my sister - in - law , too . "
In a corner , she saw her mother - in - law , holding her children and crying .
" That same day we were locked in our house .
That was the worst , the worst period of my whole life .
That 's when it started .
" Every day we were raped .
Not only in the house -- they would also take us to the front line for the soldiers to torture us .
Then again in the house , in front of the children , " Jasmina said through a translator , remembering the 10 other women who were brutalized with her .
" I was in such a bad condition that sometimes I could n't even recognize my own children .
Even though I was in a very bad physical condition they had no mercy at all .
They raped me every day .
They took me to the soldiers and back to that house .
" The only conversation we had was when I was begging them to kill me .
That 's when they laughed .
Their response was ' we do n't need you dead . ' "
Once at the front line , there were female soldiers who tortured her with a bottle and then slashed at her throat and wrist when it broke .
Then the troops cut one of her breasts with a bayonet , said Jasmina , now looking older than her 35 years .
" It lasted for a year .
Every day .
...
Not all the women survived . "
Tens of thousands of women were raped in Bosnia and the other parts of the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 1994 during the rule of Radovan Karadzic , according to estimates by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe .
See a timeline of Karadzic 's rule »
Karadzic was captured this week after years on the run and now will face war crimes charges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia .
The tribunal , set up to try war crimes suspects , established for the first time that rape was a crime against humanity and that rape was " used by members of the Bosnian Serb armed forces as an instrument of terror . "
For Jasmina , some relief came one day in 1993 when a familiar face , an older Serb who had been a friend of her parents , appeared at the house where she was being kept .
Jasmina was told he had bought her as a prostitute but , once in a car with him , the man said he was saving her .
" I owe this to your parents , " he said .
He drove Jasmina and her children to the front lines , gave something to the Serb soldiers there and directed her toward the Bosnian position , saying , " now you are free to go . "
" I was very weak .
I weighed only 45 kilos [ 99 pounds ] .
I carried both my children for more than a kilometer to the Bosnian side . "
Jasmina was safe but scarred .
" I felt ashamed .
I wanted to die , to disappear somehow .
I could n't take care of my children ; others did that .
I just did n't have the strength or the will . "
A new low came when doctors began to treat her in one of the refugee centers around the city of Tuzla .
" They discovered that I was pregnant , six months pregnant , and I did n't know that .
It was too late for any abortion , but I kept saying I did n't want that child . "
The gynecologist pleaded with Jasmina to have the child and give it up for adoption , saying it was too dangerous to try anything else .
But that was no option for Jasmina .
" I did n't want to hear about that , about giving birth to that child at all . "
Finally , medics said they could try to abort the child but it was a very risky operation that only one in 100 women would survive .
" I begged them to do it , " Jasmina said , pausing to remember an 18 - year - old girl who had the same operation on the same day as her and died .
Jasmina herself continues to have gynecological health problems stemming from her abuse .
Months later , her husband arrived at the same refugee center after managing to escape a camp in Serbia .
A man he broke out with was killed by a mine .
" It was such a difficult moment for me .
I was n't even sure if I wanted him to be dead or alive .
I knew that he knew what had happened to me , so it was very , very difficult for me , " Jasmina said .
" I thought he was going to leave me and take my children because of everything that happened .
But he told me he was not going to ask me about anything .
And that he also went through terrible things himself , so he did n't want to discuss anything . "
Yet still she says she cannot look her husband in the eye .
Jasmina said she was unable to talk to the therapists in Tuzla and tried to kill herself in 1995 , the first of three suicide attempts .
" I will never be OK , " she said , adding that she believes God kept her alive for a reason .
She now lives in a modestly furnished apartment in a tower block in Sarajevo , the capital of Bosnia - Herzegovina .
She has been there since 2001 with her husband and children .
Her dreams now are for her children .
She believes it 's crucial she give them some stability but says that 's impossible when she does n't know from day to day whether she will be evicted .
She does not own the apartment , and all property must be returned to rightful owners under the terms of an annex to the U.S. - brokered peace agreement that ended the war .
The same pact allows for the return of all refugees and displaced people -- more than half of the country 's people left their homes during the war , according to the International Organization for Migration -- and the re-establishment of the mixed ethnic communities that had lived peacefully for centuries before the war .
The Office of the High Representative for Bosnia - Herzegovina , an international body set up to oversee the implementation of the peace agreements , says almost all property rights have been restored .
But it is impossible to say how many people have gone home and how many have sold their houses , leaving cities and towns like Bijeljina " ethnically cleansed , " as the warmongers had planned .
A law enacted in September 2006 does include a section that says homes should be provided for victims of sexual torture during the war .
It is not clear who should implement the act , and there is no agency making sure the law is enforced , according to the Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees .
Meanwhile , authorities say Jasmina should return to her mother - in - law 's rebuilt house in Bijeljina .
But she says she will never go back to the place where she lost 39 members of her family and where her abuse began .
It is a fear shared by other women , according to Alisa Muratcaus , the president of the Association of Concentration Camp Survivors -- Canton Sarajevo -- a group that offers classes and other support to Jasmina and 1,200 other women across the capital , including 150 victims of mass rape .
" Many of our members must deal with the realities of return .
Not all members are able psychologically to return to regions in which they suffered such extreme human rights abuses , " she said .
" No one raped woman has returned to their pre-war houses , since it is immoral and inhuman to request their return while the war criminals who tortured them are still free and live in these regions . "
The Sarajevo municipality that owns Jasmina 's apartment says that it does not plan to evict her and that any such directive would come from the Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees .
Saliha Djuderija , head of the Ministry 's Department of Human Rights , said she was aware of victims who could not face returning to the places where they were tortured and was working on a solution .
In the past couple of years , between 15 and 20 women have been given somewhere to live , but lack of funding is restricting the help that can be given .
Priority was given to women who testified against their attackers , and Jasmina is not in that group , as her case is still unsolved .
But if her future is in doubt , Jasmina 's mind is made up .
" I 'm not going to take my children to Bijeljina .
I told my children when I die , do n't take my bones to Bijeljina .
I do n't want to hear about Bijeljina .
It does n't exist for me , " she said , flashing anger for the first time in a lengthy interview .
Then she shows a picture of her daughter , a beautiful young woman , but even that causes Jasmina pain as she remembers how the soldiers picked her out .
" I was beautiful once .
It cost me my life . "

NASHVILLE , Tenn . --
Nashville police were asked to search for Vince Young on Monday evening after family members placed a call to the Tennessee Titans informing them of their concern about the quarterback 's state of mind .
According to Nashville Metro Police spokesman Don Aaron , Young " abruptly " left his home in Williamson County about 7 p.m. Monday without his cell phone .
Those with him at his home , including family members , were " concerned with his emotional well - being , " Aaron said .
Police issued a bulletin to all on - duty officers to be on the lookout for Young , and negotiators were placed on standby , a procedure that is common in such situations , Aaron said .
Someone contacted coach Jeff Fisher out of concern for Young , and Fisher contacted the police department , police said .
" I was given some information from people that were close to him late afternoon , early evening that was quite honestly very concerning to me .
I 'm not going to go into specifics , but it was concerning to me , " Fisher said .
In a statement , the Titans said that the smart move was to contact authorities .
" Not having all the facts available to us and approaching the matter prudently , we contacted Metro Police to make them aware of the situation and asked for their assistance in locating Vince , " the statement said .
" He was located at a friend 's house , where we made contact with him .
" He then came to the practice facility , where it was determined that those initial concerns by his friends and family were unfounded and he returned home without incident , " the Titans said .
Young left the facility by himself in his own vehicle after speaking with Fisher and officers , police said .
Details were first reported on the Web site of WKRN - TV in Nashville , an ABC affiliate .
Later Tuesday , Young 's agent told The Associated Press there was no need for concern because Young had been at a friend 's house watching football and eating chicken wings .
" When people were worried about him , I was on the phone talking to him , " agent Major Adams said .
" I did n't know there was any confusion about where he was as if he was missing or whatever .
He just said , ' Hey , I 'm over here watching the game . '
Then I start getting all these frantic calls . "
Adams spoke while on his way to learn the test results on Young 's knee , AP reported .
Young hurt his knee in Sunday 's season opener .
Aaron said there was an unloaded handgun in the glove compartment of Young 's vehicle .
But as it is not against the law in Tennessee to transport an unloaded firearm with no ammunition present , it was not an issue for the police department , he said .
He could not say whether the gun was registered because it was not traced .
Young was booed in Sunday 's victory over Jacksonville and did not finish the game because of an injury to his left knee .
The Titans said on Tuesday that he has a sprain of the medial collateral ligament , but the team did not set a timetable for his return .
ESPN's Chris Mortensen reported on Sunday that Young will miss two to four weeks .
After throwing an interception in the fourth quarter , Young was late to join the offense for its next series , creating speculation that he tried to take himself out of the game after throwing what was his second pick .
He sat on the bench after that interception , seemingly unmoved by players and coaches who tried to console him , often holding his head in his hands .
Fisher explained Monday that the issue was tightness in Young 's hamstring and that there was n't clear communication on the sideline about his ability to return to the field .
Young did return , but he injured his knee four plays later .
Some , including his mother , question Young 's desire to return to the game after the recent incidents .
" What would you think , if you were tired of being ridiculed and persecuted and talked about and not being treated very well , what would you do ?
What kind of decision would you make ? ''
Young 's mother Felecia Young told The Nashville Tennesssean on Tuesday .
" He may not want to deal with it [ all ] , but you have to get to that point before you make that decision first .
" But we 're not talking about football right now .
We 're talking about what would make him happy , and that is the most important thing .
...
You do n't want people to be hurting like he is .
But it is a growing - up process , and he will eventually come out like gold no matter what .
But Vince is going to be OK .
We are just going to try and give him some space . "
Veteran Kerry Collins is the only other quarterback on the roster , but the Titans agreed to terms with free - agent quarterback Chris Simms on Tuesday .
Simms was flying to Nashville on Tuesday night after visiting Kansas City earlier in the day .
Tennessee had worked out Quinn Gray on Tuesday .
The team also was looking at QB Joey Harrington and a handful of receivers , including Glenn Martinez and Chad Jackson .

It ’s always a little disconcerting  and even irritating  when stars at awards shows , dripping in Chopard jewelry and self - regard , try to banter about current events .
But there is at least one reassuring point to it : if television actors feel free to make light of dark events then things must not yet be that bad .
It ’s when comedians stay silent that you know things are really dire  think of the frothy escapist Busby Berkeley musicals and screwball comedies that distracted audiences during the Great Depression .
By that standard , then , Sunday night ’s 60th Primetime Emmy Awards were not all that reassuring .
The funniest stars there  Stephen Colbert , Ricky Gervais and Steve Martin  were very funny but did n’t make any jokes about the looming financial crisis .
Even Alec Baldwin , not known for restraint , held back .
Tina
Fey did , though , thank NBC for sticking with her show despite “ the turkey burger economy . ”

IMG MGMT : 20 Archetypes
The Stanford Bunny .
Three - dimensionally scanned from this terra cotta garden decoration in 1994 , the Bunny model has since become one of the most commonly used tests for a wide variety of 3D research projects
[ Editors note : IMG MGMT is an artist essay series highlighting the diversity of curatorial processes within the art making practice .
Kevin Zucker , today ’s invited artist is represented by Greenberg Van Doren in New York .
He has had numerous solo exhibitions internationally , most recently Standards and Anomalies at Arario Beijing , where he showed work that incorporated imagery discussed in this post .
His next project will be a two - person show with Hilary Berseth at Eleven Rivington ( NY ) in October . ]
“ These are the archetypes of a new world .
They do n’t need you or me .
They ’re representation for machines . ” 
I ’ve been collecting documentation of objects and images used in the development and testing of digital imaging and 3D modelingtechnologies for a few years , and have thousands of them stashed on a hard drive and a list of links to databases with literally hundreds of thousands more .
The twenty presented here are representative highlights that I think epitomize the inscrutability , banality , anachronism , and the straightforwardly artless presentation that characterize most of the collection .
Those qualities , contrasted with the weird aura possessed by these analog “ originals ” of digital representation , make for the unsteady balance of gravity and absurdity that first got me interested in collecting them .
While the “ end user ” rarely sees any of these images or objects , a handful of them ( Lena , the mandrill , the Utah Teapot ( all below ) , the Stanford Bunny ( above ) and the Cornell Box ( below ) ) are well known to the point of being iconic within the digital imaging research community .
They have even become the subjects of inside jokes between programmers and animators : 3D models of the Utah Teapot are hidden in Pixar ’s Toy Story , a screensaver that comes as part of Microsoft Windows , and the Simpsons episode where Homer stumbles into a computer - generated “ Third Dimension ”
The Utah Teapot .
Modeled in 1975 from this original , the Teapot has become another standard test object used in a very wide variety of 3D applications
Lena .
Scanned in 1973 , The Lena image has since become the most widely used standard test for a variety of image processing applications
The Cornell Box .
A physical model photographed under controlled lighting conditions , the box is intended to be used as a standard for comparison when judging the accuracy of lighting in 3D renderings
The Mandrill .
Another very widely used test used for image analysis and computer vision research
Lena , probably the best known of all of these images because of its ubiquity as a standard quality test , is the face of Playboy “ Playmate of the Month ” Lena Sjooblom , originally cropped from the centerfold in 1973 by engineers at USC .
It is still in wide use today in spite of technological advances , past controversies over copyright , and ongoing questions about the politics of its source and content .
The centerfold source of the Lena image .

The rest of the images and objects shown here are more obscure , taken from data sets that are freely distributed for research purposes .
Some of their applications include : image quality tests ; benchmarks for the measurement of processing performance ; hardware , software and printer self - tests ; the development of synthetic lighting techniques for rendering 3D graphics and animation ; statistical shape analysis ; the modeling of traffic patterns , and samples for training facial recognition software and robotic / machine vision .
[ From the top left ]

These fields of research have developed rapidly and become important influences on our culture .
Virtually everything produced for the mass market is now designed in 3D software that made use of a Bunny or Teapot test model at some point in its conception .
From the compression of the jpegs we see online to the CAD software used to design the monitors we view them on , the results of research using these test images and objects have been seamlessly integrated into many aspects of daily life .
An image from a standard stereoscopic vision test set
A Standard test image
If you have any inclination toward science fiction , it ’s appealing to view the realm of 3D modeling and digital representation as a discrete and clearly defined universe , a parallel reality to our own .
In that universe , the objects and images shown here would constitute some of the Platonic forms upon which everything else was based .
Even if that sounds overstated , it ’s safe to say that the archetypal images and objects that come from our analog world ( except for the “ as used ” images above , the photographs shown here are straightforward documentation of things from the physical world ) structure a digital domain that in turn exerts an influence on the way we see and make things .
Another image from a standard stereoscopic vision test set
From the IMM face database .
Images from this database are used for testing and development of software for applications like facial recognition and character modeling
While the researchers ’ original choice of some of these images as standards may seem arbitrary or eccentric , it ’s important to remember that they were never intended to function as representation in the normal sense of the word ; they are n’t meant to communicate something about the world we live in .
In most cases , their selection was a function of convenience paired with the image ’s appropriateness for testing very specific software or hardware capabilities .
For example , Greg Turk , who 3D - scanned the Stanford Bunny in 1994 , bought it from a local Palo Alto home and garden supply store because the terra cotta material was “ red and diffuse ”  and its geometry was not particularly complex .
The Lena photo was scanned because the engineers had been looking for an image of a face that was “ glossy to ensure good output dynamic range , ”  and “ just then , somebody happened to walk in with a recent issue of Playboy . ” 

Image from hand sequence data set used in statistical shape analysis
Standard test image used for image analysis and computer vision testing
Image from a standard stereoscopic vision test set
These objects and images ( and others like them ) have a profound but hidden impact as the building blocks of an increasingly complex vocabulary of digital forms .
As future developments in imaging technologies expand on their current capacities , these sorts of mundane archetypes will stay , at least metaphorically , ingrained at their basic levels .
In the same way that the 19th century pop song “ Daisy Bell ” remained at the core of the “ dying ” HAL ‘s regressing memory in 2001 , the visual artifacts shown here will remain part of the evolutionary memory embedded in the methods machines use to process and describe visual information .

Tux3 , a Versioning Filesystem Date Wed , 23 Jul 2008 13:49:13 - 0700
Hi all ,
Since everybody seems to be having fun building new filesystems these
days , I thought I should join the party .
Tux3 is the spiritual and
moral successor of Tux2 , the most famous filesystem that was never
released .
[1 ]
In the ten years since Tux2 was prototyped on Linux
2.2.13 we have all learned a thing or two about filesystem design .
Tux3
is a write anywhere , atomic commit , btree based versioning filesystem .
As part of this work , the venerable HTree design used in Ext3 and
Lustre is getting a rev to better support NFS and possibly become more
efficient .
The main purpose of Tux3 is to embody my new ideas on storage data
versioning .
The secondary goal is to provide a more efficient
snapshotting and replication method for the Zumastor NAS project , and a
tertiary goal is to be better than ZFS .
Tux3 is big endian as the Great Penguin intended .
General Description
In broad outline , Tux3 is a conventional node / file / directory design
with wrinkles .
A Tux3 inode table is a btree with versioned attributes
at the leaves .
A file is an inode attribute that is a btree with
versioned extents at the leaves .
Directory indexes are mapped into
directory file blocks as with HTree .
Free space is mapped by a btree
with extents at the leaves .
The interesting part is the way inode attributes and file extents are
versioned .
Unlike the currently fashionable recursive copy on write
designs with one tree root per version [ 2 ] , Tux3 stores all its
versioning information in the leaves of btrees using the versioned
pointer algorithms described in detail here :
http://lwn.net/Articles/288896/
This method promises a significant shrinkage of metadata for heavily
versioned filesystems as compared to ZFS and Btrfs .
The distinction
between Tux3 style versioning and WAFL style versioning used by ZFS and
Btrfs is analogous to the distinction between delta and weave encoding
for version control systems .
In fact Tux3 's pointer versioning
algorithms were derived from a binary weave technique I worked on
earlier for version control back in the days when we were all racing for
the glory of replacing the proprietary Bitkeeper system for kernel
version control . [ 3 ]
Filesystem Characteristics and Limits
* Versioning of individual files , directories or entire filesystem
* Remote replication of single files , directories or entire filesystem
* All versions ( aka snapshots ) writable
* 2^60 maximum file size
* 2^60 maximum volume size
* 2^48 maximum versions
* 2^48 maximum inodes
* Variable sized , dynamically allocated inodes
* New versioning method ( Versioned pointers )
- versioned extents for file / directory data
- versioned standard attributes ( e.g. mode , uid , mtime , size )
- versioned extended attributes ( including immediate file data )
* New atomic update method ( Forward logging )
* New physically stable directory index ( PHTree )
* Btree backpointers for robust fsck
Forward Logging
Atomic update in Tux3 is via a new method called forward logging that
avoids the double writes of conventional journalling and the recursive
copy behavior of copy on write .
Each update transaction is a series of data blocks followed by a commit
block .
Each commit block either stores the location where the next
commit block will be if it is known , otherwise it is the end of a chain
of commits .
The start of each chain of commits is referenced from the
superblock .
Commit data may be logical or physical .
Logical updates are first
applied to the target structure in memory ( usually a inode table block
or file index block ) then the changed blocks are logged physically
before being either applied to the final destination or implicitly
merged with the destination via logical logging .
This multi level
logging sounds like a lot of extra writing , but it is not because the
logical updates are more compact than physical block updates and many of
them can be logged with a periodic rollup pass to perform the physical
or higher level logical updates .
A typical write transaction therefore looks like a single data extent
followed by one commit block , which can be written anywhere on the disk .
This is about as efficient as it is possible for an atomic update to be .
Fragmention Control
Versioning filesystems on rotating media are prone to fragmentation .
With a write - anywhere strategy , we have a great deal of latitude in
choosing where to write , but translating that ability into minimzing
read seeks is far from easy .
For metadata , we can fall back to update
in place using the forward logging method acting as a " write twice "
journal .
Because the metadata is small ( at least when the filesystem is
not heavily versioned ) sufficient space of the single commit block
required to logically log a metadata update will normally be available
near the original location and the update in place fallback will not
often be needed .
When there is no choice but to write new data far away from the original
location , a method called " write bouncing " is to be used , where the
allocation target is redirected according to a generating function to a
new target zone some distance away from the original one .
If that zone
is too crowded , then the next candidate zone further away will be
checked and so on , until the entire volume has been checked for
available space .
( Analogous to a quadratic hash . )
What this means is ,
even though seeking to changed blocks of a large file is not entirely
avoided , at least it can be kept down to a few seeks in most cases .
File
readahead will help a lot here , because a number of outlying extents can
be picked up in one pass .
Physical readahead would help even more , to
deal with cross - file fragmentation in a directory .
With flash storage , seek time is essentially zero and transfer bandwidth
is the dominant issue , at which Tux3 should excel .
Inode attributes
An inode is a variable sized item indexed by its inode number in the
inode btree .
It consists of a list of attributes blocks with standard
attributes are grouped together according their frequency of updating ,
and extended attributes .
Each standard attribute block carries a
version label at which the attribute was last changed .
Extended
attributes have the same structure as files , and in fact file data is
just an extended attribute .
Extended attributes are not versioned in
the inode , but at the index leaf blocks .
The atime attribute is handled
separately from the inode table to avoid polluting the inode table with
versions generated by mere filesystem reads .
Unversioned attributes :
Block count
- Block sharing makes it difficult to calculate so just give the
total block count for the data attribute btree
Standard attribute block :
mode
uid
gid
Write attribute block :
size - Update with every extending write or truncate
mtime - update with every change
Data attribute :
Either immediate file data or root of a btree index with versioned
extents at the leaves
Immediate data attributes :
immediate file data
symlink
version link ( see below )
Unversioned reference to versioned attributes :
xattrs - version : atom:datalen:data
file / directory data
Versioned link count :
The inode can be freed when link counts of all versions are zero
None of the above :
atime - Update with every read - separate versioned btree
Note : an inode is never reused unless it is free in all versions .
Atom table
Extended attributes are tagged with attribute " atoms " held in a global ,
unversioned atom table , to translate attribute names into compact
numbers .
Directory Index
The directory index scheme for Tux3 is PHTree , which is a ( P ) physically
stable variant of HTree , obtained by inserting a new layer of index
blocks between the index nodes and the dirent blocks , the " terminal "
index blocks .
Each terminal index block is populated with [ hash , block ]
pairs , each of which indicates that there is a dirent in < block > with
hash < hash > .
Thus there are two " leaf " layers in a PHTree : 1 ) the terminal nodes of
the index btree and 2 ) the directory data blocks containing dirents .
This requires one extra lookup per operation versus HTree , which is
regretable , but it solves the physical stability problem that has caused
so much grief in the past with NFS support .
With PHTree , dirent blocks
are never split and dirents are never moved , allowing the logical file
offset to serve as a telldir / seekdir position just as it does for
primitive filesystems like Ext2 and UFS , on which the Posix semantics of
directory traversal are sadly based .
There are other advantages to physical stability of dirents besides
supporting brain damaged NFS directory traversal semantics : because
dirents and inodes are initially allocated in the same order , a
traversal of the leaf blocks in physical order to perform deletes etc ,
will tend to access the inodes in ascending order , which reduces cache
thrashing of the inode table , a problem that has been observed in
practice with schemes like HTree that traverse directories in hash
order .
Because leaf blocks in PHTree are typically full instead of 75 % full as
in HTree , the space usage ends up about the same .
PHTree does btree
node merging on delete ( which HTree does not ) so fragmentation of the
hash key space is not a problem and a slightly less uniform but far more
efficient hash function can be used , which should deliver noticeably
better performance .
HTree always allocates new directories entries into btree leaf nodes ,
splitting them if necessary , so it does not have to worry about free
space management at all .
PHTree does however , since gaps in the
dirent blocks left by entry deletions have to be recycled .
A linear
scan for free space would be far too inefficient , so instead , PHTree
uses a lazy method of recording the maximum sized dirent available in
each directory block .
The actual largest free dirent may be smaller ,
and this will be detected when a search fails , causing the lazy max
to be updated .
We can safely skip searching for free space in any
block for which the lazy max is less than the needed size .
One byte
is sufficient for the lazy max , so one 4 K block is sufficient to keep
track of 2^12 * 2^12 bytes worth of directory blocks , a 16 meg
directory with about half a million entries .
For larger directories
this structure becomes a radix tree , with lazy max recorded also at
each index pointer for quick free space searching without having to
examine every lazy map .
Like HTree , a PHTree is a btree embedded in the logical blocks of a
file .
Just like a file , a directory is read into a page cache mapping
as its blocks are accessed .
Except for cache misses , the highly
efficient page cache radix tree mechanism is used to resolve btree
pointers , avoiding many file metadata accesses .
A second consequence of
storing directory indexes in files is that the same versioning mechanism
that versions a file also versions a directory , so nothing special needs
to be done to support namespace versioning in Tux3 .
Scaling to large number of versions
What happens as number of versions becomes very large is something of a
worry .
Then a lot of metadata for unrelated versions may have to be
loaded , searched and edited .
A relatively balanced symmetric version
tree can be broken up into a number of subtrees .
Sibling subtrees
cannot possibly affect each other .
O( log( subtrees ) ) subtrees need to be
loaded and operated on for any given version .
What about scaling of completely linear version chain ?
Then data is
heavily inherited and thus compressed .
What if data is heavily
versioned and therefore not inherited much ?
Then we should store
elements in stable sort order and binsearch , which works well in this
case because not many parents have to be searched .
I have convinced myself that scaling to arbitrary numbers of versions
will cause worst case slowdown of no more than O( log( versions ) ) using
the method described above .
When I say " large number of versions " I
mean " more than a few hundred " , so it is not an pressing issue for
today 's versioning filesystem applications , which mainly use
their versioning capability to implement backup and replication .
Filesystem expansion and shrinking
( What could possibly go wrong ? )
Multiple Filesystems sharing the same Volume
This is just a matter of providing multiple inode btrees sharing the
same free tree .
Not much of a challenge , and somebody may have a need
for it .
Is there really any advantage if the volume manager and
filesystem already support on - demand expansion and shrinking ?
Quotas
( Have not thought about it yet .
Quotas should be comprehensive , fine
grained and deadlock free . )
New user interfaces for Version Control
The standard method for accessing a particular version of a volume is
via a version option on the mount command .
But it is also possible to
access file versions via several other methods , including a new variant
of the open syscall with a version tag parameter .
" Version transport " allows the currently mounted version to be changed
to some other .
All open files will continue to access the version under
which they were opened , but newly opened files will have the new
version .
This is the " Git Cache " feature .
Tux3 introduces the idea of a version link , similar to a symlink , but
carrying a version tag to allow the named file to be opened for some
other version than the currently mounted version .
Like symlinks ,
it is not required that the referenced object be valid .
Version links
do not introduce any new inter-version consistency requirement , and are
therefore robust .
Unlike symlinks , version links are not followed by
default .
This makes it easy to implement a Netapp - like feature of
a hidden . snapshot subdirectory in each directory through which periodic
snapshots can be accessed by a user .
Summary of data structures
Superblock
Only fixed fs attributes and pointers to metablocks
Metablocks
Like traditional superblocks , but containing only variable data
Distributed across volume , all read on start
Contain variable fields , e.g. , forward logs
Inode table
Versioned standard attributes
Versioned extended attributes
Versioned data attribute
Nonversioned file btree root
Atime table
Btree tree versioned at the terminal index nodes leaf blocks are
arrays of 32 bit atimes
Free tree
Btree with extents at the leaves
subtree free space hints at the nodes
Atom table
A btree much like a directory mapping attribute names to internal
attribute codes ( atoms ) .
Maybe it should just be a directory like
any other ?
Forward log commit block
Hash of transaction data
Magic
Seq
Rollup - which previous log entries to ignore
Data blocks
Directory Index
Embedded in logical blocks of directory file , therefore
automatically versioned
Implementation
Implementation work has begun .
Much of the work consists of cutting and
pasted bits of code I have developed over the years , for example , bits
of HTree and ddsnap .
The immediate goal is to produce a working
prototype that cuts a lot of corners , for example block pointers instead
of extents , allocation bitmap instead of free extent tree , linear search
instead of indexed , and no atomic commit at all .
Just enough to prove
out the versioning algorithms and develop new user interfaces for
version control .
The biggest single piece of prototype work remaining to go from a
simplified prototype to the filesystem described here is to extend the
versioned pointer algorithms to handle versioned extents , a challenging
bit of hacking indeed .
Transaction management at the VFS method level
is also expected to be a major cause headaches just as it was for Ext3 .
Btree methods are pretty much under control .

It is from the science fiction master Robert Heinlein .
Heinlein engineered his own nerdy solution to a problem common to famous authors : how to deal with fan mail .
In the days before the internet , Heinlein ’s solution was fabulous .
He created a one page FAQ answer sheet – minus the questions .
Then he , or rather his wife Ginny , checked off the appropriate answer and mailed it back .
While getting a form letter back might be thought rude , it was much better than being ignored , and besides , the other questions you did not ask were also answered !
Indeed , it is both remarkable and heartwarming that Heinlein replied at all to most mail .
Can you imagine other great authors doing the same — even with a form letter ?
Heinlein ’s form is very entertaining to read because you are forced to reconstruct the missing requests .

" A German zoo has scrapped plans to break up homosexual penguin couples following protests from gay rights groups .
The Bremerhaven Zoo had earlier flown in four female Humboldt penguins in an attempt to encourage three couples discovered to be all male to reproduce .
The zoo originally defended the experiment , claiming that the birds were an endangered species , but following protests from gay rights groups , director Heike Kueck has said that the zoo is abandoning the plan .
She said : “ Everyone can live here as they please . ”
Kueck said that it was neither her intention nor possible to separate the gay couples by force and interest them in their new female companions .
She added that the penguins had shown little interest in their new female companions but said that the programme could have been started too late in the year .
Gay groups had earlier protested against “ the organised and forced harassment through female seductresses ” in an open letter to Bremerhaven ’s Mayor Joerg Schulz . "

Following a three year long investigation by his office and the Ohio
Department of Insurance , Attorney General Marc Dann has filed suit against the world ’s largest insurance broker , Marsh & McLennan , and four of the nation ’s largest insurance companies and their subsidiaries for alleged violations of the state ’s anti-trust laws .
The complaint , filed in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court , alleges that Marsh administered a well - orchestrated conspiracy among insurers American International Group , Inc. ( AIG ) , ACE Ltd. , The Chubb Corporation , and the Hartford Financial Services Group , Inc. , to eliminate competition in the commercial insurance industry .
Specifically , the filing cites numerous instances in which the insurers allegedly agreed to offer customers fictitious quotes , often referred to as “ B quotes , ” in order to create the false impression that competitive bidding had produced the best possible price when , in fact , no competitive process had taken place .
A fifth company that had been under investigation , Zurich American Insurance Co. , entered into a $ 7 million settlement with the state in October of 2006 .
“ Our investigation has produced evidence of blatant violations of the antitrust laws that have cost Ohio businesses millions of dollars , ” Dann said .
“ That is why I am determined to use every resource at my disposal to both hold the conspirators accountable and to send a strong message that this type of illegal and unethical activity will not be tolerated in Ohio . ”
In the lawsuit , the Attorney General asks the Court to enjoin the parties from engaging in this type of activity in the future , to order them to disgorge all monies generated by the overcharges , and to assess monetary damages .

Pictured : Divers discover amazingly preserved shipwreck of HMS London on bottom of Thames
The largest - ever post - war salvage operation on the Thames has discovered seven shipwrecks up to 350 years old .
They include a warship that was blown up in 1665 , a yacht converted to a Second World War gunboat , and a mystery wreck in which divers found a personalised gin bottle .
The vessels , in the Thames Estuary , are just some of about 1,100 ships which went down in the whole of the river .
Oldest find : HMS London , which sank in 1665 , at the bottom of the Thames Estuary
The salvage by Wessex Archaeology and the Port of London Authority , which regulates the river , was both historical and practical .
Jagged metal from the wrecks which stick out of the mud , silt , and gravel act as a ' can - opener ' that can split apart vessels , especially large container ships which can skim within half a metre of the riverbed .
The operation was filmed for the BBC and took four months , using a dozen divers who used 3D survey equipment to locate the wrecks in near - zero visibility .
HMS Aisha : Originally purchased as a pleasure cruiser , it was crewed by civilians during the Second World War as part of the ' Dad 's Navy ' Home Guard
Frank Pope , the marine archaeologist who led the research , said : ' This is the first time it 's been done on this scale on the Thames , clearing to such depths - down to 16 metres - to get at ships this big . '
The ships explored by diving teams were :
HMS London , the oldest wreck , found near Southend .
It was collected by Charles II from Sweden during the Restoration .
The 90 - cannon warship was blown up accidentally in peacetime in 1665 , just a year after its launch , killing 300 - but 24 people , including one woman , survived after being blown clear .
Samuel Pepys wrote about the ship in his diary .
An unnamed Tudor Thames brick barge found close to HMS London .
Hundreds of yellow Kent bricks were found aboard .
The Dovenby , a 70 - metre , three - masted steel cargo ship carrying guano for fertiliser from Peru to Antwerp .
It sank in 1914 after crashing into steamship Sindoro in fog , north of the Isle of Sheppey .
The helmsman was killed .
HMS Aisha , a yacht requisitioned to become part of " Dad 's Navy " in the Second World War .
It hit a mine north of the Isle of Sheppey in October 1940 .
A pottery carrier - one of seven that sank in the 19th century between the Dovenby and brick barge .
Known as a Bawley boat , it was also used for shrimping .
A mystery wreck labelled ' 5051 ' , just south of Canvey Island .
It went down in about 1862 .
A gin jug found on it is marked Mr White , owner of the Crown and Anchor , Woolwich .
SS Letchworth , a collier sunk in November 1940 by the Luftwaffe en route from Blyth to London , sank off Southend .
All hands survived .
Divers also found the SS Letchworth which was sunk by the Luftwaffe in 1940
Finds from the various ships included cups , plates , well preserved leather shoes , bricks , the rare steel sailing mast of the Dovenby and a deck beam from the Aisha .
Dive , dive , dive : Marine archaeologist Frank Pope led the research
But any dreams of recovering chests of gold or well - preserved cannons were not realised .
Some salvage operations had already been carried out after the ships went down .
Divers using upturned bells to allow them to work underwater managed to save valuable bronze cannons from HMS London soon after it sank .
Richard Everitt , chief executive of the Port of London Authority , said : ' This is the largest operation of its kind since submarine defences were removed at the end of the Second World War .
' We co-ordinated the whole process because we felt it was right we should get a long - term record of the history of Britain 's second - largest port , and this very important part of the country 's economy . '
HMS LONDON
The wreck of the HMS London is so significant that the Port of London Authority is moving the shipping channel to avoid disturbing it .
It has been dived on several times , and sections of wood have been recovered for archaeologists to analyse .
It sank with the loss of 300 lives when it was blown up accidentally after a sailor is thought to have taken a candle belowships .
The vessel was in service when Samuel Pepys began to draw up his plans for Britain 's navy .
On 7th March 1665 Pepys recorded the event in his diary .
'... This morning is bought to me to the office the sad news of the London , in which Sir J Lawson 's men were all bringing her from Chatham to the Hope , and thence he was to go to sea in her - but a little a - this - side of the buoy of the Nower , she suddenly blew up .
' About 24 and a woman that were in the round house and coach saved ; the rest , being 300 , drowned - the ship breaking all into pieces - with 80 pieces of brass ordnance .
She lies sunk , with her round house above water .
Sir J Lawson hath a great loss in this , of so many good chosen men , and many relations among them . '
HMS London : A computer simulation of how the warship would have looked
HMS AISHA
The Aisha was purchased as a pleasure cruiser and lovingly renovated by one RH Turner .
She was , however , requisitioned shortly afterwards by the Navy and sprayed gunmetal grey inside and out , much to the dismay of Turner 's wife .
As the Second World War broke out , the Aisha was crewed by civilians and retired seamen as part of the " Dad 's Navy " Home Guard and helped to guard the Thames .
She was part of the armada of ' Little Ships ' that evacuated Allied troops from Dunkirk in June 1 ... but was blown up later that year by a mine north of the Isle of Sheppey .
Following on from a geophysical survey earlier this year , there will be a full dive on the wreck to attempt to retrieve small objects before archaeologists decide whether to lift her fully or partially excavate her .

UPDATE 7/1 12:21 pm PST : Gustav weakened to a category 2 storm right before making landfall west of New Orleans .
It appears that the worst - case scenarios were thankfully avoided .
The New Orleans levees have held so far and as the Houston Chronicle reports , " Hurricane Gustav appears to have spared energy operations in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore infrastructure today as it traversed the offshore oil patch and rolled into Louisiana . "
UPDATE 6/31 4:31 pm PST : The latest NOAA advisory has Gustav making landfall as a very strong Category 3 hurricane with winds of about 125 miles per hour .
There is considerable variability between the various forecasting models , but it seems clear that the storm will hit land " as a mjaor hurricane . "
For excellent on - the - ground updates from New Orleans , follow @GustavReporter , a Chicago Tribue correspondent , and keep your eye on the Red Cross blog for the hurricane .
UPDATE 6/31 10:15 am PST : Gustav continues its up - and - down trajectory , weakening slightly after blasting Cuba .
Right now , the storm is still heading straight for Louisiana , with most of the weather models projecting landfall a bit east of New Orleans .
The latest National Hurricane Center forecast , posted at 8 AM Pacific time , strikes a tone of uncertainty about how strong Gustav will be at landfall .
" At the risk of sounding like a broken record , " the forecasters write , " the intensity forecast remains problematic . "
The weather models are not in agreement about the impact the storm could have , but the NHC is doing its best to come up with a plausible scenario .
" The intensity forecast will call for Gustav to re-intensify to [ 133 miles per hour ] in 12 to 24 hours … " and make landfall on the northern Gulf Coast as a major hurricane . "
That ’d make Gustav a borderline Category 4 hurricane , which is a slight weakening from previous projections .
The good news is courtesy of Cuba slowing Gustav down , as the forecasters wrote early this morning , " The interaction with western Cuba took more of a toll on the hurricane than earlier estimated . "
UPDATE 8/30 6:30 pm : Gustav is now a category 5 hurricane and it ’s barreling straight for Louisiana .
Mayor Ray Nagin has ordered the evacuation of New Orleans and called Gustav " the mother of all storms . "
Gustav has become a much bigger , much stronger hurricane than the consensus prediction even 24 hours ago .
It now has sustained winds of over 155 miles per hour and could bring major devastation to Louisiana .
For live updates from the crowd , keep your eye on the Ning group for Hurricane Gustav .
Storm surge maps developed by a insurance risk management firm show that Tropical Storm Gustav , if it continues strengthening , could have a devastating impact wherever it hits along the Gulf Coast .
Provided to Wired Science by First American Proxix Solutions , it ’s important to note that these maps show the worst case scenario for storm surge .
With some luck — such as the storm hitting at low - tide — the Gulf Coast will be able to avoid these scenarios .
Red areas are at extreme risk of being hit by a storm surge , no matter how weak the hurricane ends up .
Green areas are only likely to be affected if Gustav becomes a much stronger hurricane than is currently forecast .
The model that created the maps has a resolution of 30 meters and takes into account natural and human barriers to the water .
It was developed to support insurance underwriting .
The first map shows southern Louisiana from New Orleans to the east all the way to the Texas border .
Similar maps for the Houston and Galveston areas are provided after the jump .
These maps generated back in April .
The video shows the potential impact of storm surge in the city of New Orleans .

Obama , meanwhile , accused the New York senator of pandering on gas taxes and saber rattling toward Iran as both candidates gave television interviews before primary contests in North Carolina and Indiana .
The two are battling to be their party ’s nominee to face Republican John McCain in November ’s election .
Appearing on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” Clinton said it was time to move beyond the controversy surrounding Obama ’s former pastor , Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
“ We should definitely move on , ” the New York senator said in response to a question from the audience .
“ We should move on because there ’s so many important issues facing our country that we have to attend to . ”
Clinton raised questions about Obama ’s ability to connect with working - class Americans while dismissing economists who have said her plan to suspend gas taxes over the summer would do little good .
“ I ’m not going to put my lot in with economists , ” Clinton said when asked to name an economist who backed her proposal .
“ We ’ve got to get out of this mind - set where somehow elite opinion is always on the side of doing things that really disadvantage the vast majority of Americans , ” said Clinton , a former first lady who would be the first woman president .
Critics have painted Obama as elitist for a comment he made about job losses causing some small - town Americans to become bitter and to cling to guns and religion .
That perception hurt the Illinois senator in the big blue - collar state of Pennsylvania , where Clinton won a crucial victory last month in the protracted Democratic contest .
The two candidates next square off in primaries in North Carolina and Indiana on Tuesday .
Polls close by 7 p.m. EDT /2300 GMT in Indiana and by 7:30 p.m. EDT /2330 GMT in North Carolina .
Results are expected shortly after .
“ WASHINGTON GIMMICK ”
In an interview on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” Obama dismissed Clinton ’s gas - tax proposal as “ a classic Washington gimmick ” that has no chance of becoming law .
“ What this is is a strategy to get through the next election , ” he said .

Obama acknowledged he should have more quickly distanced himself from his former pastor who has suggested the U.S. government created AIDS to kill blacks and the September 11 attacks were payback for U.S. foreign policy .
He did not repudiate Wright completely until last week , after the Chicago preacher reiterated his views .
“ When you ’re in national politics , it ’s always good to pull the Band - aid off quick , ” Obama said .
“ But life ’s messy sometimes , it ’s not always neat , and things do n’t always proceed in textbook Political 101 fashion . ”

Obama launched a new ad slamming Clinton ’s gas tax plan .
“ Clinton aides admit it wo n’t do much for you , but would help her politically , ” the ad ’s announcer says .
Clinton aides said the spot was misleading because a person cited in the Obama ad was actually criticizing McCain , not Clinton .
Opinion polls show Obama losing ground to Clinton in Indiana and North Carolina during the past several weeks .
He now leads Clinton by an average of 7 points in North Carolina and trails her by an average of 6 points in Indiana .
Obama spent the afternoon campaigning door - to - door in Elkhart , Indiana , where much of the talk was about high gas prices .
One woman said it cost $ 4 to mow her lawn .
Clinton , meanwhile , encouraged supporters in Fort Wayne , Indiana , to help get people to the polls on Tuesday .
She has spent $ 6.7 million in the two states , according to her campaign aides , while Obama has spent $ 10.5 million .
On Saturday night , Obama eked out a narrow seven - vote victory in the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam .

Japanese scientists claim they have developed world 's first flash memory with a potential lifetime of hundreds of years .
Working at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and the University of Tokyo , scientists mentioned that the new chips are able to work at lower voltages than the usual ones .
It is worth mentioning that Flash memorychips are included in such products as Apple 's iPhone , mini laptops such as Asus Eee PC , Nintendo Wii console , Flash memory cards and digital cameras .
Today 's Flash chips can serve for about a decade for the majority of applications .
Despite this fact , a number of application that require frequent writing and rewriting of information in theory may lead to a faster wear out of the cells , making the Flash device useful for just a few years .
The same thing can occur when users use a large space of Flash memory as a swap file or continuously add updated log files .
The lifetime of a Flash memory also depends of its size , meaning the smaller a Flash device is the less time it will serve .
According to Japanese scientists , these factors have a negative impact on the usual Flash cells , making them impracticable at circuit sizes below 20 nm .
But scientists managed to create a ferroelectric Nand Flash memory cell that can be leveled down to at least 10 nm .
It 's interesting to note that one can rewrite the ferroelectric
Flash memory cell over 100 million times , in contrast to the usual Flash memory cell that can be rewritten about 10,000 times .
In order to provide a longer lifetime of their Flash memory chips , scientists used a " wear - levelling " process , which enables an equal use of all cells , worn cells being " retired " having no impact of the whole chip .
Conventional chips use a rewriting voltage of around 20 volts , while the ferroelectric cells use less than 6 volts .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- CNN 's Lou Dobbs is no fan of the $ 700 billion bailout plan that went down to defeat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday .
He spoke with Kiran Chetry of CNN's " American Morning " on Tuesday about how he thinks there are better ways to solve the financial problems plaguing the U.S. economy .
Lou Dobbs : Americans " do n't want to hear this nonsense about $ 700 billion to bail out financial institutions . "
Kiran Chetry , CNN anchor : CNN's Lou Dobbs joins us this morning from Suffolk , New Jersey .
You expressed delight I guess you could say , at the fact that it did go down yesterday in defeat .
We saw the largest point - drop on Wall Street ever .
What happens now ?
Lou Dobbs , CNN host of " Lou Dobbs Tonight " :
Well , what happens now is that it sounds like the same fools who brought you this effort are going to try again .
Henry Paulson saying he 's going to come right back , suggests he 's not learning .
And he 's not paying attention to the Congress .
These Congress people are all at home in their home districts , nearly every one of them and they 're hearing an earful .
The American people do n't want to hear this nonsense about $ 700 billion to bail out financial institutions .
Frankly , Kiran , they do n't need it .
Economist after economist , with whom I 've spoken , CEOs , they acknowledge that there are far better ways to deal with the issues confronting our financial system than this bailout .
And it 's absolutely obscenely irresponsible of House Speaker [ Nancy ] Pelosi , Treasury Secretary [ Henry ] Paulson , President Bush , Sen. Harry Reid , the leader of the Senate ; for these people to be clucking about like hysterical -- so hysterically .
It really must stop .
And to hear there -- go ahead .
Chetry : I was just going to ask you --
Dobbs : Go ahead .
Chetry :
You say that there 's other ways around this .
One of the things that everyone keeps talking about is the fact that credit markets are frozen and there has to be some way to free that up so that everyday business from Wall Street to Main Street can continue .
Do you buy that ?
Dobbs : No , not at all .
And neither do most of the CEOs and economists with whom I 'm speaking certainly .
The real issue , they say , is liquidity .
The Fed has injected more than half a billion dollars in liquidity into this banking system .
Watch Lou Dobbs and economists discuss bailout effort »
What we are watching are business -- quote , unquote -- leaders who wo n't surface and put their faces before the American public who are hysterical .
Absolutely hysterical .
These are not leaders of moment .
They are not leaders of great character or vision .
Only Warren Buffett has had the courage to step forward .
And that 's after he puts $ 5 billion into Goldman Sachs .
To watch our political leaders , they have no idea in the world , Kiran , what they 're doing .
Literally .
And the arrogance with which this administration asks for , not only money , almost $ 1 trillion , and surely more in the months ahead .
But the absolute power for Treasury Secretary Paulson .
Give me a break .
The American people want this stopped .
Those Congressmen and women at home right now , in their districts , are getting an earful because this is an absurdity and it has to end .
Chetry :
So in one way , you 're knocking Congress .
But on the other way you 're saying that , I guess the system works in that the brakes were pulled .
Whether or not you agree with the reasons why it did n't go through .
So , were n't they doing their job and showing leadership ?
Dobbs :
Let me be clear , Kiran .
I 'm saying leadership -- I 'm saying the Democratic leadership of this Congress was absolutely in the same situation as this president .
They do n't know what they 're talking about .
They 're trying to ram this thing down the people 's throats and Congress .
And those House Republicans and House Democrats who voted against this bailout deserve a great , great expression of thanks from the American people .
Absolutely .
Chetry :
What do you think if you were up there making decisions ?
What do you think we need to do ?
Dobbs :
Well , the first thing we need to do is return to a traditional role of regulation .
...
The problem here is not simply the housing market .
...
But $ 700 billion and nothing in that bill deals with the foreclosure crisis , if you can imagine that .
That 's arrogance .
That 's stupidity .
That is your leadership in Washington , D.C. Democratic leadership in Congress and Republican leadership in the White House .
So that 's an absurdity .
The first thing that has to be dealt with is mitigating the foreclosure crisis , period .
Secondly , in terms of instilling confidence in the banking system and in our credit markets , the first thing to do is to deal with those institutions that are wildly out of balance , whose balance sheets , frankly , are a joke .
And the regulators who should have been tending to them over the years are also a joke .
It 's time to end the joke .
That means aggressive regulation .
It means aggressive intervention on an institution - by - institution basis .
Chetry :
All right .
Well , they 're going to take this up again today , or throughout the week as they try to figure out what the best course of action is .
Maybe they should listen to you a little bit more .
Dobbs :
They 'll be back Thursday .
Chetry : Right .
Dobbs :
They 'll be back Thursday to try this nonsense all over again , Kiran .
In a feat of interplanetary sharpshooting , NASA 's Cassini spacecraft has pinpointed precisely where the icy jets erupt from the surface of Saturn 's geologically active moon Enceladus .
New carefully targeted pictures reveal exquisite details in the prominent south polar " tiger stripe " fractures from which the jets emanate .
The images show the fractures are about 300 meters ( 980 feet ) deep , with V - shaped inner walls .
The outer flanks of some of the fractures show extensive deposits of fine material .
Finely fractured terrain littered with blocks of ice tens of meters in size and larger ( the size of small houses ) surround the fractures .
" This is the mother lode for us , " said Carolyn Porco , Cassini imaging team leader at the Space Science Institute , Boulder , Colo .
" A place that may ultimately reveal just exactly what kind of environment -- habitable or not -- we have within this tortured little moon . "
One highly anticipated result of this flyby was finding the location within the fractures from which the jets blast icy particles , water vapor and trace organics into space .
Scientists are now studying the nature and intensity of this process on Enceladus , and its effects on surrounding terrain .
This information , coupled with observations by Cassini 's other instruments , may answer the question of whether reservoirs of liquid water exist beneath the surface .
The high - resolution images were acquired during an Aug. 11 , 2008 , flyby of Enceladus , as Cassini sped past the icy moon at 64,000 kilometers per hour ( 40,000 miles per hour ) .
A special technique , dubbed " skeet shooting " by the imaging team , was developed to cancel out the high speed of the moon relative to Cassini and obtain the ultra - sharp views .
" Knowing exactly where to point , at just the right time , was critical to this event , " said Paul Helfenstein , Cassini imaging team associate at Cornell University , Ithaca , NY. , who developed and used the skeet - shoot technique to design the image sequence .
" The challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp , unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car . "
Helfenstein said that from Cassini 's point of view , " Enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface .
Our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of Enceladus , spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of Enceladus ' predicted path , and let Enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky , snapping images along the way . "
For scientists , having the combination of high - resolution snapshots and broader images showing the whole region is critical for understanding what may be powering the activity on Enceladus .
" There appears to have been extensive fallout of icy particles to the ground , along some of the fractures , even in areas that lie between two jet source locations , though any immediate effects of presently active jets are subtle , " said Porco .
Imaging scientists suggest that once warm vapor rises from underground to the cold surface through narrow channels , the icy particles may condense and seal off an active vent .
New jets may then appear elsewhere along the same fracture .
" For the first time , we are beginning to understand how freshly erupted surface deposits differ from older deposits , " said Helfenstein , an icy moons expert .
" Over geologic time , the eruptions have clearly moved up and down the lengths of the tiger stripes . "
The new images , with jet source locations labeled , are available at : http://www.nasa.gov/cassini, http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov and http://ciclops.org .
DIGG THIS
The U.S. constitution , as a compromise between liberty and a central state , has been degraded step by step , like The Picture of Dorian Gray .
Liberty has lost .
The degradation is a continuing enterprise , constantly renewed .
How can future generations do better ?
They need to know how and why liberty lost .
They need to know the past errors that produced the loss of liberty .
People justified each step by some ideas or philosophy , and the current generation continues to support these pro-State and anti-liberty ideas .
We are now immersed in them .
They are in the air .
They are often subliminal , catching us unawares and getting under our skin .
They lie just beneath the surface of our consciousness , and they motivate many of us to support big government .
One of these ideas is that the government has inherent powers that are constitutional .
The Justice Department , for example , has asserted that " the Constitution vests in the President inherent authority to conduct warrantless intelligence surveillance ( electronic or otherwise ) of foreign powers or their agents , and Congress cannot by statute extinguish that constitutional authority . "
Alberto R. Gonzales stated : " The President has the inherent authority under the Constitution , as Commander - in - Chief , to engage in this kind of activity . "
The Supreme Court usually supports the government ’s claims to inherent power .
Government power could not have grown without that support .
In a 2004 decision ( Hamdi v. Rumsfeld ) , the Court said that the Executive could detain a U.S. citizen as an " enemy combatant " without Congressional authorization : " the Executive possesses plenary authority to detain pursuant to Article II of the Constitution . "
The debate between the Legislative and Executive branches about which one has various inherent powers is secondary to the main claim that such powers are present in the government and legalized by the supreme law of the land .
One of the most serious errors of the Constitution was to make the judiciary part of the federal government .
Since the Executive nominates justices and the Senate confirms them , they control the judicial philosophy of the Court .
That control while imperfect has resulted in judgments with a strong bias toward favoring government power .
The justice system should be entirely separate .
The Constitution has other major errors that supply the pro-State judges with plenty of ammunition .
Chief among these is the " necessary and proper " clause :
" The Congress shall have Power … To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers , and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States , or in any Department or Officer thereof . "
Money , taxation , and borrowing are essential for the government to use its powers .
It is therefore no accident that one of the earliest controversies over this clause concerned the charter of the First Bank of the United States .
And it is no accident that in 1819 Chief Justice Marshall wrote his famous opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland that supported the Second Bank of the United States .
He found that the government had the implied power to set up a federal bank under the necessary and proper clause .
Once the Court illuminated the road to implied powers , the government traveled that road as far as it could , even when it ran over other provisions of the Constitution .
Once the national government was established and a few precedents set of using powers not expressly mentioned in the Constitution , it became easier and easier for statist ideas to become the unwritten constitution and for Supreme Court judges to affirm the constitutionality of far - reaching legislative and executive powers .
In this article , I go back to the Supreme Court cases in 1870 that justified making greenbacks legal tender .
There we find a clear statement of the inherent power ideas that we need to contend with consciously today if we are ever to gain the liberties that the Declaration of Independence so passionately supports .
These ideas need to be brought to light .
Their glorification of the State and their antagonism to liberty need to be exposed .
Legal tender law
Before there were Federal Reserve notes ( our current paper money instrument ) , there were U.S. notes .
These were issued by the U.S. Treasury , not the Federal Reserve , which is a central bank created by Congressional action .
Looking at a clear picture of a $ 20 U.S. note , we see at the top " Legal Tender for Twenty Dollars . "
Legal tender means that the note must , by law , be accepted as payment for all debts , public charges , taxes , and dues .
The U.S. Treasury began issuing non-interest bearing notes in 1862 after Congress passed several Legal Tender Acts authorizing their issue .
The notes came to be known as greenbacks .
The law , which did not distinguish debts contracted before the law was passed from debts contracted thereafter , read as follows :
" Be it enacted … , That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized to issue on the credit of the United States , one hundred and fifty millions of dollars of United States notes , not bearing interest , payable to bearer , … , and such notes herein authorized shall be receivable in payment of all taxes , internal duties , excises , debts , and demands of every kind due to the United States , … , and shall also be lawful money and a legal tender in payment of all debts , public and private , within the United States , … "
The existing U.S. law is not far different :
" Section 5103 of title 31 , United States Code
5103 .
Legal tender
United States coins and currency ( including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks ) are legal tender for all debts , public charges , taxes , and dues .
Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts . "
Ex post facto law
The 1862 statute conflicted with the Constitution in several ways .
In the first place , it was an ex post facto law .
It was retrospective or retroactive .
It impaired contracts made before the date of the law .
Article I , Section 9 , which applies to the federal government , says : " No bill of attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed . "
Article I , Section 10 , which applies to the states , says : " No state shall …pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , … "
In his article written in 1900 titled " Are Our Legal Tender Laws Ex Post Facto ? " , Brainerd Taylor DeWitt examines the issue thoroughly .
The evidence that the legal tender laws are retroactive and thus , in his view , unconstitutional is overwhelming .
His own conclusion is this :
" Laws impairing the obligation of contracts being embraced in the prohibition of Article I , Section 9 , under the terms " ex post facto law , " as explained by the Constitution itself , by The Federalist and by the usage of our English ancestors long previous to the formation of the Constitution , the conclusion is unavoidable that our legal - tender laws are ex post facto , and that Congress in enacting them violated an express provision of the Constitution . "
To Justice Strong , who wrote the majority opinion that upheld the legal tender laws , it did not matter if those laws impaired contracts and violated some provisions of the Constitution .
There were more important fish to fry .
He wrote :
" If , then , the legal tender acts were justly chargeable with impairing contract obligations , they would not , for that [ 79 U.S. 457 , 551 ] reason , be forbidden , unless a different rule is to be applied to them from that which has hitherto prevailed in the construction of other powers granted by the fundamental law .
But , as already intimated , the objection misapprehends the nature and extent of the contract obligation spoken of in the Constitution .
As in a state of civil society property of a citizen or subject is ownership , subject to the lawful demands of the sovereign , so contracts must be understood as made in reference to the possible exercise of the rightful authority of the government , and no obligation of a contract can extend to the defeat of legitimate government authority . "
In unambiguous words , Strong asserts that government authority trumps the property of citizens ( subjects ) and the contracts they may make in civil society .
He holds this view , as we shall soon see , because he believes that government itself is entitled to whatever powers it requires to perpetuate and preserve itself .
In other words , we not only must have government , we must have the government we now have that was established by the Constitution , and that government has a right to preserve itself .
We are subject to it .
It is not subject to us .
In some cases , the Framers linked the impairment of contracts by ex post facto laws to the production of paper notes , known then as bills of credit .
They knew that historically legal tender laws had the intent of making people accept a devalued currency in place of money instruments like gold and silver and augmenting the power and resources of the sovereign while diminishing the liberty of the sovereign ’s subjects .
Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth , in recommending the Constitution to their state , wrote :
" The restraint on the legislatures of the several states , respecting emitting bills of credit , making anything but money [ gold and silver ] a tender in payment of debts , or impairing the obligation of contracts by ex post facto laws , was thought necessary as a security to commerce , in which the interest of foreigners as well as the citizens of different states may be affected . "
In Number 44 of The Federalist , Madison speaks strongly against bills of credit being issued by the states .
The Federal Convention refused to grant Congress this power as well .
Emitting bills of credit , then the term for non-interest bearing paper notes to be used as currency , is not the same as making such bills into legal tender .
The Supreme Court later held that the federal government could issue bills of credit .
Hepburn v. Griswold
The first test of the constitutionality of the legal tender law came in 1869 .
The Supreme Court found that the law was unconstitutional .
The Court said that ( 1 ) the Constitution contained no express provision to make any credit currency a legal tender in payment of debts , and ( 2 ) the legal tender laws were not justifiable under the " necessary and proper " clause :
" The making of notes or bills of credit a legal tender in payment of preexisting debts is not a means appropriate , plainly adapted , or really calculated to carry into effect any express power vested in Congress , is inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution , and is prohibited by the Constitution . "
The Court pointed out another major conflict of legal tender laws with the Constitution .
The Fifth Amendment declares that " no person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . "
The legal tender laws by directly impairing the value of contracts deprived persons of property without due process of law .
Knox v. Lee
The Court reversed Hepburn v. Griswold in the following year in two cases : Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis .
Such a reversal was unprecedented .
The majority of 5 - 3 in Hepburn changed into a 5 - 4 decision favorable to legal tender laws with the Chief Justice dissenting .
One of the original five had retired .
The remaining four maintained their position .
The minority of three became four when a vacant seat was filled , and it became the majority of five through a new appointee when the court was expanded from 8 to 9 seats in December , 1869 .
Statements made by the majority in support of the legal tender laws are what interest us .
They are of the utmost importance to us today , inasmuch as we hear them echoed on all sides as every government , Democrat and Republican , reaches for more power .
Justice Strong made several arguments .
He began with this statement :
" If it be held by this court that Congress has no constitutional power , under any circumstances , or in any emergency , to make treasury notes a legal tender for the payment of all debts ( a power confessedly possessed by every independent sovereignty other than the United States ) , the government is without those means of self - preservation which , all must admit , may , in certain contingencies , become indispensable , even if they were not when the acts of Congress now called in question were enacted . "
This statement contains justifications for the government power .
Not one of them refers directly to the Constitution .
A first technique of subverting the Constitution is simply to ignore its language and bring in other considerations .
This technique is always in vogue .
Strong mentions extreme circumstances and emergencies in which Congress should have power to act , such power being constitutional , even if it be not present in that document .
His idea is that practical necessity is the real ruler at times .
He is saying that there is a tradeoff of constitutional constraints on power for another urgent need .
This assumes that the Constitution is of second - order or third - order importance .
Necessities hold sway .
A second technique of subverting the Constitution is thus to cry " Emergency ! "
This technique , which relegates the Constitution to secondary status , is also always in vogue .
Any leader can easily find a dozen pressing needs , problems , disasters , exigencies , and necessities .
He will then urge that they be dealt with no matter what the Constitution says .
The Constitution , being the general document that it is , is denigrated as being unable to handle events that it could not have foreseen .
Room must be made for stretching its words to fit the necessities of today .
Under this philosophy one may well ask , why bother to have a constitution ?
Obviously , if the Constitution is ignored in times of emergency or pressing need , then it is no longer the fundamental or supreme law of the land .
Something else is , namely , practical need or pragmatism .
They are assumed to be more important than the law .
The problem with this approach is that it is lawless .
Practical needs are not defined by law .
They are defined by men , and that means there is no constitution acting as law .
Once the Constitution has been ignored or twisted so as to conform to some supposed need , it is then easy to ignore it again and again .
It can not retain its former character as a constraint on government power .
When pragmatic matters are primary , the role of the Constitution is that of providing a patina of legality that covers over the actual illegality .
Ignoring the Constitution ’s limitations on government power in time of emergency or practical exigency not only assumes that the Constitution is of second - order importance , it also presumes that the government is the only means of possible action .
It presumes that the government is the sole organization that can and must act and that it must be empowered to find the solution to the supposed emergency .
But this is hardly ever so .
In case after case , the government is the worst possible organization chosen to handle problems .
The question at issue in the legal tender case is whether or not the government has the power constitutionally to make everyone accept its paper money as legal tender .
Justice Strong begs that question .
He presumes that we as persons need the government to solve various problems and have put that government in place as the sole and only means to solve these questions .
He presumes that we are incapable of organizing ourselves in any other ways to resolve particular problems .
Having made that postulate , he easily deduces the implication that the legal tender power is necessary and proper for the government ’s exercise of its other powers .
If one glorifies government to begin with , by placing it on a pedestal , by assuming that it and no other organizations and associations , it and no other means , can solve the common problems we as persons face , one then is ineluctably led to the conclusion that any powers that the government exercises that are needed to support its unique position in solving our problems must be necessary and proper to those exercises of power .
If one assumes the uniqueness and singular importance of a government , one is led away from a government with limited powers .
One is led to a government with unlimited powers .
But since the Constitution established the national government as a unique government , it left itself open to expansive interpretations such as Justice Strong’s .
Strong ’s second argument begins in the offhand remark that every other independent sovereignty had the power to make its note into legal tender .
He views this as an indispensable means to the " self - preservation " of governments .
This argument is false on several grounds , both theoretical and constitutional .
Mr. Justice Clifford , dissenting , demolished Strong ’s argument .
He pointed out that there was no implied power in the Constitution to make bills of credit into legal tender .
Congress already had ample constitutional power to conduct war and preserve the government .
" Congress may appropriate all moneys in the treasury [ 79 U.S. 457 , 630 ] to carry on the war , or Congress may coin money for that purpose , or borrow money to any amount for the same purpose , or Congress may lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises to replenish the treasury , or may dispose of the public lands or other property belonging to the United States , and may in fact , by the exercise of the express powers of the Constitution , command the whole wealth and substance of the people to sustain the public credit and prosecute the war to a successful termination . "
In another dissent , the Chief Justice gave an economic or theoretical argument .
He laid out the basis for a " tax " foundation for U.S. notes to become currency :
" The real question is , was the making them a legal tender a necessary means to the execution of the power to borrow money ?
If the notes would circulate as well without as with this quality it is idle to urge the plea of such necessity .
But the circulation of the notes was amply provided for by making them receivable for all national taxes , all dues to the government , and all loans .
This was the provision relied upon for the purpose by the secretary when the bill was first prepared , and his reflections since have convinced him that it was sufficient . "
Governments do not disappear when they lack the legal tender power .
The U.S. has fifty state governments that lack this power .
Nor do paper monies issued by governments fail if they are not legal tender .
A government can support its note issues as currency , without making them legal tender , by making them payable for the taxes that it assesses .
Since the notes can be returned to the government to extinguish tax bills , they can circulate as a money instrument that has value .
Returning to Justice Strong , we find next an amazing argument :
" … the powers conferred upon Congress must be regarded as related to each other , and all means for a common end .
Each is but part of a system , a constituent of one whole .
No single power is the ultimate end for which the Constitution was adopted .
It may , in a very proper sense , be treated as a means for the accomplishment of a subordinate object , but that object is itself a means designed for an ulterior purpose .
Thus the power to levy and collect taxes , to coin money and regulate its value , to raise and support armies , or to provide for and maintain [ 79 U.S. 457 , 533 ] a navy , are instruments for the paramount object , which was to establish a government , sovereign within its sphere , with capability of self - preservation , thereby forming a union more perfect than that which existed under the old Confederacy . "
Strong argues that the Congressional powers , as granted in the Constitution , and the Constitution itself are means to an overriding end : to establish a perpetual government .
Government itself is the paramount end !
It is true that the Constitution ’s preamble says that we the people established the Constitution to form a more perfect union , but it does not say that union of the states is the premier end or even anything but a means to the other objects it lists : justice , domestic tranquility , the common defense , the general welfare , and the blessings of liberty .
For us the people , having a union of states makes no sense in and of itself unless it is a means to these other ends .
He quotes approvingly from Justice Marshall :
" Said Chief Justice Marshall , in Cohens v. The Bank of Virginia , 86 u2018 America has chosen to be , in many respects and to many purposes , a nation , and for all these purposes her government is complete ; for all these objects it is supreme .
It can then , in effecting these objects , legitimately control all individuals or governments within the American territory . ’ "
Some of our Justices seem to have had Hobbes at their elbows or for bedtime reading .
Strong holds that the government , by the necessary and proper clause , can do whatever it wants to that it is not prohibited from doing :
" That would appear , then , to be a most unreasonable construction of the Constitution which denies to the government created by it , the right to [ 79 U.S. 457 , 534 ] employ freely every means , not prohibited , necessary for its preservation , and for the fulfilment of its acknowledged duties .
Such a right , we hold , was given by the last clause of the eighth section of its first article . "
Mr. Justice Bradley , a member of the majority , explained at length why the government had the power to make its paper money a legal tender .
He ended up saying that it is " one of those vital and essential powers inhering in every national sovereignty and necessary to its self - preservation . "
The notion of inherent powers , supported by Bradley , arises at the inception of the U.S.A. and carries forward to this day .
Hamilton in The Federalist 23 made incredibly broad claims for government power :
" The authorities essential to the common defense are these : to raise armies ; to build and equip fleets ; to prescribe rules for the government of both ; to direct their operations ; to provide for their support .
These powers ought to exist without limitation , because it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and variety of national exigencies , or the correspondent extent and variety of the means which may be necessary to satisfy them .
The circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite , and for this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is committed . "
Is it really the case that free people cannot defend themselves without giving up their liberty ?
Must they commit their lives and liberties to a central power and give that power carte blanche ?
If they do that , how can they control their controllers ?
Obviously , a government with no constitutional shackles concerning the war power is exceedingly dangerous and inimical to liberty .
It seems that the U.S. has taken the Hamiltonian philosophy to heart .
But should it have done so ?
The passage quoted seems to express an inordinate degree of paranoia and fear combined with an inordinate faith in government as the remedy for that fear .
It is hardly wise for an entire country to follow out intemperate and extravagant rambling that has so little balance and restraint .
John
Yoo ’s memoranda within the Bush administration articulate and justify the doctrine of inherent executive power with a degree of imbalance equal to Hamilton’s .
In his expansive view , among many other claimed powers , " the President may deploy military force preemptively against terrorist organizations or the States that harbor or support them , whether or not they can be linked to the specific terrorist incidents of September 11 . "
The nation seems to be perpetuating in its leadership a highly dangerous degree of power - worship that is capable of self - fulfillment as it induces the conflicts and wars it supposedly wishes to avoid .
Was the U.S.A. to be no different than any Old World nation or any despotic power elsewhere on earth ?
Government is government , the U.S.A. being no exception , Justices Strong and Bradley argued .
Bradley spelled this out in his exposition .
His amazing statements could easily serve as a basis for the absolutist rule of Hitler , Stalin , or any number of American Congresses and Presidents :
" It is absolutely essential to independent national existence that government should have a firm hold on the two great sovereign instrumentalities of the sword and the purse , and the right to wield them without restriction on occasions of national peril .
In certain emergencies government must have at its command , not only the personal services — the bodies and lives — of its citizens , but the lesser , though not less essential , power of absolute control over the resources of the country .
Its armies must be filled , and its navies manned , by the citizens in person .
Its material of war , its munitions , equipment , and commissary stores must come from the industry of the country .
This can only be stimulated into activity by a proper financial system , especially as regards the currency . "
Sentiments like these , expressed by a Supreme Court Justice in 1870 , are now and always have been a constant strain in the American system , ranging as they do at least from Hamilton to Yoo and Gonzales .
American government on many occasions has used these powers .
They and more are now fixtures in American life .
Proponents of liberty are up against many obstacles , of which the American willingness to give in to absolutist rule is one .
Heightened fear that is tantamount to paranoia is deeply embedded in the American experience and philosophy .
Any kind of distress or severe problem is likely to be labeled an emergency whereupon the conditioned and habitual response is now to yield to the power of government as the great savior .
This is not a characteristic that will be easily resolved or changed .
Gold and silver
Justice Clifford in his dissent began by pointing out that
" Money , in the Constitutional sense , means coins of gold and silver fabricated and stamped by authority of law as a measure of value , pursuant to the power vested in Congress by the Constitution . "
The federal power to coin money does not mention gold and silver , but the very next section of the same article that restricts the states does .
The two sections are logically connected , and Clifford made the connection :
" Coined money , such as is authorized by that clause of the instrument , consists only of the coins of the United States fabricated and stamped by authority of law , and is the same money as that described in the next clause of the same section as the current coins of the United States , and is the same money also as u2018 the gold and silver coins ’ described in the tenth section of the same article , which prohibits the States from coining money , emitting bills of credit , or making u2018 anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts . ’ "
What did the Framers intend in the Constitution ?
" Paper emissions have , at one time or another , been authorized and employed as currency by most commercial nations , [ 79 U.S. 457 , 589 ] and by no government , past or present , more extensively than by the United States , and yet it is safe to affirm that all experience in its use as a circulating medium has demonstrated the proposition that it cannot by any legislation , however stringent , be made a standard of value or the just equivalent of gold and silver .
Attempts of the kind have always failed , and no body of men , whether in public or private stations , ever had more instructive teachings of the truth of that remark than the patriotic men who framed the Federal Constitution , as they had seen the power to emit bills of credit freely exercised during the war of the Revolution , not only by the Confederation , but also by the States , and knew from bitter experience its calamitous effects and the utter worthlessness of such a circulating medium as a standard of value .
Such men so instructed could not have done otherwise than they did do , which was to provide an irrepealable standard of value , to be coined from gold and silver , leaving as little upon the subject to the discretion of Congress as was consistent with a wise forecast and an invincible determination that the essential principles of the Constitution should be perpetual as the means to secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity . "
Clifford ’s invaluable review of 70 years of history establishes the firm place of gold and silver as money instruments in American history and of the hostile sentiments of the Framers toward paper money .
At the end , he notes that the Court has always " held opinions utterly opposed to such a construction of the Constitution as would authorize Congress to make paper promises a legal tender as between debtor and creditor . "
Conclusion
Flaws in the U.S. Constitution have inevitably led to a loss of liberty in America .
The flaws include the Supreme Court as part of the federal government and language such as the necessary and proper clause .
The legal tender cases acquaint us with a number of pro-State points of view that I summarize as follows .
The federal government is premier , over its citizens and subjects .
The federal government is the sole government , having a constitutional mandate and right to be perpetual and self - preserving .
There are no legal competitors to it .
The option for people to organize themselves in other ways no longer exists ; the adoption of the Constitution foreclosed those options .
The existence and survival of this form of government are forever established by the Constitution .
Whatever implied powers it requires for its existence take precedence over other liberty - sustaining and power - limiting provisions of the Constitution , and they may be violated if the government decides that circumstances warrant such violations .
Furthermore , the government has inherent powers .
In situations of practical necessity , in emergencies , in cases of great need , the government has powers to act so as to insure its own security and survival .
The government set up by the Constitution must control the sword and the purse .
These are inherent sovereign powers .
If that means impressing every citizen into armed service and taxing every last resource , the government has that power by its very existence as government .
If that means controlling the definition of money , making its own bills of credit into legal tender , it has that power .
If that means establishing central banks , it has that power .
The legal tender cases of 1870 brought out the conflict between two views .
On one side is liberty and a constitution with enumerated and limited powers that serves people .
On the other side is the predominance of government with whatever inherent powers it takes for it to survive .
In that view , liberties are dispensable for the greater good of the preservation of an immortal constitution ( as Justice Marshall expressed it in Cohens v. The Bank of Virginia ) .
We are far down the latter road .
It is a one - way street .
It seems to me that we are bound and gagged by the Constitution .
This is why I have called for dissolving the U.S.A. and ending the rule of this flawed document .
Adhering to it has led us to where we stand today .
Let us go our many ways .
The land is broad enough and we are intelligent enough to manage our affairs with any number of governments of our choice .
Let there be competition in governance .
Why ca n’t there be innovation in constitutions , a constitution with a sunset provision , a constitution with electronic referenda , or any number of other innovations ?
Why must governments be territorial ?
Why must a person be subject to a government merely because of where he happens to live ?
Why must a government control what money is ?
Why ca n’t we have monetary freedom ?
Why must governance involve forced taxation ?
Why ca n’t we agree to the government of our choice and to paying our share of its costs ?
Sooner or later , we will get off the one - way street we are on .
What we can do now is prepare ourselves and those who come after us , so that we and they have a chance to do better .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
It Depends ( from David )
Several years back , a " small startup on the verge of explosive growth " emailed me back after I had sent over my resume .
They were interested in an interview .
I went there , and their " office " was an old house in some shady downtown neighborhood that had four home - built computers jumbled together on an improvised table in the dining room with two guys in wooden chairs sitting around it .
For a startup , I did n't think it was that bad , as many start up that way .
One of the two guys told me that he was " one of the CEOs , the President of the Company , and Head of Research and Development . "
I suspect he might have also said " and supreme leader of the world " if the other guy at the table , i.e. the other CEO , had n't been there .
I grabbed a wooden chair and sat at the table for our interview .
The interview was fairly straightforward , and the CEO ( and the other CEO ) did n't seem to disagree with my salary expectations .
He told me the company had lots of " biiiiiiig " clients and was just starting to really grow .
To gauge my technical skills , he asked me to do some simple coding tasks which were printed on a sheet of paper .
The first exercise read something like this :
Write a program in C# that receives a number N via console , and then prints the first N primes .
Example : 6 1 2 3 5 7 11
" Quick question , " I asked the interviewer , " the task tells me to print the first N primes , but then lists ' 1 ' in the output . "
" Okay , " he said , inquisitively raising his left eyebrow , " so ...? "
" Err , " I stumbled , " ' 1 ' is n't a prime . "
" Hmm , " he replied , " well , that depends . "
" It depends ? " I questioned , unsure if this was some sort of trick question , " it depends on ...? "
" Well , " he responded , " there are times when ' 1 ' is prime , and times when it 's not . "
I was tempted to ask what it depended on , but just decided to leave it at that .
I quickly finished the exercise and left shortly after that .
Too Good to be True ( from Greg L )
In an effort to find top - notch candidates , my consulting company put up a website that had a pretty difficult , broad - scoped multiple choice quiz on it .
Anyone could take the quiz and , upon completion , had the opportunity to submit their score , some basic contact information , and a résumé .
It was a pretty tough quiz : the company ’s brightest guy took it , and he had only scored 84 % .
We figured it'd be a great benchmark .
The website got some great exposure , and next thing we knew , résumés came flying in .
Most scored between 65 and 75 , and were all very good candidates .
As time passed , the influx of résumés reduced , and so far , no one scored higher than that magical 84 .
One night , just as the contest was coming to a close , I received an email from the website proclaiming that someone had scored a 92 .
I eagerly pulled up his resume to see what he ’s done in his past to warrant such a high score .
I started perusing through it , only to find that he ’s had one job listed on his resume , and it looked like it was just some website he ’s done as a hobby .
Looking at the dates of schooling , I could gather he was in his very early 20s .
This did n’t quite make sense .
The test was designed to gauge experience , not book smarts .
Sensing something was up , I pulled up the web logs to see what had happened .
After seeing an entry point from Google , I noticed he pulled up the test page , submitted the test , pulled up the test again , submitted it again two minutes later , submitted yet again 40 seconds later , and again , and again .
He took the test over and over and over for a period of two hours a grand total of 140 times !
The next day , the candidate emailed me to see what I thought of his score .
I politely replied , saying that taking the exam 140 times was n't quite the behavior we would expect from a consultant .
He replied with the following .
Hi Greg , Anyone with 1 or more years in .
Net could probably pass that quiz .
I was trying to learn from it .
Is there another quiz that I could take ?
I am not sure I took it over that many times .
I took it maybe 20 times but your number is overboard .
Regards , C------
I considered replying , but decided I should n't waste anymore time with this clown .
No matter , a full 18 minutes later , he followed up with another email .
Dear Greg , I really apologize for taking the test so many times .
As I said I was trying to learn from it .
I hope this does not affect my possible future employment with ------- in the past .
It seems to be a very great company .
Is it still possible to apply in the future ?
Sincerely , C------
A polar bear clinging to a melting iceberg may the poster child for global warming , but rising temperatures , pollution and other human activity are also affecting the animal kingdom in far subtler ways .
Like the proverbial canary in the coal mine , the natural world could be giving us other signs that human intervention has knocked it way off kilter .
Some recent examples :
1. Earlier Migration : Several bird species are making their annual northward jaunt slightly ahead of schedule in recent springs , as the East Coast of the United States heats up , according to a study detailed in the June issue of the journal Global Change Biology .
The report confirms similar studies dating back to 2006 .
Early birds may not sound like a huge deal , but scientists warn that long - distance migrators who start out in South America , and therefore lack cues about the timing of spring in Northern Hemisphere destinations , will be less able to keep pace with the changing climate .
" Trees and shrubs are further along in their development , and different groups of insects are out , " said lead author Abraham Miller - Rushing of Boston University .
" Spring is coming earlier for most other plants and animals , but not for the long - distance migratory birds .
Thus , these long - distance migrant birds may need to learn to eat different sources of food or face other challenges because of the changes in timing . "
2 : Jellyfish Rule :
An outbreak of jellyfish in oceans across the planet has resulted from the stinging creatures hitching rides on ships that circumnavigate the globe .
In fact , studies suggest that almost a quarter of all marine species in international harbors are alien transplants , thanks to human - assisted dispersal .
3 : Food Web Contaminated .
Scientists said last month that they found toxic pollutants in nine deep - sea species of cephalopods , a class of mollusks that includes octopuses , squid , cuttlefish and nautiluses .
Among the contaminants were at least two banned in the United States in the 1970s : dichloro - diphenyl - trichloroethane ( DDT ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .
Scientists say it 's further evidence that contaminants make their way deep into the marine food web .
4. Heading for the Hills :
Thirty species of reptiles and amphibians have fled uphill to cooler climes as global warming has caused the mercury to rise .
We could see a rash of extinctions occurring between 2050 and 2100 , scientists say , because higher ground will eventually run out .
5. Penguins in Peril : A rapid population decline among penguins because , in addition to a warming planet , they face the triple whammy of oil pollution , depletion of fisheries and aggressive coastline development .
" Penguins are among those species that show us that we are making fundamental changes to our world , " said Dee Boersma , a University of Washington biology professor who has studied the flightless birds for more than 25 years .
" The fate of all species is to go extinct , but there are some species that go extinct before their time and we are facing that possibility with some penguins .
6. Sea -Life Shift : Scientists see a notable shift in the composition of coastal marine animal communities , caused in part by changing ocean temperatures , from vertebrates ( fish ) to invertebrates ( lobsters , squid , and crabs ) , as well as from bottom - feeders to species that feed higher in the water column .
Meanwhile , warm - water species have superseded larger , cool - water species in population size .
7. Migrating Parasite :
The parasite Angiostronglyus vasorum , commonly known as " French heartworm , " is migrating northward because of rising temperatures .
Normally found in southwestern England , the parasite has been detected in dogs admitted to animal hospitals in Scotland .
Climbing temperatures in the country have also resulted in a sudden proliferation of slugs and snails .
8. Food Shortages : Plant - loving animals in extremely seasonal environments such as the Arctic struggle to feed themselves because global warming causes their food supply to peak in availability before they can reach breeding grounds .
" Think of it like this , " said Eric Post , a biologist at Penn State .
" You 've been out on the town with friends , and on the way home you want to stop off for a bite to eat , but the restaurant you 've always gone to has closed early .
So you try for one around the corner that 's always open a little longer .
But when you get to that one , it too is closed .
For herbivores , the fact that there are several ' restaurants ' — their food patches — dispersed across the landscape is n't useful if they all begin closing at the same time in addition to closing earlier in the season . "
For all the write - downs and bad news on Wall Street over the last year , only five local and regional banks have shut their doors .
The handful that have failed have been a fraction of the size of IndyMac .
IndyMac held $ 32 billion in assets as of late March , according to the government release .
“ It ’s the biggest failure in 24 years , ” said Chip MacDonald , a banking lawyer at Jones Day in Atlanta .
“ You have n’t had a lot of failures of that size , yet . ”
It has been 15 years since any bank larger than $ 10 billion in assets collapsed .
The largest bank failure on record was in 1984 when Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust in Chicago hit trouble , presaging the savings and loan crisis .
IndyMac ran into trouble late last year when it was not able to sell off a chunk of its Alt - A mortgage loans , which go to homeowners with credit that is better than the sub - prime category .
IndyMac was being shopped to potential investors this summer , but their interest disappeared after Mr. Schumer ’s comments , said Timothy T. Ward , deputy director of examinations , supervision and consumer protection at the O.T.S .
William Isaac , chairman of the F.D.I.C. in the early 1980s , cautioned against panic .
Bank failures so far pale against the 3,000 bank failures in the 1980s , he said .
Elizabeth Sullivan , an IndyMac customer in the Pasadena area , said she almost withdrew her money after hearing about Mr. Schumer ’s letter two weeks ago .
Once she felt assured that the F.D.I.C. would insure her money , she decided against it , in part out of loyalty to a teller she likes at her local branch and because she felt a public duty not to contribute to “ mass panic . ”
“ Now I wish I had withdrawn it , ” she said .
“ That was in my gut . ”
Café owners in the Netherlands are joining religious movement known as the One and Universal Smokers Church of God , the Telegraaf reports on Wednesday .
‘ We stand firmly behind the church ’s teachings and that is smoking , ’ Cor Busch , owner of the former Lindeboom café in Alkmaar told the paper .
‘ Smokers are being discriminated against … but a beer and a cigarette belong together . ’
Smoking has been banned in Dutch bars since July 1 .
Several dozen bars have joined the movement which claims the Dutch constitution and European rules give it legitimacy under the right to freedom of religion , the paper says .
People who join the church get a membership card entitling them to smoke inside the building .
Worshippers believe in the trinity of smoke , fire and ash and honour their god by smoking .
Church founder Michiel Eijsbouts says café owners who are trying to get round the ban on smoking will not be allowed to join .
The church , he says , takes smoking very seriously .
‘ It has ritual aspects , it is something you experience and we follow our faith very strictly , ’ he told the Telegraaf .
No , this is n't a punchline !
Join three of the most unlikely castmates from the original season of The Ultimate Fighter ( TUF ) as they find themselves face - to - face in a cramped rental car almost four years after all the drama on " reunion weekend . "
While the addition of Bobby Southworth would have been pure gold , I 'm more interested in how they determined who rode shotgun .

Kevin Strom in a pre-arrest Wikipedia page photo .
Kevin Strom , who was sentenced to 23 months for possession of child pornography and who proudly counts himself a white separatist , gets out of prison tomorrow , and his pending residence in the 1100 block of St. Charles Court is causing some neighborhood consternation .
Filling neighborhoods with unwanted racial pamplets and papers has long been a tactic of white supremacist organizations .
In this case , however , it appears someone in the neighborhood , or someone who does n't like Kevin Strom , may be doing the leafleting .
The Charlottesville neighborhood where Strom , founder of a now - defunct white separatist organization called the National Vanguard , will live with his mother , stepfather , and two children has been papered with fliers warning about the registered sex offender who will be residing among them .
Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo , who lives in that neighborhood , hopes Strom gets a fair treatment in his transition back into society .
" We talk a lot about redemption , " says Longo .
" He 's served his sentence .
I would hope people will not pre-judge . "
Longo calls Strom 's mother and stepfather " good people " and " good neighbors , " and he says his children play with Strom 's children , who have been living with Strom 's mother while he was incarcerated on the child porn possession charge .
And Longo points out that Strom , who has been at the Federal Correctional Complex in Petersburg , will be heavily supervised during his 15 - year probation .
Strom went to trial last year on charges of enticement of a minor and witness intimidation , charges that were thrown out .
He pleaded guilty to one count of child porn possession , but said he'd possessed it " unwillingly , " and at the April 21 sentencing declared , " I am not a pedophile . "
His estranged wife , Elisha Strom , denies leafleting St. Charles Court about Strom 's September 3 release , but says , " Someone has to notify the neighborhood , especially since he 's still pretending to be innocent . "
The Stroms ' tempestuous relationship was revealed in court last fall , after Elisha Strom 's phone calls to police accusing Strom of kiddie porn possession , stalking a 10 - year - old friend of her daughter 's and intimidation of a witness–- herself –- led to felony charges .
She did admit to bashing Strom on the head with a telephone .
While Strom is not prohibited from being around his minor children , Elisha Strom maintains that her husband is a danger to children .
" He 's in denial , " she says .
" [ Strom and his parents ] are trying to play the victim .
They 're not victims . "
Another St. Charles
Court resident , who asked that her name not be used , is most concerned about " those two wonderful children living in that household with Kevin 's mother . "
She says , " I can't imagine the impact on them .
I just do n't know what the publicity is going to do to those children . "

A French judge has ordered two branches of the Church of Scientology and seven of its leaders to stand trial for fraud , in the latest of a series of French legal battles against the organisation promoted by celebrities such as Tom Cruise .
Scientology , which offers self - improvement based on the writings of the science - fiction author L Ron Hubbard , is seen as controversial in France 's secular republic .
Although Scientology is registered as a religion in the US , French authorities treat it as a sect .
The latest case centres on a complaint made in 1998 by a 33 - year - old woman who said she was approached by a group of people outside a Paris metro station who offered her a free personality test and a later meeting to interpret the results .
Over the following months , she said she paid 140,000 francs ( £ 17,000 ) to the Scientologists for courses , books , medication , and " purification packs " .
Judge Jean - Christophe Hullin ruled that the Scientologists ' operational centres in France , its " Celebrity Center " and its bookshop , along with seven church leaders should be tried for " organised fraud " and " illegally practising as pharmacists " .
He ignored the recommendation of the public prosecutor who had earlier said the case should be shelved .
The Church of Scientology denounced the case as " empty and concocted " , and said the woman who filed the complaint had been reimbursed .
In 1995 , the first French Church of Scientology association was dissolved for not paying taxes after it was refused special church status .
The group claims to have thousands of French members , despite fraud convictions for officials in Lyon in 1997 and Marseille in 1999 .
In 2003 , a Paris court fined the organisation for keeping personal information on its members .

' Shootin ' at the walls of gay heartache , bang , bang -- they are the warriors '
by Jeremy Hooper
Thee following is the cover from this month 's edition of Focus on the Family 's Citizen magazine .
Have a looksie :
The line at the bottom : " They led a dedicated army of volunteers that gave Californians a chance to vote -- one more time -- to protect marriage . "
" Warriors " ?
" Led an army " ?
How noble of them .
In fact , it 's a wonder FOF left the magazine 's name as " citizen " and did n't bump it up for the issue to something like " deity " or " martyr " !
Oh , and apparently the situation is so dire that one of the " warriors " can't even remove his bluetooth headset for the cover photo ?
What does he think , that an emergency " militant gay hijacking " might occur during the shoot ?
Is he scared that if he pulls himself away from the phone for even a millisecond , a heterosexual marriage will be left vulnerable ?
But in all seriousness , the real thing we want to know :
Why can't these folks just pull out from these unjustified wars and finally bring their troops home ?
It 's over .
They had a long run , but loss is simply inevitable for the side of inequality .
It 's time to drop the " warrior " hat and start working towards a peace - making treaty .
Non-militarized acceptance of the LGBT community 's placement within the spectrum of normalcy is a good place to begin .
September 2008 [ FOF Citizen ]
** Reference from our headline :
Your thoughts
A large percentage of the volunteers are Mormons who have been " commanded by the Prophet , " ( Mormons believe the president of their church to be a living prophet , ) to devote as much of their time and money as they can to Proposition 8 .
Those who have a problem with the church 's involvement have been advised to " clear up these issues " with local ecclesiastical leaders .
If they do n't " Follow the Prophet " by supporting Prop.
8 they will likely be considered unworthy to enter hold leadership callings in the church or go into a Mormon temple .

I have been reading this website for a few months and the people who represent the other side are really nuts when it come to this notion that being gay is so nasty that they cant even bring themselves to teach teenage grown children that gay is here to stay and that we are just as normal as apple pie .
so I hope that with this election coming that we will once and for all put an end to gutter politics and introduce real sustantive polotics back to reality .

Okay .
Look .
I was n’t going to tell you what I think of Sarah Palin , but so many people are asking , so fine .
Here it is .
She is nuts .
And the Republicans are nuts for putting her on a ticket .
She has a five - month - old kid with Down ’s Syndrome .
Why is no one writing about this ?
I have a special needs kid .
I have two .
Here ’s what happens when you have a special needs kid .
You are in shock .
You love the kid .
I loved my first one so much that even though there was something like an 80 % chance of having another kid with autism , I had a second kid .
And guess what ?
The second kid had a different disability than the first .
Amazing .
Statistically phenomenal , really .
But my point here is that I ’m very qualified to tell you what it ’s like to be a breadwinner mom of a five - month - old special needs kid .
And , it ’s not just from my perspective .
I am a magnet for breadwinner moms .
They constantly write to me .
And when I write about this topic — being the breadwinner and having a special needs kid — women come out of the woodwork .
They all say exactly what I ’m telling you now : it ’s insane .
It ’s insanely hard .
Here ’s what ’s insanely hard .
You go through a mourning period .
Do n’t tell me about love and how everyone is different .
Because everyone is the same about their kids :
They love their kids no matter what , and they did n’t plan on having a special needs kid , no matter what .
So you need adjusting time .
And here ’s more I know from both statistics and first - hand experience :
It ’s nearly impossible to keep a marriage together with a special needs kid .
And it ’s nearly impossible to keep a marriage together when the husband quits his job to take care of the kids ( which Palin ’s husband just did ) .
And Sarah needs her marriage to stay together pretty badly right now .
And who will take care of the newest member of the family ?
Certainly not the 17 - year - old daughter who is pregnant with the newest kid .
So the dad now has three teens at home and soon two kids under one year old at home and one has special needs .
This is not a reasonable job .
For anyone .
I know that I ’m going to be reminded me that I have a nanny , a house manager , and a cleaning woman ( who actually shows up every day ) .
But I also have a job that allows me to leave at 2:30 .
It ’s a compromise for me .
Because every parent in the world has had to compromise , and it ’s fair to judge public figures on the choices they make .
It ’s really hard to know where to compromise .
Here ’s what I was doing when my kid was five months old : I was at home .
Hating it .
Telling myself that I was not cut out to be at home .
I was sort of a columnist and sort of a mom and sort of a psychopath .
Because having a five - month - old with special needs is very very hard .
Not just learning to take care of the baby , but mentally coping .
Why is no one talking about this ?
The Republicans should dump Palin .
She ’s got too much responsibility at home .
Do n’t tell me that this is not fair to women .
Because you know what ?
People should have railed against John Edwards running for President when he had two young kids at home and a wife fighting cancer .
Fine if she wants him to run for office while she fights the cancer .
I get it .
But I do n’t get how the President of the United States was going to have time to console two school age kids about their mom ’s death while leading the country .
It ’s irresponsible .
I know it ’s not cool to tell people how to parent .
I know it ’s not cool because every day someone asks me how I run my company when I have two young kids and what they are really saying is “ you suck as a parent . ”
It ’s hard to hear every day , so I have empathy for the idea that everyone should shut up about how other people parent .
But it ’s absurd how extreme these presidential - wanna - be cases are .
I do n’t want someone in the White House who has kids at home who desperately need them .
I do n’t want to watch that scenario unfold on national TV .
So at some point , it must be okay to speak up .
At some point we have to say that we have standards for parenting and we want the community to uphold them .
This article will explain to you why the Totally Screwed - Up US Strategic Plan for the Caspian Basin has backfired and created a " megatrend " against America that may well be the doom of our nation .
Any country willing to spend 30 years lying , conniving and scheming - and blow over $ 3 trillion ( reported ) on nothing - is pretty damned stupid or desperate .
In the case of American policy , I submit , both apply ... and we can , with no effort , add in DELUSIONAL .
There is nothing that George W Bush , McCain or Obama can do to change the tide now ... for it has turned into a tsunami against America .
The Grand Chessboard game is over , finished , and the US has lost in a rout .
Our nation has blown through trillions of dollars ( of new debt ) with little to nothing accomplished to pursue a bogus , contrived war that was designed to take over in excess of $ 15 trillion in Caspian Basin oil and natural gas .
The sheer cost of the failed ' war ' and scheme to take over the Caspian Basin has ruined the value of the dollar , buried the US in debt and a myriad of ancillary problems , skyrocketed the cost of oil , utilities , food , and shredded the reputation of the United States around the world .
By any measure , it is a catastrophe .
They say greed makes people do stupid things .
I guess we can all conclude that ' really stupid greedy people ' do REALLY stupid things .
This screw - up is colossal .
Only an MBA president like the Great Decider , who bankrupted every company he ever ran , could do such a thorough job of wrecking the world 's largest economy and that of much of the rest of the world , too .
If Americans would learn math and factor these monumentally needless expenditures back into ' the real US cost for a gallon of gasoline ' , Americans would wig out completely .
Every time you cringe while gassing up at the pump , multiple that by at least 25 and you are in the ball park of the real ' net price ' for each gallon of gasoline today .
That , of course , does not include the cost of blood , both foreign and American , which made it possible for you to pay these absurd prices for gasoline .
The checkmate went to Russia and the World directly due to the massive strategic blunders by the United States over the past 20 years .
Yes , folks , the past 20 years , not just the Bush Administration .
The administrations of George H W Bush , Clinton and the current Village Idiot in the Oval Office have predictably managed to put about 1,000 torpedoes into the USS Titanic and their moronic Grand Chessboard scheme .
The ship is going down and Americans need to focus their blame and anger on the idiotic , traitorous , terrorist warmongers in Washington , DC .
Theses vampire goons have needed no help whatsoever from any outside ' enemy ' to utterly destroy America .
This was their idea and marketing plan , so let them all burn .
That is one of the basics of Sun Tzu's classic ' The Art of War ' .
Give the delusionally arrogant enough rope and they hang themselves without any outside help ... every time .
There is no need to wage war on arrogant morons ; nobody can trounce them quite as thoroughly as they trounce themselves .
Past civilizations had the right idea in having the names of derelicts and traitors stricken from every book , every temple , building and palace .
However , we shall not be that fortunate because the names of these creeps will be plastered to libraries , freeways , aircraft carriers , and university and federal buildings as a permanent reminder of monumental self - destruction and treason .
San Francisco had the right idea , name a sewage treatment plant ' The George W Bush Wastewater Treatment Center . '
Garbage in is garbage out .
When I wrote " One - Way Ticket To Crawford Texas , A Conservative Republican Speaks Out " many things were uncovered during the research , investigations and interviews I conducted as deep background for the book .
Much of that data could not be put into the book because of publishing deadlines or to protect the identities of certain sources .
The book had 837 pages and over 950 footnotes .
Many enjoyed reading the footnotes as much as the book because they start to show the true ' Ugly American ' face of the US government .
It may wind up a minor ' classic ' for it predicted what we are all seeing right now .
Many chapters of the book are about the same lunatic policies of our government and how insane ideas become idiotic national policies and even dumber ' strategic plans . '
It explains how a brain - retarded ' strategic vision ' evolves into a ' shitforbrains national strategic plan ' based on a lust for money and power that came from the ' geostrategic imperative ' of the Grand Chessboard by Zbigniew Brzezinski .
When the DNC heard the title of the book , their Vice Chairman got in touch with me thinking that an " off the ranch Republican " would be their ' best buddy ' for the 2004 elections .
However , they were horrified when they saw the book and how it exposed this lunatic scheme all the way back to Carter and moved forward through George H W Bush and Clinton , and then showed why Bush , Jr is the complete imbecile he has proven himself to be .
I could write a six volume set the equivalent of Carl Sandberg 's " Lincoln " just from the information that was put into my hands about what a total fraud Bush , Congress and the Global War on Terror are .
I , and others , have known from day - one that the problems rest on both sides of the aisle in DC .
We do not have a ' Dream Team ' in Washington , DC representing America , now , or will we have one in the foreseeable future .
All of this euphoria about McCain or Obama ( as if he is the Messiah ) is a total waste of time and energy .
Much ado about absolutely nothing .
What we have is an unmitigated nightmare leading America into the abyss while these lying thugs line their pockets at our expense .
It is a deadly cancer and it is time for major surgery .
We have a ' terrorist organization ' running America .
I have no fear of ' Al Qaeda ' which is a Jimmy Carter - CIA fabrication used to control the American Sheeple and keep them dead in their tracks , like deer in the headlights .
The biggest enemy of the American people is the government of the United States .
As explained below , ' the world 's foremost terrorist organization ' is the United States government .
Read on , and I will provide you some proof .
Barky Obama Black Bush does not have a plan and apparently John McBush does not have a damned clue .
I would be more entertained if Daffy Duck Obama were running against Mr. John MaGoo ... but we are stuck with the lousy theater DNC and RNC have scheduled for 2008 .
There will be no meaningful ' change ' ... none whatsoever .
I totally agree with Mike Gravel .
Bush does not deserve impeachment ; he deserves war criminal referral to the ICC at The Hague .
However , the true list would be much longer than just Bush and would include Big Names from both sides of the aisle .
Somewhere between ' point A ' and ' point B ' we , as a nation , got lost .
We trusted our government .
We trusted that it would always do the right thing , the honorable thing , the just thing .
We trusted its members to be better , and on a higher moral ground than any possible enemy .
We trusted them to not become a tyranny ... or worse , terrorists .
We trusted that they would always speak the Truth ... but the only thing that flows from their mouths are endless lies .
That should be the first clue to every American that something is amiss .
We were wrong to have ever trusted them .
What and who we trusted are the true enemy of every man , woman and child in America .
In the early years they did the right thing , but ultimately , they sold us out .
Shit happens ... and it is now way past time to fix it .
Most people I know in America have a deep sense of right versus wrong .
Most people I know will follow that which God and Jesus Christ desire rather than blindly accept orders from evil beings ... such as the liar war criminal George W Bush and his co-conspirators in the US House and US Senate .
As I was doing the research for " One - Way Ticket to Crawford Texas " I was contacted one day by a former US Special Forces soldier .
He wanted to meet for coffee in a public place and tell me something that Americans needed to know .
I drove for hours to get to that meeting .
A full eight weeks before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 , this US soldier was part of a special forces black ops team that was ordered to attack both Iranian and Iraqi positions to stir up tensions in that part of the Middle East .
That was weeks before Iraq invaded Kuwait to set the stage for ' Desert Shield ' and then ' Desert Storm 1991 ' and another completely fabricated war by the Bush Family .
This former Special Forces soldier had the dates , operation names , targets , etc .
Through other sources I was able to verify it all .
It was just another third - rate , based - on - lies ' Bush Show ' and if Americans are not tired yet of the ' Bush Show ' they are a pretty sad lot ... to the extent of being dead from the neck up .
Many Americans have heard the babbling fool George H W Bush mumble " if Americans only knew what we have done they would run us out of town . "
Well , we Americans cannot " only knew " when we have blatant liars as leaders and a gutless mainstream media that puts career promotions or ' talking head status ' as being more important than the truth .
Bill O'Reilly gets over $ 50 million a year to lie to and mislead America .
The stakes are high for this criminal cabal .
Before Iraq invaded Kuwait there had been a dispute going on in the background .
Reportedly , US oil contractors operating in Kuwait had used ' directional drilling ' and ' aided and abetted ' a major theft of Iraqi oil .
They were stealing oil from Iraq 's southernmost oil fields ... which just happen to be very close to the Kuwait border .
It took serious planning and premeditation to pull off such a burglary .... which went on for years .
Iraq was claiming that about $ 7 Billion of its oil had been stolen ( at 1990 oil prices ) and Iraq was demanding payment or Saddam would invade Kuwait and take payment .
Of course , this was all heating up as US Special Forces were attacking and making Saddam think some of his neighbors were stirring up the mess .
Just for spite and good measure , George H W Bush had Special Forces playing ' shits and giggles ' with Iran at the same time they were trying to goad Saddam Hussein into invadingKuwait .
George H W Bush created the mess so he could be a " war president " and appear to be something other than the babbling elitist fool he is .
Remember well , Daddy Bush wrecked the US economy , too .
There was a 1990 conference call involving Washington , DC and the US ambassador in Iraq , April Glaspie , and Saddam Hussein .
To this day she is under a ' gag order ' so she cannot tell the world about what really happened on that conference call and what a liar George H W Bush is .
The US told Saddam , unequivocally , that it did not care if he invaded Kuwait to collect what had been stolen from his country .
Saddam was told the US had no interest whatsoever in the dispute .
If the Kuwaitis owed Iraq money , sort it out with the Kuwaitis .
Remember what I wrote just above ­ a full 8 weeks before Iraq invaded Kuwait the US Special Forces , under order of President George H W Bush , started attacking to stir up a hornet 's nest .
I will let you figure this out ­ they were not posing as " US soldiers " .
The US wanted Saddam to think the Kuwaitis were flaunting in his face that they were US allies , not Iraq , and could steal all the oil they wished because the Kuwaitis had a Big Bully as an ally .
Now , carry that one - step forward as to how the controllers crafted and presented 9 - 11 to Americans .
They were trying to intentionally start a war - just like they did with Afghanistan , just like they have now done twice with Iraq , and just like they are trying to do with Iran .
Since I could not get confirmation from the ' gagged ' former ambassador April Glaspie , I had to wait to see if I would get confirmation from other directions .
Suddenly , such confirmation did show up from a retired US employee .
There were many on that conference call since it was planned to set off a Middle East shit storm , so the US could take the Iraqi oil and get rid of Saddam Hussein with " Desert Storm . '
They expected the hornet 's nest could quickly spread to the entire Middle East so they included the embassies all over that area of the world in their planning .
Their goal was to sucker Saddam Hussein into invading Kuwait to collect what the Iraqi people were legitimately due .
A former US Foreign Service person contacted me and confirmed several things .
Yes , he was on the conference call .
Yes , the US already had Special Forces attacking to stir things up , and yes , they told Saddam that they had no interest in his dispute with Kuwait .
The US also informed Saddam that they were not going to intervene on behalf of Iraq and help recover funds from Kuwait for the stolen oil .
So , Saddam invaded because Iraq had been robbed of billions by BushCo and their buddies .
Then the GHWB forces swung into action to ' save the world ' with 1990 Desert Shield and then 1991 Desert Storm .
I remember his arrogant pontificating like it was yesterday , " Saddam , get out of Kuwait ! "
What a vile performance .
What an utter betrayal of America and its people .
On January 12 , 1991 , Congress voted to declare war on Iraq .
I have always wondered how many of these dolts knew GHWB had Special Forces over there in the summer of 1990 trying to get a war started and provoke Iraq to invade Kuwait .
My bet is many of them .
They are liars , folks .
Our leaders are blatant , outrageous , psychopathic , unrepentant liars .
The Zionist Jew Neocon Edward Luttwak was asked in 1991 what the US was going to do to Iraq .
" Saddam is not like the Saudi Princes who spend the bulk of their lives outside of their country , and who fritter away the Kingdom 's oil profits on prostitutes and bottles of champagne in Paris .
No , Saddam is building railways !
Creating electrical networks !
Highways and other important elements of a serious State infrastructure !
After eights years of war against the Iranian regime of Khomeini , he desperately needs to demobilize his Republican Guard , which incorporates so many of this technical elite , in order to rebuild his war - devastated country .
These people are his technicians , his engineers .
If they are put to work in the way Saddam wishes , they will rapidly make Iraq the most advanced power in the region , and we cannot allow this to happen . "
Yeah , I can understand why George H W Bush would not want Americans to know that he started that Desert Storm war and intended to do just that .
I can see where that fact does not ' jive ' with the Presidential Legacy they keep trying to mold for him .
Sort of like trying to create a ' great monumental sculpture ' from countless tons amounts of bullshit rather than marble or clay .
Do you recall the Bush speech after Desert Storm ?
" Now , we can see a new world coming into view .
A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order . "
Right .
One based on endless lies .
That is why everything has to be such a ' big damned secret ' ; why they lie and they intend to keep on doing just that .
That is part of selling their stupid strategic plan to control and dominate all things .
I do not know who can be credited with the quote " Like father , like son " but I think they probably knew the Bush Family pretty well .
The research continued and the more I did the more confirmation I received that we are led by evil agenda players , not to mention one of the sleaziest , murderous families in the history of the nation , if not the planet .
At dinner one night , I was meeting with a US Army major who was having a very deep battle of the conscience .
Even someone trained to kill as a profession has a conscience and usually weighs the issues of right versus wrong , legal versus criminal , just versus evil , etc .
That is most often the case until one meets the mercenary types employed by firms like Blackwater USA , which put money far above human life .
Many of the Blackwater killers are on laced up on drugs to dull their senses for rampant , indiscriminate killing .
I have met some of the former Blackwater USA employees .
Chronic , serious use of drugs , severe drinking problems and clinical psychosis are common issue among their employees .
I could explain to them why they have a ' bruised spirit ' but they would have to want that help for it to do any good .
America , at its core , is essentially still a nation of good people for the most part .
Unfortunately , we are being riddled by the malignant affliction of being ruled , governed and societally - programmed by idiots , liars and arguably the most evil people on Earth .
At this particular dinner meeting , I was stunned to hear some of the details that were being conveyed to me across the table .
And I am not an easy person to shock .
This person was stationed at Landstuhl , Germany at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center .
That is where our troops are mainly sent when they are injured in battle or require evacuation for medical attention .
That is also where the ' Official Morgue ' is located .
I was shocked to learn that many US troops have been delivered to Landstuhl on life - support due to a ' mystery ' pneumonia .
Many of them died at Landstuhl or were dead when they arrived ( DOA ) ... still plugged into life support .
They were not part of the official KIA stats in Iraq ... by order of Bush and Rumsfeld .
I was shocked to learn that many US troops also have chronic problems with DVT , or deep vein thrombosis , after they were given ' vaccines ' for CBW that they will not even encounter on the field of battle or in their Iraq or Afghanistan missions .
Those injections are given , yet again , just to line the pockets of some of the DoD and BushCo insiders .
Firms such as ... BioPort and DynPort Vaccines , LLC , that hybrid of a biotech and a mercenary company that the FBI keeps overlooking as a suspect in the anthrax attacks in the US .
DVT causes huge blood clots if not treated .
The NBC reporter David Bloom and MANY US troops have died or suffered major health setbacks due to heart attacks , strokes or pulmonary embolisms due to blood clots caused by DVT ... resulting directly from the Anthrax ' vaccine ' they are injecting into our young men and women .
Our nanotechnology researchers have been on that matter for 4 years now , working on ways to block it or reverse it .
I was further shocked to learn that many of our troops are diagnosed at Landstuhl as having a rare disorder ( only 1 per 500,000 in a normal population ) that is abundantly common in our US troops after they have had the usual course of vaccine injections .
It will take time to nail it down , but it currently appears that possibly as many as 25 % of US soldiers have this rare disorder .
That huge spike , as compared to a normal population , is too high not to be noticed as being tied to what the DoD and their pet contractors are injecting into our US troops .
If that affliction rate holds up , it means from 250,000 to 500,000 US soldiers could now have it .
It 's called ' amyloidosis ' and while it can be deadly , it is almost always debilitating .
The doctors and nurses at Landstuhl were under orders to ' diagnose ' this new disorder as sprains , fatigue , wear and tear due to physical exercise , carrying heavy army packs on their backs , and hard soldiering work in the desert heat , etc .
I was told that some of the soldiers were in so much pain they could not even sit in a chair ... but were still expected to serve and perhaps die for Emperor Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It was little wonder to me that when I met some of the US soldiers with this nightmare , I found that they call themselves " the Walking Dead " because of how awful they feel and how ruined their lives are .
Amyloidosis is most likely a direct result of the ruthless barrage of dangerous , sometimes deadly , and ultimately useless ' vaccines ' they are forced to take .
I have , by now , met several thousand soldiers ... and about TWENTY - FIVE percent of them are said to be afflicted .
Amyloidosis causes the human body to produce amyloid proteins which the body cannot handle properly .
These proteins destroy joints and vital organs , and over time result in permanent disability and sometimes death .
This is the same crap Bush wanted to inject into all American citizens under his lunatic Project BioShield .
The biggest shock of all was learning that vast numbers of our troops are now confirmed as having been exposed to Depleted Uranium ( DU ) with often extremely heavy concentrations of it found in their blood and body organs .
However , once again , the doctors and nurses were under direct orders to not disclose DU poisoning to the soldier , not to make any note of it in their medical records which would create a ' criminal chain of evidence . '
They are , instead , instructed to take blood samples only , freeze them , and that the DoD will ' check back on the soldiers ' in a few years to see how they 're doing .
Many , of course , will be dead or dying , or to have produced deformed children , or to have contaminated their spouses and families with it .
You have probably already guessed ... the DoD never bothers to check back on the soldiers at all .
DU weapons were banned by the UN as a " weapon of indiscriminate harm " because after it kills , it just keeps right on killing civilians living in the area such weapons were used ... like Bosnia , Palestine , Iraq , Kuwait , Lebanon and Afghanistan .
That list does not include the many US military bases where they have been shooting DU weapons for years and polluting America , too .
In fact , DU contaminated sand was recently shipped from Kuwait to IDAHO ... since the Kuwaities are our good buddies because they helped get rid of that evil Saddam after he caught them stealing billions of dollars of Iraq 's oil .
Two of the reasons I have had to fight the Bush Administration professionally ( nanotechnology ) are because we are trying to do something about the DVT / Anthrax vaccine problems and the DU .
They do not want a chain of evidence to nail their asses to the wall , and we are building such a chain to do just that .
' Indiscriminate harm ' and ' genocide ' are accurate ways to sum up the entire Bush Administration , and those of Clinton and Daddy Bush .
If the United States government will not help our soldiers , I am , as a United States citizen , trying to find a way to help them .
Many are dying of other conditions and are experiencing major health problems .
Of course , all ignored by DoD under the ' Feres Doctrine ' that grants immunity to our DoD and defense contractors for such criminal negligence .
Since DoD is immune , who is George Bush to really care about the well - being of our US troops ?
Under Bush orders ( and idiotic policies ) , millions of our soldiers now have ruined health and ruined lives .
It is time for accountability for ' knowingly harmful actions ' and to Hell with the Feres Doctrine .
I was also shocked to learn that those troops delivered to Landstuhl Germany on life - support ( regardless of reason ) are not declared dead until they reach Germany and are therefore not part of the KIA ( killed in action ) from Iraq or Afghanistan .
Some of those people were dead when flown out of Iraq or Afghanistan but the ' diagnosis ' was delayed until they reached Germany so they did not show up in the Official DoD Certified KIA for Iraq or Afghanistan .
Such " strategies " are to keep American citizens from knowing the true toll of carnage the US has suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan under the beyond stupid Bush Plan .
But , what really stunned me and broke my heart the most was something else this US Army major disclosed to me .
By the time our dinner meeting was over , we went to the couple 's home to talk in private .
I was fuming by that time , as you may well imagine .
Landstuhl , as the MSM told us , was receiving injured from the Iraq and Afghanistan " theater of operations " where the US was claiming so many successes .
However , it was ALSO receiving wounded from places like Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , and Tajikistan where our evil government was trying to carry out Special Forces
Ops to target and kill those who were standing in the way of the BushCo regime and its Grand Chessboard , Fake Global ' War on Terror ' scheme .
Standing in the way of their precious pipeline across Turkmenistan and Afghanistan !
Standing in the way of their taking over huge amounts of oil and natural gas in the Caspian Basin !
Standing in the way by siding with pipelines that were headed north into Russia or east to China !
Standing in the way by signing up with non-US oil companies !
I asked " Are these medical need cases from the military bases Bush has put in the Caspian Basin area or combat related injuries ? "
Response : " They are both ... need for general medical treatment and combat related .
Vehicle accidents , non-combat injuries , major illness , combat injuries , etc . "
I asked " Interesting , I do not seem to recall reading in ' the news ' that the US is involved in combat operations in those nations .
Are we talking about black ops ? "
Response : " Yes , it is almost all black ops in those nations . "
I asked .
" How did you know that these troops had been injured in those nations and not say in Afghanistan ? "
Response : " Because they were angry at what they had been sent to do and they wanted someone to talk to about it .
As their care providers , safe in the hospital late at night , they cried , they talked , they confessed to us what they had been sent to do .
We are all under orders to shut up , not tell the truth , but soldier - to - soldier we talked a lot .
I heard more than I was prepared to hear .
Due to the horrid extent of the injuries , I saw more than I was prepared to see . "
[ This major showed me a DVD of photos from the triage , operating rooms and ICU .
I have never in my life seen such horrible photos and I do not have a weak stomach . ]
I asked .
" Why would a tough special ops soldier be crying ?
Loss of a fellow soldier , loss of a leg or limb , or God - forbid his genitals , or face unrecognizable anymore ? "
Response : " Because of what they were sent to do , once they figured out what the real mission was . "
I asked " Like what ?
What was enough to make the toughest US soldiers cry ?
Protecting the high and mighty Americans from the " terrorists " ?
Response : " No , they were sent to be the terrorists and it is why they were sent that had them crying .
Some of them were afraid that God would never forgive them , and , I think they might be right at times .
There were some attacks on the US soldiers by people who do not want us there and some ' pay back ' attacks after US forces had attacked them , but for the most part what I was being told about was the US conducting intimidation and terrorism operations against civilians .
to get their oil and gas . "
I asked " Really ?
US ?
The honorable , truth - telling US of A being " terrorists " in Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan .. and Tajikistan ?
Please explain . "
Response : " Many of the people in those areas do not like America , do not trust America .
Many are competing to get control of areas of land that have , or are thought to have , vast amounts of oil or natural gas .
Some of it is oil and gas leases , some of it pipeline right - of - way to get it to a port and ship it all over the world . "
I asked " I know , the Caspian Basin mother lode , the idiotic Grand Chessboard .
That is why I have been reporting on and researching the Caspian Basin and the real reasons we attacked Afghanistan to steal a pipeline deal from an Argentina company .
Have these soldiers been sent in to strong arm , threaten , terrorize , etc with these Big Oil thugs and things got too hot , shooting started ? "
Response : " Some times yes , but that is not what had many of them upset unless they did lose a fellow soldier or yes , they lost a future because of their injuries .
What had them upset was they were sent to kill entire families under the pretense of " hitting a terrorist base " and they found out later that it was not a terrorist base .
It was the home of a father , mother , children , grandparents who would not roll over for Bush and his thugs and sign over their property or the oil and gas rights .
They were uh , in the way of the " Big Mission " .
These were people who refused to sign over their land and energy rights to US Big Oil .
It was a ' tract of land ' Big Oil wanted and these people were refusing . "
I asked .
" So , it is true .
Anyone daring to stand in the way of those trillions in oil and natural gas is classified as a " terrorist " and eliminated ?
Response : " Exactly , and that is exactly why I contacted you .
Japan , China , Russia , and others are over there to sign up the oil and gas leases , but the US is the only one I know of that is going in there and terrorizing or killing people to get its way .
They are using US soldiers to try to force people to sign a contract or kill them and take it from them anyway .
The truth has to get out about what Bush has done and used 9 - 11 as the excuse to do it .
These black ops started way before 9 - 11 .
They had to get oil and gas leases signed , then they had to get the pipeline under control . "
" Many of our soldiers have already figured out that 9 - 11 was just to get the pipeline they need across Afghanistan .
Many of these soldiers know they were ' used ' to get the oil and gas leases nailed down so there would be something to put through that pipeline . "
" The US Army or Marines can not tell you the truth , lest they want to face court martial and spend the rest of their life in Leavenworth .
As for me , I am no longer concerned about making grade to colonel or general .
I am resigning my commission and getting out of this web of lies and evil .
I can no longer serve this nation and what it really stands for and what is does and will not tell America .
I 'm finished . "
I asked " Were you able to determine from any of these special ops soldiers how long such covert operations had been going on prior to 9 - 11 ? "
Response : " Yes , according to some of them these operations had been going on for up to a year before 9 - 11 and possibly even longer .
They had to nail down those oil and gas leases , pipeline right - of - ways because many other nations were after the same oil and gas deals . "
I continued .
" The thought just occurred to me , how do they explain these injuries or KIA of these soldiers who are waging black ops against civilians in nations we supposedly have no ongoing military operations ?
Afghanistan ?
Response : " Afghanistan some times if after October 7 , 2001 , or they list them as ' victims of terrorists ' without explaining that they were killed or injured conducting acts of terrorism against civilians and a fire fight broke out .
Innocent humans except they were sitting on land with oil and gas under it .
There were some attacks on US troops as ' pay back " , but most of the attacks were terrorism by the US against those who were not cooperating with the US objectives in the region .
If they cannot come up with an excuse , since the ops are black , they just ignore it ever happened . "
I cannot say what you are feeling right now as you just read through that , but I was sickened to my stomach that night and have been ever since that night .
That meeting with the US Army Major was the day I stopped being a proud American .
The reason I was offended and angered is that those are all illegal orders .
These were orders originated by a US war criminal at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave .
If such happened even once ... it happened one time too many .
This US Army Major confirmed that many discussions were held with many wounded US soldiers over a period spanning months .
There were many such black ops targeted at many people who were judged to be ' in the way . '
This happened far more times than George Bush or Bill Clinton want anyone to know about .
What the Major was seeing in the hospital at Landstuhl was for the most part US soldiers who were injured by someone who was defending their rights and their property .
This man had many heart - to - heart talks with these wounded soldiers .
Few of them were angry at a Turkmen , or an Uzbek , or a Kazakh .
They were angry at who sent them and why they were sent .
It did not take long for many of them to figure out that they had been sent under illegal orders to commit murder , not take out a terrorist .
Some of the missions were literally to kidnap persons who had been labeled ' terrorist ' but were really just resisters defending their property rights .
Most of our US soldiers have very strong sense of duty , but they also have very strong senses of right versus wrong and they have good instincts to see wrong for what it is .
In their hands are matters of life and death , and they do not take that as lightly as the arrogant bastards in Washington , DC who do n't have the courage to stand on that front line ... cowards that they are .
I asked " Did any of these soldiers admit to you how they figured out that someone had ordered them on an illegal mission , an illegal order , to go process a death warrant on civilians who would not sign a contract ? "
Response : " Yes , because I had the same question .
There was a targeted site , an alleged " terrorist camp " .
and the team leader sent snipers as advance recon to get into position and closely watch a house .
A smart soldier will always size up what he is about to lead his men into .
While they were watching a vehicle pulls up , three men get out and there is a huge argument regarding a stack of papers the men were trying to get them to either take or sign .
It was a US oil company truck and they were ordered off the property at gun point .
They then went to another house about half - mile away that could be also be seen by the snipers , where a second group ordered them off the property at gun point , would not accept or sign the papers .
That night they were ordered to ' take out ' everyone at both houses .
They had already been briefed on the ' intel regarding the alleged terrorist camp ' and knew that both houses could not fit what the mission description was .
That was when they realized that the orders were to remove " resisters " not ' terrorists ' .
Most were women and children .
The reason more than one of that team were at Landstuhl was the locals were more than prepared and repelled the attack that night .
As one soldier of that team said , ' those folks know how to deal with burglars .
I am lucky to be alive ' .
I am not naïve enough to think that all such attacks were repelled . "
What was being described to me pre-dated 9 - 11 in the Clinton and Bush Administrations and continued on as they launched their bogus , fraudulent Global War on Terror .
As this US Army Major talked , I was remembering Operation Gladio where US , UK and NATO were conducting terrorist operations against innocent people in Europe to get their way .
As I was driving back home , I thought about the Special Forces soldier who was involved prior to Desert Shield / Desert Storm and about what I was just told that predated 9 - 11 in the Caspian Basin nations .
I had to resist the urge several times to pull over on the side of the road and throw up ... over their description of what America had become .
I know exactly what these arrogant murderous bastards are after , and have been since they planned 9 - 11 so they could launch this hideous , murderous scheme ... this ' lunatic strategic plan . '
I did not know until that night that even before 9 - 11 they were attacking and taking out families in the Caspian Basin area who did not want to sign over their property or their oil and gas rights to the US thugs .
That was when I truly understood the level of evil that has taken control of our nation and our government .
These are not legitimate " missions " in defense of America ; they are death warrants to kill people who do not wish to roll over to US demands .
Anyone who would prefer to do business with others , were labeled " terrorists " and murdered or extorted into complying with US demands , or ' disappeared ' .
If they would not sign the contracts with Big Oil , the ' T " designation was hung on them , and elimination was next .
Sign the contract or die .
I can well imagine that some were ' tortured ' into signing the contracts .
They may still be torturing some into signing the contracts .
Think on that one .
Folks , these are the acts of desperate people who are wickedly sick in mind and heart .
Resisting is not ' terrorism ' by a property owner .
It is , by legal definition , self - defense of family and property and what was rightfully theirs and not rightfully the property of Big Oil or BushCo .
People have a legitimate right to get the best price for what they own ... but not when they happen to be standing in the way of US hegemony and pipedreams of trillions and trillions and trillions of oil and natural gas .
If they refuse to sign with BushCo , they are ' terrorists ' .
The GITMO fiasco has already proven many in our government are psychopathic liars and conducting illegal actions and violations of human rights against many people .
When some of the military started objecting to such orders , they were ' relieved of duty ' .
The tasks were handed over to the mercenary firms , since they will do anything for money .
In my travels in the EU and elsewhere , I have noticed and met many people from Azerbaijan , Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , etc .
I started asking questions as to why they were no longer living in their homeland .
They are afraid to live in their homeland .
They are afraid of the US and their black ops killers who come in the night like the thugs , thieves and murderers they are .
and the terrorists they are .
Countless people were targeted by George W Bush for execution as terrorists because they wanted to take a better business offer from others .
Merely designate them as ' terrorists ' and target them for elimination , entire families .
It was that night that I had a totally clear picture of what some in the US will do for oil and natural gas and domination of anyone who gets in their way .
A largely lighthearted turn on Jay Leno took a more serious turn when McCain was asked about how many houses he owns .
He offered his most expansive answer yet on the matter , including a new shorthand twist at the end .
Via poolers Elizabeth Holmes and Michael Cooper :
LENO : Welcome back , Sen. McCain , for one million dollars , how many houses do you have ?
( Jay laughs , McCain squirms and chuckles )
MCCAIN : You know , could I just mention to you , Jay , and a moment of seriousness .
I spent five and a half years in a prison cell , without — I did n’t have a house , I did n’t have a kitchen table , I did n’t have a table , I did n’t have a chair .
And I spent those five and a half years , because — not because I wanted to get a house when I got out .
And you know , I ’m very proud of Cindy ’s father , he was a guy that barely got out of high school , fought in World War II in the Army Air Corps , came home and made a business and made the American dream and so somehow .
You ’ve had Cindy on this show .
...
We spend our time in a condominium in Washington , a condominium in Phoenix , some time over here in the state of California , and then we have a place up in northern Arizona , ’’ he said .
And my friends , I ’m proud of my record of service to this country , and it has nothing to do with houses .
What it has to do with putting Americans in houses and keeping them in their homes . ’

Obama won the day yesterday .
First , from Politico :
Final score : Obama wins the day …
Or maybe that should be : “ McCain loses the day . ”
A day after trying to explain his way out of his suggestion that the American economy is “ strong , ” McCain still lacked a serious , persuasive response to the week ’s financial upheaval .
The candidate started the day with a feint toward policy talk , suggesting that a 9/11 - style commission should examine the causes of the teetering market .
Any substance behind that suggestion , though , got drowned out by a series of unhelpful comments made by advisors Douglas Holtz - Eakin , who implied that McCain helped invent the BlackBerry , and Carly Fiorina , who told MSNBC that Sarah Palin would n’t be qualified to run Hewlett - Packard .
Then the Hill :
McCain campaign stumbles through day … .
Top advisers to Republican presidential candidate John McCain spent much of Tuesday with their feet in their mouths .
Their comments to reporters left openings for Democratic rival Barack Obama ’s campaign to exploit throughout the day .
Filed under campaign déjà vu , McCain senior policy adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin got the day started by saying the Arizona senator helped created the BlackBerry , a claim the Obama camp labeled “ preposterous . ”
Holtz - Eakin told reporters at a campaign stop in Florida that McCain ’s seat on the Senate Commerce Committee was responsible for the invention of one of the most - used devices in Washington .
“ If John McCain had n’t said that ‘ the fundamentals of our economy are strong ’ on the day of one of our nation ’s worst financial crises , the claim that he invented the BlackBerry would have been the most preposterous thing said all week , ” Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said in a statement … .
Holtz - Eakin , according to reports , held up his BlackBerry as an example of “ a miracle that John McCain helped create . ”
Holtz - Eakin was explaining how McCain ’s position on the committee helped him understand financial markets , using his BlackBerry as visual evidence .
McCain has noted his computer illiteracy in several interviews .
The GOP presidential candidate has also said he does n’t use a BlackBerry , although his wife Cindy McCain is often spotted with one .
“ Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years , comes right through the Commerce Committee , so you ’re looking at the miracle John McCain helped create and that ’s what he did , ” Holtz - Eakin said , according to reports .
I recently compiled all Python version from v2.2 to 3.0b , to see how their performance compares .
I decided to not use pybench , but to take some of the benchmarks from the [ http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/|Computer Language Benchmarks Game ] instead ( hoping they are slightly more " real use " realistic ) .
I compiled all versions of Python identically , using the same compiler ( 4.3.0 ) and the same optimization options ( " - O3 - march=core2 - mtune=core2 " ) .
All benchmarks were run 20 times for every python version , and the fastest run for each benchmarks and interpreter was picked .
This obviously gives a " best case " scenario ( I think ) , the other alternative would be to do a median or average , but I wanted to avoid any unfairness due to system / OS activities .
The benchmarks had to be ported to support Python3000 ( v3.0b3 ) , but these changes were mostly trivial ( __print__ 's and __xrange__'s ) , so I do n't think that should affect the results .
My test system ( a Core2 Duo box with plenty of RAM ) was " unused " during the entire test run ( which took over 6 hours to complete ) .
Alright , so what are the results ?
The most interesting data is the relative performance index .
This is the average of each test as compared to Python v2.2.3 , which therefore has an index of " 1.0 " .
This also means that each test has equivalent weight in the total index calculation ( a higher index is better ) .
::{img src=http://www.ogre.com/files/ogre.com/py-performance-index.png}::
I 'm also including the results for each individual benchmark , in the following graph ( times in seconds , lower is better ) :
::{img src=http://www.ogre.com/files/ogre.com/py-performance-bench.png}::
__Update__ :
On request from a friend , I tried compiling with " - Os " instead of " - O3 " , and not surprisingly , compiling for size is not advantageous on my Core2 box .
This is in line with the results from the Firefox tests I did before .
Again , the 4MB L2 cache probably negates any benefits from compiling for size .
I 'm not going to make any comments about what might have happened after v2.4.x , but it 's good to see that Python3 k is getting very promising results .
Portable Coroutine Library ( PCL )
The Portable Coroutine Library ( PCL ) implements the low level functionality for coroutines .
For a definition of the term coroutine see The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E. Knuth .
Coroutines are a very simple cooperative multitasking environment where the switch from one task to another is done explicitly by a function call .
Coroutines are a lot faster than processes or threads switch , since there is no OS kernel involvement for the operation .
Also coroutines require much less OS resources than processes of threads .
The idea of writing this library started when I was testing Linux epoll functionality and performance .
I initially started using the coro library by E. Toernig < froese@gmx.de > and I found the library very interesting .
It was simple and yet powerful .
The limitations of the coro library were both non portability and crashes when not used together with certain versions of gcc .
So I decided to write a new library to address the problems aforementioned by also taking portable context switching ideas from the GNU Pth library .
This library is easily portable on almost every Unix system and on Windows .
It can use either the ucontext.h functionalities ( getcontext ( ) / makecontest ( ) / swapcontext ( ) ) or the standard longjmp ( ) / setjmp ( ) .

The origin of the Tahitian vanilla orchid , whose cured fruit is the source of the rare and highly esteemed gourmet French Polynesian spice , has long eluded botanists .
Known by the scientific name Vanilla tahitensis , Tahitian vanilla is found to exist only in cultivation ; natural , wild populations of the orchid have never been encountered .
Now , a team of investigators led by Pesach Lubinsky , a postdoctoral researcher with Norman Ellstrand , a professor of genetics in UC Riverside 's Department of Botany and Plant Sciences , claims to have traced Tahitian vanilla back to its true origins .
In the August issue of the American Journal of Botany , Lubinsky and colleagues use genetic and ethnohistoric analysis to argue that Tahitian vanilla began its evolutionary journey as a pre-Columbian Maya cultivar inside the tropical forests of Guatemala .
" All the evidence points in the same direction , " Lubinsky said .
" Our DNA analysis corroborates what the historical sources say , namely , that vanilla was a trade item brought to Tahiti by French sailors in the mid-19th century .
The French Admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to Tahiti , Alphonse Hamelin , used vanilla cuttings from the Philippines .
The historical record tells us that vanilla – which is n't native to the Philippines – was previously introduced to the region via the Manila Galleon trade from the New World , and specifically from Guatemala . "
The Manila galleons ( 1565 - 1815 ) were Spanish trading ships that sailed once or twice each year across the Pacific Ocean between Manila in the Philippines and Acapulco , Mexico .
The ships brought Chinese porcelain , silk , ivory , spices , and other exotic goods to Mexico in exchange for New World silver .
The genetic data Lubinsky and his colleagues obtained confirmed that the closest relatives to Tahitian vanilla , from among 40 different Vanilla species they analyzed from across the world , were two species that grow naturally only in the tropical forests of Central America : Vanilla planifolia and Vanilla odorata .
V. planifolia is also the primary species cultivated for commercial vanilla , and is grown principally in Madagascar and Indonesia .
V. odorata has never been cultivated .
advertisement
Yet , even with this initial genetic data , the researchers faced a conundrum .
They could find no Tahitian vanilla growing wild in Guatemala , which is where its closest relatives grew .
The researchers decided to give their genetic data a second look .
This time , by comparing patterns of relatedness in DNA sequences from both the nucleus and the chloroplast ( a plant cell 's photosynthetic factory ) , they discovered that Tahitian vanilla fit the pattern of being a hybrid offspring between V. planifolia and V. odorata .
" And that 's where the Maya cultivators come in , " Lubinsky explained .
" The pre-Columbian Maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate , and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice .
The Maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests , which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place .
That 's the scenario we present in our research paper for how Tahitian vanilla got started .
It is an evolutionary product , but also a Maya artifact . "
Seung - Chul Kim , an assistant professor of systematics in the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences and a coauthor on the research paper , served as an advisor to Lubinsky on the project .
" Pesach has demonstrated that Vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers , " Kim said .
" This provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future . "
Lubinsky , Kim and their colleagues plan to do further research on vanilla .
In January 2009 , they will begin mapping cacao - vanilla forest gardens in Belize , southern Mexico and Guatemala .
They also are actively advising on sustainable agricultural development projects using vanilla in Mexico and Belize , and have plans to assemble a vanilla germplasm collection .
Lubinsky and Kim were joined in the research by Kenneth M. Cameron of the University of Wisconsin , Madison , Wis. ; María Carmen Molina of Escuela Superior de Ciencias Experimentales y Tecnología , Móstoles , Spain ; Maurice Wong and Sandra Lepers - Andrzejewski of the Etablissement Vanille de Tahiti , French Polynesia ; and Arturo Gómez - Pompa of the Universidad Veracruzana , Veracruz , Mexico .
A UCR professor emeritus of botany who was named a University Professor , Gómez - Pompa is now the director of the Universidad Veracruzana 's Centro de Investigaciones Tropicales ( Center of Tropical Research or CITRO ) .
He also served as Lubinsky 's advisor on the research project .
The research was funded by the Graduate Research Fellowship Program of the National Science Foundation ; the University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States ( UC MEXUS ) ; a University of California Office of the President Pacific Rim mini-grant ; and UCR's Department of Botany and Plant Sciences .
Conservationists to Purchase and Destroy Two Maine Dams
August 25th , 2008 by Alex Felsinger
Through a combination of federal grants and private donations , a coalition of seven conservation groups called the Penobscot River Restoration Trust have gathered enough money to purchase and demolish two dams and install a fish bypass on another .
By doing so , they hope to replenish the thinning Atlantic salmon , river herring , and many other migratory fish populations .
While the move is unprecedented , it is not without some flaws .
The PPL Corporation , the power company which currently owns the dams , currently has no plans to replace the lost power with a new sustainable source .
Instead it has increased the output from three up - river dams and intends to reactivate the turbines on another currently inactive dam .
Regardless , these are two dams that Maine will not miss .
By removing them , the river ’s ecosystem will recover from the years of sediment impoundment on the river bottom .
When the project is completed in 2012 , nearly 1,000 miles of the river will flow unimpeded , re-establishing the food chain from the plants and insects up , and eventually reviving the local fishing industry .

The site of the ancient hippodrome course in Olympia , where the emperor Nero competed for Olympian laurels , has been discovered .
The hippodrome was discovered in Olympia by a research team that included Professor Norbert Müller ( a sports historian from Mainz ) , Dr Christian Wacker ( a sports archaeologist from Cologne ) and PD Dr Reinhard Senff ( chief excavator of the German Archaeological Institute - DAI .
" This discovery is an archaeological sensation , " commented Norbert Müller of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz .
The research project extended over several weeks before being completed in the middle of May 2008 .
Prior to this , the hippodrome had only been known from written sources .
Archaeologists had failed to locate its actual site .
This is surprising , as German archaeologists have been continuously excavating the site of where the ancient olympiad was held since 1875 ; this research has become a tradition and innumerable archaeologists , historians , and sports historians from all over the world have been involved in trying to solve this secret for over a hundred years .
Pausanias , a travel writer of the ancient world , described this course for horse races , its starting mechanisms , turning points and altars in much detail in the 2nd century AD : " If you climb over the stand of the stadion along the side where the hellanodikai are seated , you reach a terrain , where the horse races and the starting mechanism for the horses are located .
The starting mechanism has the form of the prow of a ship , with the tip pointing to the race - track .
Along the side where the prow touches the column of Agnaptos , it is broad .
At the farthest tip of the prow there is placed a bronze dolphin on a pole ( 11 ) Both sides of the starting mechanism are more than 400 feet long and there are starting gates incorporated in them .
These starting gates are assigned by lot to the competitors in the horse races .
A cable is stretched out as starting barrier before the chariots or the ridden horses .
An altar of unbaked brick , plastered on the outside , is constructed every Olympiad in the centre of the prow .
( 12 )
On the altar there is an eagle with outstretched wings .
The race director operates a device inside the altar .
When it is put into motion , the eagle flies up , so that it is visible for the spectators , and the dolphin falls to the ground .
( 13 )
The first cables to fall down are those on both sides of the column of Agnaptos and the horses in these positions leave first .
They now draw level with those who have drawn the lot for the second place and the starting ropes are lowered here ; this procedure continues until all the horses are level in a row at the tip of the prow .
At this point the drivers can begin to demonstrate their skills and the speed of their horses .
( 14 )
It was Kleoitas who invented the starting device and he was so proud of his invention that his statue in Athens bears the following inscription :
" The first inventor of the starting mechanism for horses at Olympia made me : Kleoitas , son of Aristokles . "
It is said that a certain Aristeides modified this invention .
( 15 ) " The racecourse has one side longer than the other , and on the longer side , which is an earthen bank , there can be found , at the passage through the bank , Taraxippos , the Horse - Frightener . "
( Pausanias VI 20.10 - 15 )
Another - previously unheeded - written source from the 11th century AD goes so far as to state the size and dimensions of the enclosure : " The olympiad has a course for horse races that [ has a length of ] 8 stadia .
Each of the long sides is 3 stadia and 1 plethron long , while the width to the starting gates measures 1 stadion and 4 plethra , [ a total of ] 4800 feet .
Near the Taraxippos , behind which - so it is said - there is concealed an ancient hero , the horses run around a turning post ; the finishing point of the race , however , is the pillar of Hippodameia .
Among the horses , those in the foal category run a distance of 6 stadia , while those in the adult category run 12 stadia ; chariots with a pair of foals travel three times around the circuit and those with adult horses eight times ; chariots with four foals complete a total of eight circuits , while those with four adult horses complete 12 circuits . "
( Tabula Heroniana II , Fol. 27f . )

To date , it had been assumed that nothing of the hippodrome had survived , as the area described by Pausanias to the east of the sanctuary of Olympia has been flooded by the Alfeios River since ancient times and has become covered with silt .
In modern plans and descriptions it is usually stated quite simply that " nothing remains of the hippodrome due to flooding in medieval times " .
This served as an additional incentive for the German researchers : Using modern geophysical methods , they systematically searched the area for the first time .
The experts Armin Grubert ( Mainz ) and Christian Hübner ( Freiburg ) , who specialize in the use of geomagnetic and georadar techniques , were able to map soil disturbances such as water courses , ditches , and walls .
Conspicuous , rectilinear structures were indeed discovered along a stretch of almost 1200 meters .
The researchers believe this to be the racecourse , which ran parallel to the stadium .
Structural remains identified as the temple of Demeter that is known to have been sited near the hippodrome were discovered in the northern part of the area investigated in the spring of 2007 .
Of particular interest is the fact that at the halfway point of the northern access to the starting - gates - where Pausanias describes entering the hippodrome - there is a circular arrangement with a diameter of about 10 meters , clearly marked in the ancient soil layer , which could be the remains of the sacred structure described here by the ancient writer .
The actual starting - gates , with boxes for up to 24 teams of horses , are most probably located under a gigantic pile of earth excavated by the archaeologists investigating the temple area since 1875 .
The investigation of the area east of the sanctuary of Olympia , only made possible by the research funds provided by the Institute of Sports Science of the University of Mainz and the International Riding Association , has produced the first concrete indications of the location of the racecourse and its geographical dimensions ..
Ten students were on hand to assist the sports historian Professor Norbert Müller , who is an authority on Olympia .
" The DAI , with its branch in Athens , has done sports history a great service through its contribution , " said Müller .
" The project could become a new attraction for the sports world , similar to the excavation of the ancient Olympic stadium 50 years ago . "
The area east of the sanctuary of Olympia had not been the subject of archaeological investigation before , although the ancient written sources show that this must have been the site of the largest construction , in area terms , built to host competitions .
According to Pausanias , the hippodrome lay south of the now researched and reconstructed stadium , and must now be several meters below the current level .
It is only here , between the adjoining hills on the other side of the road to Arcadia in the north and the bed of the Alfeios River in the south ( which has since been straightened ) that the topology is suitable for the accommodation of a racecourse with a length of more than one kilometer .

Nevertheless , the geological and geographical conditions are not favorable .
On the one hand , intensive agricultural use has produced stark changes to the historical geography , and , on the other hand , the course of the Alfeios River , which once meandered through the plain , has changed several times over the centuries .
The landscape in this area has changed so much that it is nearly impossible to reconstruct its appearance in ancient times .
It is known today that the level of the river in medieval times was about 9 meters higher than in ancient times , but that about 7 meters of the deposited material has since been eroded and carried away by the river .
This means that the ancient remains to the east of the sanctuary lie about 2 meters below the current level .
The racecourse described in such detail by Pausanias ( Book VI 20.10 - 15 ) was located at this level .
According to this author , the teams lined up in the shape of a prow of a ship in starting - gates in front of a hall ; the starting signal was a brass eagle that was raised and lowered by means of a hoisting mechanism , while a dolphin figure moved in front of the drivers .
There was space for spectators along a wall on the southern side and along the adjoining hills to the north , but it seems that there were no stone stands similar to those of the great circuses in Rome or Carthage .
Various reconstructions have been based on Pausanias ' description , with the racecourse usually assumed to be twice as wide as the starting - gates .
However , it was only after a hand - written medieval document from the 11th century was correctly reinterpreted by J. Ebert in 1989 that the actual appearance and dimensions of the hippodrome became apparent .
The complex had a length of 1052 meters and a width of 64 meters , not including the earth walls built for the spectators .
The starting - gates stretched the full width of the racecourse .
Modern geomagnetic methods were used by a team of German scientists in April / May 2008 to explore the accessible terrain at the level described above .
Two different physics - based techniques were used .
Geomagnetic mapping of archaeological structures involves the accurate , high - resolution recording of the tiny magnetic anomalies in the earth 's magnetic field that these cause .
Such anomalies are usually caused by the presence of foundations , large stone objects or burnt layers .
This technique was used in combination with georadar , a ground penetrating form of radar .
In this electromagnetic technique , short impulses that each last only a few nanoseconds are radiated into the ground .
These are reflected by the margins of different layers and by objects .
A combination of the two methods can be used to detect anomalies and even to determine at what depth they are located in the ground .
This makes it possible to determine within which layer ( modern , medieval , ancient ) the identified anomalies are probably located .
An area of 10.5 hectares was finecombed with geomagnetic mapping techniques , while georadar was used to investigate an area of 3.6 hectares .
It was not always possible to penetrate the thick layers of fine sand , while the remains of decades of agriculture in the form of fences , channels and concrete structures also made results difficult to interpret .
Nevertheless , some significant finds were made .
It appears that there was never extensive construction on the site .
The innumerable channels extending to the northern perimeter of the area once defined the edges of terraces or water drainage conduits .
The Alfeios River would have repeatedly flooded the entire area up to the foot of the hills .
As the ancient level is approximately 2 meters below the current level , however , any remains will have been protected to some extent .
This means that the parallel anomalies ( ditches , walls , earthworks ) identified along a length of almost 200 meters must represent the remains of the ancient hippodrome .
The hippodrome was thus sited parallel to the stadium and ended where there is a distinctive bend in the modern road at its eastern turning point .
Approximately half - way along the northern access route to the starting - gates - where Pausanias entered the hippodrome - a circular stone formation with a diameter of about 10 metres was found in a layer dating from ancient times .
Some remains that were most probably once buildings located on a terrace have been discovered near the road on the northern side of the hippodrome .
As remains of a temple of Demeter have been discovered by Greek archaeologists in the immediate vicinity underneath the modern road , it now seems likely that this was the location described by Pausanias .
Hence , without any need for excavation , modern geomagnetic techniques have given us the first clear indications of the site of the hippodrome east of the sanctuary of Olympia .
This means that archaeological and sports - historical research has come a little closer to solving one of the last great mysteries of Olympia .
( CNN ) -- Aides to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin improperly obtained her former brother - in - law 's state police personnel files and cited information from those records to raise complaints about the officer , the head of Alaska 's state police union said Thursday .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has put an aide on leave during a probe into the firing of the public safety commissioner .
" It 's apparent to us that the governor or someone on her staff had direct access to his personnel file , as well as his workers ' comp file , and those are protected , " said John Cyr , executive director of the Alaska Public Safety Employees Association .
Palin , now the Republican nominee for vice president , is battling allegations that she sacked her public safety commissioner in July because he refused to fire Trooper Mike Wooten , her sister 's ex-husband .
But a spokesman for GOP presidential candidate John McCain 's campaign released documents late Thursday indicating Wooten signed a waiver during his divorce that allowed his entire personnel file to be released .
" When you 're a real reformer like Sarah Palin , who is n't afraid to take on entrenched political interests , scurrilous attacks and empty allegations come with the territory , " campaign spokesman Taylor Griffin said .
In an ethics complaint filed Wednesday , the union names the governor and three aides , one of whom cited Wooten 's records in a tape - recorded call to a state police lieutenant in February .
And the former commissioner , Walt Monegan , said he believes his refusal to fire Wooten led to his firing .
Watch Monegan say Palin fired him for personal reasons »
Monegan said no one directly demanded Wooten 's dismissal , but the trooper was the subject of " constant " questions or comments " either verbally or in e-mail saying , ' Is this the kind of trooper that should be representing the troopers ? ' or ' This is not the kind that we want to have as a poster child . ' "
" In the center of all of the controversy is Trooper Wooten 's continued employment , " the former police commissioner said .
" My job was to provide passion and support to 900 people -- almost 900 people -- in the Department of Public Safety , and one of them -- which included Trooper Wooten -- was an irritant to her . "
Palin said Monegan was sacked because of disagreements over the state budget .
His firing is under investigation by the Alaska Legislature , but Palin 's attorneys filed papers this week to request Alaska 's Personnel Board take over the probe .
In August , Palin admitted members of her administration had contacted people in Monegan 's department more than 20 times regarding Wooten since she took office in December 2006 .
" The individual inquiries taken by themselves are one thing .
Many of these inquiries were completely appropriate ; however , the serial nature of the contacts understandably could be perceived as some kind of pressure , presumably at my direction , " she said .
But in papers requesting the probe be transferred to the personnel board , Palin 's lawyer called Wooten a " rogue trooper " who threatened the governor 's family during a bitter divorce and custody battle .
Thomas Van Flein , the governor 's attorney , said it was appropriate to complain to the head of the department about a trooper the Palins believed posed a threat to their security .
Van Flein had no immediate response to the union complaint .
Palin had been complaining to state police officials about Wooten since before she became governor .
In March 2006 , Wooten received a five - day suspension for drinking beer in his patrol car , illegally shooting a moose under his wife 's hunting permit and using a Taser on his 10 - year - old stepson " in a training capacity . "
Wooten , in an interview with CNN's Drew Griffin , said he wanted to be " the best father I can be to my children " and " the best trooper I can be to the state . "
" You know , I was young and I made mistakes , " Wooten said .
" And I was punished for those mistakes .
I learned my lesson .
They 're behind me . "
Van Flein , Palin 's lawyer , said Wednesday the Palins were unaware any action had been taken against Wooten until after Monegan 's firing .
In the February 29 call by Frank Bailey , Palin 's boards and commissions director , to state police Lt. Rodney Dial , Bailey complained there had been " absolutely no action for a year on this issue . "
During the call , he said there was some " really funny business " about a worker 's compensation claim Wooten had filed and suggested he lied about a health condition on his state police job application .
" That 's extraordinary for them to reference that , " Cyr said .
Police application files contain results of background checks and reference letters , " and those are sealed .
Even Trooper Wooten does n't have access to those . "
And during the February conversation , Dial questioned how Bailey had obtained information that was " extremely confidential . "
" I 'm trying to find out how it was determined by anybody that he had indicated something on his application that later was found to be not true , " he said .
Bailey replied , " I 'm a little bit reluctant to say . "
But he added , " Over in admin is where , you know , we hold workers ' comp right in there . "
Efforts to contact either Bailey or his attorney on Thursday were unsuccessful .
But the McCain campaign released copies of a February 7 waiver Wooten signed during divorce proceedings that authorized the release of his personnel file , " including but not limited to any and all disciplinary actions and or complaints , and personnel records and actual shift and date worked records . "
" Mike Wooten signed a waiver as part of the divorce proceedings , and as a result the information was in the public domain , " Griffin , the campaign spokesman , told CNN .
When she turned over the recording of the February 29 call to the Legislature , Palin said she was " truly disappointed and disturbed to learn that a member of this administration contacted the Department of Public Safety regarding Trooper Wooten .
At no time did I authorize any member of my staff to do so . "
Palin placed Bailey on paid leave until the investigation is over .
Cyr said the union 's complaint has been in the works since August 13 , when the Bailey - Dial conversation was disclosed .
" Of course , we had no way of knowing that Gov. Palin was tapped to be the vice president , " he said .
All About Sarah Palin • Alaska
Jeff Rense and I agree this election is now Barack Hussein Obama versus Sarah Palin .
The Obama machine is alleging Gov Palin has no foreign policy experience , but the fact of the matter is neither does Obama .
A few airplane trips to the world 's current trouble spots , does n't qualify Barky for anything .
Even with the DNC attacking , lying and fabricating an MSM and internet smear campaign against Palin , the polls are showing they are failing miserably to achieve their goals .
You see , Sarah Palin is a smart lady .
She already knows the Iraq War , so callously dubbed Iraqi Freedom , is a war for oil and has publicly proclaimed it as such .
Her position was thoroughly vetted by McCain and the RNC before she was selected .
You might want to ponder that a moment as to the McCain rhetoric during the primaries and why he selected Sarah Palin to be his running mate .
Major changes are coming to DC if the McCain - Palin ticket wins in November .
In a recent BusinessWeek interview with Maria Bartiromo , Sarah Palin was very candid about her views on why the US is in Iraq ... for oil .
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/aug2008/
db20080829_272692.htm
In fact , Palin is the only person in the race for the White House who is being honest and candid about our Energy Policy and that America absolutely MUST end its dependence on foreign oil ... which would also end the need for more wars for oil .
Trust me , the DNC slugs just can't do the math .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMC_XqdFYe0
If you carry that one step forward , it is sheer lunacy for the Obama campaign to think it can ' refocus ' on the bogus , utterly fraudulent Global War on Terror and get the oil and gas deals done that Bush has failed to get done in his eight years of hell .
This proposed ' refocus ' is merely to salvage the reputation of Zbigniew Brzezinski and his idiotic Grand Chessboard scheme .
They can get a pipeline done but only SOUTH across Iran ... by changing US policies , or they can cease and desist with the killing in Afghanistan and get a business deal done without military force .
There are no other options .
The US has based an entire war and 20 years of failed foreign policies on ' geostrategic imperatives ' that are totally unneeded if the US were to be energy independent of foreign oil .
WHICH IT CAN DO .
Barky is trying to figure out what to do next because McCain just threw him the best curve ball of McCain 's career and the DNC missed it by a mile .
Now the DNC is stuck with its War Party plan while the RNC heads off in another direction .
The entire Caspian Basin fiasco , the Afghanistan pipeline disaster , and now the Georgia war are all part of the Zionist New World Order 's agenda to control world energy and keep Russian energy might from rising to a position of near dominance .
The Zionist / PNAC / City
Of London Banksters will have to get used to the Russian Bear being close to the ' geostrategic imperative ' pipeline across Georgia because both Abkhazia and South Ossetia are lost to Zionist Georgia for good .
The Bear is not going anywhere .
It is time for Americans to recognize that the schizophrenic folks at the DNC are pushing policies that are destined to create more foreign wars for oil by blocking any move for true U.S. energy independence through their phony environmentalist fronts , falsely using the Endangered Species
Act ( even if the animals are not endangered , like the polar bears ) , and with any other strong arm tactics they can find .
By pushing outdated environmental policies to protect areas from being tapped for oil and natural gas , these same folks who pretend to be ' antiwar ' are , in fact , assuring that there will be more of them .
Contrary to what the DNC Lie Machine is saying about Gov Palin , she is an avid environmentalist and conservationist .
She is also mature and pragmatic enough to realize that the vast oil and natural gas supplies in Alaska are desperately needed RIGHT NOW to get the US off this War for Oil game plan before America collapses permanently .
Palin wants to see Alaska 's energy resources developed intelligently , environmentally and safely , and has already laid down the a rigid framework that Big Oil will have to comply with if it is to tap Alaskan energy .
These sniping , backstabbing sleaze artists of the DNC do not want America to know that this lady 's stance on the environment outshines any of their lapdog politicians in Congress .
There is a big difference in chatter , posturing and idle photo op rhetoric versus REAL action ... and Gov Palin is a lady of action .
No one on either side of the aisle has an Energy Policy that does not include war .
Sarah Palin is the only one with real answers .
She is developing the oil and gas of Alaska , but , and this is a major but , she has made the Big Oil tycoons comply with each and every one of her ENVIRONMENTAL DIRECTIVES .
She would not , and will not let them rape Alaska and that is part of why the DNC Lie Factory in high gear right now .
Evidently , these idiots who profess to be ' antiwar ' actually want and would welcome as many more wars as needed to dominate as much foreign oil as possible .
They are already attacking based on the non-endangered polar bears and protecting a 2,000 acre ANWR that is known to have a vast pool of energy under it .
It can be DIRECTIONALLY drilled to a great extent but the DNC hyperventilating morons do not want anyone to know that .
ANWR is part of an area of about 1,000 square miles that is ultra rich in energy reserves .
It can be easily tapped without any undue harm to the environment , but the DNC Spin Machine does not want anyone to know that , either .
Here 's one typical smear ...
" Sarah Palin - worse for the environment than even Bush and McCain " ' Sarah Palin , hard at work destroying everything that makes Alaska special '
The DNC does n't want you to think about wildlife starving to death through overcrowding which is what happens when their numbers are not balanced by hunting for food .
Alaskans know this but those in the southern 48 are kept clueless by the lies and a complicit media .
That posting is yet another blatant lie from the same nutcase liars who can't understand that no oil and gas production in the US means there will absolutely be more foreign wars for oil .
But , hey , war is profitable , right ?
Palin's record as governor of Alaska and the environmental steps she has already taken disprove every word her ( foundation - funded ) environmentalist critics are saying and every willfully false posting they are making on the Internet .
I remember years ago when Rense first exposed the Peak Oil scam .
The Russians figured it out years ago ... oil is an abiotic .
It is produced CONSTANTLY by the Earth from natural processes .
It has nothing to do with " fossil " anything .
Where the geologic conditions are ripe , the Earth is an oil producing machine that works on its on ... without any help from the DNC .
What is going on within the RNC ranks right now is McCain and Palin are about to divorce the US from the BushCo way of getting oil for America through war and genocide .
That plan was stillborn before it was ever launched .
There is no way for Barky and Zbig to revive the plan because it was stupid to begin with and Bush has managed to turn it into the biggest Dirty Diaper of his entire life .
Most Americans have not a clue how big Alaska is .
It is huge and far bigger than Texas .
It is mega - rich in energy and mineral resources , which is , by the way , the exact reason that the United States bought Alaska from Russia .
If you are not aware of that , read it again .
Alaska was purchased from Russia for resources , not as a huge stage for environmental melodrama and paranoid fictions to be acted out upon .
They are spreading all sorts of rumors that her husband works for BP ( forgetting to mention he is union ) so , therefore he ( and his wife ) must be part of evil Big Oil.
Ridiculous .
Her husband was a commercial fisherman all of his life until the economy crashed in Alaska .
He works for BP because he has 5 children to feed , and soon a grandchild to assist with .
Some of the most laughable lies are about her endangering the polar bears .
Read carefully : the polar bear is no longer an endangered species ; their numbers have increased enormously since the 1950s .
Unfortunately , facts and truth have never gotten in the way of the liberal environmental movement or the DNC .
There are MILLIONS of square miles in the Arctic ... but the ANWR and surrounding energy reserves cover only about 1,000 square miles .
These DNC twits would do America and the world a great favor if they just adopted a Pet Rock , sat down , shut up and let the real workers get down to the business of saving America ... and their pin- headed asses , too .
I was not going to vote this year , but Gov Sarah Palin and Energy Independence gets my vote .
There is something else the critics are not telling America .
Nanotechnology has made huge breakthroughs to where the cars of the future WILL run on water and hydrogen .
There will always be a need for petroleum for petrochemicals , plastics , synthetic fabrics and pharmaceuticals ... and thanks to the EARTH and ABIOTIC OIL , we will never run out of them .
Our company is right in the middle of all this , but it will take about 3 - 5 years for the auto industry to retool , and it will also take the construction of countless new plants that will generate power from hydrogen .
I am quite certain those hyperventilating folks at DNC have not a clue what this all means .
Even after our HPS are available , it will still take 10 to 20 years to completely take the US off dependence of oil to power automobiles .
Reality is reality , but not over at the DNC .
There are 300 million Americans and Big Auto can only make and sell so many cars per year .
Right now , Ford , GM and Chrysler are literally facing bankruptcy .
Facts are facts and there is nothing DNC delusions can do to change them .
In the mean time , America needs all of the domestic oil and gas it can produce .
Sarah Palin gets my vote because she clearly knows that .

Bush pushes controversial memo author
Bush Ignores Democratic Opposition , Seeks Confirmation for Memo Author
AP News – President Bush renominated Steven G. Bradbury as assistant attorney general Wednesday , refusing to yield to Democrats who oppose a permanent job for the official who signed legal memos authorizing harsh interrogations for suspected terrorists .
Bradbury has been serving as acting chief of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legislative Counsel .
Bush wants the Senate to confirm Bradbury as permanent head of the office .
Senate Democrats complain that two secret memos from Bradbury in 2005 authorized the CIA to use head slaps , freezing temperatures and waterboarding — a practice that invokes drowning fears — when questioning terrorism detainees .
The memo controversy left Bradbury , a founding member of the conservative Federalist Society , with no confirmation hearing before senators began a four - week break in December .
Concerned that Bush might use his constitutional authority to avoid the Senate confirmation process by appointing Bradbury during the holiday recess , senators scheduled 11 brief pro forma sessions to keep the Senate technically in session .

Just when you think that there can be no more outrageous proposals from the current lame duck government , and that it ’s down to a straight race between Barack Obama , a man with respect for the rule of law , and John McCain , who , I fear , may allow the malign spirits of Dick Cheney and David Addington to maintain a presence in the corridors of power , George W. Bush , the least popular president in history , has made a last - ditch attempt to secure his bellicose legacy by slipping an extraordinary passage into proposed legislation dealing with legal appeals filed by Guantánamo prisoners in the wake of the Supreme Court ’s ruling in Boumediene v. Bush .
As Eric Lichtblau described it in the New York Times , the president ’s advisers , believing that " many Americans may have forgotten " that " the United States is still at war with al - Qaeda "  which is an easy mistake to make , given that it is both dangerous and deceitful to describe resistance to small bands of terrorist criminals as a " war "  " want Congress to say so " and to " acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al - Qaeda , the Taliban , and associated organizations , who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of Americans . "
I must admit that I can’t actually understand why the president ’s advisers should regard this commitment as particularly important , as legislation passed by Congress in the wake of the 9/11 attacks  the Authorization for Use of Military Force , passed on Sept. 14 , 2001  has never been repealed .
This states , unequivocally , that " the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations , organizations , or persons he determines planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11 , 2001 , or harbored such organizations or persons , in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations , organizations , or persons . "
Notoriously , this is the legislation that launched the power grab that is the main legacy of the " War on Terror " for the executive branch of the United States : the open - ended declaration of war that enabled the president and his advisers to start two wars , undermine the U.S. Constitution , shred the Geneva Conventions , spurn habeas corpus , tear up the Bill of Rights , discard the Army Field Manual , create a system of trials for terrorists out of thin air , spy on American citizens with impunity , and pour scorn on the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman , or Degrading Treatment or Punishment .
I can only think that , like some sort of grotesque power couple ostentatiously renewing their wedding vows , Bush , Cheney , and Addington have put forward this legislation in an attempt to renew their own deathly vows of unending horror with Congress and the American people .
Myopic and arrogant to the last , they will presumably play this as an attempt to support John McCain and the Republican Party in the face of an assault on national security by backsliding liberals , whereas all clear - sighted Americans should see it for what it really is : another cynical attempt to absolve the administration of its vast catalog of war crimes by yet again attempting to convince the American public that they are America ’s saviors rather than a dictatorial executive branch , serving only their lust for power and the coffers of their blood - stained corporate allies , and that as a result they require the American people to live in a permanent state of paranoid and xenophobic fear .
Nothing would make historic sites more fun to visit than a golf cart that drives itself , navigates around obstacles and lets you concentrate on enjoying the scenery .
If the ' Verdino ' takes off , you just may have it .
A team of engineers from the University of La Laguna ( ULL ) in the Canary Islands designed the Verdino and have demonstrated it as a self - steering vehicle that can sense the road surface using a technique called Ant Colony Optimization ( ACO ) , based on the behavior used by ants to find the shortest way between their ant hill and sources of food .
The study ’s lead author , Rafael Arnay , from the ULL’s Department of Systems and Automatic Engineering and Computer Architecture and Technology , say that the ACO algorithms are used to resolve “ problems of combinatory optimization ” and were inspired directly by ants .
The Verdino uses ' ant colony optimization ' , the pheromone - based method ants use to track each other to food sources .
The ' pheromones ' the Verdino uses are artificial but the coolness is real .
In Nature , ants leave a trail of pheromones as they move , which can be detected by smell and followed by other members of the colony .
The pheromones evaporate over time , which means that the path used by those ants that move to and from the food source over the shortest distance is the most deeply reinforced by these chemical substances , and so is the one chosen by the other ants .
“ The ACO technique is based , similarly , on a colony of artificial ants , in other words computational agents that work cooperatively and communicate with each other by means of artificial pheromone trails , ” explains Arnay .
This technique has been chosen by Canary Island engineers to allow the Verdino to keep to the correct path along the road without the need for any driver .
The prototype looks like vehicles used on golf courses but it incorporates a camera that gathers the visual data necessary to apply the algorithms , as well as an internal control system that processes the data in real time .
The Verdino is programmed to even travel along unstructured roads , those without lines painted on the surface or with irregular edges caused by encroachment by soil or vegetation .
The engineers are currently testing the Verdino to be used as an internal transport system linking 25 housing units and a visitor center in a bioclimatic housing development being built by the Technological and Renewable Energy Institute in the south of Tenerife , and they describe the first results as “ very promising . ”
The researchers believe the self - guided system could be commercialized and used in vehicles for places such as historical town centers , tourist complexes , exhibition or sporting venues , shopping centers and industrial parks .
It could even be used within remote security systems or in adapted cars for elderly or disabled people .

In the Queen 's speech this autumn Gordon Brown 's government will announce a scheme to institute a database of every telephone call , email , and act of online usage by every resident of the UK .
It will propose that this information will be gathered , stored , and " made accessible " to the security and law enforcement agencies , local councils , and " other public bodies " .
This fact should be in equal parts incredible and nauseating .
It is certainly enraging and despicable .
Not even George Orwell in his most febrile moments could have envisaged a world in which every citizen could be so thoroughly monitored every moment of the day , spied upon , eavesdropped , watched , tracked , followed by CCTV cameras , recorded and scrutinised .
Our words and web searches , our messages and intimacies , are to be stored and made available to the police , the spooks , the local council – the local council ! – and " other public bodies " .
This Orwellian nightmare , additionally , is proposed for a world in which leading soi-disant liberal democracies run , and / or permit rendition flights to , Guantanamo Bay .
How many steps separate an innocent British citizen from some misinterpretation or interference or error in the collected and ' made accessible ' data of text messages and emails , and a forthcoming home - grown version of Guantanamo Bay for people whose pattern of phone calls does not fit the police definition of acceptable ?
Two things have made this ghastly development possible : the technology , and politicians .
The technology is way ahead of the game : Siemens of Germany are already supplying 60 countries with a device that monitors and integrates data from phone , email and internet activity ; its software establishes patterns of uses and alerts monitoring staff to deviations from the patterns .
As New Scientist reports , the system is already known to throw up huge numbers of false positives ; that could have been predicted by a rudimentary acquaintance with human nature and human life .
But it is a fact that has to be added to the brilliance and reliability of government and law enforcement agencies in keeping data secure , unhackable and unlosable .
The second point concerns the quality of our politicians .
They say they are putting us all under suspicion for our own good .
They wish to protect us against terrorists and criminals , and to make bureaucracy more efficient .
The efficiency of bureaucracy has one of its finest moments in the neat and sorted piles of false teeth , hair and spectacles at the gas chamber doors .
Oh no : better the milling crowd than the police - disciplined queues of bureaucratic efficiency ; better the irritation of dealing with human fallibility than the fear of dealing with jack - booted gendarmes whose grip on one 's arms follows stepping out of the queue .
But as to the first matter : protecting us – by making us all suspects , all potential criminals and terrorists – from terrorism and criminality .
Well : the first duty of our politicians should be to protect our liberties , and to encourage us to see that liberty carries risks , which we should be trusted to understand and accept so that we can make our own lives our own way .
But no : these politicians – Brown and Labour , once the party of the people – are going to keep us safe by not keeping our liberties safe ; they are going to keep us safe by making us unfree .
Yet the putative benefit of protecting us from terrorism and crime is unattainable .
They themselves say ' there is no 100 % guarantee of safety ' : but they are going to spy on us all anyway !
In fact they are going to create crime : a huge new criminal industry awaits for stealing , copying , falsely creating and manipulating that newly - created precious commodity , " identity " .
A huge new impetus awaits for techno - crime to disrupt the monitoring and data storage systems on which the government intends to spend billions of our tax money , creating its unblinking eye in our bedrooms .
As surely as night follows day , the new surveillance society will do more harm than good .
The potential for profoundly negative uses of technology has escaped us .
It is with despair that I conclude that we have to start all over again with the demos and resistance , the campaigns and arguments , to roll back this huge and ultimately destructive assault on our civil liberties .
Once upon a time the authorities worked at frightening everyone into thinking that the unblinking eye of a deity exercised surveillance and data - gathering over them .
Now we have Gordon Brown and Siemens , the real thing , not a myth : the unblinking eye of the security services , the local council , " other public bodies " , in our bedrooms , our text messages , our emails , our internet searches .
Torquemada and Stalin would have given their right arms for what Gordon Brown will tell us in this autumn 's Queen 's speech he is intending to introduce .
Brown has not even thought of that comparison , shame and double shame upon him .
Might it help to read the glutinous websites of the Home Office on surveillance and protection of our liberties ?
Enjoy , if you can : or weep .
Is this adequate to today , before the new universal surveillance comes on stream ?
Is it adequate to future developments in surveillance technology , to future even less benign governments , to increased " security " powers in actual or alleged future states of emergency ?
What new crimes , new criminals , new threats to society , will need to be plucked from the watched masses ?
Smokers ?
Readers of unauthorised books ?
Will old crimes return - homosexuality , Catholicism , Jewishness , atheism , adultery , pre-marital sex ?
Will every individual have to be a tight - lipped , right - thinking , timid , dutiful , obedient , queue - forming clone to escape the censure of the unblinking eye now being opened by the state upon us ?
We need to stop this assault on civil liberies going further , we need to roll back the attritions they have already suffered , and we need a rock solid written consitution to protect us from those who aim to make us all suspects in the gaze of the unblinking universal eye .
Excerpt from Stratfor ’s “ Intelligence Guidance : Dust Clearing In Georgia ” , 9 August 2008 — Stratfor does this sort of thing well , among the best at this of the public geopolotical shops in my opinion .
Some major questions remain open .
First , what motivated the Georgians to invade South Ossetia on the night of Aug .
7 ? Why did they believe that they could do that without incurring a Russian response ?
Did the Russians indicate to them some form of nonbelligerence and then double - cross them ?
The second , even more intriguing , question is the American role in all of this .
The United States has hundreds of advisers in Georgia and could not possibly have been ignorant of Georgian intentions .
The United States also has ample means of technical intelligence with which it could have noted the Russian buildup and perhaps even known Moscow ’s intentions .
The United States is Georgia ’s patron .
What happened in Tbilisi and Washington to allow the Georgians to walk into a Russian nutcracker ?
There are levels of intrigue here that we do not yet understand .
In some ways they are more important than the final outcome .
About the blogosphere ’s coverage of the conflict
Joshua
Foust sums it up , posted 9 August at Registan ( brief excerpt ; I recommend reading the full post ) :
As the fighting in South Ossetia heats up , it ’s interesting to see the rush by all the bloggers to do the biggest , grandest roundups .
By looking at this , you see those who think they ’re clever by either stating the obvious ( Russia wants to split Georgia , Abkhazia is getting involved ) , the conventional wisdom ( Russia wants to disrupt the Georgia energy corridor ) , or the plain old wrong ( Russia wants to annex Georgia ) .
The examples are countless , and while not necessarily wrong , none are really saying anything those who are knowledgable of the situation have n’t been saying for months or years .
… Basically , ignore all of that .
We will not have a useful picture of the minutae of the fighting for at least several days ( really ?
Russia will own Georgian airspace just like that ? ) , until some good correspondents get on the scene and we ’re not left hearing only what the various foreign ministries say .
… But even that is just conventional wisdom .
Who cares ?
It ’s called conventional wisdom because everyone already knows it .
Finding something new or interesting about this conflict is tough , and the blogosphere is being more hurtful than helpful in offering anything of value .
I agree .
Much of these are somewhere between waste of time and providing the illustion of information .

ST . PAUL ( Reuters ) - Republican candidate John McCain said on Wednesday that if elected president , he will capture al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
“ President Clinton had opportunities to get Osama bin Laden .
President Bush had opportunities to get Osama bin Laden .
I know how to do it and I ’ll do it , ” he told ABC ’s “ World News ” in an interview .
“ I understand and I have the knowledge and the background and the experience to make the right judgments .
Senator Obama does not , ” McCain said in a reference to his Democratic rival for the White House , Barack Obama .
McCain , who was a Navy fighter pilot and spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , said Obama “ does n’t know how -- how the world works nor how the military works . ”
An early backer of the Iraq war , the Arizona senator has assailed Obama ’s judgment in opposing the war .
He was asked to respond to Obama ’s accusation last week that McCain ’s focus on the Iraq war rather than pursuing al Qaeda had allowed bin Laden to escape in Afghanistan .
Al Qaeda is blamed for the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States which killed almost 3,000 people in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania .
Pourquoi rénover sa salle de bain ?
Si on décide de refaire en totalité une salle bain , les travaux seront considérables et le de devis s’élèvera alors lui aussi .
Il faudra alors y allouer un budget conséquent .
La solution la plus simple reste donc la renovation .
Mais pour une bonne renovation salle bain , il faut prendre en considération plusieurs éléments .
Il existe de nombreuses photos renovation salle de bain qui font rêver .
La plupart du temps , la douche italienne est à l’honneur .
Mais pour en avoir une , il y a beaucoup de paramètres qu’il faut considérer notamment la plomberie .
Toujours en ce qui concerne la douche , on a le choix entre cabine douche et baignoire .
Pour faire le bon choix , il faut surtout considérer l’espace disponible ainsi que le budget alloué pour la renovation .
Le mieux pour renover salle bain c’est de faire appel à une entreprise pour établir le devis des travaux .
Prenez bien en compte que , lorsque vous rénovez votre salle de bain , de nombreuses saletés vont être déposées un peu partout : il sera donc nécessaire de faire particulièrement attention au ménage dans cette pièce pendant les jours qui suivront la fin de la rénovation .
Il en va évidemment de même si vous rénovez votre maison entièrement .
But Mr Zogby cautioned that the McCain lead might turn out to be based on the enthusiasm generated by last week 's Republican convention and therefore temporary .
Most of the Monday polls reflected samples taken on Friday , the best possible day for Mr McCain because of televised coverage of his Thursday night speech , which was watched by nearly 40 million people .

Barr Met Deadline , Demands Law Be Enforced
The Bob Barr presidential campaign has stated “ serious legal consequences ” will occur should Senators Barack Obama and John McCain be allowed on the Texas general election ballot after they knowingly missed the state ’s deadline to file .
According to documents obtained by the Barr campaign , neither John McCain nor Barack Obama complied with Texas Election Code 192.031 , which requires that filings must be submitted ‘ before 5 p.m. of the 70th day before presidential Election Day , ” listing the “ names of the party ’s nominees for president and vice - president . ”
“ The Election Code of the State of Texas imposes requirements on a political party , which must be met if its candidates for president and vice - presidents are to appear on the general election ballot , ” Russell Verney , Bob Barr ’s campaign manager stated in a letter sent to the Texas Secretary of State ’s office .
“ The Democratic Party and Mr. Obama , and the Republican Party and Mr. McCain , blatantly ignored the Texas statutory deadline . ”
The deadline , which was set at 5 p.m. on August 26 , passed before Sen.
Obama was nominated and before Sen.
McCain had even selected his running mate .
“ The law is clear , and it was clearly not followed , ” says Verney .
“ The Texas Supreme Court was emphatic when it stated that the law ‘ does not allow political parties or candidates to ignore statutory deadlines . . .’
Senators Obama and McCain did not file by the deadline ; therefore , Texas should abide by the laws it created .
No political party or candidate is above the law . ”
Libertarian Party presidential candidate Bob Barr represented the 7th District of Georgia in the U. S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 .
The Libertarian Party is America ’s third largest political party , founded in 1971 as an alternative to the two main political parties .

Seven indigenous Maori tribes have signed New Zealand 's largest settlement over grievances arising from 19th century losses of lands , forests and fisheries during European settlement of the country .
The $ NZ420 million ( $ A334 million ) Treelords agreement will transfer ownership of 176,000 hectares of plantation forest and forest rents from the central government to the central North Island tribes .
Hundreds of Maori , some wearing traditional feather cloaks , gathered at the nation 's parliament in Wellington to witness the signing of the agreement .
Chants , challenges and conch shell notes rang out during the ceremony ; some wiped tears from their eyes during the speeches and signing .
The seven tribes include more than 100,000 people .
Democrats continue to dominate Republicans in voter registration in at least eight states expected to be among the most competitive in the November presidential election , an Arizona Republic analysis shows .
In Colorado , for example , Democrats picked up a net 54,000 registered voters from April to August .
Republicans added a net 11,000 in the same period , state records show .
Republicans still hold a narrow lead over Democrats in registered voters in that state .
Pennsylvania added 107,000 registered Democrats from April to early September , while Republicans added 2,700 .
Democrats already led registration there .
Fifteen states are considered key battlegrounds in the race for the White House .
Six states do n't track the party affiliation of voters and another , West Virginia , has n't updated its figures since spring .
The registration trends are a continuation of a pattern that played out for Democrats throughout the primary season .
The surge of newly minted voters favors Barack Obama , the Democratic nominee , but only if he is able to do what few presidential candidates have done : get these new , often younger , voters to the polls in November .
John McCain , the Republican nominee , figures to draw from a smaller but more reliable pool of supporters , experts say .
Still , the registration trend suggests Democrats are better positioned for the election in those states .
" The Republicans would love to have those numbers working in their favor , " said Thomas Patterson , a government professor at Harvard University .
" This is motivated registration .
. . .
This is , no doubt , a net plus for Democrats . "
" That 's a precursor to turnout ( in November ) .
That 's good news for Democrats , " said Henry Brady , a political - science professor at the University of California - Berkeley .
He said turnout in battleground states has been higher among newly registered voters than it is in less politically competitive states .
Both parties should expect at least 40 percent of the new registrants to show up in November , Brady said .
Among existing registrants , elections officials expect turnout higher than that .
Kenneth Bickers , a political - science professor at the University of Colorado , said the registration figures in his state suggest , but hardly guarantee , that Obama could be competitive there .
" The profile of a McCain voter is someone who is likely to vote no matter what , " Bickers said .
Historically , enthusiasm fades among many who register as Democrats , Bickers said , and GOP voters turn out more reliably .
Obama successfully marshaled young voters during the Democratic primaries , but many states held caucuses , a format that typically draws only a fraction of voters .
His performance there showed organizational strength but not necessarily broad appeal to voters .
Still , the registration trend is in line with the fundraising patterns playing out across the country in the presidential and congressional races .
Together , they underscore the reason Democrats think the party could strengthen its control in both the House and Senate and win the White House .
Most states saw a spike in voters registering as independents , and some , including Nevada and North Carolina , registered more independents than Republicans in recent months .
Democrats already had a registered - voter advantage this year in six of the eight battleground states that register voters by party .
But four years ago , President Bush won six of these eight states to clinch a second term .
Other likely swing states , such as Michigan and Wisconsin , do n't register voters by party .
Ohio allows voters to change party affiliation at will , making it difficult to gauge where voter loyalties lie .
The Columbus Dispatch , however , reported that Ohio has added 1 million registered Democrats since 2004 , while Republicans added 356,000 voters in that time .
Polling and recent voting history suggest that voters in at least some states , like Florida and North Carolina , may register as Democrats but vote for Republicans in November .
In Florida , Democrats gained 258,000 potential voters from December to July , while the GOP added 101,000 .
Democrats had a 300,000 - voter advantage before the changes .
In November 2004 , Democrats had 369,000 more registered voters than Republicans did , yet the state voted for Bush by 381,000 votes .
In North Carolina , Democrats have picked up a net 50,000 registered voters over the GOP since May .
They dominate overall registration by about 750,000 voters .
But in 2004 , with a similar edge , the state still voted for Bush by 400,000 .
Polls indicate McCain is ahead in both those states .
In New Hampshire , Democrats netted 4,400 additional voters from January to August , while Republicans lost 3,100 .
In New Mexico , Democrats gained a net 13,000 voters over Republicans and hold a commanding 200,000 - voter advantage .
Still , recent polling suggests the state could be as tight as the past two elections :
It went for Al Gore in 2000 and Bush in 2004 .
Democrats also added to their existing registration leads in Iowa and Nevada .
These states , however , had slim Republican majorities among registered voters four years ago .
Republicans have nearly lost their lead among registered voters in New Hampshire and have a narrow lead in Colorado , though independents are now the state 's largest bloc .
The registration figures for half the swing states were tallied before McCain named Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate .
She is already cited as stirring conservatives , which could alter registration patterns in the closing weeks .
Palin has ceded control of Alaska to John McCain ’s campaign staff .
That ca n’t be good for Alaskans :
Gov. Sarah Palin has surrendered important gubernatorial duties to the Republican presidential campaign .
McCain staff are handling public and press questions about actions she has taken as governor .
The governor who said , “ Hold me accountable , ” is hiding behind the hired guns of the McCain campaign to avoid accountability .
Is it too much to ask that Alaska ’s governor speak for herself , directly to Alaskans , about her actions as Alaska ’s governor ?
Apparently , the answer to the question is “ Yes . ” Instead , Alaska ’s governor is speaking directly to the rest of America — and , like her running mate on the Palin - McCain ticket , is lying to our faces .
“ People want presidents who lead and relate to them  they do n’t want presidents who analyze and seem above it all , ” said G. Terry Madonna , a pollster and director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster , Pa . “ Obama still comes across as dispassionate to the point of coolness .
He is so comfortable in his own skin , he can be hard to connect with for people who are struggling . ”
Discussing the Iraq war earlier in the campaign , Mr. Obama did not need to come across as livid because many voters saw him as right : he was the only top - tier presidential candidate who opposed the war from the start .
Now the economy is the issue of the day , and Mr. Obama has largely been delivering Mr. Fix - It speeches and pointed critiques .
“ For the candidates , it ’s show , not tell , ” said Ruth Sherman , a political communications consultant .
“ Saying you understand is not enough , you have to be able to show it .
Obama ’s dispassionate approach on the economic crisis fails him on this front because his delivery contradicts his words . ”
Whereas former Vice President Al Gore and Senator John Kerry struck populist tones during their presidential bids , Mr. Obama is having none of it .
For better or worse , his performance in this time of financial peril goes to the heart of who he is .
Mr. Obama may have looked subdued as he arrived at the White House on Thursday for a meeting on the economy , but he also stayed calm and ultimately prevailed at a similarly urgent point in his primary campaign against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , whose turn toward populism helped her win the Ohio and Pennsylvania primaries .
“ I think it would be more popular in the short term politically to be more populist on the bailout and Wall Street , ” said Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina , a Democrat , “ but people know in their gut that a populist approach wo n’t solve the problem . ”
" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 20 - A grammar for ( pseudo ) XML
grammar XML { token TOP { ^ < xml > $ } ; token xml { < text > [ < tag > < text > ]* } ; token text {
<-[<>&]>* } ; rule tag { ' < '( \w+ ) < attributes >* [ | '/>' # a single tag | '>' < xml > ' </' $ 0 '>' # an opening and a closing tag ] } ; token attributes { \w + '= " ' <-[ " <> ]>* ' " ' } ; } ;
So far the focus of these articles has been the Perl 6 language , independently of what has been implemented so far .
To show you that it 's not a purely fantasy language , and to demonstrate the power of grammars , this lesson shows the development of a grammar that parses basic XML , and that runs with Rakudo .
Please follow the instructions on http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/ to obtain and build Rakudo , and try it out yourself .
For our purposes XML is quite simple : it consists of plain text and nested tags that can optionally have attributes .
So here are few tests for what we want to parse as valid " XML " , and what not :
my @tests = ( [ 1 , ' abc ' ] , # 1 [ 1 , '< a ></a>' ] , # 2 [ 1 , '..< ab> foo</ab>dd ' ] , # 3 [ 1 , '< a >< b>c</b></a>' ] , # 4 [ 1 , ' < a href = " foo " >< b>c</b></a>' ] , # 5 [ 1 , ' < a empty= " " >< b>c</b></a>' ] , # 6 [ 1 , '< a >< b>c</b><c></c></a>' ] , # 7 [ 0 , ' < ' ] , # 8 [ 0 , '<a>b</b>' ] , # 9 [ 0 , '< a >b</a' ] , # 10 [ 0 , ' < a > b < / a href= " " >' ] , # 11 [ 1 , '< a />' ] , # 12 [ 1 , '< a />' ] , # 13 ) ; my $ count = 1 ; for @tests -> $t { my $s = $ t [ 1 ] ; my $ M = XML.parse ( $s ) ; if ! ( $ M xor $ t [ 0 ] ) { say " ok $ count - ' $s ' " ; } else { say " not ok $ count - ' $s ' " ; } $ count ++ ; }
This is a list of both " good " and " bad " XML , and a small test script that runs these tests by calling XML. parse ( $ string ) .
By convention the rule that matches what the grammar should match is named TOP .
( As you can see from test 1 we do n't require a single root tag , but it would be trivial to add this restriction ) .
The essence of XML is surely the nesting of tags , so we 'll focus on the second test first .
Place this at the top of the test script :
grammar XML { token TOP { ^ < tag > $ } token tag { ' < ' ( \w+ ) '>' '</' $ 0 '>' } } ;
Now run the script :
$ ./ perl6 xml-01.pl not ok 1 - ' abc ' ok 2 - '< a></a >' not ok 3 - '..< ab> foo < / ab > dd ' not ok 4 - '< a>< b>c</b></a>' not ok 5 - ' < a href= " foo " >< b>c</b></a>' not ok 6 - ' < a empty= " " >< b>c</b></a>' not ok 7 - '< a>< b>c</b><c></c></a>' ok 8 - ' < ' ok 9 - '< a>b</b>' ok 10 - ' < a >b</a' ok 11 - ' < a >b</a href= " " >' not ok 12 - ' < a/>' not ok 13 - ' < a />'
So this simple rule parses one pair of start tag and end tag , and correctly rejects all four examples of invalid XML .
The first test should be easy to pass as well , so let 's try this :
grammar XML { token TOP { ^ < xml > $ } ; token xml { < text > | < tag > } ; token text {
<-[<>&]>* } ; token tag { ' < ' ( \w+ ) '>' '</' $ 0 '>' } } ;
( Remember , <-[... ]> is a negated character class . )
And run it :
$ ./perl6 xml-03.pl ok 1 - ' abc ' not ok 2 - '< a></a>' ( rest unchanged )
Why in the seven hells did the second test stop working ?
The answer is that Rakudo does n't do longest token matching yet ( update 2013 - 01 : it does now ) , but matches sequentially .
< text > matches the empty string ( and thus always ) , so < text > | < tag > never even tries to match < tag > .
Reversing the order of the two alternations would help .
But we do n't just want to match either plain text or a tag anyway , but random combinations of both of them :
token xml { < text > [ < tag > < text > ]* } ;
( [...] are non-capturing groups , like ( ? : ... ) is in Perl 5 ) .
And low and behold , the first two tests both pass .
The third test , ..< ab> foo </ ab >dd , has text between opening and closing tag , so we have to allow that next .
But not only text is allowed between tags , but arbitrary XML , so let 's just call < xml > there :
token tag { ' <' ( \w+ ) '>' < xml > '</' $ 0 '>' } ./ perl6 xml-05.pl ok 1 - ' abc ' ok 2 - '< a></a>' ok 3 - '..< ab> foo </ ab> dd ' ok 4 - '< a>< b>c</b></a>' not ok 5 - ' < a href= " foo " >< b>
c</b></a>' ( rest unchanged )
We can now focus on attributes ( the href = " foo " stuff ) :
token tag { ' <' ( \w + ) < attribute >* '>' < xml > '</'
$ 0 '>' } ; token attribute { \w+ '= " ' <-[ " <> ]>* \ " } ;
But this does n't make any new tests pass .
The reason is the blank between the tag name and the attribute .
Instead of adding \s + or \s * in many places we 'll switch from token to rule , which implies the : sigspace modifier :
rule tag { ' < '( \w+ ) < attribute >* '>' < xml > '< /'$ 0 '>' } ; token attribute { \w + '= " ' <-[ " <> ]>* \ " } ;
Now all tests pass , except the last two :
ok 1 - ' abc ' ok 2 - '< a ></a>' ok 3 - '..< ab> foo </ ab> dd ' ok 4 - '< a>< b>c</b></a>' ok 5 - ' < a href= " foo " >< b>
c</b></a>' ok 6 - ' < a empty= " " >< b>c</b></a>' ok 7 - '< a>< b>c</b><c></c></a>' ok 8 - ' < ' ok 9 - '< a>b</b>' ok 10 - ' < a >b</a' ok 11 - ' < a >b</a href= " " >' not ok 12 - ' < a/>' not ok 13 - ' < a />'
These contain un - nested tags that are closed with a single slash / .
No problem to add that to rule tag :
rule tag { ' < '( \w+ ) < attribute >* [ | '/>' | '>' < xml > '</'$ 0 ' >' ] } ;
All tests pass , we 're happy , our first grammar works well .
Playing with grammars is much more fun that reading about playing , so here 's what you could implement :
plain text can contain entities like &
I do n't know if XML tag names are allowed to begin with a number , but the current grammar allows that .
You might look it up in the XML specification , and adapt the grammar if needed .
plain text can contain <![ CDATA [ ... ] ]> blocks , in which xml - like tags are ignored and < and the like do n't need to be escaped
blocks , in which xml - like tags are ignored and and the like do n't need to be escaped Real XML allows a preamble like < ?xml version = " 0.9 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> and requires one root tag which contains the rest ( You 'd have to change some of the existing test cases )
and requires one root tag which contains the rest ( You 'd have to change some of the existing test cases )
You could try to implement a pretty - printer for XML by recursively walking through the match object $ / .
( This is non-trivial ; you might have to work around a few Rakudo bugs , and maybe also introduce some new captures ) .
( Please do n't post solutions to this as comments in this blog ; let others have the same fun as you had ;-) .
Have fun hacking .
It 's powerful and fun

Virgin Media has sent about 800 letters to customers warning them that they should not be downloading illegal music files via file - sharing sites .
It is part of a 10 - week campaign it is running in conjunction with the BPI to " educate " users about downloads .
The BPI , the body which represents the UK record industry , told the BBC that " thousands more letters " would be sent .
Its stricter stance on illegal downloaders might result in some ISPs being taken to court , it told BBC News .
Refuseniks
The BPI wants all UK ISPs to sign up to a so - called three strikes policy - where users of file sharing networks get two warnings and are then disconnected if they are sharing copyright files .
So far only Virgin Media has officially signed up and it is keen to stress that currently it is running an education - only campaign and that no - one has been thrown off the network .
Virgin said the wording on the envelope which contains the warning letter sent to 800 customers - which threatens consumers with disconnection - was a " mistake " .
This would be reviewed in mid-August , said a Virgin Media spokesman .

BPI chief executive Geoff Taylor told BBC
News that the body was prepared to back up the education campaign with legal action , including taking ISPs to court .
" If we have to go to court , we will go to court and we will win , " he said .
One customer who received a letter told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat programme that he was unhappy with Virgin Media .
It is doomed to fail
Virgin customer Will McGree
Newsbeat talks to Virgin customers Will McGree received a letter in June , warning him that legal action could be taken against him .
He said : " It 's doomed to fail .
Virgin Media will lose a lot of customers over this because people do n't like to be accused of stealing music over their morning coffee .
" It made me feel betrayed .
I was under the impression that I paid Virgin Media money to keep my internet connection protected and safe . "
He said no - one in his flat had been file - sharing and that it was possible someone had accessed his wireless network from outside the building .
Becky Hogge , executive director of the Open Rights Group , said the letters were a disproportionate response from the music industry .
" We need to protect users from punitive measures , " she said .
She said the music industry had to be in a position of offering a viable alternative before it clamped down on the activities of some users .
" Stopping illicit file - sharing might not be as effective a measure as trying to monetise it , " she said .
Some ISPs such as Carphone Warehouse , have refused to participate and the BPI did not rule out the possibility of taking such refuseniks to court .
Others , such as BT , have sent letters to subscribers threatening them with disconnection although it said this is not a new policy .
" We have not joined any " crusades " , the telco said in a statement .
" We do work with various bodies to help them protect their copyright material and will sometimes pass on warning notices to customers on their behalf where we feel this is appropriate .
If a customer continues to be in breach of our terms and conditions then BT has the right to suspend or terminate that customer 's account , though we work closely with customers to avoid this where possible , " the statement read .
The industry has been given until spring of next year to find a solution to illegal downloaders or face legislation .
The music industry says new laws could be introduced Youth - skewed The current system involves the BPI policing file sharing networks .
It looks for illegal traffic and identifies the IP address from which it has come and informs the ISP .
There is no distinction made between someone who has downloaded one illegal track and someone who has downloaded thousands .
A joint letter from Virgin and the BPI is then sent to the individual .
" This is about education .
We make no assumptions about who is at fault .
It may be someone in the family or someone illegally using their wi-fi connection , " said a Virgin Media spokesman .
With conservative estimates suggesting a fifth of Europeans are involved in file sharing , some experts question how much impact such a system can have .
" File sharing is very youth - skewed .
The BPI is n't going to close the door on the problem but it can get at the families whose kids are file sharing without their knowledge , " said Mark Mulligan , an analyst with Jupiter Research .
Virgin is keen to stress that the 800 or so letters it has so far sent are a drop in the ocean compared to its 3.8 m user base .
" In the scheme of things that is a relatively small number , " said Ian Fogg , analyst with Jupiter Research .
He said that ISPs faced a difficult balancing act between conforming to the BPI 's new rules and pleasing their own customers .
" It is a sensitive issue for providers .
File sharers are using up network capacity and therefore pushing up their costs and illegal downloads compete with their own music services , " he said .
" They need to be seen to be doing enough so they do n't get sued and to control their costs but also need to be careful not to upset their customers . "
Three strikes and you 're in The record industry has long grappled with how to wrest back control of digital music .
According to Jupiter Research , a fifth of Europeans use file sharing networks .
Paid - for digital music services such as iTunes are used by just 10 % and make up just 8 % of overall music revenue .
The BPI admitted that the current mechanisms for selling music were " broken " .
The new strategy will see it negotiating licensed content deals with ISPs who have pursued file sharers .
" We want people to see this not as three strikes and you 're out but three strikes and you 're in to legitimate music services , " said Frederico Bolza , head of strategy at SonyBMG .
Some DRM - free material may be made available and the new subscription models will allow users to keep some of the tunes they download , he said .
Geoff Taylor , chief executive of the BPI , said the details of the services were yet to be decided but that there are likely to a variety of models on offer that would be " easy and cheap " .
The form they take will be crucial , thinks Mr Mulligan .
" Charging a tenner a month has n't worked .
Ideally it needs to be incredibly cheap or free , with a massive catalogue that can be transferrable , " he said .
Mr Taylor admitted that the BPI 's current campaign was unlikely to stop file sharing completely but he did think the idea that the web was home to free stuff needs to be challenged .
" There is a phenomenal amount of piracy out there and we believe that the idea that 95 % of content on the net is free is not sustainable .
We do n't believe that society can allow the free consumption of content to persist , " he said .

In the newest in a line of studies showing the potential value of vitamin D , new research from Johns Hopkins University shows that not getting enough of the so - called " sunshine vitamin " may increase the risk of early death by more than a quarter .
Researchers used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and looked at people 's vitamin D levels and then death from various causes .
While the risk of death for people with low vitamin D from any single cause was only slightly elevated , the broader picture showed a 26 percent increase in death rates .
" [ Low ] vitamin D levels seem to confer an increased risk of dying from any cause , " said Dr. Erin Michos , a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins , and one of the lead investigators of the study .
She said that the study showed an association between low vitamin D and death from heart disease , and said further study may reveal vitamin D to be a sign of impending heart disease .
" We think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin D deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease , putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors , such as age , gender , family history , smoking , high blood cholesterol levels , high blood pressure , lack of exercise , obesity and diabetes , " Michos said .
The study was published in this week 's issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine .
But the study 's researchers and others were quick to say that the study provides absolutely no evidence for now that taking vitamin D can reduce the risk of heart disease .
" Before we tell all Americans out there that this will definitely prevent heart attack , we need some clinical trials , " Michos said .
Some took it a step further and questioned whether low vitamin D levels can even be considered a risk factor at all at this point .
" A relative increase in risk of death of 26 percent is not trivial , but not huge , either , " said Dr. David Katz , director of the prevention research center at Yale University School of Medicine .
" Consider that being physically active , not smoking , and eating well could reduce the risk of premature death by as much as 80 percent , " said Katz .
" We would not want people to get the impression that a vitamin D supplement is a panacea .
The findings are by no means that significant . "
Others strongly agreed .
" It ca n't be considered a risk factor with the strength of cholesterol and hypertension until further studies are done , " said Dr. Melvyn Rubenfire , the director of preventive cardiology at the University of Michigan .
But Rubenfire did not dismiss the importance of adequate vitamin D intake .
" I do encourage patients with CAD and other risk factors to be sure they have both adequate calcium and vitamin D , particularly those that use sun block , " he said .
In fact , use of sunscreen in response to concerns about melanoma was cited by a number of physicians as a reason why many Americans are below advisable levels of vitamin D .
" I have been checking vitamin D studies in my patients for the last year and a half , and I have been astounded by the number of patients [ with healthy lifestyles ] that are ' D '- deficient , " said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer , a clinical associate professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine .
" I have a relatively ' compliant ' patient population .
I advise sunscreen to prevent skin cancer [ and wrinkles ] .
For the most part , my patients listen .
But sunscreen with an SPF factor of 8 or more ( and I recommend at least SPF 30 or higher ) reduces the skin 's ability to produce vitamin D by 95 percent .
So , the amount of dietary vitamin D that was enough in the past may not be enough now that we are protecting our skin [ and trying to prevent skin cancer ] . "
Many doctors cite the importance of vitamin D because of the relatively high levels of deficiency among Americans .
A 2005 study from Drew University and UCLA showed that more than 41 percent of men and 53 percent of women had mildly or severely deficient levels of vitamin D .
Getting Up D Levels
And while vitamin D's impact on heart disease remains unclear , doctors recognize that its intake has other important benefits .
This new study adds to the mounting evidence that vitamin D deficiency is epidemic and that higher doses are needed , " said Joanne Shearer , the director of food and nutrition services at Avera Heart Hospital in Sioux Falls , S.D .
" I would favor screening for vitamin D deficiency as we screen for blood sugar , cholesterol , blood pressure , etc .
There are so many medical conditions that are now associated with vitamin D deficiency , that it seems like a prudent public health measure to take .
Vitamin D screening and treatment is relatively inexpensive , versus the cost of treating the disease associated with vitamin D deficiency . "
So , how should Americans make up the deficits in vitamin D ?
" It would certainly be prudent to recommend daily consumption of low - fat and fat - free milk , and to educate people about other sources , " said diet expert Keith - Thomas Ayoob of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine .
" Fatty fish ( salmon , mackerel , sardines , etc. ) are loaded with vitamin D , for example . "
Why Is This Vitamin Different ?
Dr. James O'Keefe , a cardiologist at the Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City , Mo. , said that while studies like these only present preliminary findings , vitamin D may prove to be a bit more important than other vitamins taken as supplements .
He noted that the latest study 's findings were unclear because many of the risk factors for heart disease , like obesity , can actually cause a deficiency in vitamin D . So , it may be a marker rather than an agent .
" It might just be a marker , but unlike the other vitamins , it 's a hormone , " O'Keefe said , referring to the fact that vitamin D is actually produced by the human body -- from being out in the sun , for example .
The problem , he said , is that many people have deficiencies in the vitamin that can be easily diagnosed and corrected .
While surpluses of vitamins will often have no effect , getting a deficient vitamin up to speed will , as in the case of British sailors who avoided scurvy by eating limes .
And those chronic deficiencies are why people should monitor vitamin D levels , according to O'Keefe .
" People should know their vitamin D. Measure it .
If it 's abnormal , treat it , " he said .
And , in addition to eating fish or taking a daily dose of the less popular cod liver oil , O'Keefe said that some sunshine should be a part of everyone 's regimen .
" We 're not designed to be moles ; we 're designed to be outdoor creatures , " he said .
" Prudent sun exposure not only feels good , it 's good for vitamin D levels . "

A parasitic plant that sucks water and nutrients from its plant host also taps into its communications traffic , a new report finds .
The research could lead to new ways to combat parasites that attack crop plants .
Professor Neelima Sinha and colleagues at the UC Davis Section of Plant Biology studied dodder vines growing on tomato plants in the lab .
They found that RNA molecules from the host could be found in the dodder up to a foot ( 30 cm ) from the point where the parasite had plumbed itself into the host .
Plants often use small RNA molecules as messengers between different parts of the plant .
In a paper published in Science in 2001 , Sinha 's group showed that RNA could travel from a graft into the rest of the plant and affect leaf shape .
Plants can also use specific RNAs to fight off viruses .
Picking up these RNA messengers could help the parasite synchronize its lifecycle with that of the host plant , Sinha said .
" It might be important for the parasite to know when the host is flowering , so it can flower at the same time , " before the host dies , she said .
Sinha 's lab holds a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to research plant parasites , notably Striga , which attacks maize crops in Africa .
Striga cannot be imported into the U.S. , so dodder serves as a model system .
Ultimately , the researchers hope to use host RNA to trigger a change in the parasite that kills it or makes it less damaging , Sinha said .
Finding that host RNA molecules are transported through the parasite is a step in characterizing the system , she said .
A paper describing the work is published online by the journal New Phytology .
Co-authors on the paper are UC Davis postdoctoral researcher Rakefet David - Schwartz , graduate students Steven Runo and Brad Townsley , and Jesse Machuka of Kenyatta University , Kenya .

LAS VEGAS – The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority filed a suit in federal court on Friday seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent three undergraduate students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from presenting a talk at the DefCon hacker conference this weekend about security vulnerabilities in payment systems used in the Massachusetts mass transit system .
The transit authority , known as the MBTA , is seeking to prevent the students from " publicly stating or indicating " that electronic passenger tickets used on the transit system have been compromised until the MBTA can fix security flaws in the system .
It further seeks to bar the students from releasing any tools or providing any information that would allow someone to hack the transit system and obtain free rides .
The MBTA says in its complaint that disclosure of the flaws , before it has a chance to fix them , will cause irreparable harm to the transit system .
The three student researchers , Zack Anderson , R.J. Ryan and Alessandro Chiesa , are scheduled to give a talk Sunday afternoon entitled " The Anatomy of a Subway Hack : Breaking Crypto RFIDs & Magstripes of Ticketing Systems . "
According to a description of the talk posted on the conference website , the students plan to discuss vulnerabilities in the fare collection system of Boston 's T subway system and to demonstrate how they reverse engineered the mag stripe on paper passenger tickets known as the CharlieTicket as well as how they cracked smartcard tickets known as the CharlieCard .
They also plan to release several open source tools that they created in the course of their transit card research .
The MBTA , which oversees the T subway , operates the fifth largest transit system in the United States , servicing 175 towns and cities .
It uses both the CharlieTicket and the CharlieCard in its passenger payment system .
The CharlieCard , which was first used in January 2007 , provides the MBTA with nearly $ 500,000 in revenue per weekday , according to the court documents .
More than 68 percent of passengers use it to pay their fare .
The CharlieCard is a MiFare Classic card , which was the subject of much controversy earlier this year after Dutch researchers showed how they were able to hack the cards .
But the MBTA says in the court papers that it has substantially enhanced the security of its MiFare cards with proprietary encryption , making previously reported flaws with the MiFare Classic card irrelevant to the CharlieCard .
The MBTA filed its suit in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts against the three students and their university , stating that the students violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in accessing protected MBTA computers without authorization , for which the MBTA seeks unspecified damages .
The MBTA also asserts that MIT and the student 's supervisor , computer science professor Ron Rivest , failed to properly supervise the students to prevent them from attacking and harming the transit system .
The MBTA first became aware of the researchers ' talk on July 30 when one of its vendors pointed it to the DefCon website where the talk was listed on the conference schedule .
A description of the talk began with the provocative line , " Want free subway rides for life ? " and discussed how the researchers social engineered transit employees to accomplish their hack of the transit cards .
On August 5th , the court documents reveal , a detective with the transit police and an FBI agent met with the MIT students , Rivest , and an MIT lawyer to discuss their concerns and inquire about what the students would disclose in their talk .
But the students would not provide the MBTA with a copy of the materials they planned to present in their talk or information about the security flaws they found in the transit system .
After that meeting the MBTA says the description of the talk on the conference website was revised to delete the reference to " free subway rides for life " and alter the comment about social engineering transit employees .
( The image below right , taken from the court document , shows changes made to the description of the talk .
Text with a line through it indicates deletions ; underlined words indicate additions .
The original description still appears in the printed version of the schedule that is being handed out to conference attendees . )
The MBTA asserted in the court filing that it sought the restraining order on Friday after again requesting , and failing to receive from the students , a copy of their presentation materials .
Efforts to reach the three students and the MBTA for comment were unsuccessful .
A spokeswoman for the DefCon conference said she was aware that the MBTA had met with the students to discuss the talk but thought the meeting had satisfied the MBTA 's concerns .
She was not aware that the MBTA had gone to court to halt the talk .
She noted , however , that the restraining order would have little effect in suppressing the information at this point since the speakers ' slides were on the conference CD - ROM , which had already been distributed to conference attendees Friday morning .
" The MBTA was a day late , " she said .
UPDATE : The Electronic Frontier Foundation is representing the students .
A hearing in the case occurred this morning in Massachusetts and a judge issued the restraining order .
Jennifer Granick , an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , said through a DefCon spokeswoman that EFF advised the students to pull their talk .
UPDATE II : Among the documents the MBTA filed with its declaration to the court today is a vulnerability assessment report ( . pdf ) that the three students gave the MBTA about the flaws in its system .
The document is dated August 8 , the day the MBTA filed its lawsuit against the students , and is essentially the information the students declined to give the MBTA before it filed its lawsuit .
Ironically , the document reveals more about the vulnerability in the MBTA system than the slides that the restraining order sought to suppress contain .
The vulnerability assessment report is now available for anyone to download from the Massachusetts court 's electronic records system .
The EFF will be holding a press conference at DefCon this afternoon to discuss the case .

In terms of maps of the U.S. , Alaska has long been neglected .
Each morning on tv , the national weather maps represent our massive state as a shrunken - head version of itself tucked off in the left corner next to Hawaii … that is until today .
McCain ’s announcement in his choice of Vice President of the United States is … Sarah Palin ?
I thought last Tuesday ’s statewide election results were a nightmare in which Palin played a starring role .
Palin publicly stated her ‘ personal opinion ’ on how she would vote against the Clean Water Initiative six days before the vote of her people at a televised news conference .
The CWI would have placed important clean water and salmon protections in place for the proposed Pebble Mine .
The Pebble Mine is THE mother of all open pit nightmares that is planned by British mining giant Anglo American and it ’s junior Canadian partner Northern Dynasty Minerals .
At stake is the world ’s largest sockeye ( red ) salmon fishery in the world as the backers of Pebble plan on digging right at the headwaters of the Kvichak and Nushagak river systems which are home to the most prolific runs of salmon worldwide .
Add that to the continuing investigation to her alleged abuse of power in regards to the firing of her Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan over a family - related issue regarding her sister and her ex-husband state trooper .
Recorded phone messages from Monegan revealed Palin’s and her administration ’s fabrications that no phone calls were ever made pressuring the highly respected life - long cop Monegan to fire said trooper .
Monegan refused to comply and was promptly dismissed .
Palin was elected on a platform of a clear and transparent government .
A bold new symbol of change against an Alaska tarnished by corruption and greed … sound familiar ?
Sadly , in just two short years her promises have fallen sickeningly short and mirrors that of former governor Frank Murkowski ’s embarassing tenure .
Shame has befallen this once great state .
I have heard it from conservatives and liberals alike .
We have been stunned into submission .
Corruption is now a household term we eat daily for breakfast and go to bed with each and every night .
We are a state with so much potential but so few leaders .
Now America has been introduced to Alaska ’s Sarah Palin .
Is America this desperate ?
Response to " Return of Debtor 's Prison ? " Share
This :
One of the critical issues with civil contempt is that it now has a standard of proof of clear and convincing evidence .
This is higher than the civil standard of preponderance of the evidence , but lower than the criminal standard of beyond reaonable doubt .
Clear and convincing evidence requires much more than a judge 's say - so .
Now , it requires a full - scale investigatory matter requiring a trial by jury , or at least the right to appointed , competent , effective counsel ( I 've had situations where real estate and patent lawyers were appointed to people facing contempt and jail time , when they needed an attorney knowledgeable in constitutional law , criminal law and family law ) .
Given that 49 out of 50 states ( NH is the only one that does n't ) now require appointment of counsel for indigent parents in child support enforcement cases , there is no difference in civil contempt and enforcing a child support order .
In fact , child support orders have been declared as judgment debts on the date they are due by every state .
Child support has been defined as a " civil " debt and not a " special kind of debt " by all of the the Federal Courts of Appeals that have had these cases before them on interstate criminal matters .
The issue is not whether the matter turns on the " civil " or " criminal " aspect of the case , but whether it deprives a person of liberty .
If it does , according to most states ' caselaw , statutory law and constitutions , then there can be no imprisonment without full criminal due process , e.g. , right to trial by jury , right to appointed competent , effective counsel , right to present evidence , witnesses and testimony , right to an ability to pay hearing , etc. ) .
In the Chadwick case , the PA courts are out - of - bounds with their ruling .
This is because it has gone past the remedial and is now past the punitive .
The theoretical ability to be jailed for the rest of one 's life without any due process has been brought to fruition by this case .
Herein lies the conflict of interest and the unconstitutionality of the use of contempt .
Judges are sitting on child support - alimony cases where they have a financial interest in the outcome of such cases ( e.g. , pension increases , salary increases , bonuses , etc. ) .
Therefore , they are tempted to use their unbridled contempt powers to threaten or actually jail people to extract / extort more and more child support - alimony out of them to increase collections and enforcement .
The more collected and enforced , the more reported to the feds to get more reimbursement incentive funding .
The vicious cycle .
However , the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that judges who sit in judgment of such cases where they have a financial interest in the outcome of such cases is constitutionally unacceptable , and must disqualify themselves from those cases .
See , Tumey v. Ohio , 273 U.S. 510 ( 1927 ) ; Ward v. Monroeville , 409 U.S. 57 ( 1972 ) ; Gibson v. Berryhill , 411 U.S. 564 ( 1973 ) .

People say that there would be no judges to hear child support cases .
Too bad .
Then they either go to a civil law system like you mentioned in your article , or empanel a citizen - review board made up of professionals ( e.g. , economics experts , vocational experts , psychologists , maybe a lawyer or two , and whomever else would be necessary to determine economic viability of a person ) .

With regard to child support and alimony cases , states receive federal funding for the awarding , collection and enforcement of child support and alimony .
Pursuant to Title IV - D of the Social Security Act ( which I despise because SS was supposed to be only for disability and retirement ) , Title 42 USC Section 658 ( a ) is called the federal incentive reimbursement funding .
What occurs here is that the feds give the states 90 cents for every dollar of child support awarded , collected and enforced upon .
At the beginning of every fiscal year , billions are allotted to all 50 states based on each state 's child support collections numbers .
This federal funding is given to the states with " no strings attached " .
The states put this money into the general treasury ( and not for child support ) .
The first items paid out of any state general treasury are state employee pension plans and salaries and judicial pension plans and salaries .
Herein lies the conflict of interest and the unconstitutionality of the use of contempt .
Judges are sitting on child support - alimony cases where they have a financial interest in the outcome of such cases ( e.g. , pension increases , salary increases , bonuses , etc. ) .

Your article " Return of Debtor 's Prison ? " was outstanding .

Mr. McCain cast the process , at least in those days , as orderly and said that the last thing he wanted was the kind of rushed decision that President George Bush had made in 1988 in selecting his running mate , Dan Quayle , then a senator from Indiana .
But it was not until the last few weeks that Mr. McCain winnowed his list to five or six finalists .
They included , a McCain adviser said , Mr. Pawlenty , Mr. Romney , Mr. Lieberman , Ms. Palin and Tom Ridge , the former governor of Pennsylvania who also supports abortion rights .
Ms. Palin , unlike the others , was barely mentioned in news media speculation .
The finalists , including Ms. Palin , were vetted , a campaign adviser said , and Mr. McCain then asked his inner circle  Mr. Salter , Rick Davis , Steve Schmidt and Charlie Black  to provide him with assessments of each .
“ He said , ‘ Give me plusses and minuses on each of these people , ’ ” Mr. Black said .
One of Mr. McCain ’s closest friends , Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina , weighed in as well , pushing so hard for Mr. Lieberman  Mr. McCain , Mr. Graham and Mr. Lieberman are longtime traveling companions  that he vexed some of the other advisers .
Others in the inner circle favored Mr. Pawlenty or Mr. Romney .
Ms. Palin had no strong advocates in the group , an outside adviser said , but she had no detractors , either .
Last Sunday , 24 hours after Mr. Obama announced his running mate , Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware , Mr. McCain met with his senior campaign team at the Ritz - Carlton Hotel in Phoenix .
By then , campaign advisers said , the group had long decided that Mr. McCain ’s “ experience versus change ” argument against Mr. Obama had run its course , to the extent that it had worked at all .
At the same time , Mr. Obama ’s coming acceptance speech before a stadium of about 80,000 people ( and what turned out to be a television audience of nearly 40 million ) loomed large .
As much as the campaign was publicly dismissing Mr. Obama as a celebrity in a rock - star setting , the concern was that his command of such a large crowd on the last night of the Democratic convention would give him the aura of a president .
In any case , one campaign adviser said , Mr. McCain hated running as the wizened old hand of experience .
Despite his embrace this year of President Bush and many of the administration ’s policies , Mr. McCain , a campaign adviser said , still saw himself as the maverick who delighted in occasionally throwing political grenades at his own Party .
The botnet created by a teenager who was arrested by Dutch police in a sting operation is most notable for its total reliance on social engineering to spread , computer security experts said Thursday .
The 19 - year - old Dutch man was caught July 29 with his 16 - year - old brother trying to sell a botnet to a 35 - year - old Brazilian man , according to Dutch prosecutors .
All were arrested by the Dutch High - Tech Crime Unit , with assistance from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation .
As is customary in the Netherlands , Dutch police have not released the names of those arrested .
Few other details , such as how authorities became cued into the case , have been released .
U.S. authorities are seeking the extradition of the Brazilian man .
But experts from Russian security vendor Kaspersky Lab were called on by Dutch police to write up instructions for how to remove the botnet code from infected PCs , as well as aid in the continuing investigation , said Eddy Willems , one of Kaspersky 's security evangelists .
A botnet is a group of PCs that is infected with malicious code and controlled by a hacker .
This particular botnet , which at one time had as many as 150,000 machines worldwide , is called " Shadow , " the name bestowed on it by its creator .
The code that enabled Shadow to work was distributed on Microsoft 's Windows Live Messenger instant messaging network .
Victims would typically get a message from someone who appeared to be one of their contacts .
The message would contain a link to another Web site , where the victim was asked to download a file .
If the file was executed on a PC , Shadow would collect other instant messaging contacts and send out more messages trying to enlarge the botnet .
It appeared that Shadow was particularly successful in the Netherlands , since some messages were sent out in Dutch .
The distribution method relied entirely on victims willingly downloading the code rather than trying to exploit a software vulnerability , which could result in an infection regardless of what the user does .
It means that Internet surfers are just as susceptible to fall victim to scammy tricks .
" Social engineering seems just as effective as it was 10 years ago , " said Roel Schouwenberg , senior antivirus researcher .
Shadow could also download other malicious code and may have been used to download advertising software and spyware programs , Schouwenberg said .
The teenager who created Shadow appears to use bits of malware code already circulating on the Internet , as well writing his own code .
The result was a fairly run -of - the - mill botnet , but one that could be considered large , Willems said .
When the bust occurred , the 19 - year - old was attempting to sell the botnet for € 25,000 ( US $ 37,290 ) , a price Willems said is way too high in proportion to how botnets are currently priced .
People who control a group of computers , called botnet herders , have been known to rent time to other scammers , who use the computers to send spam or conduct other malicious activity .
The use of remote computers helps disguise who is actually using those machines to carry out crime .
Dutch prosecutors could not immediately be reached for comment .

As we hit another low in the financial crisis that has struck the United States , John McCain put his ignorance of the economy on full display , by once again saying that the economy is fundamentally strong .
This prompted his rival for the presidency Barack Obama to ask McCain , what economy are you talking about ?
Here is the video of McCain in Florida expressing his belief that the fundamentals of economy are strong :
Advertisements
While campaigning in Colorado , Obama asked McCain which economic fundamentals was referring to , Senator – what economy are you talking about ?
What ’s more fundamental than the ability to find a job that pays the bills and can raise a family ?
What ’s more fundamental than knowing that your life savings is secured and that you can retire with dignity ?
What ’s more fundamental than knowing that you ’ll have a roof over your head at the end of the day ?
What ’s more fundamental than that ? ”
He continued , “ The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great – that promise that America is the place where you can make it if you try – a promise that is the only reason that we are standing here today . ”
Later in Orlando , McCain tried to do some damage control by saying that he was referring to the American workers , which only serves to make his remarks more nonsensical , because America workers are the ones being hardest hit by this economy .
Every time McCain opens his mouth on the economy , he makes Obama ’s argument for him .
The Republican nominee seems to know little about the economy , and what ’s even worse is that he does n’t care .
Wall Street is in crisis .
Lehman Brothers is in bankruptcy .
Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America for $ 50 billion in stock , and $ 700 billion in wealth was wiped out today .
Yet , John McCain thinks that the economy is fine .
McCain ’s gibberish about workers was just a poor attempt at political cover from a candidate who has not spent more than five minutes talking about workers issues during this entire campaign .
Look , if America wants to reelect Herbert Hoover that ’s fine , but voters had best be prepared for the consequences of electing a man president who has little concern for the economy in times that continue to grow increasingly desperate .
In neither case were voters moved by the “ heartbeat away ” concern .
McKinley and Eisenhower both won easily .
Should voters be alarmed by a relatively young or inexperienced vice - presidential candidate ?
No .
Since 1900 , five vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency during their term in office : Teddy Roosevelt in 1901 , Calvin Coolidge in 1923 , Harry Truman in 1945 , Lyndon Johnson in 1963 , and Gerald Ford in 1974 .
Teddy Roosevelt took over at age 42 , becoming our youngest president , and he ’s generally thought to have proved up to the job .
Truman was V.P. for less than three months and had been kept in the dark by Franklin Roosevelt about such matters as the atom bomb  and he ’s generally thought to have risen to the occasion .
Character , judgment and the ability to learn seem to matter more to success as president than the number of years one ’s been in Washington .
Did McCain think Palin his very best possible successor ?
Perhaps not .
Did Barack Obama think Biden the absolute cream of the Democratic crop ?
Perhaps not .
They undoubtedly thought highly enough of their running mates to have confidence in their ability to take over their administration in case of incapacity or death .
I think most voters will accept that basic judgment .
But  shocking to say !
 both Obama and McCain also took political considerations into account in making their selections .
One thing McCain undoubtedly had in mind was Obama ’s failure to pick Hillary Clinton .
As The Times ’s Patrick Healy reported Friday , “ If the election remains close , the next president could very well be picked by what Chris Lehane , a Democratic strategist , calls ‘ Wal - Mart Moms ’  white working women with children living in the exurbs and in rural parts of battleground states .
... ”
McCain did n’t just pick a politician who could appeal to Wal - Mart Moms .
He picked a Wal - Mart Mom .
Indeed , he picked someone who , in 1999 , as Wasilla mayor , presided over a wedding of two Wal - Mart associates at the local Wal - Mart .
“ It was so sweet , ” said Palin , according to The Anchorage Daily News .
“ It was so Wasilla . ”
A Wasilla Wal - Mart Mom a heartbeat away ?
I suspect most voters will say , No problem .
And some  perhaps a decisive number  will say , It ’s about time .
In my last blog , I wrote about recent JRuby on Rails project I did at amazon .
In this blog , I will show some technical details on setting up JRuby on Rails with Tomcat .
I used 2.1.1 of Rails and 1.1.4 of JRuby , here are steps to setup JRuby and Rails :
Download Jruby 1.1.4 from http://dist.codehaus.org/jruby/
Setup JRUBY_HOME and PATH export JRUBY_HOME =installed directory of jruby export PATH=$JRUBY_HOME / bin:$ PATH
Install Rails gem install rails -y
Install ActiveRecord JDBC
Adapter jruby - S gem install activerecord - jdbc- adapter
Install warbler plugin to create war file , older version of Rails ( 1.2 or older ) used goldspike but the newer version requires warbler jruby - S gem install -y warbler
Edit config/environment.rb and add if RUBY_PLATFORM =~ / java / require ' rubygems ' RAILS_CONNECTION_ADAPTERS
= %w ( jdbc ) end
Download mysql-jdbc driver as I used MySQL .
( You may have to download different driver . )
Copy mysql-connector - java-5.1.6- bin.jar to lib directory of jruby
You can edit config / warble.rb and add other jar files or directories , e.g. config.java_libs += FileList [ " lib/*.jar " ] config.pathmaps.java_classes << " % {build / classes / , }p " config.webxml.jruby.min.runtimes = 2 config.webxml.jruby.max.runtimes = 24
Edit config / environment.rb and add define adapter , driver and url as follows : development : adapter : jdbc driver : com.mysql.jdbc.
Driver url : jdbc:mysql://localhost/rspm_development username : rspmdb_user password : secret test : adapter : jdbc driver : com.mysql.jdbc.
Driver url : jdbc:mysql://localhost/rspm_test username : rspmdb_user password : secret production : adapter : jdbc driver : com.mysql.jdbc.
Driver url : jdbc:mysql://localhost/rspm_production username : rspmdb_user password : secret
Create a template web.xml.erb in config directory , e.g. <!
DOCTYPE web - app PUBLIC "-// Sun Microsystems , Inc.//DTD
Web Application 2.3//EN " " http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd " > < web-app > <% webxml.context_params.each do |k , v| %> < context - param > < param - name > <%= k %> </ param - name > < param - value > <%= v %> </ param-value > </context - param > <% end %> < servlet > < servlet - name > Rails </ servlet - name > < servlet - class > org.jruby.rack.RackServlet </servlet-class > </ servlet > < servlet - mapping > < servlet - name > Rails </ servlet - name > < url - pattern > /* </url - pattern > </ servlet - mapping > < filter > < filter - name > RackFilter </ filter - name > < filter -class > org.jruby.rack.RackFilter </filter-class > </ filter > < filter - mapping > < filter - name > RackFilter </ filter - name > < url - pattern > /* </url - pattern > </ filter - mapping > < listener > < listener - class > <%= webxml.servlet_context_listener || ' org.jruby.rack.RackServletContextListener ' %>
</listener-class > </ listener > </web-app >
Now create war file jruby - S warble
Finally copy the war file to webapps directory of standard J2EE web container , in my case Tomcat 6.0
Now point the browser to your server , e.g .
http://localhost:8080/your-controller and voilla .
On final note , I found warble quite slow in generating war file and tomcat takes a while to deploy the war file , so I use WEBrick for development and Tomcat for staging / production .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I just received another one of those mass emails being used to spread lies about Obama .
I ’ve interspersed the text of it with data contradicting the claims :
INTERESTING DATA JUST RECEIVED ON TAXES Spread the word …..
This is something you should be
aware of so you do n’t get blind - sided .
This is really going to catch a lot
of families off guard .
It should
make you worry .
Proposed changes in taxes after 2008 General election : CAPITAL GAINS TAX MCCAIN
0 % on home sales up to $ 500,000
per home ( couples ) McCain does not
propose any change in existing
home sales income tax .
OBAMA
28 % on profit from ALL home sales
How does this affect you ?
If you sell your home and make a profit , you will pay 28 % of your gain on taxes .
If you are heading toward retirement
and would like to down - size your
home or move into a retirement
community , 28 % of the money you
make from your home will go to taxes .
This proposal will adversely affect the elderly who are counting on the income from their homes as part of their retirement income .
This claim about Obama taxing profits on home sales comes from nowhere .
Any gains on the sale of one ’s principal residence is not taxed under section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code .
Neither McCain nor Obama has proposed to amend this section .
DIVIDEND TAX MCCAIN 15 % ( no change ) OBAMA 39.6 %
How will this affect you ?
If you have any money invested in stock
market , IRA , mutual funds ,
college funds , life insurance , retirement accounts , or anything that pays or reinvests dividends , you will now be paying nearly 40 % of the money earned on taxes if Obama become president .
The experts predict that ‘ higher
tax rates on dividends and capital gains would crash the stock market yet do absolutely nothing to cut the deficit .
As for Capital Gains taxes in general , Obama is proposing to raise the capital gains tax rate from 15 percent to 20 percent for those American families making more than $ 250,000.00 per year or singles making over $ 200,000.00 per year .
Those families or singles making less than these respective amounts will not have a tax increase .
Further , IRAs and college funds are exempt from taxation entirely – and neither candidate is proposing to change this .
INCOME TAX
MCCAIN ( no changes ) Single making 30 K – tax $ 4,500
Single making 50 K – tax $ 12,500
Single making 75 K – tax $ 18,750
Married making 60 K - tax $ 9,000
Married making 75 K – tax $ 18,750
Married making 125 K – tax $ 31,250 OBAMA
( reversion to pre-Bush tax cuts )
Single making 30 K – tax $ 8,400
Single making 50 K – tax $ 14,000
Single making 75 K – tax $ 23,250
Married making 60 K – tax $ 16,800
Married making 75 K – tax $ 21,000
Married making 125 K – tax $ 38,750 Under Obama your taxes will
more than double !
How does this affect you ?
No explanation needed .
This is pretty straight forward .
This claim is worse than all those above – because Obama is actually proposing to lower taxes for all of these groups listed .
Here ’s a site which provides an Obama tax cut calculator .
I ca n’t vouch for its accuracy , but it seems to be based on the Tax Policy Institute ’s analysis of both candidates ’ plans .
The email also inaccurates states that Obama plans to revert to “ pre-Bush tax cuts ” which is only true for those making over $ 250,000.00 .
As Obama said in his speech on Thursday night :
I will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families .
Because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class .
Sarah Palin in her speech this past Wednesday made the same claim the Republicans keep making :
Taxes are too high , and he wants to raise them .
His tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan .
And let me be specific :
The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes , and raise payroll taxes , and raise investment income taxes , and raise the death tax , and raise business taxes , and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars .
As Politifact.com writes – Palin ’s claims are deliberately misleading .
This email is worse than misleading – it is entirely fase .
This little list conveniently does not include those making over $ 125,000.00 .
It is this group of people – especially those making over $ 250,000.00 , and even more , those making over a million dollars a year – to whom the profits of the past eight years has gone .
The economy has been growing for eight years while the income of those in the middle class has decreased by approximately $ 2,000.00 when accounting for inflation since Bush took office .
INHERITANCE TAX MCCAIN 0 % ( No change , Bush repealed this tax ) OBAMA Restore the inheritance tax How does this affect you ?
Many families have lost businesses , farms and ranches , and homes that have been in their families for generations because they could not afford the inheritance tax .
Those willing their assets to loved
ones will not only lose them to
these taxes .
As for this section – again , falsehoods galore .
According to FactCheck.org :
The claim that Obama proposes to “ restore the inheritance tax ” is also false , as are the claims that McCain would impose zero tax and that Bush “ repealed ” it .
McCain and Obama both would retain a reduced version of the estate tax , as it is correctly called , though McCain would reduce it by more .
The tax now falls only on estates valued at more than $ 2 million ( effectively $ 4 million for couples able to set up the required legal and financial arrangements ) .
It reaches a maximum rate of 45 percent on amounts more than that .
It was not repealed , but it is set to expire temporarily in 2010 , then return in 2011 , when it would apply to estates valued at more than $ 1 million ( $ 2 million for couples ) , with the maximum rate rising to 55 percent .
Obama has proposed to apply the tax only to estates valued at more than $ 3.5 million ( $ 7 million for couples ) , holding the maximum rate at 45 percent .
McCain would apply it to estates worth more than $ 5 million ( $ 10 million for couples ) , with a maximum rate of 15 percent .
Again – this email is counting on people accepting its ’ allegations without checking them and hoping that stereotypes about liberals are strong enough that people will accept these charges .
NEW TAXES BEING PROPOSED BY OBAMA * New government taxes proposed on
homes that are more than
2400 square feet *
New gasoline taxes ( as if
gas were n’t high enough already ) *
New taxes on natural resources
consumption ( heating
gas , water , electricity ) *
New taxes on retirement accounts
and last but not least ….
This section is even more fanciful than the rest .
Obama has never proposed taxes on water .
He is n’t proposing to increase gasoline taxes .
He is n’t proposing to increase taxes on retirement accounts .
The taxes on homes with more than 2400 square feet – neither the number nor general idea can be found anywhere aside from in references to this email .
The one thing that is partially true is that Obama – and McCain – are proposing to create a “ cap - and - trade system ” which would impose a cost on businesses ’ carbon emissions .
Although neither McCain nor Obama call these costs “ taxes ” they can reasonably be called that .
Further , Obama , though not McCain , plans to offset any potential increase in costs for consumers with a refund from a windfall profits tax .
* New taxes to pay for socialized medicine so we can receive the same level of medical care as other third - world countries !!!
This final claim is way over - the - top .
Obama ’s plan calls for every American who wants to preserve their health insurance plan to be able to keep it .
His plan even includes incentives that reward employers that do provide health insurance and penalizes employers that do not ( with exceptions for small businesses . )
In addition to this , Obama ’s plan will open up the government health care plan used by members of Congress to allow consumers – in a free market – to opt into it .
Obama ’s plan is designed to create incentives within our current system to gradually close the huge holes in insurance coverage and over time bring down costs .
It ’s a conservative plan , in the best sense of that word .
John McCain ’s health care plan is radical .
McCain says he wants to :
Reform The Tax Code To Offer More Choices Beyond Employer - Based Health Insurance Coverage
In other words , McCain wants employers to stop providing health insurance coverage .
He proposes to include the cost of health care in each employee ’s taxable income – and to offset this by offering a $ 2,500.00 tax rebate for individuals and $ 5,000.00 for families .
This is n’t enough to purchase health insurance coverage in many states , so in addition , McCain proposes to effectively deregulate the insurance market and allow insurance to be sold across state lines – eliminating the consumer protections states provide , including protections for those with pre-existing conditions .
The theory behind the McCain plan is that we already have too much health insurance coverage and are going to the doctor too often because we do n’t have to pay every time we do .
So he proposes that every individual – or family – purchase individual or family health insurance – a radical change , and one that places much greater power in the hands of the insurance industry .
As a matter of fact , it would be accurate to say it is exactly what the health insurance industry is asking for .
Conclusion
So , there we have it .
An email full of lies deliberately designed to mislead those Obama ’s plans are designed to help .
Obama ’s plans – which are the fruit of a kind of Democratic consensus that has emerged in the past ten years on how to deal with the destabilization that has come from globalization .
Obama is asking that those individuals who have gained the most from our society and economy should give a bit more in this time of need .
All McCain and Palin and the Republicans offer is more tax cuts for the richest indivudals and the biggest corporations ( tax cuts that go further than Bush ’s tax cuts in favoring the wealthy ) – for which their only defense is to make the false claim that Obama is planning on raising everyone ’s taxes .

A month ago , I wrote in my controversial essay that I was going to give up on downloading illegal fansubs .
In a way , it really was n’t that hard of a decision for me to make at the time .
I had burnt myself out with covering the spring season on my Twitter account .
What started off as a dozen new shows in the first week quickly filtered to only two shows the next week , and I even lost interest in those shows not long after that .
Instead of watching fansubs for the rest of that season , I was discovering many older shows through my Netflix account .
I was watching them on my big screen HDTV , so I felt a lot more relaxed sitting on my couch than sitting in front of a computer at my desk .
And for the most part , they were all turning out to be good series because I was only renting shows I recalled hearing good things about through out the years .
So when I was working on the Ayres piece , I had to deal with the fansub debate head on and really reevaluate why I was continuing to download things illegally .
I ’ve been saying for years that people who were watching fansubs were not buying DVDs , and this in turn was creating problems for the industry in both America and Japan .
But knowing this , I went on for years using the reasoning of , “ I ’ll buy the DVD when it comes out , ” as my justification for downloading fansubs .
But I never bought the DVD .
In fact , I did n’t know anyone who regularly bought anime DVDs anymore .
They all stopped when they discovered fansubs .
So instead of being a hypocrite and never fulfilling on my promises , I decided to give up on the whole thing all together .
It did n’t really sound that difficult to do .
Working on the Ayres piece just convinced me to go all the way .
Not surprisingly , coming to this kind of realization and going public with it did n’t go so well with my readers .
I was met with a lot of hostility from everyone starting with my very first tweet , and the criticism has n’t stopped since then .
People told me that they had to download anime illegally in order to “ sample ” the show and determine if they were going to like it or not .
I was thrown the argument of anime being too expensive , and that anime fans ca n’t afford to watch anime legally anymore .
I was also given the argument that legit anime was too limiting .
Anime fans had to turn to fansubs in order to stay up - to - date on the latest from Japan .
According to everyone , it would be completely impossible for American anime fans to go legit and live without fansubs in this day and age .
I was an idiot for even suggesting it .
But was it really that impossible ?
After all , I somehow managed to go through most of the spring season without them , and I also started off my first few years of being otaku never having download a single fansub .
What was so impossible about it ?
Why did I not see a problem in giving up fansubs ?
For the entire month of July , I kept a record of all my otaku activities , the amount of material I was able to consume , and the total cost of everything I was doing .
Thanks to this month - long experiment , I now have some actual numbers and statistics to show just why I was able to live legit for that month .
Legal Consumption
My main source of anime came out of my Netflix subscription .
I have a 3 DVD - at - a - time subscription plan that costs me a little under $ 20 every month .
For the month of July , I was able to rent 16 DVDs from Netflix with 9 of them being anime DVDs or live - action Japanese films based on anime , like the Honey and Clover movie .
I was able to watch the entire first seasons of Emma : A Victorian Romance and School Rumble during that time .
I also watched the first DVD of the series Human Crossing , but I did n’t really like the show that much so I did n’t watch any more of it .
In a way , the Netflix experience was very similar to the “ sample ” justification to fansubs .
I had never seen any of these shows before , and there was absolutely no guarantee that I was going to like them .
As it turns out , I really enjoyed Emma and School Rumble , so I continued to watch them both to the very end .
Human Crossing , on the other hand , was dropped very quickly from my queue .
I was safe to check out anything I wanted because there was absolutely no commitment to buy the DVDs .
Just watch them once and return it for something new .
But unlike downloading illegally , I was actually paying for the opportunity to sample anime using this method instead of getting it all for free .
But how much was I actually paying ?
When you count all the episodes on those anime DVDs and break the movies into 25 - minute blocks , I watched a total of 33 episodes from just Netflx last month .
Since I only paid $ 20 all month , that translates to only 60 ¢ per episode .
Not to mention that I also rented 7 other DVDs on Netflix that were n’t anime - related .
If I had only rented anime DVDs , I probably could have brought the cost down to 30 ¢ or 40 ¢ per episode .
When I ’m paying such a small amount of money , I do n’t even feel like I ’m wasting cash when I rent anime .
If I do n’t end up liking the show , so what ?
Losing a small amount of cash on a bad DVD is nothing when it comes with paying so little on watching good DVDs .
This micro-payment system is completely legit , and I ’m sure the industry would much rather you pay them a small amount of cash to sample their product rather than paying nothing when you download it illegally .
A lot of little payments end up becoming a huge profit over time .
After all , the movie rental business has been a huge source of revenue for Hollywood ever since the early days of VHS .
Why not make it profitable for the niche market of anime with Netfilx as well ?
Moving beyond Netflix , my second largest source of anime was legally purchased shows from iTunes and BOST TV .
The anime blogging community is probably already well aware of Strike Witches and Gonzo ’s story .
Because of this , Strike Witches is the only “ new ” anime I ’m watching this season , and fortunately for me , it ’s targeted towards my moé loving needs .
So I bought and downloaded 4 episodes of the show during the month of my experiment .
But the launch of the 3G iPhone was the major reason for me watching so much off of the iTunes store .
Last September , I used an iTunes gift card and bought the entire series of Tsukoyumi ~ Moon Phase ~ .
I watched the show for about a week , and enjoyed it so much that I ended up naming my newly adopted kitten Nekomimi because of the show ’s theme song .
But then the fall fansub season started , and I ended up dropping Tsukuyomi at episode 8 to watch all the new “ fresh ” shows from Japan at that time .
When I bought my new 3G iPhone , I upgraded from the 8 - gig model to the 16 - gig model and now had a lot of empty space to fill on it .
So I decided to put my Tsukuyomi episodes on the phone and finish watching the 18 remaining episodes .
I watched the episodes on my bus rides to New York during the month , and in bed on nights that I was having trouble going to sleep .
I ended up really loving the series , and I will be writing a post on Studio Shaft for this website sometime later this month .
I also caught the last 10 episodes of Avatar on iTunes the same way which , as I wrote in last week ’s post , I also consider to be anime as well .
So in total , I watched 32 episodes of legally downloaded anime , averaging at $ 1.69 per episode .
Not quite as low as the rate of renting anime over Netflix was , but at least I was able to keep all the episodes to watch again sometime in the future .
My third source of anime was from the traditional method – store - bought DVDs .
I bought Paprika on Blu- Ray , Lucky Star vol. 2 , and the first two - disc set of Gurren Lagann .
Even though I got some pretty sweet discounts on these DVDs , these 17 episodes worth of anime still cost me $ 2.70 per episode .
This is probably what my readers were complaining about with anime being too expensive , and I agree , it was .
But again , I did n’t have to buy these DVDs , I could have just rented them on Netflix for only 60 ¢ a pop .
I just wanted to have a copy to own for my personal collection , so I paid that premium for it .
To make up for that , I was also able to watch 12 episodes of anime streaming online for absolutely free .
This came from watching Death Note , Code Geass , and Shin-chan on Adult Swim ’s free video service .
FUNimation also had a sample episode of Bacconno when they announced the license for it last month .
However , FUNimation really blew me away when I discovered their Youtube shows on the very last day of my experiment .
At that time , they had the first 4 episodes of Peach Girl , Slayers , Blue Gender , and Kiddy Grade ready and available for free .
Because I had only discovered it during the final few hours of July , I was only able to watch 5 free episodes that night .
But since then , I ’ve watched plenty more shows for free thanks to this service .
FUNimation is really going in great directions right now .
So if you have n’t realized it by now , I watched a freaking lot of anime in July .
It ended up being 94 episodes in total , or at least 3 episodes for every day of the month .
So to say that my options were limited by going legit was completely untrue .
Even if I had cut out the paid downloads and purchased DVDs , I would have still watched 45 episodes of anime on just the Netflix and free streaming alone .
That would be the same as watching the weekly fansubs of 10 different series at the same time .
Do anime fans really follow more than 10 different anime shows every season ?
I think it ’s reasonable to say that for only $ 20 a month , you can watch just as much anime legally as you normally do illegally .
And $ 20 is not really that much money .
It ’s less then the cost of one normal anime DVD .
And in the grand scheme of them , my total amount of money I spent on my otaku hobby ( with manga included ) was only $ 104 in July .
When you compare that to all my other expenses for the month – rent , food , car payments , iPhone , utilities , etc. – anime and manga ended up being less than 5 % of my total spending for the month .
It was really not that expensive .
Keeping it “ Fresh ”
So now I come to the argument that , “ yeah , but you did n’t watch brand new shows from Japan .
All the stuff you saw was old . ”
That is completely true .
With the exception of Strike Witches , the newest show I watched , Gurren Lagann , was a year old and the oldest show I saw , Tsukuyomi , came out four years ago .
However , I was watching all of these “ old ” shows for the first time ever , so I never felt that they were actually old or stale .
Gurren Lagann was just as awesome to watch for the first time last month as it would have been to watch for the first time a year ago .
Tsukuyomi was just as awesome to watch for the first time last month as it would have been in 2004 .
And actually , it was probably better to watch Tsukuyomi for the first time in 2008 because I can now watch it on my iPhone while traveling !
I really see no problems with watching older shows for the first time like this , but clearly my readers and the fansubbing community does .
So just what does it mean to have “ fresh ” anime from Japan and why does the fansub community crave it so dearly ?
If you think about it , that answer comes from simple greed and the hope for 15 minutes of internet fame .
A show that airs in Japan for the first time is guaranteed not to have been fansub before it airs .
So all fansubbers will circle around every new show like vultures waiting for that “ raw ” meat to finally hit the web .
When it does , they strike and pick it apart as quickly as possible so that they can be the first release their own subtitle version under their own name .
The most downloads will go to the group that finishes first .
So the hype and attention to fresh new shows from Japan comes from the competition between all the fansubbing groups .
After they have picked all the meat off of the carcass of a show for one season , they circle around the new meat of the next season ’s shows .
The same applies to anime bloggers as well .
Most blogs have nothing more to offer to the community than talking about fansubs and taking screen caps of the stuff they can steal for free off the internet .
Again , many other bloggers are also writing the exact same post on the exact same show .
So there ’s still a little feeling of competition to be the first to blog about a new episode .
Some bloggers even make it their gimmick to blog about “ raw ” anime episodes , because they ’ll have the exclusive scoop of the episode before other bloggers get to watch the fansub .
They ’re trying to generate the most traffic because of this exclusivity .
This whole “ I want to watch new shows from Japan ” is just a facade to mask the greed , freeloading , and peer pressure of the fansubbing and blogging community .
This kind of pressure was killing me by overloading me with a ton of “ new ” shows to watch every season , the stress of keeping “ up - to - date ” with everyone every week , and limited my choices to only the “ here and now . ”
By giving up fansubs , not only was I relieving myself of this stress , but I was also expanding my window of opportunity to all those older shows that have come out over the years that had managed to fly under my radar this whole time .
It was actually a very liberating experience .
Living Legit
So in my month without fansubs , I found out that I was able to watch over 90 episodes of anime using only completely legal methods , and I did n’t even end up poor because of it .
With so many free and affordable options available , I never felt the need to go back to downloading fansubs .
In fact , I found the experience to be personally liberating by relieving myself of the stresses created by the fansubbing community and exploring so many great shows of years past .
But most of all , I was no longer being hypocritical by saying I was going to make up for downloading a fansub by buying the DVD , and then never following through on that promise .
By always making my initial viewing supported by either micro-paying DVD rentals , paying less for legal downloads , or simply watching an ad- supported free video over the internet , I was always supporting the artists and the industry even without buying an expensive DVD at full price .
So is it really impossible to be an American anime fan and go completely legit in today ’s world ?
Well , my dear readers , you ’ll never really know until you give it a try yourself . 😉
SOCHI , Russia ( Reuters ) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned ex-Soviet Moldova on Monday against repeating Georgia ’s mistake of trying to use force to seize back control of a breakaway region .
A Russian military vehicle drives in the direction of the Russian border in the South Ossetian settlement of Dzhava , some 25 km from Tskhinvali ( 15.5 miles ) , August 22 , 2008 .
The poster reads " Year of Transdniestria in South Ossetia .
We are strong people through brotherly friendship . "

Russia sent peacekeepers to Moldova in the early 1990s to end a conflict between Chisinau and its breakaway Transdniestria region and is trying to mediate a deal between the two sides .
Transdniestria , one of a number of “ frozen conflicts ” on the territory of the former Soviet Union , mirrored the standoff between Georgia and its rebel regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia until they erupted in war earlier this month .
Russia sent troops to Georgia to crush Tbilisi ’s military push into South Ossetia and Moscow says Georgia has now lost the chance of ever re-integrating the breakaway provinces .
“ After the Georgian leadership lost their marbles , as they say , all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted , ” Medvedev told Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin .
“ This is a serious warning , a warning to all , ” he added .
“ And I believe we should handle other existing conflicts in this context . ”
As the two leaders spoke in Medvedev ’s Black Sea residence in Sochi , Russian lawmakers were voting non-binding resolutions urging the Kremlin to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states .
That would be a nightmare scenario for Moldova which fears Russia could recognize Transdniestria , a pro-Moscow region in Moldova .
Medvedev , keen to limit diplomatic damage caused by the Russian operation in Georgia , made clear Moldova had no reason to worry for now .
“ We have agreed ... to meet and discuss the Transdniestria settlement , ” he told Voronin .
“ I think there is a good reason to do this today .
I see good prospects of reaching a settlement . ”
Medvedev ’s spokeswoman Natalya Timakova later told reporters the two leaders had agreed to hold a fresh round of talks on Transdniestria soon .
“ Russia is ready to continue its efforts towards finally solving the Transdniestrian crisis , ” she told reporters .
Russia is currently trying to forge a deal between Chisinau and Transdniestrian separatists which would keep the rebel region as part of Moldova but give it broad autonomy .
The Russian - brokered deal would also allow Transdniestria to leave Moldova should the former Soviet state decide to join their ethnic kin in EU member Romania .
Several years ago , Moldova rejected a similar deal under a strong pressure from NATO .
But now Voronin appears to treat the Russian mediation more favorably .
The Moldovan leader told Medvedev he had indeed learned the lesson : “ Thank God , during all these years ... we had enough brains and reserve not to allow a similar deterioration of situation . ”
“ Frozen conflicts are a real volcano which can blow up anytime , ” Voronin added .
“ That is why taking into account what had happened elsewhere it would be useful if we exercised again such wisdom not to allow such things to repeat in our country . ”

So I was researching the U.S. troops strength in Iraq since there was all this talk of surging and pulling out .
Turns out there is n’t really any good visuals of it , and the raw data leaves alot to be desired .
So I went about creating my own chart .
I would first like to thank the Statistical Information Analysis Division ( SIAD ) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense for the raw data .
As is often the case when the Pentagon and the Internet mingle , the SIAD website looks like it was done by the lone DOD IT guy in between bites of a chicken sandwich
Regardless , here is the data when its cleaned up a bit .
( click it to make it bigger )
I have added in major dates related to the Iraq war .
The Army , Navy , Marines , and Air Force are depicted and labeled .
If you see any trends let me know ; I am not analyzing this data , just throwing it out there .
For reasons unknown to me , the SIAD does not list troop levels later than December of 2007 .
The unofficial end of July projection is 140,000 and the unofficial goal expressed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates for December is 100,000 .
I will leave the plausibility of that up to you .
Whats also missing in the numbers for Operation Enduring Freedom which is for Afghanistan .
The data is available for this but not prior to 2005 for some reason so I did n’t include it .
There are 20 - 25,000 troops in Afghanistan at any given time , about 95 % Army .
So now that we have a nice clean chart , its time to complicate it with extraneous data sets .
Below is the same chart only I overlaid the Dow Jones Index , Halliburtons stock aswell as the Homeland Security ’s terror alert indication .
See any correlation ?
Of course there is no set vertical scale for the economic data but there does n’t need to be to spot trends .
I experiment with other indicators such as the price of oil but the chart became a little overwhelming .
I will try more overlays in the future and you ’re more than welcome to use the images to your own devices .
Enjoy .
( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Wednesday accused Sen. John McCain 's campaign of engaging in " lies " and " swift boat politics " in regard to his comment about " lipstick on a pig . "
" Spare me the phony outrage .
Spare me the phony talk about change , " Obama said at the start of an education event in Norfolk , Virginia .
" We have real problems in this country right now .
The American people are looking to us for answers , not distractions , not diversions , not manipulations .
They want real answers to the real problems we are facing .
" I do n't care what they say about me .
But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics .
Enough is enough , " he said , referring to how Swift Boat Veterans for Truth launched attacks against Sen.
John Kerry in the 2004 presidential race .
Obama said the McCain campaign was doing the type of thing that makes people " sick and tired of politics . "
Watch Obama dismiss " the latest made - up controversy " »
Responding to Obama 's comments , McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said , " Barack Obama can't campaign with schoolyard insults and then try to claim outrage at the tone of the campaign .
" His talk of new politics is as empty as his campaign trail promises , and his record of bucking his party and reaching across the aisle simply does n't exist . "
Obama 's heated response came after the McCain campaign said the Democrat owes the GOP vice presidential nominee , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , an apology for invoking an adage on the campaign trail Tuesday : " That 's not change , " Obama said , saying McCain 's policy views were similar to President Bush's .
" That 's just calling something the same thing something different .
You know you can put lipstick on a pig , but it 's still a pig . "
McCain 's campaign said Obama 's remarks were offensive and a slap at Palin -- despite the fact that the senator from Arizona used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Sen. Hillary Clinton's .
Watch how tensions are rising on the campaign trail »
Within minutes , the McCain campaign announced a conference call focusing on the remark , which it said was a deliberate reference to Palin 's line : " You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull ?
Lipstick . "
Read more about the " lipstick " controversy
Palin used the line in the opening remarks of her acceptance speech at last week 's GOP convention , and she frequently uses it on the campaign trail .
Earlier Wednesday , Obama 's campaign announced it was launching " Alaska Mythbusters , " a group of Alaskans that the campaign says will " set the record straight " about Palin .
Former Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles and Bob Weinstein , mayor of the city that would have been home to the " Bridge to Nowhere , " planned to discuss Palin 's record in a conference call later Wednesday .
Obama 's group comes the day after McCain deployed the " Palin Truth Squad " to fight future attacks on his vice presidential nominee .
It was launched as The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Palin had billed the state a per diem for 312 days she spent at home and requested reimbursement for plane rides and hotel rooms for her husband and children .
The newspaper noted that officials said the claims were justified under existing state regulations .
The McCain campaign said that Palin had reduced yearly travel expenses by roughly 80 percent of the amount spent by her predecessor , former Gov. Frank Murkowski .
Meanwhile , after Obama made his remarks criticizing Republicans , he moved on to discussing his plan for the education system .
At the Virginia event , Obama repeated proposals he laid out Tuesday , which included doubling funding for charter schools and investing in early - childhood education .
Read more about Obama 's plan for public education
Obama has put a lot of emphasis on Virginia , a Republican stronghold he hopes to turn blue .
Obama kicked off his general election campaign in Virginia in June .
Virginia has n't voted for a Democrat since President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 , but for more than a year , Obama 's campaign has cited the state 's 13 electoral votes as part of its argument that he can reshuffle the electoral map this fall .
Virginia Gov.
Tim Kaine was long considered one of Obama 's top vice presidential contenders , and the state played a big role at the Democratic National Convention last month , with Kaine 's predecessor , Mark Warner , delivering the keynote address .
Following his Virginia event , Obama was set to tape an appearance for the " Late Show With David Letterman " and then head to Washington to speak before the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Gala .
Obama 's running mate , Sen. Joe Biden , was in New Hampshire for a town hall meeting .
New Hampshire is also a tossup state , with four electoral votes at stake .
On the Republican side McCain and Palin were in Fairfax , Virginia , for a rally .
The campaign moved the rally from a northern Virginia high school to a nearby park following complaints from some officials , who said that holding a partisan event on school grounds violated local school board policy .
However , McCain 's campaign said Wednesday that the main reason for moving the event was to accommodate the demand for tickets .
McCain 's rallies over the last week with Palin have drawn large crowds for the Republican nominee .
Wednesday 's event is McCain 's first in Virginia since securing the GOP nomination .
CNN 's Alexander Mooney contributed to this report .
All About John McCain • Sarah Palin • Barack Obama
The one question I have after playing the final , retail release of Star Wars : The Force Unleashed is the following : what the hell happened ?
We enjoyed the demo ; the things LucasArts showed us before the game 's release all looked promising , but the final version is buggy , messy , and stretches the patience of even the most hardcore Star Wars fan .
This is even more galling because the story of Darth Vader 's secret apprentice is a strong one , the comic book is wonderful , and , while the novelization is n't a great piece of literature , it 's a very readable adventure .
I devoured it in two nights and have no problem recommending it to anyone who wants a light splash of Star Wars in their day .
The story fits snugly between episodes three and four , and adds some very nifty things to canon ; I was left looking forward to actually playing the climactic scenes from the book .
The problem is that the game never feels solid , or even finished .
It can be unclear where you can and can't explore , the camera gets in your way more often that not , and the cuts from game play to cinemas happen suddenly and in a very herky - jerky way .
If I were given this game as a demo I would say things look great , and I can't wait to see where they are in four to six months .
As a retail release though , the lack of polish is a deal - breaker .
Mike Thompson even encountered a game - ending bug during a boss battle , although for the sake of spoilers I can't describe it in much detail .
To finish off the bosses you have to participate in quick - time events , and while I was assured that if you failed one of these you could just kill the boss and not get to see the cool cinema , that wise bit of design was cut ; failures now force you to retry the combination of button presses again and again .
With some enemies it's hard to tell if you 're hitting them at all , which is hard to explain considering you 're carrying a fracking lightsaber .
The places to use your force powers are also insultingly obvious , which huge chunks of the levels growing blue to show you have to interact with certain places .
Major scenes that have been hinted at and barely shown leading up to the game end up being broken or anticlimactic .
Do n't get me started on the menus , which are also annoyingly slow and take way too long to load .
When you find leveling your character painful , something tragic happened during development .
There are some joys to be squeezed from the game , including an opening scene with a rampaging Darth Vader and some interesting art here and there , but overall this is a large disappointment .
I know you may tell yourself it can't be that bad , or that you want to play just for the story ...
I implore you to at least rent it first .
Or buy the comic , or even the book .
You 'll be much happier .

Another multi-decade health conspiracy

Mercury , a dangerous toxin , was added to dental amalgams in the 1940s .
The dental profession went along with it and threatened any dentist who spoke out against the practice even though the use of mercury in amalgams had been banned previously for decades .
In the 1940s , the dental profession endorsed another toxin : fluoride .
This time the adding of it to the water supply .
Different toxin , same story
Public relations pros were brought in to sell the public on the idea that a raw industrial waste ( fluoride ) could and should be added to drinking water supplies .
Anyone who questioned its use was attacked .
This went on for decades
It still goes on .
66 % of US water supplies are still fluoridated .
In contrast , only 2 % of European water supplies are .
A conspiracy ?
You bet it is .
Well - funded , well - organized , and ruthlessly executed by experienced operatives .
The people at the top knew they were lying and knew their actions were causing the public harm , but went ahead and did it anyway , using media manipulation , corrupted scientists and raw political power to silence opponents .
The people battle back
There is hope ...
In 2005 , eleven environmental protection agency EPA employee unions , representing over 7000 environmental and public health professionals of the Civil Service , called for a halt on drinking water fluoridation programs across the USA and asked EPA management to recognize fluoride as posing a serious risk of causing cancer in people .
The unions acted on an apparent cover -up of evidence from Harvard School of Dental Medicine linking fluoridation with an elevated risk of osteosarcoma in boys , a rare but fatal bone cancer .
In addition , over 1,730 health industry professionals , including doctors , dentists , scientists and researchers from a variety of disciplines are calling for an end to water fluoridation in an online petition to Congress .

The pandemic has certainly changed the cycle of product announcements and getting the gear to market .
I see some positive things with stock on the EOS R5 and EOS R6 and hopefully , there are plenty of the Canon Cinema EOS C70 cameras to go around in November .
The preorders for the latter have been really positive .
A lot of you continue to ask what ’s up next from Canon .
I do these posts from time - to - time as a reminder and hopefully bring some clarity to things .
Near Future Cameras :
Canon Cinema EOS C50
This was apparently supposed to be announced alongside the Canon Cinema EOS C70 but has been delayed , likely due to manufacturing challenges .
For the moment , I do expect to see this camera until the first quarter of 2021 .
Canon XF505
Also supposed to be announced in 2020 , and I ’m not sure when we can expect it to be announced .
Canon XC20
There ’s a pattern here , this was also to be a 2020 announcement .
I think it has been pushed back to early 2021 .
Canon EOS M50 Mark II
I have n’t heard anything about this camera in quite some time , it was scheduled for a Q4 2020 announcement .
There is a ton of mixed information about the EOS M lineup out there , and I ’m not sure what ’s true at the moment .
I hope to hear more soon .
Accessories
A new flagship Speedlite
This has been delayed numerous times I have been told .
I ’m not sure when we ’re going to see it .
PL to RF adapter with Cooke / i
This was supposed to be announced alongside the Speedbooster with the EOS C70 , but it has obviously been delayed .
EF - Cinema Lock to RF
Same as above .
User interchangeable RF mount for Cinema EOS cameras
This was also supposed to announced at the same time as the Cinema EOS C70 , bit it has apparently been delayed to mid 2021 at the earliest .
Lenses
RF 70-200 mm f/4L IS USM
This should be announced sometime in 2020 .
RF 50 mm f/1.8 STM
This should also be announced sometime in 2020 .
Canon RF 100-400 mm f/4.5-7.1 IS STM
This lens will likely be announced in the first half of 2021
Canon RF `18-45 mm f/3.5-6.3
This will also likely be announced in the first half of 2021
Canon RF 24 mm f/2.8 IS Macro STM
This will likely be announced in the 2nd half of 2021 .
Canon RF 70 - 135 mm f/2L USM
I do not have a guess as to when this lens is going to be announced , if at all .
It has been mentioned to me so many times , that I do believe it exists .
There are obviously more rumored products , but this is the stuff I think is most likely to be coming .
We ’re probably a couple of years from things normalizing to some degree , so announcements and shipping will be a moving target for now .
It looks to be another scam or hoax or whatever you want to call it .
The delay is on purpose to keep the buzz a live on the internet .
As for the DNA evidence , the men presented a copy of an email from the University of Minnesota reporting of the three distinct DNA sequences that showed up , one was inconclusive , one was human , and the third was from a possum .
The animal ’s body is currently in an undisclosed location and further DNA tests and a necropsy will be conducted , said Tom Biscardi , CEO of Menlo Park ’s Searching for Bigfoot , Inc. Whitton and Dyer said they found the 7 - foot - 7 , 500 lbs .
Bigfoot while hiking .
Tom Biscardi has been linked to other hoaxes before and now you have cried wolf one too many times .
You will no longer fool people anymore .
We can all back to our normal lives and let this hoax rest in peace .
Run Sasquatch , Run …
“ I ’m too busy to exercise . ”
Even if it were true , it is n’t a reasonable excuse .
Exercise gives you more energy to do work .
In many ways , most people are too busy not to exercise .
But still , a lot of people feel they do n’t have time for starting new habits like exercise , reading or doing extra work .
Being able to find time is a big obstacle in starting new habits .
I ’d like to make two arguments .
These are generalizations , so while they may not be true in specific cases , I ’d say they apply to most people , most of the time .
Time is never the most limited resource in your day .
A lack of attention , not time , is what prevents you from adding new habits .
You Have Enough Time
Even when you ’re extremely busy , you are n’t using your time with 100{ 54c12dad2cc2b53ae830e39915b1a3e70288dbcbbeb8bbf8395437c5dc3c512c} efficiency .
There are gaps in everyone ’s schedule where they are n’t doing anything important .
Even if your schedule has no gaps , there are probably chunks of time where you are n’t working as fast or as effectively as you possibly could .
Why are n’t you completely efficient ?
It ’s because time is n’t the limiting factor .
If it were the limiting factor , people could work non -stop without breaks or any unproductive distractions .
Instead people , even those who are highly productive , need to take breaks , occasionally procrastinate and slow down on tasks throughout the day .
The real limiting factor for productivity is your energy levels and ability to pay attention .
Energy levels limit your productivity because when you ’re tired , you can have ample time and still not get everything done .
Your attention span is even more limited , because even if there are a million things that need to be done , you can only focus on one or two at a time .
You might not be able to insert another 4 - 5 hours into your schedule without making some sacrifices .
But even extremely busy people can add an hour or two into their schedule without eliminating something .
The reason it ’s hard to “ find time ” is n’t a lack of time .
It ’s because you do n’t have the attention span left to focus on something else that needs to fit into your day .
I first suspected time was n’t the real problem during an extremely busy period in my life over a year ago .
I was insanely busy , but at this time I still exercised regularly .
I had daily to - do lists with over twenty items , and I still found time to exercise .
However , after a few weeks off , due to illness , I stopped exercising .
I was not busy by any standards , in fact , my schedule was incredibly light .
Despite this free time , I found it hard to find time to exercise .
It seemed to get pushed later and later into my schedule until it was gone .
How could I explain this odd experience ?
Paying Attention is Expensive
Some studies estimate that there are close to eleven thousand sensory inputs into your brain during any second , but you only process around forty consciously .
This means out of everything you could be thinking about , you are reduced to examining less than one percent .
Even when you do think , you ’re handicapped .
Your short - term memory , or active memory , can only hold about 7 items at a time ( why do you think phone numbers are typically 7 digits long ? ) .
Your attention is extremely limited , and given the amount of things you do each day , paying attention is very expensive .
I believe this lack of attention is the main culprit in finding time for new habits .
You may have very little time , but you have even less attention .
Even if you could find an hour or two to spare for exercising , reading or a new activity , it ’s mentally costly to keep reminding yourself to do it .
New habits have a start - up cost that you pay with attention .
Finding Time for New Habits
There is n’t much you can do to free up more attention .
But you can be smart in your usage of it .
Forming a habit makes continuing much easier because , after several weeks , you stop thinking about it .
My exercise during the busy period in my life was easy because it no longer required thought .
When I stopped for a few weeks , I suddenly needed reminders , which made finding time more difficult .
You can reduce the attention needed to start a new habit by writing it down .
Write it into your to - do lists , and place it on Post Its around your house .
If you allow the environment to remind you of your habit , you can cut down on the amount of internal attention you need to use to remember it .
The best way to find time is to focus on it .
If you can focus on a new habit for a few weeks , you can find the attention to make it a habit .
Once exercise , reading , studying or whatever you want to do becomes a habit , it wo n’t cost you anything to keep going .
Attention is the currency of productivity , so if you want to find time for anything , find the energy to pay attention first .

Birds on the island had been used to having no predators and are unable to fend off the mice which attack in groups at night .
Tomorrow night at 10 PM , Food Network kicks off Alton Brown 's latest TV show , Feasting on Waves , where the Mensa - smart kitchen geek and his crew hop into two 50 - foot catamarans and sail around 15 different Caribbean islands in search of quality cuisine , shooting and editing the hi-def episodes right there on the boats .
It turns out , despite his disdain for specialized kitchen gadgets , Brown depended on regular high - end tech to make a cooking show on a boat happen .

How do you produce a TV show from a sailboat ?
One of the things about the Feasting shows in general is that they have a very small crew , and we are moving with very little space .
We are extremely packed and technology dense .
We had two 50 - foot catamarans - it sounds fun but it was n't that fun .

So you shoot and edit as you go ?
This year we decided to go completely tapeless : Panasonic P2 cards on 200s .
We 're downloading them into our portable Avid edit system .
We take as much audio equipment as we take video equipment .
The funny thing is , professional audio has n't gotten a whole lot smaller .
Although hi-def cameras have gotten smaller , lenses have gotten better and battery time has gotten better , audio is still the tricky part of the process for field reporting .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
I see you were also using a little Panasonic ?
I was lucky enough to be one of the first people in the US to get Panasonic 's HDC - HS100 AVCHD camcorder .
It 's got a nice little Leica lens on it .
We take everything through a DaVinci color correction system .
Once we do that , you really can't tell the difference between my little camera and the big cameras - it 's all 1080i .
We have some scenes that were 100 % shot with just my camera .

How did you connect to the internet ?
It 's kinda funny , the entire time that I was in the islands , I had perfect e-mail with my iPhone .
The entire time .
I think there was once , during a midnight crossing , the Anegada Passage , where I lost internet for about half an hour .
The rest of the time , I was getting e-mail through either EDGE or something else [ probably GPRS ] .
I did not even take a computer with me on that trip .
I decided I just did n't want to see a computer for a while .
And at the time , I figured you know , computers , boats , water , scuba diving .
I thought about taking the ToughBook along , and then I thought about taking the Asus because that 's a great little box .
Then I thought , the hell with it .
I took a few pads of paper , some pens and my iPhone .

You also carry GPS everywhere , right ?
As a motorcyclist , as a hiker and as a pilot , I 'm pretty sold on Garmin .
In the first Feasting on Asphalt , I had a touchscreen weatherproof version of the StreetPilot for my motorcycle that even worked with gloves on .
I just really love how their interfaces work .
You do n't even need manuals for most of their stuff , the stuff is so intuitive .

In New York , I use Google Maps with my iPhone , because I know where I am - I do n't need GPS .
If I was going some place where I needed GPS , I 'd use my Garmin Colorado [ shown in top pic ] , which I really really like .
It 's a really great marine box .
It 's splashproof , but it comes loaded with all the marine functions , so it 's really easy to do marine chart info if you get the right cards for it .
You can sail the world with one .
So it was your navi on land and sea ?
Everywhere .
We basically documented the entire Feasting on Waves journey in the Colorado .
Every place we went , we popped a waypoint .
It 's got so many easy functions for calculating distance it made navigating around the island easier .
Even islands that did n't have roads at all , we could get good topographic information .
Advertisement
Do you adhere to the old sailor 's adage that you should never have just one form of navigation ?
Abso - stinking - lutely .
When I fly , I may have full GPS on the plane , but I got a full set of charts too , and I keep the charts out while I 'm flying to make sure I know where I am .
In this day and age , if I have a major power outage , I just whip out my handheld , the 496 , a spectacular handheld aviation GPS .
But there could be a catastrophic satellite failure , different things could happen that could make GPS unusable - I guess .
I think your unit would fail before the satellite did .
Something could happen to satellites , you never know .
So I always want to know where I am on paper , too .

And on the island , what was your backup ?
There were a lot of times where I did n't have a backup .
On islands , I sometimes did n't have anything else , because there are n't reliable paper maps for those places .
The only time I was n't using Garmin to navigate was when we were underwater - I do n't think they have an underwater unit yet .
We did a fair amount of scuba diving , and you 're still on your own under water .
You still gotta use a compass .
Advertisement
I think you just invented something .
Underwater GPS would be spectacular .
I do n't know how deep you can go with that technology without having serious problems .
Even 50 to 70 feet would be useful .
I wonder why they have n't done that yet .
I 'll ask Garmin when I can get that .
For rec diving , having that kind of application would be fantastic .
Note : I asked Garmin why there was n't a scuba GPS , and I got a quick reply : " The reason for no scuba GPS is simple ... the signal is deflected by water . "

So how do you keep everything charged up ?
That 's a problem .
Especially on the boats , it was really difficult .
We got down there and realized that the power systems on the boats which were all 220 V - the power was n't clean enough for our editing computers .
On St. Martin , we had to go buy a Honda generator to run on the back of the boat to give us good steady clean 120V .
The Colorado runs on AAs , so I took a batch of rechargeable AAs .
I ran the recharger for that in the cabin where I also charged my iPhone and my little camera batteries .
I had to have three chargers .
My other camera only runs on regular batteries , not rechargeables .

What kind of camera is it ?
It 's an old metal Canon EF - about 30 years old .
I also carry a 35 mm Leica point - and - shoot with a fixed 40 mm lens .
I was shooting slide film in the Canon and print film in the Leica .

So you 're not shooting digital ?
Not on this .
I wanted Ektochrome - nothing looks like Ektochrome .
I 'm old school that way .
I have a pretty decent Canon digital , and a Leica digital as well , but I did n't want to have to deal with the chargers , and I wanted super robust technology , so I went film .
I like film .
You can't beat it .
I spent most of my career as a cinematographer before I went to culinary school , so I just got a thing about film emulsions .
It 's still the way I think .
I just do n't appreciate digital photography as much as I should .

I know , I know - we managed to get through an entire discussion about a food show without talking about the freakin ' food .
Good thing there are already clips of the show ( alas , non-embeddable ) up at Food Network 's website , so take a look .
The awesome photographs of Alton were shot - digitally - by Marion Laney , ForgottenGulf.com .
The state of Oklahoma announced Thursday that it will plant more than 1,100 acres of switchgrass to be used to produce ethanol .
The Oklahoma Bioenergy Center , a state - funded collaboration of Oklahoma universities that aims to advance the use of ethanol from non-food sources , will begin planting the switchgrass within the next 45 days .
The center plans to convert the switchgrass into cellulosic ethanol at a biorefinery some 35 miles away .
The biorefinery is under construction and is scheduled to begin operations in 2010 .
The move is a step forward for energy crops , which could help push cellulosic ethanol forward but which also are controversial , as some fear that the crops could encroach on land needed to grow food .
Ethanol , once the darling of all clean - fuel technologies , has received substantial criticism from studies that question its environmental benefits and its potential competition with food .
Advocates hope that cellulosic ethanol will solve the problems because it can use non-food or waste biomass , such as corncobs and woodchips .
But so far , cellulosic ethanol has proven more costly than regular ethanol made from corn and sugar , and part of that cost comes from the difficulty ofr harvesting and collecting enough of the materials , from disperse locations , to make it cost - effective .
Planting cellulosic crops specifically for fuel is one idea for gathering more of the material in one place , but critics such as Lester Brown , president of the Earth Policy Institute , have said using farmland for fuel crops will continue to jeopardize the food supply – exacerbating the problem that cellulosic ethanol is meant to solve ( see Lester Brown Talks Smack About Ethanol ) .
Oklahoma secretary of energy David Fleischaker admits that rising food costs have brought about a backlash against certain types of renewable fuels , but says that switchgrass is a non-entity in the food versus fuel debate .
" Cellulosic ethanol from sources like switchgrass and sorghum are non-competitive with food sources for animals and humans and remove cellulosic ethanol from this discussion , " he said in a statement .
" More so , this dedicated land will allow us to demonstrate the advantages of switchgrass . "
The advantage of switchgrass is that it is drought resistant , making it less of a burden on irrigation supply , and produces more energy than corn , according to the announcement .
Cellulosic companies like Coskata say that energy crops are needed , and that some companies are developing energy crops that could grow on land that currently is n’t usable for growing food .
“ The story is n’t just waste , ” said Wes Bolsen , chief marketing officer for Coskata , earlier this month .
“ I ’d hate for people to generate more waste because we need new biofuels .
That would be crazy .
Could [ new energy crops ] replace acres of corn , soybeans and other food crops ?
Of course .
But what is our alternative ? ”
Moreover , earlier this week , industry organization Ethanol Promotion and Information Council highlighted a recent study by the Argonne National Laboratory that showed U.S. ethanol production is improving its efficiency , with water consumption reduced by 26.6 percent and energy by 21.8 percent between 2001 and 2006 .
But environmental advocates are n’t convinced .
" Even if you are looking at cellulosic ethanol , it just does n't seem like a good idea to be taking land that would be used forrom growing food and getting fuel from it , " said Frances Moore , a staff researcher at the Earth Policy Institute .

How he got his hands on the goods , we do n't yet know .
But today , police visited the home of a Culver City man and arrested him on suspicion of violating federal copyright law by posting nine previously unreleased Guns N' Roses songs on a website , Scott Glover reports in this L.A. Times story .
In June , the nine songs , from the band 's upcoming album " Chinese Democracy , " ended up on the website Antiquiet , which drew the attention of the feds .
The site received so much traffic that it crashed .
Kevin Cogill , 27 , told the FBI that he had posted the songs , according to an arrest affidavit .
( In other stories , Cogill has been quoted as Kevin Skwerl , who , according to Rolling Stone , operates Antiquiet and used to work in the distribution office of Universal Music .
The Recording Industry Assn. of America says it 's the same person . )
" Leak or no leak , I said that the only way the album would be a net success would be if the music was good enough to move units for years to come , " he wrote at the time on his blog .
For musicians , TV networks or movie studios , there is probably nothing worse than seeing their work available illegally online before it has even been released .
The movie industry has put elaborate ...
George Will and Cokie Roberts , neither of whom is awfully very friendly to Democrats , both really ripped into McCain on ABC’s This Week .
And Sam Donaldson repeatedly said that McCain ’s actions this week brought back into question “ the age issue . ”
Huff
Post has a 4 minute clip , it ’s devastating .
“ I suppose the McCain campaign ’s hope is that when there ’s a big crisis , people will go for age and experience , ” said Will .
“ The question is , who in this crisis looked more presidential , calm and un-flustered ?
It was n’t John McCain who , as usual , substituting vehemence for coherence , said ‘ let ’s fire somebody . ’
And picked one of the most experienced and conservative people in the administration , Chris Cox , and for no apparent reason …
It was un-presidential behavior by a presidential candidate . ”
Donaldson then jumped in : “ It was two days after the he said the fundamentals of the economy were strong .
His talking points have gotten all mixed up .
And I think the question of age is back on the table . ” …
The whole , painful , episode crested with Will leveling an even harsher blow .
“ John McCain showed his personality this week , ” said the writer and pundit , “ and made some of us fearful . ”
Cleric may end cease fire if no US withdrawal timetable released Friday Associated Press
Published : Thursday August 7 , 2008
Print This Email This Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr will call on his fighters to maintain a cease - fire against American troops but may lift the order if a planned Iraq - U.S. security agreement lacks a timetable for the withdrawal of American forces , a spokesman said Thursday .
The statement by Sheik Salah al - Obeidi comes as al - Sadr plans to reveal details of a formula to reorganize his Mahdi Army militia by separating it into an unarmed cultural organization and elite fighting cells .
The announcement is expected during weekly Islamic prayer services on Friday .
Several cease - fires by al - Sadr have been key to a sharp decline in violence over the past year , but American officials still consider his militiamen a threat and have backed the Iraqi military in operations to try to oust them from their power bases in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq .
Al - Sadr 's move appears to be an extension of plans he announced in June aimed at asserting more control over the militia by dividing it into a group of experienced members who would be exclusively authorized to fight and others who would focus on social , religious and community work .
But the cleric also apparently has decided to link the reorganization to ongoing U.S. - Iraqi negotiations over a long - term agreement that would extend the American presence in Iraq after a U.N. mandate expires at the end of the year .
The White House 's original goal was to have it completed by the end of July .
" This move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw , " al - Obeidi said .
" The special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis-a - vis the Iraq - U.S. agreement on the presence of American forces here . "
The new cultural group will be called Momahidoun , or " those who pave the way " in Arabic , in reference to the Mahdi , or so - called Hidden Imam , who disappeared as a child in the ninth century .
Shiites believe he will return one day to bring justice to Earth .
It will replace the Mahdi Army , but elite cells of fighters will be created that could resume targeting U.S. - led foreign forces under strict guidelines , such as not harming Iraqis or infrastructure , said al - Obeidi , the al - Sadr spokesman .
The U.S. military cautiously welcomed the reorganization plan , saying it appeared to be an effort to help the Iraqi people .
Residents in some Baghdad neighborhoods , however , said American troops were removing neighborhood fliers from al - Sadr 's offices saying " a new organization will be established soon . "
" The proof is always in the actions and not just the words , " military spokesman Col. Jerry O'Hara said in an e-mailed statement .
Sporadic attacks have continued despite the cease - fires by al - Sadr , who is believed to be in Iran , raising questions about how much control he maintains over his militiamen .
American commanders have consistently said they are n't targeting al - Sadr 's followers but rather Iranian - backed breakaway factions .
Two U.S. soldiers were killed Monday by an armor- piercing roadside bomb known as an explosively formed penetrator , which the military believes is supplied by Iran to Shiite militia fighters .
Iran denies it is supporting violence in Iraq .
On Thursday , a roadside bomb killed eight Bedouins , including three women and two children , on a remote desert highway west of Nasiriyah frequently used by U.S. and Iraqi troops , a police official said , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to release the information .
Nasiriyah , about 200 miles southeast of Baghdad , is in a Shiite area that has been the site of fierce infighting between rival Shiite factions but has been relatively peaceful since a cease - fire declaration by al - Sadr .
Gunmen also killed a senior member of the Sunni Iraqi Islamic Party , Mahmoud Younis Fathi , and a colleague as they were driving to work in the northern city of Mosul , according to the group .
Elsewhere in Mosul , three Iraqi policemen were killed when a booby - trapped wooden cart exploded after they arrived to collect a body that had been left on the street beside it , police said .
Product Reviews / Diet Nibbles / Sweeteners , Syrups & Seasonings David Burke Flavor Sprays Calorie - Free Flavor - Boosters For Dieters
EDITOR ’S NOTE 2013 :
To the best of our knowledge , this product has been discontinued , CAPSULE REPORT : A gaggle of journalists and nutritionists raved about David Burke Flavor Sprays when they debuted last year .
We tried six of them and thought they were more hype than hot .
Still , they are fun , and readers write to ask our opinion of them .
So rather than stay mum on the topic , we share our thoughts of the good and the tepid .
We love David Burke : he ’s a great chef and a creative thinker who is always coming up with something truly innovative in food — not just restaurant dishes , but new forms of food .
We first reported on his gourmet pops — smoked salmon , goat cheese , foie gras and cheesecake on a stick , a great contribution to entertaining .
We love his mail order panna cotta .
Some of his other efforts , like FlavorMagic spice - impregnated wraps for meat that supply all the seasonings so you do n’t have to ( in a clear , non-edible sheet , like a very thick plastic wrap ) , are really more trouble than they ’re worth .
It ’s high concept , but who truly lacks the skill to season a piece of meat or fish ?
It was more difficult to cover the meat properly with the seasoned wrapper .
Burke is executive chef and co-owner of top New York City restaurant davidburke & donatella , which we visit frequently , intaking zillions of calories .
So when we heard that he was “ giving back ” with a line of zero - calorie Flavor Sprays to enable people to put more flavor into steamed vegetables , boiled eggs , or whatever acts of contrition one pays in between visits to the restaurant , we were charmed by both concept and end - result .
It ’s nice that someone who has contributed so much to creating absolutely knock - out , self - indulgent food can turn his attention to the opposite end of the scale ( so to speak ) with calorie - free , fat free , carb - free Flavor Sprays .
In mini ( a tad higher than 4 inches ) pump bottles , there are 35 flavors , sweet and savory , both naturally - flavored and a combination of natural and artificial .
Anybody on any diet or food plan can use the sprays .
Flavor Spray was voted by Time magazine as one of the most amazing products of 2005 .
So is it bigger than diet soda , or is the emperor ’s new clothes ?
While the sprays will certainly be of interest to perpetual dieters , the word amazing is a bit hyped in our opinion .
But it all depends on what side of the emperor ’s tailor shop you ’re sitting on .
We find them more fun than food solution — but fun is good , and one can never have too many gift ideas for dieting friends .
Chronic dieters — we are one — will try anything looking for the panacea .
Here ’s our analysis .
What They Are Take away the smoke and mirrors , and Flavor Sprays are like the flavors that food chemists play around with when they ’re creating products in the development labs of food companies .
Take a whole bunch of basic flavors and try them with everything — sodas , puddings , salad dressings , tofu— until you come up with something that works .
While we do n’t claim to know the production process behind what Chef Burke has put in the bottle , from a simplistic conceptual standpoint he has taken a series basic flavors ( and a few complex ones ) and put them in a spray bottle for you to play around with to see what works .
You can play “ food chemist ” and spray any flavor , or combination of flavors , onto anything you like to make it taste better than it tastes to you plain — with zero added calories , fat , et al .
Thus , if you need to eat lots of vegetables but truly dislike the flavor of them plain or steamed vegetables with basic seasonings or calorie - free salad dressing and want to try to make them more palatable with Parmesan Flavor Spray , Memphis BBQ Flavor Spray , et al , this is the opportunity before you .
You may truly discover something you might never have tried in this lifetime , but will come to enjoy .
Thus , if you want to try bacon - flavored cottage cheese , or bacon - pesto cottage cheese , spray those flavors on your cottage cheese .
Or , if you want to turn your cottage cheese into a dessert , spray banana and chocolate fudge on it .
If your diet allows you to have plain pasta but no sauce , you can spray pesto onto it .
How They Taste Much as we wanted to find a great new diet aid , we found that the flavor sprays do n’t really add a lot of flavor .
We had to spray them on totally bland foods — plain yogurt , farmer ’s cheese ( a more bland version of cottage cheese ) and plain rice crackers — in order to get any taste at all .
Even when we tried them on sugar - free vanilla ice cream , the vanilla in the ice cream totally covered up the flavor of the Fudge and Cookies & Cream Flavor Sprays .
Similarly , we found that the recommended pairing of Chocolate Fudge Flavor Spray on strawberries or pineapple had very little impact — and why would anyone want to tamper with delicious fruit that way — we would n’t even put real chocolate syrup on it .
In fact , a lot of the recommended pairings seem like sprays in search of an idea , rather than assists to foods that need doctoring up .
Take a look at these recommended ideas : Hot and Sour Spray on peanuts
Tomato Basil Flavor Spray on crackers
What ’s wrong with eating perfectly good peanuts plain — we do it by the bowlful ?
Toss them with real cayenne or chili if you want spice , or buy them that way .
Similarly , why spray a cracker when a fresh basil leaf and a sliver of tomato — passable on just about any diet — would make so much more delicious a snack ( and , by the way , the Tomato Basil Flavor Spray was the least palatable flavor we tried ) .
Pesto Flavor Spray on low carb pasta
Here again , why would anyone need to do this ?
With fresh ( or even dried ) basil so healthy , delicious and available , and a sauce of fresh chopped tomato ditto , if you can eat the carbs in the pasta , you can have a delicious real sauce on top of it .
( Check out Vino de Milo , for 45 calories a serving — it ’s our favorite sauce . )
Pepper City Flavor Spray on grilled steak
Why would someone put this partially artificially - flavored spray on a perfectly good steak , when fresh cracked pepper and hot sauce would do so much better a job for virtually the same zero calories and fat ?
Ranch Flavor Spray on salad and raw vegetables
Ice Blue Salt Flavor Spray on celery and carrots
Teriyaki Flavor Spray on steamed vegetables
Parmesan Flavor Spray on steamed broccoli
Honestly , there are calorie - free salad dressings like Walden Farms that taste so much better here .
In terms of the suggestion of mainlining the sweet flavors , by spraying them right into one ’s mouth ( e.g. Banana Split Spray , Chocolate Fudge Spray , Marshmallow Spray , Cheesecake Spray ) : it ’s a creative thought , but the taste is n’t great as a direct hit .
For a spectacular sweet taste experience , we ’d rather have a 20 calorie Jeff ’s Diet Egg Cream , or calorie - free diet sodas from Boylan ’s or Steaz Green Tea Sodas , or one of the fruity and elegant unsweetened iced teas from Republic of Tea .
In terms of potential :
We did n’t get to try all 35 sprays , and are guessing that some might do better than others .
Perhaps the Memphis BBQ or Teriyaki flavors , which we did not get to taste , might provide some variety to plain , skinned chicken and steamed or broiled fish when one has tired of all of the seasoned salts and citrus squeezes .
Picky eaters , like kids who wo n’t eat vegetables , may be enticed if they can spray Smoked Bacon , BBQ , and Parmesan flavors on them .
We ’re just guessing — we did n’t put the theory to the test .
At The End Of The Day Flavor Sprays launched to great momentum .
With everyone in search for the great diet aid , Flavor Sprays generated a big initial trial .
We , too , have dieted all of our lives , and wanted to find the magic .
We did n’t : just give us a delicious plate of steamed fresh vegetables with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and fresh - cracked pepper .
It ’s all the flavor we could ask for — no sprays required .
We did , however , find the fun and the adventure ; and others will too , although probably not enough to generate lots o repeat purchase .
Yet others will enjoy the flavor and become permanent customers : when your daily breakfast consists of a boiled egg , that bacon spray may start to look good .
But , even Burke says , “ The sprays do not compete with a gourmet chef or a balanced diet .
Rather , they help in adding flavor to food without adding the fat and calories .
They complement well - prepared food and a healthy diet plan . ”
So , for $ 5.95 a bottle , buy a couple and try them .

A new technique has reportedly been developed by two security researchers that bypasses all of the memory protection safeguards in Windows Vista .
The tactic is expected to have far - reaching implications for Microsoft the rest of the tech industry .
Mark Dowd of IBM Internet Security Systems ( ISS ) and Alexander Sotirov of VMWare Inc. will discuss the new methods they 've found to get around Vista 's Address Space Layout Randomizations ( ASLR ) , Date Execution Prevention ( DEP ) and other functions built into Windows Vista by using Java , ActiveX controls and .NET objects to load arbitrary content into web browsers during a presentation at a Black Hat briefing .
The attacks -- deemed a major breakthrough by researchers -- are not based on any new vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer or Windows Vista and there is little that Microsoft can do to address the problem because it takes advantage of the fundamental architecture built into Vista .
Dowd and Sotirov were able to load whatever content they wanted into a location of their choice on a user 's machine by taking advantage of the way browsers , especially Internet Explorer , handle active scripting and .NET objects .
Almost any vulnerability in the browser is exploitable and reusable .
ASLR is meant to prevent attackers from predicting target memory addresses by randomly moving things such as a process 's stack , heap and libraries , and is designed to stop host - based attacks .
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 , Mac OS X Leopard and Linux are also potentially vulnerable .
Microsoft is aware of the research and would like to see it once it goes public , and has not responded to Dowd 's and Sotirov 's findings .
In another Black Hat conference presentation , Ben Hawkes explained how to conduct attacks against the Vista heap allocator , a strategy that could enable malicious hackers to compromise Windows Vista systems around the world .
He reportedly presented several scenarios in which the Vista heap could be attacked in order to produce buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code .
Also at the Black Hat Conference , researcher Su Yong Kim reportedly demonstrated how developers often install program files or store sensitive data in low integrity folders in order to simplify updates .
These low integrity folders do n't require user agreement to access and execute the contents .
It 'll be interesting to see if this will affect Microsoft 's marketing based on the security of Windows Vista , since many of its built - in security features have been rendered useless .
Visit Bill 's Links and More for more great tips , just like this one !
Here 's a screenshot of the latest language from Mozilla , and as you 'll see , they absolutely have listened to the community 's EULA concerns ( if you click on the image , it gets larger ) .
Instead of a EULA , the new page you get on install is a notices page with no " I agree " requirement , along with a link to an optional services agreement , and instructions there on how to avoid having to accept the services , if you do n't want them .
The notices inform you about the license being the MPL , that Mozilla 's trademarks are theirs , not ours , and the link to the services offerings .
I believe trademarks are important to protect , as you probably know from reading Groklaw .
I have n't closely analyzed the services language yet , but my concerns about the EULA have been addressed .
Bottom line : Now , you can install and use Firefox without having to agree to a EULA .
The services have been separated out .
If they were opt in instead of opt out , I 'd be happier , but this is acceptable to me .
There may be further tweaks , I understand , but I think it 's time to acknowledge that Mozilla is behaving very well indeed now and demonstrating a desire to get this right .
On trademarks , please let me explain why I think they matter and why the reservation of rights is fine with me .
Trademarks tell you when you are getting what you think you are getting .
I want to know when I am downloading software from someone I know , like Mozilla , and when I 'm not .
That does n't mean I 'd only download software from Mozilla , just that I want to know the source of any software I download .
If only Mozilla can use the Firefox trademark , I know what I 'm getting if it says Firefox .
That matters even if my desire is to avoid Firefox , because I 'm looking for IceWeasel or whatever else .
The fundamental point is that whichever you are looking for , you want to know for sure when you 've found it .
That is the purpose of trademark law .
And I think it 's a good purpose .
It is n't gravity which sorts the popped from the unpopped but rather
the physics of large and small .
I have forgotten the technical name
for this .
It explains why tires pop to the surface in landfills
( which do vibrate ) or why any larger item should shake to the top of
a mixed sizes conglomerate .
Try it by mixing whole bean and cheaper already ground coffee ( this
is a compromise between flavor and cost ) — be sure to add the beans
first then the ground coffee .
Shake .
Beans rise to surface .

McCain was interviewed recently by WCSH ’s John Caldwell in Portland Maine and had to answer some tough questions , and it ’s clear he got a little testy at the end .
Temper , temper John .
I wonder if Charlie Gibson will be as tough on Sarah Palin … I doubt it .

The World From Berlin ' Germany Will Pay a High Price for US Sins '
German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück delivered an impassioned speech before parliament Thursday denouncing greed and government failures for the US financial meltdown .
But German commentators are asking for reassurance rather than more finger - pointing .
The Theatre was one of London 's first dedicated playhouses
An archaeological dig has recovered what is thought to be the remains of the theatre where Shakespeare 's plays were first performed .
The Theatre was found in excavations by the Museum of London at a site in Shoreditch , east London , being prepared for the building of a new theatre .
It was one of London 's first dedicated playhouses when it opened in 1576 .
It was dismantled and its timbers taken to the South Bank , where they were used to construct The Globe in 1599 .
A spokesman for the Museum of London said it had long been known that an open air playhouse , called The Theatre , stood in this area , but traces of its exact location had proved elusive .
' Enduring secrets '
He said the open - air theatre was one of London 's first dedicated playhouses and it was here that a young William Shakespeare performed as part of The Lord Chamberlain 's Men company of players , and had his first plays performed .
The archaeological team found the footings of what appears to be part of a polygonal structure during their evaluation of the site at New Inn Broadway .
It is thought that they form the north - eastern corner of the building , which followed a design described in Henry V as " this wooden O " .
Jo Lyon , senior archaeologist at Museum of London Archaeology , said : " It 's extremely exciting to be so close to the known location of The Theatre and then find remains that look to be associated with it .
" As well as allowing us to walk in the footsteps of Shakespeare himself , the remains help us to start uncovering one of London 's enduring secrets . "
The site will be eventually be home to the Tower Theatre Company .
Its chairman , Jeff Kelly , said : " The discovery that we shall be building a 21st Century playhouse where Shakespeare and Burbage played and where some of Shakespeare 's plays must first have been performed is a huge inspiration . "

What are these ?
It 's no accident that Hilton 's tongue - in - cheek video , which dominated the Internet on Wednesday , August 6 , starts with a crowd shot from Barack Obama 's July speech in front of Berlin 's Victory Column .
That 's precisely the way the McCain campaign began its own anti-Obama advertisement entitled " Celebrity , " following it up with brief images of Britney Spears and Hilton herself .
The somewhat muddled message was that , by having the audacity to speak to 200,000 people in a major world city in a country closely allied with the US , the Democratic candidate was descending to the level of a tabloid celebrity .
Any time anyone in Europe takes an interest in a US election , so the implicit logic , something must be deeply fishy and anti-American .
What a change from the go - it - alone stance of the Bush administration , which led to such cost - efficient and confidence - building global solutions as the Iraq War .
Hilton did n't have any problems with this white - haired dude ...
And what an example of consistency from the Republican Party , whose modern - day hero , Ronald Reagan , began his political career as a foreign - policy expert…um , wait …a celebrity .
But the " wrinkly white - haired guy " -- as Hilton , channeling the gut feelings of millions of Americans under the age of 50 , called the presumptive Republican nominee -- did n't count on his celebrity adversary fighting back .
Her video matches McCain 's image for image , showing pictures of TV retirees the Golden Girls , fawning CNN interviewer Larry King and Colonel Sanders , the white - bearded mascot of the Kentucky Fried Chicken food chain .
A portentous off - screen voice intones " He 's the oldest celebrity in the world , " then asks : " But is he ready to lead ? "
The point , an entirely valid one , is that as the world 's most famous politician an American president is by definition a celebrity .
Indeed , the ability to manage fame is part of the job .
Hilton 's subsequent assurance that she is " like totally ready to lead , " while thumbing through a travel magazine in search of the best place to improve her tan , is also on the money .
After all , what can any rational person hope to learn about a candidate 's inner readiness to lead a country like the US from a medium as surface - oriented as TV ?
... this one , however , rubbed her the wrong way
All one can reasonably glean from television ads are a few indications of the candidates ' positions -- and of the depths to which their campaigns are willing to sink to win the election .
In McCain 's case , the latter include playing on a primitive suspicion and ignorance of Europe that post - Bush America would do well to discard .
Hilton , whose previous most popular performance in an Internet video came in a badly lit home - porn movie , seems to understand this , as her obvious preference for the " guy who wants change " over the " white - haired dude " indicates .

The UN says up to eight houses were totally destroyed
There is convincing evidence that 60 children and 30 adults were killed in a US air strike in western Afghanistan last Friday , the United Nations says .
The US originally said its planes had killed 30 militants in the attack in the province of Herat .
President Karzai sacked two senior Afghan army officers over the incident .
The US says Afghan forces led the operation in the district of Shindand .
The incident has worsened relations between Mr Karzai and foreign forces .
On Monday the government said it wanted to renegotiate the terms under which US - led forces and Nato - led forces operate in Afghanistan .
If confirmed , the Shindand incident is one of the worst cases of foreign forces killing Afghan civilians .
Destruction evident
The UN investigation was carried out by its Assistance Mission in Afghanistan ( Unama ) .
Such attacks are undermining attempts to win over Afghans " Investigations by Unama found convincing evidence , based on the testimony of eyewitnesses , and others , that some 90 civilians were killed , including 60 children , 15 women and 15 men , " the UN's Special Envoy to Afghanistan , Kai Eide , said in a statement issued on Tuesday .
" The destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some seven - eight houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others .
" Local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties , including names , age and gender of the victims . "
Call for help
The UN investigation adds further weight to the Afghan government 's own report into the incident .
President Karzai's office said on Sunday that " 89 of our innocent countrymen , including women and children " died in the incident .
Reports say that Afghan soldiers were fighting Taleban militants in the village of Azizabad and called in US air forces for help .
President Karzai subsequently sacked Gen Jalandar Shah Behnam , head of the army in western Afghanistan , and Maj Abdul Jabar , for " neglecting their duties and concealing the facts " , indicating that they were partly to blame for the incident .
The US has said it is carrying out its own investigation into the attack .
An Afghan general said the air strike was launched following intelligence that a Taleban commander , Mullah Siddiq , was presiding over a meeting of militants .
Afghan tribal elders said a bomb was dropped on a large group of mourners at a funeral wake .
The issue of civilian casualties has been a constant source of friction between Mr Karzai and international forces .

What are these ?
Last year Sean A. Spence , a professor at the school of medicine at the
University of Sheffield in England , performed brain scans that showed that a woman convicted of poisoning a child in her care appeared to be telling the truth when she denied committing the crime .
This deception study , along with two others performed by the Sheffield group , was funded by Quickfire Media , a television production company working for the U.K. ’s Channel 4 , which broadcast videos of the researchers at work as part of a three - part series called “ Lie Lab . ”
The brain study of the woman later appeared in the journal European Psychiatry .
Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) purports to detect mendacity by seeing inside the brain instead of tracking peripheral measures of anxiety — such as changes in pulse , blood pressure or respiration­­ — measured by a polygraph .
Besides drawing hundreds of thousands of viewers , fMRI has pulled in entrepreneurs .
Two companies — Cephos in Pepperell , Mass. , and No Lie MRI in Tarzana , Calif . — claim to predict with 90 percent or greater certitude whether you are telling the truth .
No Lie MRI , whose name evokes the casual familiarity of a walk - in dental clinic in a strip mall , suggests that the technique may even be used for “ risk reduction in dating . ”
Many neuroscientists and legal scholars doubt such claims — and some even question whether brain scans for lie detection will ever be ready for anything but more research on the nature of deception and the brain .
An fMRI machine tracks blood flow to activated brain areas .
The assumption in lie detection is that the brain must exert extra effort when telling a lie and that the regions that do more work get more blood .
Such areas light up in scans ; during the lie studies , the illuminated regions are primarily involved in decision making .
To assess how fMRI and other neuroscience findings affect the law , the MacArthur Foundation put up $ 10 million last year to pilot for three years the Law and Neuroscience Project .
Part of the funding will attempt to set criteria for accurate and reliable lie detection using fMRI and other brain - scanning technology .
“ I think it ’s not possible , given the current technology , to trust the results , ” says Marcus Raichle , a neuroscientist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who heads the project ’s study group on lie detection .
“ But it ’s not impossible to set up a research program to determine whether that ’s possible . ”
A major review article last year in the American Journal of Law and Medicine by Henry T. Greely of Stanford University and Judy Illes , now at the University of British Columbia , explores the deficiencies of existing research and what may be needed to move the technology forward .
The two scholars found that lie detection studies conducted so far ( still less than 20 in all ) failed to prove that fMRI is “ effective as a lie detector in the real world at any accuracy level . ”
Most studies examined groups , not individuals .
Others have not been replicated .
Subjects in these studies were healthy young adults — making it unclear how the results would apply to someone who takes a drug that affects blood pressure or has a blockage in an artery .
And the two researchers questioned the specificity of the lit - up areas ; they noted that the regions also correlate with a wide range of cognitive behaviors , including memory , self - monitoring and conscious self - awareness .
The biggest challenge — and one for which the Law and Neuroscience Project is already funding new research — is how to diminish the artificiality of the test protocol .
Lying about whether a playing card is the seven of spades may not activate the same areas of the cortex as answering a question about whether you robbed the corner store .
In fact , the most realistic studies to date may have come from the Lie Lab television programs .
The two companies marketing the technology are not waiting for more data .
Cephos is offering scans without charge to people who claim they were falsely accused if they meet certain criteria in an effort to get scans accepted by the courts .
Allowing scans as legal evidence could open a potentially huge and lucrative market .
“ We may have to take many shots on goal before we actually see a courtroom , ” says Cephos chief executive Steven Laken .
He asserts that the technology has achieved 97 percent accuracy and that the more than 100 people scanned using the Cephos protocol have provided data that have resolved many of the issues that Greely and Illes cited .
But until formal clinical trials prove that the machines meet safety and effectiveness criteria , Greely and Illes have called for a ban on nonresearch uses .
Trials envisaged for regulatory approval hint at the technical challenges .
Actors , professional poker players and sociopaths would be compared against average Joes .
The devout would go in the scanner after nonbelievers .
Testing would take into account social setting .
White lies — “ no , dinner really was fantastic ” — would have to be compared against untruths about sexual peccadilloes to ensure that the brain reacts identically .
The potential for abuse prompts caution .
“ The danger is that people ’s lives can be changed in bad ways because of mistakes in the technology , ” Greely says .
“ The danger for the science is that it gets a black eye because of this very high profile use of neuroimaging that goes wrong . ”
Considering the long and controversial history of the polygraph , gradualism may be the wisest course to follow for a new diagnostic that probes an essential quality governing social interaction .
Note :
The article was originally published with the title , " Lighting Up the Lies " .
WASHINGTON  President Bush secretly approved orders in July that for the first time allow American Special Operations forces to carry out ground assaults inside Pakistan without the prior approval of the Pakistani government , according to senior American officials .
The classified orders signal a watershed for the Bush administration after nearly seven years of trying to work with Pakistan to combat the Taliban and Al Qaeda , and after months of high - level stalemate about how to challenge the militants ’ increasingly secure base in Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
American officials say that they will notify Pakistan when they conduct limited ground attacks like the Special Operations raid last Wednesday in a Pakistani village near the Afghanistan border , but that they will not ask for its permission .
“ The situation in the tribal areas is not tolerable , ” said a senior American official who , like others interviewed for this article , spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the missions .
“ We have to be more assertive .
Orders have been issued . ”
( CNN ) -- Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama on Friday called for an economic plan for working families , saying , " We cannot only have a plan for Wall Street .
Sen. Barak Obama speaks at a campaign rally in Coral Gables , Florida , Friday .
" We must also help Main Street , " he said .
While " tough new regulations on financial institutions " are needed , the Illinois senator called for an emergency economic plan for working families .
Obama spoke after meeting with his economic advisers in Coral Gables , Florida .
Watch Obama call for help for Main Street »
Obama on Friday also backed administration and congressional leaders ' efforts to develop a " a more stable and permanent solution " to the U.S. financial crisis .
Watch Obama talk about how working Americans need help in this economy
Obama 's statement came after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox met with congressional leaders to discuss a plan that would allow banks to get rid of bad mortgage - related assets that have been a drag on their balance sheets .
" What we 're looking at right now is to provide the Treasury and the Federal Reserve with as broad authority as necessary to stabilize markets and maintain credit , " Obama said .
" We need a more institutional response to create a system that can manage some of the underlying problems with bad mortgages , help homeowners stay in their homes , protect the retirement and savings of working Americans . "
After meeting with his economic advisors , Obama said his team would not present a detailed economic plan at this time , " given the gravity of this situation , and based on conversations I have had with both Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke . "
Obama said he would not present his plan until the Treasury and Federal Reserve have presented theirs .
" It is critical at this point that the markets and the public have confidence that their work will be unimpeded by partisan wrangling , and that leaders in both parties work in concert to solve the problem at hand , " Obama said .
Later , Obama held a rally , at the University of Miami , which was disrupted by protesters who held up signs saying " Blacks against Obama " and " Obama endorsed by the KKK . "
Obama said the protesters could stay and hold up their signs if they stopped shouting , but they were later escorted out after they continued to disrupt the rally .
Obama spoke after Republican presidential candidate Sen .
John McCain said Friday morning that he would establish a new agency to deal with the U.S. financial crisis that many experts say is the worst since the Great Depression .
Watch McCain blast Washington corruption »
That agency , a Mortgage and Financial Institutions trust , would work with the private sector and regulators to identify institutions that are weak and fix them before they go broke .
" The underlying principle of the MFI or any approach considered by Congress should be to keep people in their homes and safeguard the life savings of all Americans by protecting our financial system and capital markets , " McCain told the Green Bay Chamber of Commerce in Wisconsin .
McCain said the agency would be an early intervention program to help financial institutions avoid bankruptcy , expensive bailouts and damage to their customers .
Obama , at the rally in Florida , lashed out at McCain 's plan .
" This morning Sen . McCain gave a speech in which his big solution to this worldwide economic crisis was to blame me for it .
" This is a guy who spent nearly three decades in Washington and after spending the entire campaign saying I have n't been in Washington long enough ... he apparently now is willing to assign me responsibility for all of Washington 's failure , " he said .
Wall Street witnessed the federal government take unprecedented steps this week to stabilize the economy , including the takeover of the insurance giant American International Group Inc. in exchange for an $ 85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve .
In his speech , McCain blamed the crisis on " the corruption and manipulation of our home mortgage system " and blasted Congress and the administration for not addressing the problems at the two mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which he said " led our housing system down a path where quick profit was placed before sound finance . "
McCain also blasted his Democratic rival , Sen. Barack Obama , for not working to clean up the " corruption " at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Fact Check : Did Obama ' profit ' from Fannie and Freddie ?
" We 've heard a lot of words from Sen . Obama over the course of this campaign .
But maybe just this once he could spare us the lectures and admit to his own poor judgment in contributing to these problems .
The crisis on Wall Street started in the Washington culture of lobbying and influence peddling , and he was square in the middle of it . "
Although action must be taken to avoid future panics , the Arizona Republican said that ultimately , the economy would have to grow to get through " this tough time for America . "
McCain touted his economic plan , which includes tax cuts , and again said Obama would increase taxes on Americans who make as little as $ 42,000 .
McCain 's charge that his opponent would raise taxes on those making $ 42,000 is misleading , however .
The McCain campaign cites Obama 's vote for a nonbinding 2008 budget resolution that outlines budget priorities through 2013 and assumed that President Bush 's tax cuts would expire in 2011 .
Fact Check : Does Obama want to raise taxes ?
The Obama campaign says its economic plan would raise taxes only on those making over $ 250,000 .
The economic crisis has given Obama and his running mate , Sen. Joe Biden , the opportunity to go on the offensive .
Most Americans see Obama as more capable than McCain when it comes to the economy , polls indicate .
The two campaigns have traded shots all week , most recently over the government takeover of AIG .
As the economy has dominated the headlines , Obama has widened his lead over McCain , according to CNN 's latest " poll of polls . "

Unless Edwards also had an affair with Obama that strikes me as really implausible .
On the other hand , if you 're mad about John Edwards behaving badly you might also be mad at John McCain for doing the same goddamned thing . *
JMM :
What I do know is that this is another of those cases where there is a tacit but uniform agreement among pretty much all reporters and close campaign watchers not to publicly state the obvious : that this is a perilous development for John McCain .
Just as Bill Clinton 's public undressing in the Lewinsky scandal led indirectly to the exposure of several high - profile Republican affairs , Edwards ' revelation will inevitably put pressure on the press in general to scrutinize John McCain under something more searching than the JFK rules they 've applied to date .
I assure you that this dimension of the story occurred to every reporter even tangentially involved in reporting this race soon after the Edwards story hit yesterday afternoon .

We all resent the fact that we are getting hoodwinked into earnestly choosing eco-friendly laundry detergents , while corporations are slowly unravelling any lingering EPA restrictions , right ?
That life has been marketed to feel greener , yet if we held manufacturing plants accountable for their pollution , the effects would dwarf our paltry individual attempts ?
And actually make a difference ?
I think this should be termed Supply Side Environmentalism .
If giving the corporations tax breaks will supposedly trickle down and wet the worker , then corporations should also herald in Environmentalism !

on 08.07.08 Given how fucked up the whole military tribunal thing was , a 66 month sentence is probably the most just thing that could have come out of it .
While I appreciate the " fuck you " it sent the Bush administration , the fact they may still subvert the courts and continue to hold Hamdan as an enemy combatant after he serves his sentence is infuriating .
That said , someone someday is going to have to put this system of injustice and indefinite detentions to an end and it's going to be a Democrat ( hopefully Obama in 2009 ) .
It scares me what the aftermath is going to be .
I 'm less scared that the people being held at Guantanamo are all going to go on murderous rampages than that one of them somewhere is going to do something that lets the Republicans say " I told you so " , and solidify all of these bastardizations of the Constitution and possibly put something even more draconian in place .
I doubt people would reflect that many of the prisoners who have been held for years there went in innocent and our policies of inhumane treatment towards them might have been what made them more extreme in their beliefs .
No , the Right would use that to justify that kangaroo courts and indefinite detentions without counsel were the only solution for a people so barbaric .

on 08.07.08 Remember Oscar Pistorius ?
And the inflammatory suggestion that people 's opinions loosely fell out along athlete / non - athlete lines ?
Let 's play that game again , because I 've read in more than one place about how , instead of imposing sex testing on female athletes , the Olympic committees need to learn to live in a flexible world of intersexed people .
And maybe our opinions here mirror whether or not we were sympathetic to Old Oscar .
I have a few thoughts :
1 . In general , I believe in a flexible world of intersexed people .
And I 'd even wager that the sex lines might be blurrier in the world of super - athletic women , if being born biologically fuzzy confers any sort of athletic bonus .
2 . How often are men straight - up trying to pass as women as a form of cheating ?
Is this really a concern ?
3 . If so , you have to do the testing .
Female athletes want to win , and they 've worked damn hard , and this would cheat someone out of their medal .
4 . If you have to do the testing , it should be done with compassion for the fact that you are most likely not detecting a cheater , but an ambiguously sexed person .
( Crap .
I started out poised to write something super - inflammatory about the glory of competition and chariots of fire , and came out with some mushy peacenik shit .

Style v. Substance Posted by Becks
on 08.06.08 I saw a bunch of McCain attack ads when I was at the gym tonight .
You know how the typical negative ad goes : show an unflattering picture of your opponent ( preferably in black and white ) while you talk about the bad things he 's supposedly done and then show a happy , pretty picture of yourself while you say you 'll do the opposite .
Two things I noticed : the images of Obama they used were always in color .
I suspect this is because reminding us that he is a black man is meant to be scarier than showing him in grainy black and white .
The second : they can't find a truly unflattering shot of the guy .
Even the " bad " photos of Obama , especially displayed in color , look pretty cute .
This makes me wonder if McCain is going to run into the Reagan problem : there 's a famous story ( which I can't find the source for because the Newseum used to be the definitive link and they 've revamped and suckified their website ) about how 60 Minutes ran a segment on Reagan that showed the contrast between his actions and his photo - ops : hugging kids while cutting funding for children 's programs , shafting the VA while giving speeches to veterans groups , etc .
They thought it was scathing and going to sink the president 's approval ratings .
Instead , opinions of the president actually went up among people who watched the segment because the pictures of smiling kids , happy veterans , and Reagan acting all grandfatherly sunk in while the damning stats did not .
Maybe the claims of all the terrible things Obama is going to do if he gets elected wo n't sink in because everyone will be blinded by his shiny happy face .

To wit , a surprising uptick in activity on my , ahem , output stage , mainly in the form of a sort of aerosol , which is subject to dispense at apparently any given moment .
I 'm inclined to assume this result must be normal , but it 's still a bit disconcerting and , quite seriously , has awful comedic timing .
Moreover , I should like to clarify , given the comments so far , that this phenomenon might be better described as an " after effect " , given that it occurs , generally , quite post-run .
Other runners may have other — and possibly more elucidating — experiences .

UPDATE : The votes are in , the masses want healthcare .
Here goes :
Recently in conversation , someone related to me some policy suggestions of how to practically begin to implement a socialized health care system into our current 2008 state of the mess .
( I do n't know who originated this plan , but if someone does , I 'm happy to give them credit . )
The first law is that insurance companies must accept all applicants .
The second law is that insurance companies must charge all customers the same rate .
The effect of these two laws would be that insurance companies can only distinguish themselves by the coverage they offer - bare bones coverage to extensive coverage .
Lastly , the government then needs to offer a decent insurance package , to offer a choice where the premiums are n't being driven up by runaway profit margins .
I thought this was an eminently sensible launching point .
Holiday Posted by Fontana Labs
on 08.05.08 Andy McCarthy seems to think that this story is a big problem :
Workers at Tyson Foods ' poultry processing plant in Shelbyville will no longer have a paid day off on Labor Day , but will instead take the Muslim holiday of Eid al - Fitr in the fall .
A recent press release from the Retail , Wholesale and Department Store Union ( RWDSU ) stated that a new contract at the Shelbyville facility " implements a new holiday to accommodate the ... Muslim workers at the plant . "
The RWDSU stated that " the five - year contract creates an additional paid holiday , Iidal Fitil , a Muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of Ramadan . "
Two points about this -- not novel , but I gots to vent .
First , 250 of the 1200 workers at this plant are Somali muslims .
That 's a fifth of the workforce , and it makes sense to take some cheap and fairly easy steps to make their lives easier .
Second , I 'm betting that being a Somali immigrant working in a chicken factory is not the easiest road to walk .
Whether you see this as a small crumb for people busting their asses every day or " modern elites ' unwillingness to require newcomers to conform to our ways " is a sort of Rorschach test for assholity .
( " The elites " here would I guess be the 80 % of the union members who approved the contract ? )
( Eid -al - fitr -- which McCarthy weirdly insists on calling " the Eid " even though the only other major Muslim holiday is Eid-al - adha - - is the festival marking the end of Ramadan .
Since Ramadan is a month of the Hijra calendar , the date will move forward on the Gregorian calendar by about ten days each year . )

One of my brothers is six years older than me .
From time to time he'd give me advice like , " If you want to get a girl to like Led Zeppelin , start by playing her the Oh , oh - oh - oh - oh , you do n't have to go song .
They like that song , and then you can be like , ' They also wrote this song . ' "
So one time he told me , " Do n't sit on a boy 's lap at a party , because he could have sex with you . "
I exclaimed , " Through my pants ? ? "
My brother said , " You 'd be wearing a skirt . "
I said , " Oh ... Through my underpants ? ? "
My brother said , " You would n't be wearing underpants . "
I said , " Oh...okay .
I won't . "
I was left thinking , Heebie , just be sure to wear underpants .
( Which has actually been easy to follow . )
But also , it led me to believe that someone could just slip you sex , without you noticing , like a roofie in your drink .

on 08.04.08 I swallowed a bee on Saturday .
No really !
I was taking a photo of a friend , when this bee starting buzzing around my face , then went straight into my open mouth .
It made about as far as my Adam 's apple before my hocking action impeded progress .
At that point , the bee began its exit , making sure to give me a nice hearty sting on its way out .
Thanks , bee !
Luckily , a med student was on - hand to comfort me .
He told me that I was n't going to die from swelling , because I would already be dying , the allergic reaction to stings being , apparently , almost immediate .
He also informed me that , had I swollen up enough to block my airway , he had been prepared to " trach " me , which was nice of him , I suppose .
So I have n't heard as much about disappearing bee populations this year , but one possible theory is that they 're completely fucking insane and flying down people 's throats .
Running Out Of Letters Posted by Becks
on 08.04.08 Stipulating that attempts to paint all members of a generation with a broad brush are somewhat flawed , I think the argument that the events of the last year or two will define the ending date of sunny Generation Y holds merit :
The inconvenient truths of the past half century are settling around our shoulders , and the preteens of today are not unaware of these issues or their complexity .
Today 's 11 to 13 years olds are forming a mental map based on a world with finite limits and no easy answers .
â ¢
Most 12 year olds are very aware that the polar ice caps are melting and the march of the penguins is slowing to a halt .
â ¢
They know why the family is vacationing in the backyard this year ... â ¢
Whatever they or their parents think about the war in Iraq and the Middle East in general , it 's likely that they have absorbed the complexity of the situation .
... â ¢
It would have been almost impossible for them to escape the phrase " housing crisis , " even though few , I suspect , understand how such a disaster came to be .
Home ownership , an icon of past generations ' goals , suddenly looks less worthy , now a risky proposition .
â ¢
And they have not missed the messages regarding layoffs and challenges to U.S. corporations .
...
Virtually all in this new generation are parented by X'ers - a generation renowned for self - reliance and self - sufficiency - rather than Boomers ....
The children of Generation X have undoubtedly absorbed to some degree their parents ' frustration with the economic hand they 've been dealt - poor job markets when they began their careers , high housing prices when they bought their first homes - and their general disenfranchisement with many existing institutions .
Perhaps they 've heard their parents ' growing resentment that Boomers have been poor stewards of our world - got us into wars we can't win and failed to prepare us for the century we face : not providing an adequate educational foundation , making no significant investment in alternative energy , adopting a combative posture toward global partners , in an increasingly collaborative world .

on 08.03.08 We 're going to be dealing with the fallout of this horrible administration for a long time :
The Justice Department 's inspector general reported this week that officials illegally stacked the decks with conservative attorneys who were sometimes unqualified .
Now , some are wondering how to address the fact that people who were hired through a flawed process effectively have tenure .
...
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday , Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - R.I. ) asked whether Congress could do anything to fix the situation .
He suggested removing civil service protections from people who were hired through a flawed process until those people had been through a legitimate hiring process .
...
Addressing this issue requires a balancing act .
No one wants a witch hunt , but no one wants political hacks in sensitive jobs , either ... [ Paul Light , public service professor at New York University ] believes that even if Congress could remove civil service protections from some Justice Department employees , it would set a bad precedent .
" The civil service process is designed to protect employees from political interference , " Light says .
" By stripping civil servants of protections after the fact , you undermine the whole notion of civil service protection . "
But Robert Raben , who led the Justice Department 's legislative affairs office under President Clinton , says addressing this problem is crucial .
" They 've been caught with their hand in the ideological cookie jar , " Raben says .
" The No. 1 issue here is confidence among the American people that cases are taken in a way that is n't influenced by political ideology . "
Raben believes it 's not appropriate to fire people just because they were hired through a flawed system , but he says it 's " critical " that supervisors watch those people carefully to make sure their legal decisions are not motivated by politics .
... [ Joshua Berman , who used to work in the department 's Public Integrity section ] believes existing performance - evaluation policies are strong enough to address the problem .
" To turn a flashlight back on the people who 've entered and to re-evaluate their admission into the department would be extremely difficult , " Berman says .
The system " should over time correct itself , " he says , and people who are not qualified for their jobs will eventually leave .
OK , how many of you have ever held a job and know that 's bullshit ?
These are people strongly motivated by ideology who are holding jobs with extreme power and reach .
If Justice is like anywhere I 've worked , what I suspect will happen is that ideologically - motivated supervisors will seek out other similarly - minded employees , creating fiefdoms where they can continue to give them good reviews and ensure they are protected .
This is n't gonna shake itself out .
There is a strange beauty to slow motion videos of car crash test dummies and airbag deployment , but these do n’t compare to the similar , but far more extreme safety measure of a fighter jet ejection .
Here are videos of various aspects of their deployment testing and training .
Some of these are absolutely mesmerizing .

Real - world drug outcomes
Clinical trials have guidelines , called eligibility criteria , about who can participate .
The criteria ensure that only a selected set of people are participated .
When the drugs are released in the market , the findings of the selected participants are generalized to the much bigger public .
It is thus not uncommon for drugs to behave differently in the real world than in clinical trials .
The 21st Century Cures Act , passed in 2016 , places additional focus on the use of real - world data to support regulatory decision making .
The FDA has started to use real - world data to monitor postmarket safety and adverse events , and payers to support value - based payment program .

Link of the day - Guesstimation : Solving the World ’s Problems on the Back of a Cocktail Napkin
Last week saw the demise of the shadow banking system that has been created over the past 20 years .
Because of a greater regulation of banks , most financial intermediation in the past two decades has grown within this shadow system whose members are broker - dealers , hedge funds , private equity groups , structured investment vehicles and conduits , money market funds and non -bank mortgage lenders .
Like banks , most members of this system borrow very short - term and in liquid ways , are more highly leveraged than banks ( the exception being money market funds ) and lend and invest into more illiquid and long - term instruments .
Like banks , they carry the risk that an otherwise solvent but liquid institution may be subject to a self - ­fulfilling and destructive run on its ­liquid liabilities .
But unlike banks , which are sheltered from the risk of a run – via deposit insurance and central banks ’ lender - of - last - resort liquidity – most members of the shadow system did not have access to these firewalls that ­prevent runs .
A generalised run on these shadow banks started when the deleveraging after the asset bubble bust led to uncertainty about which institutions were solvent .
The first stage was the collapse of the entire SIVs / conduits system once investors realised the toxicity of its investments and its very short - term funding seized up .
The next step was the run on the big US broker - dealers : first Bear Stearns lost its liquidity in days .
The Federal Reserve then extended its lender - of - last - resort support to systemically important broker - dealers .
But even this did not prevent a run on the other broker - dealers given concerns about solvency : it was the turn of Lehman Brothers to collapse .
Merrill Lynch would have faced the same fate had it not been sold .
The pressure moved to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs : both would be well advised to merge – like Merrill – with a large bank that has a stable base of insured deposits .
The third stage was the collapse of other leveraged institutions that were both illiquid and most likely insolvent given their reckless lending : Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , AIG and more than 300 mortgage lenders .
The fourth stage was panic in the money markets .
Funds were competing aggressively for assets and , in order to provide higher returns to attract investors , some of them invested in illiquid instruments .
Once these investments went bust , panic ensued among investors , leading to a massive run on such funds .
This would have been disastrous ; so , in another radical departure , the US extended deposit insurance to the funds .
The next stage will be a run on thousands of highly leveraged hedge funds .
After a brief lock - up period , investors in such funds can redeem their investments on a quarterly basis ; thus a bank - like run on hedge funds is highly possible .
Hundreds of smaller , younger funds that have taken excessive risks with high leverage and are poorly managed may collapse .
A massive shake - out of the bloated hedge fund industry is likely in the next two years .
Even private equity firms and their reckless , highly leveraged buy - outs will not be spared .
The private equity bubble led to more than $ 1,000bn of LBOs that should never have occurred .
The run on these LBOs is slowed by the existence of “ convenant - lite ” clauses , which do not include traditional default triggers , and “ payment - in - kind toggles ” , which allow borrowers to defer cash interest payments and accrue more debt , but these only delay the eventual refinancing crisis and will make uglier the bankruptcy that will follow .
Even the largest LBOs , such as GMAC and Chrysler , are now at risk .
We are observing an accelerated run on the shadow banking system that is leading to its unravelling .
If lender - of - last - resort support and deposit insurance are extended to more of its members , these institutions will have to be regulated like banks , to avoid moral hazard .
Of course this severe financial crisis is also taking its toll on traditional banks : hundreds are insolvent and will have to close .
The real economic side of this financial crisis will be a severe US recession .
Financial contagion , the strong euro , falling US imports , the bursting of European housing bubbles , high oil prices and a hawkish European Central Bank will lead to a recession in the eurozone , the UK and most advanced economies .
European financial institutions are at risk of sharp losses because of the toxic US securitised products sold to them ; the massive increase in leverage following aggressive risk - taking and domestic securitisation ; a severe liquidity crunch exacerbated by a dollar shortage and a credit crunch ; the bursting of domestic housing bubbles ; household and corporate defaults in the recession ; losses hidden by regulatory forbearance ; the exposure of Swedish , Austrian and Italian banks to the Baltic states , Iceland and southern Europe where housing and credit bubbles financed in foreign currency are leading to hard landings .
Thus the financial crisis of the century will also envelop European financial institutions .

Study : Women Have Worse Nightmares Than Men
The National Review Online , a publication which is probably the father of the modern conservative moment :
[ T ]he assertion by Republican leaders in the House that as many as a dozen of their members who were leaning toward voting for the legislation ended up voting against it because of Pelosi ’s speech is extraordinary .
Let ’s see if we have this straight : whichever side of the issue you were on , yesterday ’s vote was considered one of the most important ones members of Congress will ever face .
Many respected voices argued that an economic catastrophe might follow in the wake of its defeat .
Opponents of the legislation considered it a terrible violation of free - market principles .
The stakes could not be higher .
After the legislation was defeated and only one - third of House Republicans backed the plan , John Boehner and Roy Blunt took to the microphones and indicated that Pelosi ’s speech had been so alienating and offensive that a significant number of House Republicans changed their mind and voted against the bill .
Can they be serious ?
Do they realize how foolish and irresponsible they sound ?
On one of the most important votes they will ever cast , insisting “ the speech made me do it ” is lame and adolescent .
The vote , after all , was on the legislation , not the speech .
And to say that a dozen members of your caucus voted not out of principle but out of pique is a terrible indictment of them .
I hope we learn the names of these delicate figures whose feelings were so bruised and abused .
I have been defending House Republicans for a week against friends who thought they were acting in an irresponsible fashion .
I argued they were people with admirable free - market principles who were simply trying to improve legislation and have their voices heard , something to which they were certainly entitled .
And I thought they made the bill better than it was .
But yesterday ’s vote , and the excuses that followed the vote , have made me reassess my judgment .
Watching Boehner , Blunt , and Cantor blame the outcome on the Pelosi speech was an embarrassment .
We are in one of the most dispiriting moments I have ever witnessed in Washington , when political authority seems to be collapsing all around us .
House Republicans have contributed to this , and it ’s a shame .

Will Smith Wo n’t Return For INDEPENDENCE
DAY 2
After months and months of going back and forth , it seems that Will Smith has decided ...
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A 45 percent slide in the shares of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N , on concern it was struggling to raise desperately needed capital , stirred speculation that a U.S. government - sponsored rescue was increasingly likely .
The exterior of the world headquarters for Lehman Brothers is seen in New York , June 17 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
The forced - sale of the Bear Stearns brokerage in March and the pre-emptive seizure Sunday of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N has set a template that U.S. financial authorities might find hard to avoid .
Lehman , left as the smallest major U.S. independent investment bank after Bear Stearns ' takeover by JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N , has a prominent role in many of the same markets that Bear Stearns had : interest rate swaps , credit default swaps and equity derivatives .
While the government would be very reluctant to intervene yet again , especially if it required taxpayers ’ money , several experts say there may be no alternative to avoid a systemic financial crisis .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke may be forced to act to preserve stability in the rest of the financial system .
“ There is a risk that you could get the equivalent of a financial black hole and more people getting sucked in , ” said Robert Litan , a senior fellow in the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
Litan doubted Paulson or Bernanke wanted to go down in history books as an example of what not to do .
The tipping point of government intervention comes down to exactly how much counterparty risk exists with Lehman .
Several financial experts said Paulson , a former Goldman Sachs chairman , was likely calling friends on Wall Street asking what people know , who is exposed and how much loss they are willing to take .
“ Clearly , as was the case with Bear Stearns , there ’s concern that there would be outstanding trades that would be problematic to unwind should a worse case scenario develop , ” said John Canavan , analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates .
COUNTERPARTY RISK
The Fed already has a borrowing facility open to Lehman , a measure offered to investment banks after the Bear Stearns failure .
But it is meant to ensure short - term liquidity and not prop up an insolvent firm .
Some experts said if the counterparty risk is deemed to be small enough , regulators could move away from the precedent they set with Bear Stearns and send a message that the investments are not too big to fail .
“ It ’s a closer call , ” said New York University economics professor Lawrence White , who formerly served on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board .
“ I do n’t think there would be a big effect in the stock market ...
If ( the counterparty risk is ) relatively small , the Fed turns its back and says tough luck . ”
Concerns about the survival of Lehman have been circulating for months , causing its stock price to drop almost 90 percent this year .
Lehman has complained that unfounded rumormongering by traders who profit from share price declines are behind the dramatic decline .
Lehman shares closed Tuesday down 45 percent at $ 7.79 on the New York Stock Exchange , and touched their lowest level since October 1998 .
The stock tumbled after a report by Dow Jones Newswires that talks on a possible investment from Korea Development Bank broke down , citing the chairman of South Korea ’s top securities regulator , Jun Kwang - woo .
A spokesman for the regulator denied the report , telling Reuters that Jun never made the statement .
The Dow article also quoted an unnamed government official as saying KDB had decided not to invest in Lehman .
A Lehman spokeswoman and representatives for the Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment .
A U.S. Treasury Department spokeswoman said the department stays in touch with Wall Street on a regular basis .
NYSE Regulation spokesman Scott Peterson said the exchange is monitoring trading in Lehman shares closely .
Lehman shares rose 8 cents to $ 7.87 in after - hours trading after Citigroup Inc C.N , Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX , Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N all said they were still trading with Lehman .
And some experts are more bullish on Lehman ’s prospects as a stand - alone institution , saying it has a long tradition of success that wo n’t quickly evaporate .
“ My guess is that Lehman will end up finding a way to survive without government help , ” said economist Allen Sinai , head of Decision Economics Inc , a global economics and financial markets advisory firm .
But if other firms start pulling their money out of Lehman and it looks like a spreading credit seizure is underway , regulators will be forced to pull the trigger on another shotgun marriage like the one it arranged with Bear Stearns , Litan said .
“ That ’s the nightmare you worry about , Even if it ’s only a 5 percent or 10 percent risk of that happening , do you really want to take that risk ? ” Litan said .

An article in Tuesday 's Jerusalem Post claims that US strikes on Iran are imminent .
" US President George W. Bush intends to attack Iran in the upcoming months , before the end of his term , Army Radio quoted a senior official in Jerusalem as saying Tuesday , " the Israeli newspaper reports .
However , the White House immediately denied the report this morning .
" An article in today 's Jerusalem Post about the president 's position on Iran that quotes unnamed sources  quoting unnamed sources  is not worth the paper it 's written on , " White House press secretary Dana Perino said in a statement .
" Let me respond by reaffirming the policy of the administration :
We , along with our international allies who want peace in the Middle East , remain opposed to Iran 's ambitions to obtain a nuclear weapon , " Perino said .
" To that end , we are working to bring tough diplomatic and economic pressure on the Iranians to get them to change their behavior and to halt their uranium enrichment program . "
Perino said the " president of the United States should never take options off the table , but our preference and our actions for dealing with this matter remain through peaceful diplomatic means .
Nothing has changed in that regard . "
Excerpts from article : #
The official claimed that a senior member of the president 's entourage , which concluded a trip to Israel last week , said during a closed meeting that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were of the opinion that military action was called for .
However , the official continued , " the hesitancy of Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice " was preventing the administration from deciding to launch such an attack on the Islamic Republic , for the time being .
The report stated that according to assessments in Israel , recent turmoil in Lebanon , where Hizbullah de facto established control of the country , was advancing an American attack .

Author of One Minute To Midnight
The Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 is the best documented case study of decision - making by a United States president at a time of grave international peril .
Unfortunately , those 13 tension - filled days when the world stood on the brink of a nuclear precipice have become encrusted with myth and political spin .
US Air Force RF - 101 reconnaissance plane entering Cuba at the height of the crisis
Over the last three years , I spent thousands of hours interviewing missile crisis veterans and combing through archives in the US , Russia , Cuba , and Britain to assemble a minute - by - minute account of the crisis .
In the process , I uncovered numerous examples of bad information flowing into , and out of , the White House .
" What the president did n't know , and when he did n't know it " was a recurring theme in my research .
My conclusion : the beginning of wisdom for any president - from John F Kennedy to George W Bush - is to understand that you are groping about in the dark .

It turns out that much of what we think we know about one of the most studied episodes in modern history is either inaccurate or incomplete .
Even more alarming , much of what Kennedy thought he knew about Soviet actions and motivations rested on flawed intelligence reports .
Far from being an example of " matchlessly calibrated " diplomacy - a term used by Camelot historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr - the missile crisis is better understood as a prime illustration of the ever - present " screwup factor " in world affairs .
Here is a short list of some of the myths surrounding the Cuban missile crisis : Eyeball to eyeball
The " eyeball to eyeball " myth .
The notion that US warships were minutes away from a confrontation with Soviet freighters transporting missiles to Cuba has persisted for over 45 years .
The reported comment of Secretary of State Dean Rusk : " We were eyeball to eyeball , and the other fellow just blinked " - has become part of missile crisis mythology .
John F Kennedy makes a national television speech 22 October 1962
The eyeball to eyeball moment is described in some detail in Robert F Kennedy 's memoir , Thirteen Days , and Graham Allison 's political science classic , Essence of Decision .
Declassified CIA records and Russian archives show that it never happened .
The Soviet missile - carrying ships were at least 500 nautical miles away from the quarantine line at the time of the supposed confrontation , steaming back toward the Soviet Union .
By using intelligence reports to plot the positions of Soviet ships , I was stunned to discover that Khrushchev took the decision to avoid a confrontation with the US Navy more than 24 hours earlier .
' We knew the facts '
The " we knew the facts " myth .
This was part of the Kennedy spin in the immediate aftermath of the crisis .
It is true that the president received good ( if belated ) intelligence on the status of Soviet medium - range missiles on Cuba capable of hitting targets in the US .
But he was grossly misinformed about the numbers of Soviet troops on the island , and the fact that they were equipped with tactical nuclear weapons , which could have been used to wipe out an American invading force .
Based on interviews with Soviet participants and American intelligence records , I show that the Soviets deployed nuclear cruise missiles to within 15 miles of the Guantanamo naval base on the night of 26 - 27 October .
The Soviets had sent 80 14 - kiloton cruise missile warheads ( roughly the size of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima ) to Cuba for local battlefield use .
FKR nuclear cruise missile , similar to the ones targeted on Guantanamo during the crisis Defense secretary Robert McNamara told JFK on 20 October that there were 6,000 to 8,000 Soviet " technicians " on Cuba .
In fact , there were 43,000 heavily armed Soviet troops on the island at this point .
In control ?
The " fully in control " myth .
While there is no evidence of military insubordination on either the American or the Russian side during the crisis , there are many examples of the inability of both Kennedy and Khrushchev to fully control their own forces .
Any one of these incidents could have led to a nuclear exchange .
On the American side , there is the extraordinary case of Captain Charles Maultsby , a U - 2 pilot who blundered over the Soviet Union at the height of the crisis on 27 October after being sent on a mission to the North Pole to monitor Soviet nuclear tests .
Declassified US documents reveal that Maultsby spent 74 minutes in Soviet air space , causing the Russians to scramble half a dozen Mig fighters in response .
The Air Force failed to inform the president of what had happened until half an hour after he left Soviet air space .
On the Russian side , communications were so bad that Khrushchev could only exercise tenuous control over his troops on Cuba .
The nuclear missiles aimed at Guantanamo were under the command of a major .
There were no locks or codes to prevent them being fired .
Today , there is no longer such a thing as strategy , there is only crisis management
Robert McNamara
The happy outcome to the crisis - with Khrushchev withdrawing his missiles and no nuclear exchange - engendered a spate of hubris among " the best and the brightest " .
McNamara declared : " Today , there is no longer such a thing as strategy , there is only crisis management . "
McNamara and others attempted to put these lessons into practice in Vietnam , with disastrous results .
Fortunately , Kennedy did not believe his own spin .
His own prior experience - both as a US Navy lieutenant in World War II and the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961 - had taught him to react sceptically to the assurances of the military brass .
He moved decisively to bring the crisis to an end by secretly offering to match a withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba with a dismantling of US Jupiters in Turkey .
JFK understood , better than any of his advisers , that events were spiralling out of control by 27 October , the day that became known as " Black Saturday " .
He knew that the chances of something going drastically wrong increase exponentially the closer you get to actual fighting .
In a war , anything can , and usually does , happen - as we have seen repeatedly in Iraq .
Kennedy knew that crisis management was a myth , and that there is no margin for error in preparing for a nuclear war .
That is the abiding lesson of the Cuban missile crisis .

What are these ?
I recently began working on a project based on Pinax .
The Pinax project 's goal is to develop a set of re-usable applications for the Django Web Framework that are common in website development .
Generally , these applications provide the functions and features common in social media sites .
For reference , Bob Haugen has also posted how to do this on a wiki page in the Pinax tribe on Cloud27 .
For the purposes of this example , I 've set up a temporary space called Slaptijack for my Subversion repository at Assembla .
The first thing to do is create our main repository directory structure .
In other words , let 's create the branches , tags , and trunk directory and import this into our new repository .
$ mkdir Slaptijack - tmp $ cd Slaptijack - tmp $ mkdir trunk tags branches $ svn import -- message " Initial directory import . "
http://svn.assembla.com/svn/cmlzpiJn0r3Azzab7jnrAJ
Adding trunk Adding branches Adding tags Committed revision 1 .
Now you can remove that temporary directory we created for the Subversion import .
$ cd .. $ rm -r Slaptijack - tmp
It 's time to checkout our new project .
Notice that I 'm checking out the trunk here instead of the whole repository .
$ svn checkout http://svn.assembla.com/svn/cmlzpiJn0r3Azzab7jnrAJ/trunk
Slaptijack Checked out revision 1 . We need to enter our project directory and export the Pinax project directory .
We want to export the Pinax project into our own project name .
It 's important to do an export here , because we 're going to add this directory into our Subversion repository .
Obviously , we do n't want a bunch of .svn cluttering up our import .
$ cd Slaptijack $ svn export http://django-hotclub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pinax slaptijack A slaptijack A slaptijack / manage.py < snip >
A slaptijack / templates / about / about.html
A slaptijack / templates / about/terms.html
Exported revision 962 .
Change into the project directory ( slaptijack in my case ) and clean up any references to pinax in settings.py .
This seems like a good time to mention that you can create a file called localsettings.py for settings that should only be used in your development environment or otherwise override the main settings file .
Once you 've made the necessary changes , ascend one directory and add your new directory into the repository .
$ cd .. Baldr : Slaptijack scott $ ls slaptijack $ svn add slaptijack A slaptijack A slaptijack / __init__.py < snip >
A slaptijack / utils A slaptijack / utils / gradient.py $ svn -- message " New pinax project dir " commit Sending . < snip >
Transmitting file data .....................................................
Committed revision 2 . Now we 've got the main project directory set up , it 's time to add the real meat of the pinax project .
We 'll do that via the svn:externals Subversion repository .
This way we 'll always have the latest and greatest version of each re-usable application .
You might find in your environment that it makes sense to tie each external to a particular revision .
If that 's the case , go for it !
Instead of using individual propset commands , I 'm going to use the propedit command to add all the externals at the same time .
For this to work , you will probably need to have the EDITOR environment variable set .
In my case , that 's vim .
Change into your top - level project directory and start from there .
$ svn propedit svn:externals . #
The following is the contents of the vim file .
Saving # the changes and exiting vim executes the svn command .
core_apps
http://django-hotclub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/core_apps external_apps http://django-hotclub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/external_apps external_libs http://django-hotclub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/external_libs local_apps http://django-hotclub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/local_apps
Set new value for property ' svn:externals ' on '.' $ svn -- message " Bringing in externals " commit Sending .
Committed revision 3 . To get our externals brought into our work space , we 'll need to issue an update .
There are a lot of external applications , so be patient .
$ svn update Fetching external item into ' core_apps '
A core_apps / about A core_apps / about / views.py < snip >
A local_apps / things_app/templatetags/extra_voting_tags.py
A local_apps/things_app/models.py
Updated external to revision 965 .
Updated to revision 3 . $ ls core_apps external_apps external_lib local_apps slaptijack
At this point , you should have a working Pinax - based project in your Subversion repository .
The only thing you might consider is having Subversion ignore *.pyc and SQLite3 database files .
Here 's how I did it .
First , create a temporary text file with the following two lines .
I called mine / tmp / slaptijack .
*.pyc *.db
Next I ran the following command at the top level of my repository trunk to apply the ignore settings to all directories : $ find .
- type d - name .svn - prune -o - type d - exec svn propset svn:ignore - F / tmp / slaptijack {} \;
Finally , let 's have our project directory ignore the localsettings .py file .
We do n't want to accidentally upload some configuration that will break our production environment .
$ svn propset svn:ignore localsettings.py slaptijack Like Bob Haugen , I had a similar problem where Subversion wanted me to update before I could commit .
This is possibly related to the external directories .
I think that just about wraps up everything I did .
If I missed a step or did n't adequately explain something , please leave a comment or let me know .

Individuals with synesthesia perceive the world in a different way from the rest of us .
Because their senses are cross-activated , some synesthetes perceive numbers or letters as having colors or days of the week as possessing personalities , even as they function normally in the world .
Now , researchers at the California Institute of Technology have discovered a type of synesthesia in which individuals hear sounds , such as tapping , beeping , or whirring , when they see things move or flash .
Surprisingly , the scientists say , auditory synesthesia may not be unusual -- and may simply represent an enhanced form of how the brain normally processes visual information .
Psychologists previously reported visual , tactile , and taste synesthesias , but auditory synesthesia had never been identified .
Caltech lecturer in computation and neural systems Melissa Saenz discovered the phenomenon quite by accident .
" While I was running an experiment at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center , a group of students happened to pass by on a tour , and I volunteered to explain what I was doing , " explains Saenz , who , along with Christof Koch , the Lois and Victor Troendle Professor of Cognitive and Behavioral Biology at Caltech and professor of computation and neural systems , reports the finding in the August 5 issue of the journal Current Biology .
" As part of the experiment , a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out , somewhat like the opening scene of Star Wars .
Out of the blue , one of the students asked , " Does anyone else hear something when you look at that ? "
After talking to him further , I realized that his experience had all the characteristics of a synesthesia : an automatic sensory cross-activation that he had experienced all of his life , " says Saenz .
A search of the synesthesia literature revealed that auditory synesthesia -- of any kind -- had never been reported .
Intrigued , Saenz began to look for other individuals with the same ability , using the original movie seen by the student as a test .
" I queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up , " she says .
Having that specific example made it easy to find more people .
That movie just happens to be quite " noisy " to the synesthetes and was a great screening tool .
When asked if it made a sound , one of the individuals responded , " how could it not ? "
I would have been less successful had I just generally asked , " Do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash ? " because in the real environment , things that move often really do make a sound , " for example , a buzzing bee .
This may be why auditory synesthesia had n't been detected by neurobiologists .
" People with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual .
These individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life , rather than a dramatically different experience , compared to others , " says Saenz .
However , when asked , all of the synesthetes could name examples of daily visual events that caused sounds that they logically knew to be only in their minds , such as seeing a fluttering butterfly or watching television with the sound turned off .
Saenz and Koch found that the four synesthetes outperformed a group of nonsynesthetes on a simple test involving rhythmic patterns of flashes similar to visual Morse code .
Normally , such patterns are easier to identify with sound ( beeps ) than with vision ( flashes ) , so the researchers predicted that synesthetes would have an advantage with visual patterns because they actually heard a sound every time they saw a flash .
In the test , the subjects saw a series of flashes and had to guess if a second sequence , played afterward , represented the same temporal pattern or not .
As a baseline measurement , a similar test was given using sequences of beeps .
Both the synesthetes and the control group performed equally well when given beeps .
However , with visual flashes synesthetes were much more accurate , responding correctly more than 75 percent of the time , compared to around 50 percent -- the level predicted by chance -- in the control group .
" Synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns , " Saenz says .
Saenz and Koch suspect that as much as 1 percent of the population may experience auditory synesthesia .
In fact , she and Koch think that the brain may normally transfer visual sensory information over to the auditory cortex , to create a prediction of the associated sound .
" This translation might result in actual sound perception in synesthetes , perhaps due to stronger than normal connections , says Saenz , who has begun brain imaging experiments to study this connectivity in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes .
" We might find that motion processing centers of the visual cortex are more interconnected with auditory brain regions than previously thought , even in the ' normal ' brain , " Saenz says .
" At this point , very little is known about how the auditory and visual processing systems of the brain work together .
Understanding this interaction is important because in normal experience , our senses work together all the time . "

ROME – Vice President Dick Cheney , not surprisingly , endorsed Gov. Sarah Palin as the Republican candidate to replace him , but the man who reshaped the office as much as other vice president in history suggested she would not necessarily replicate the role he has played under President Bush .
“ Each administration is different , ” he said , speaking to reporters on Monday on the sun-dappled patio of the ambassador ’s residence here .
“ And there ’s no reason why Sarah Palin ca n’t be a successful vice president in a McCain administration . ”
Mr. Cheney ’s remarks represented his first on Senator McCain ’s choice as a running mate and offered insight into his own legacy in office .
Put simply , the world ’s not likely to see a vice presidency quite like his .
“ It wo n’t look exactly like the Bush administration or the first Bush administration , the Ford administration , ” he said .
“ It ’ll be relatively unique to this president and this time that they ’re in office . ”
Even as Republicans gathered for their convention , Mr. Cheney travelled to Azerbaijan , Georgia , Ukraine and , now , Italy to rally international pressure on Russia over its war against Georgia .
He brought to the trip a reservoir of experiences as an energy executive , a defense official and a hawkish skeptic of Russia that predated his two terms as vice president .
If it might be hard for her critics to imagine Ms. Palin emerging from Air Force Two in Georgia or Ukraine to hector Russia , as Mr. Cheney did , that ’s beside the point , in his view .
A Palin vice presidency , he said , would be shaped by her own experiences and her partnership with a President McCain .
Much of that , of course , remains unclear .
“ We ’ve had all kinds of vice presidents over the years , ” Mr. Cheney said , when asked about how her experience differed so vastly from his .
“ Everybody brings a different set of experiences to the office and also a different kind of understanding with whoever the president is . ”
Mr. Cheney , who has met the governor before and telephoned her after she was selected , described her speech to the Republican convention as “ superb . ”
He singled out her joke about the difference between a pit bull and a hockey mom .
“ I loved some of her lines , ” he said , laughing .
Mr. Cheney skipped his scheduled appearance before his party ’s convention because of Hurricane Gustav , but he watched her speech on television early Thursday morning in Baku , Azerbaijan ’s capital , 10 time zones away .
With 12 receptions , 197 yards and a touchdown in three games this season , Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Hank Baskett has become a popular waiver wire pick - up in many fantasy football leagues around the nation .
And now it turns out the burgeoning star is fulfilling a bedroom fantasy of million of men , as well : he 's doing naughty things to Kendra Wilkinson nude .
Baskett and this girlfriend of Hugh Henfer were spotted recently dining together at Redstone restaurant in Marlton , Pennsylvania .
Even more telling : Kendra lists " HB3 " as one of her heroes on her MySpace page ; while Baskett 's page says " HB3 in LOOOOOVVVVEEEE !!!! "
That pretty much confirms this rumor , does n't it ?
Sounds like Hank Baskett has Kendra Wilkinson on his fantasy team ... if you know what we mean !
Zhang Yimou , the show ’s artistic director and one of the country ’s leading film directors , expressed deep sadness following a visit with Liu ’s on Monday .
“ I feel sorry for Liu Yan , my heart is full of regrets , ” he said in an interview .
“ I ’m deeply sorry .
Liu
Yan is a heroine .
She sacrificed a lot for the Olympics , for me , for the opening ceremony . ”
In an earlier interview with the Chinese media , after his artistic direction of the opening ceremony won high praise from around the world , Zhang said he was pleased with the show but added that there were some serious problems in rehearsals for a show that involved more than 15,000 performers .
“ I regret many things , many details of this performance , many things I could have done better , ” he said .
“ For example , there are performers who were injured .
I blame myself for that .
It might well have been avoided if I had given more detailed instructions . ”
Following the accident , Liu ’s parents flew to Beijing from their home in northern China ’s Inner Mongolia region .
Her husband and friends were seeking a specialist to help determine whether she can regain her ability to walk .
Liu , a graduate of the prestigious Beijing Dance Academy , was widely considered one of the country ’s leading classical dancers .
Dance experts call her movements incredibly fluid , and say her beauty radiates on the stage .
Over the years , some of her performances have also been popular on YouTube .
She has won most of the nation ’s top dance and drama awards , including the Lotus Cup .
She also performed last year at the country ’s New Year ’s Eve Gala , which is televised nationally every year and draws some of the country ’s most famous singers , dancers and actors .

You can still take the Traffic Quiz and get an instant score , but you ’d better do it before reading any further .
As promised , here are explanations and sources for the answers in the quiz , which was created by Tom Vanderbilt , the author of “ Traffic . ”
1 . At what speed have four - lane highways been found to achieve maximum flow — that is , move the most cars past one point per hour ?
60 miles per hour .
( This answer comes from a number of sources , including ( in pdf format ) this 2005 article by Pravin Varaiya in the journal Access . )
2 . What state , as ranked by fatalities per million vehicle miles driven , is the most dangerous in the United States ?
3 . How long are white stripes that divide lanes on a typical highway ?
Ten feet is the recommend standard ; in many cases they can be as long as 15 feet .
A good rule of thumb is they are long as the average car itself .
4. True or False : Drivers sitting relatively high above the road tend to drive faster than drivers sitting closer to the ground .
5 . By what estimated factor increase does the fatality risk in crash increase as speed increases from 25 to 50 mph ?
6 . What walking speed do engineers use in deciding the length of “ walk ” and “ do n’t walk ” phases ?
Four feet per second .
7 . At what average speed do we “ overdrive ” our low - beam headlights — lose our ability to stop in time if coming upon a dark object ?
Forty - five miles per hour .
( Answer provided by Michael Sivak , head of the human factors division at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute . )
8 . Imagine there are two road improvements a city can make .
One will improve the speeds of travelers from 40 kilometers per hour to 50 k.p.h .
The other , on a road of the same length , will increase speeds from 80 k.p.h. to 130 k.p.h .
Which would be better in terms of time saved for travelers ?
Both save about the same amount of time .
( See Ola Svenson ’s 2008 article in Applied Cognitive Psychology . )
9 . If you drove aggressively , how much time could you typically expect to save on a typical car trip that would ordinarily take half an hour ?
One minute .
( Aggressive driving studies have been done in a number of different contexts , but see , for example , this report by J. Archer and colleagues at the Monash University Accident Research Center . )
10 .
What percentage of crashes in the U.S. were found to be related to “ vehicle factors ” as opposed to driver behavior ?

My Story with the Quran : How I Left Islam ; How to Fight It ?
" Without raising an eyebrow , I also read about Mohammed 's genocide of the Jewish tribe of Bani Quryza .
I had developed the concept that committing Islamic genocides against the Jews are no more disturbing to an Arab than slaughtering a herd of cattle . "
Continued from Part One
In practice with other Muslims , during the month of Ramadan , I used to read the Quran from cover to cover , a tradition that stayed with me all my life as a Muslim .
I used to plan the event so that I would finish the last chapter on the 27th of the month of Ramadan .
I used to experience some strange and disturbing feeling about the quality of what I was reading .
That feeling used to get worse as I went through the chapters and by the time I got to the last few chapters it reached its peak .
Those ' satanic ' feelings were especially troubling because I used to read those last few chapters on the 27th day of Ramadan , which is known among Muslims as ' Laylat al quadr ' when the spiritual feelings supposed to be at its zenith .
However , I was a well - trained Muslim and knew what to do in such circumstances ; I used to pronounce the famous sentence " auzu billahi mina shaitani al rajeem " to seek refuge with Allah from the Satan , whom I blamed to be behind my ' satanic thoughts '!

$ 7.96 | E.Book : $ 6:00 My problem was that , as a Muslim , I was supposed to believe that the Quran has a superior language style that is impossible to be matched by a human , but deep in my mind I was n't truly convinced .
The above allegation is essential to Islam and Muslims use it to support their ultimate lie that the Quran has a divine origin .
In connection with the above allegation , all the Arabs seem to believe that all the legendary Arab poets and writers , in the past and present , were stunned by the Quran , which is another big lie that I also believed .
To me ,
It was unthinkable to allow myself to be the odd one out .
It was also totally unacceptable to my Islamic mind to live without being genuinely impressed by the Quran and legitimately believing in Allah 's superior writing style .
Therefore , I self censored my thoughts and silenced my mind and covered it with an Islamic mask to conceal my real doubts .
I blamed my standard of knowledge and my poor language taste for not properly appreciating the eloquence of a good book !
I spent several years suffering from that psychological conflict between what truly I believed and what I was supposed to believe .
I was aware that those ' satanic ' thoughts were there deep in my mind and would surface unless I continuously suppress them , which I did well .
In those days , if someone asked me about what I thought about the Quran , I would have given an automatic answer in support of the common Muslims ' assertion , without even being aware that it did n't represent my real feeling .
Fearing of the thought of being branded as an unbeliever , I kept my secret sin to myself and never mentioned it to any one no matter how he / she was close to me .
Those days , the myth of the so - called scientific miracles in the Quran was not yet an issue and I never associated the Quran with science .
I accepted the Quran just as a religious message from Allah to the early Arabs , revealed in their own language and at their level of knowledge .
I was aware that the Quran was not particularly scientific when it mentioned things like the flat earth or the development of the embryo .
During that period nobody claimed that the Quran has scientific miracles , and all the ambitions of Muslim scholars of that time were to emphasize to the ordinary Muslims not to examine the Quran with a scientific perception .
Those days the Muslim scholars promoted the Quran as a language miracle , which is another myth that all Muslims believe .
Considering that the vast majority of Muslims have no or very little knowledge of the classic Arabic language , it is safe to conclude that the vast majority of Muslims who defend the above claim do not actually know what they talk about .
Moving to the West When I moved to the UK in the late 1970s , I was already a non-practicing Muslim who hardly thought of Islam or read the Quran .
I started to have more contacts with the non Arab Muslims , usually friends and colleagues .
I was amazed by their zeal towards Islam , and their ability to read some suras from the Quran in Arabic , which is not their language .
They claimed that reading the Quran gives them a calming feeling , and envied me because , they thought , I enjoyed the full experience as I read the Quran in my own language .
They were all in agreement that the Quran should be read in its original language to appreciate its eloquence and style .
I found it strange that somebody who does not speak the language can make such an assertion with such a confidence , especially that unbiased readers think that the Quran is in fact far better after translation , which sanitizes it from many of its blunders and weaknesses .
Though impressed with the faith of the non Arab Muslims in the Quranic style , it did not convince me of their postulation .
The opinions expressed by the non Arab Muslims cannot be genuine since they do not speak the language of the Quran .
Those Muslims were obviously repeating what others told them .
This is also true for the majority of the Arabs who can hardly write an error free sentence in classic Arabic , but fiercely guard the myth of good standard in the Quran .
The opinions expressed by those Muslims helped me to come to my conclusion that to be convinced of the alleged high standard of the Quran you only need to be a Muslim , no knowledge of Arabic is required .
I moved to another town but maintained contacts with my Muslim friends .
One of them was so worried about my liberal understanding of Islam that he kept sending me some free Islamic literature to strengthen my faith .
Those booklets were superficial and boring ; I only read them to improve my proficiency the English language .
But eventually my friend succeeded when one day I received from him a copy of Baucailles ' book about the Quran and science .
I read some parts of it like the origin of the universe , the shape of the earth and the development of the embryo .
I did n't find any of the arguments presented in the book to be convincing but surprisingly I liked the book !
I only liked it because the author happened to be a Christian who believes the Quran had scientific miracles !
That must be a big win for Islam .
I must say that the Baucaille factor brought me slightly closer to Islam .
I started to acquire some other Islamic materials about the miracles of the Quran .
I had a friend who brought me some video tapes of the activities of sheikh Zendani , a wahhabi Muslim who presided on a Saudi organization dedicated to propagate the scientific miracles of the Quran .
That was the time when Professor Keith Moore was recruited , probably by this organization , to quote the Quran in his embryology book .
In the late 1980s , I made two work related trips to Saudi Arabia and performed a mini pilgrimage , called omrah , during each of them .
I had a firsthand experience with how the Saudi regime brainwashes , not only its citizens , but also all those who come to the country for work .
The Saudi / Wahhabi system expects all Muslims to adopt their own understanding of Islam which , they claim , is the true Islam .
I resented that claim in private but I must admit that I was wrong and the Saudis were right .
All employees had to stop work for half an hour to perform the miday ( Zuhr ) and afternoon ( Asr ) prayers .
It caught my eye that when the Muslim employees , of any nationality , read something during their breaks , they read either a newspaper or the Quran .
There was a good number of Quran books stacked in the coffee room to keep with the high demand .
I was shocked by the obvious manifestation of racism in the Saudi society , but even more shocking was the speed at which the other Arabs and Muslims switch to adopt a Saudi life style like wearing a white dress ( thub ) to look like the Saudis , and improve their standing in the society .
I visited a big bookshop in Riyadh and was amazed to see that Islam related books dominated the display .
I browsed some of the non Islamic sections , like history , to find all the books on display were the ones that were in line with the Saudi / Wahhabi system .
I also noticed a good number of books about dreams and jinn , which are essential parts of the Islamic culture .
I also spoke to many local ' intellectuals ' and despaired of the way they see the world and think of the others .
During those visits I had a chance to meet with some Syrian friends whom I have n't seen since the days of the university and was surprised to see the level of thinking they had descended to after spending so many years in Saudi Arabia .
They were advocates of the Zindani 's claims about the scientific miracles in the Quran .
Their only proof was the common Islamic myth that all scientists in the world are waking up to those ' facts ' .
They made me watch more of Zindani 's tapes but I did n't find any of his claims to be scientifically convincing .
Also I did n't like the practice of his group to fund and organize conferences to overpower some international scientists and tempt them to say some positive remarks about the Quran .
I became suspicious about those claims and my suspicion made me go back to Baucaille 's book and read it again , this time with an unbiased and open mind .
My aim was to look at a convincing argument .
My first alarm was to learn that the author was working for the Saudi king , because , from experience , I knew that most westerners working in Saudi Arabia would do anything to please the Saudis .
Then I read the specific scientific areas , which the author claims that the Quran comes in agreement with science .
The more I read from Baucaille 's book the more I became disgusted about how low some scientists are prepared to descend to please their masters .
In short , Baucaille book was based on twisting the language to come up with a suitable meaning .
It is interesting to note that Baucaille 's book has been in circulation for decades but I never met an Arab who had actually read it , although they all praise it with enthusiasm .
The fasting month of Ramadan was approaching fast and with it begins my traditional reading of the Quran .
That year was the first and only time in my life I felt eager to read the Quran .
My aim was to study the Quran rather than just read it .
I was mainly interested in having a general contemplation of the language style and the contents of the Quran .
By then , I already made up my mind that the scientific issue was a myth and intended to ignore it during that reading and focus on the language , but I could n't .
Having just read Baucaille 's book , I could n't help noticing that the Quran made serious mistakes whenever it touched on a scientific issue .
Those scientific blunders that never caught my eyes in the past have become major obstacles to me in accepting the Quran .
I could n't help noticing that :
The Quran commits Islam to serious mistakes in describing the origin of man .
Muslims are still in dilemma as to what to do about it .
The Quran makes serious mistakes in describing the shape of the earth .
The Quran makes serious mistakes in describing the origin of the universe ,
The Quran makes serious mistakes in describing the space ( sky ) and earth and referring to both in equal terms .
The Quran makes serious mistakes in describing the formation of mountains and claiming that Allah dropped them to stabilize the flat earth .
The Quran makes serious mistakes in describing the development of the embryo .
The Quran makes serious mistakes in describing the heart as the center of intelligence and completely ignoring the role of the brain .
The list can go on and on .
In short , the Quran only agreed with the common knowledge of the seventh century Arabia .
This is clear from the fact that the early Arabs never objected to the above information because it was the information they knew already .
The early Arabs wrongly believed the earth was flat , so did the Quran .
They wrongly believed that the mountains were dropped on the flat earth to stabilize it , so did the Quran .
They wrongly believed that the sky was attached to earth then separated by god , so did the Quran .
They wrongly believed that the heart was the center of intelligence , so did the Quran .
They wrongly understood the development of the embryo and so did the Quran .
That reading in the late 1980 was my first and only reading of the Quran with an open and critical mind .
However , it was n't a complete reading because I had to abandon it after only a couple of weeks when it became clear to me that the Quran is not worth reading .
I came to the conclusions that : The Quran is full with major scientific errors .
The myth of scientific miracles is designed to cover up those errors .
The Quran is full with grammatical and other language errors that would never be accepted in any other book or from any other writer .
The Quran has been deliberately wrapped by confusing sound and visual effects so that it does n't look like a normal book when heard or read .
The Quran is full with repetitions of stories that have no relevance to our time , or even to Mohammed 's time .
Such repetitions account for nearly one thirds of the book .
Some verses are incomplete , while others contain irrelevant insertions or seem to be completely out of place .
It is likely that the scribes or the people who collected the Quran committed such errors .
There is almost no resemblance at all between the Meccan verses and the Medina verses , a fact well known to Muslims .
However , the Muslims ' explanations are not convincing .
We do not expect Allah to change his style or dialect when Mohammed moves from one place to another .
A more logical explanation is that the authors or Mohammed 's sources have changed .
Humans ' errors of the scribes and the people responsible of the early collections of the Quran may account for many of its errors .
Some verses could have been included more than once ( hence the excessive repetitions ) and some may have been misplaced or gone completely missing .
The myth of scientific miracles in the Quran is a replica of the myth of language miracle .
In the last few decades , the Muslim scholars employed all the resources available to them to spread their big lie that claims the Quran agrees with science .
They used every possible means : schools , mosques , printed publications , TV programs and international conferences and more .
Muslims believed it and now talk about the issue as an agreed fact that is supported by another fact that most of scientists who read the Quran were convinced .
This strategy was used successfully to spread their lie that the Quran is a language miracle that stunned all the early Arabs .
Gradually , I started to gather enough pieces to complete the picture .
The Quran is all about myths and big lies .
As I started thinking about the Quran , the inevitable happened and I came to my conclusion that the Quran could never be divine .
Once the Quran was stripped off its divine halo everything looked different .
I watched with disbelief as everything I learned about Islam suddenly became meaningless .
I felt betrayed and angry because of my wasted years just to follow a liar .
At the age of forty , I had to rethink everything about my life all over again .
I felt lonely as I could n't discuss my thoughts with anyone around me ; I knew well what the consequences could be .
I also knew well what could happen to me if my relatives , back home , find out what I think of Islam .
My only option was to live with two personalities , my real personality and an Islamic one , which I put on whenever I am among relatives or friends in Syria .
In other words I started to practice a non Islamic taquiya !
I moved away from Islam at a time when most Muslims seemed to move towards it , which made me feel even more isolated .
I was firm and confident of my decision , there was no way back .
I maintained my relations with other Muslims but never disclosed my thoughts to any of them .
My friends and relatives already know me as a ' liberal Muslim living in the west ' and not keen on practicing the religion .
I am keen on maintaining that image , the only change they noticed about me is that I stopped rejecting Mohammed 's ahadiths and sira ( life story ) .
I resisted all the financial temptation to return and work in the Middle East .
My presence in the UK helped me to live my life the way I wanted and to control my contacts with the Islamic community .
Although I never wasted an opportunity to carefully disseminate the seeds of doubt in the minds of Muslim friends and colleagues , but my strategy was just to ignore Islam and live without it .
For years , I did not give a minute of thought to Mohammed or the Quran ; I put all behind my back .
I maintained my visits to Syria as well as other Middle Eastern countries like Jordan and Egypt .
I became increasingly worried about the obvious signs of Islamification of the people in those countries , especially in Egypt .
Those years in the 1990s , the world had daily loud alarms about what the Islamists can do .
Every week we heard about the massacres carried out by the Islamists in Algeria against other Muslims .
The Islamists occupied villages and slaughtered their inhabitants by cutting their throats !
Hundreds of thousands of Algerians lost their lives in that way .
In the 1990s , Egypt also was a play ground for Islamists , but the victims were European tourists .
The Egyptian president frequently blamed the west and the UK in particular for opening its doors and protecting the Muslim terrorists .
The Islamic organizations made no secret of their hatred to the west and their wish to destroy it .
I just could n't understand the western apathy towards the coming threat .
My only surprise about 9/11 was that America was surprised !
My freedom of not practicing Islam started to come under threat with the rising Islamic influence in the UK , my adopted country .
One day , I was outraged when a Muslim asked me why they do not see me in the mosque and why my wife is not covered .
It became so obvious that the Islamification of the UK was proceeding at an alarming speed .
The picture was really gloomy and depressing as nobody in sight seemed capable or willing to stand to the evil of Islam , which openly threatens all what civilization stands for .
Fortunately that all changed a few years ago .
One day I was surfing the Internet and stumbled upon FFI .
I felt like I spent years in a deserted Island then I spotted a ship .
That night , I spent hours reading the published articles about Islam , and was surprised of how little I knew about Mohammed .
I soon realized that FFI , IW and other similar Internet sites are the first real force to face Islam since its birth .
All those who fought Islam in the past did so using their military forces and were only interested in political or military gains .
Internet sites like FFI and IW are interested in exposing the truth of that evil cult that lives in darkness and survives on lies .
This is the first time in history when Islam is under pressure to provide convincing answers to protect it from the light of the truth .
But Islam has no answers .

Certainly one of the very best articles I ever found here .
Very revealing your thoughts about the average muslim who is only parroting all the hypes concerning language miracles and hidden scíence .
It is a very common phenomenon in the muslim world that people are talking about subjects they have no idea about .
BTW , how many muslims are there who have any knowledge about science ???
----------
P.S. My very first impression of the quran - a translation to be honest - was that is a very boring book , full of gossip and nonsense , but without any " REVEALATION " at all in it .
All " revealations " in it are wrong , trivial or absolutely unnecessary .
An almighty god has better things to do than to " reveal " such nonsense !

The bombing carried out by Islamic militants shows that Islam is an ideology of violence .
In dealing with Islam India should assasinate the imams or Muslim religious teachers and close down mosques .
If the Muslims in Kashmir want to revolt , shoot them dead and show no mercy

To stop this cult of death .
People like you that actually sit down and read , critically , are the ones that will bring it down .
People like you are dangerous to the head of mosques and other clergy because of the money that is given to the " houses of worship " is used by them to live .
It is people like you that I will stand no behind , not just next to , but in front of because you are the ones that will help bring down the end .
These religion refuses to do what the other religions have done , evolve .

I think internet will be the annihilator of Islam in the finite future .
The quest for knowledge and truth will be met by the internet which in turn will melt away the faith from the human beings with logic and reasonings .
The left outs will be die hard muslims who will be killling / killed at certain point of time .

This is one of the best articles I 've read in a while .
The author takes the reader into his intimate journey of psychological and intellectual struggles for twenty some years or more .
The article also clearly shows that the public will believe any lie , if repeated enough and financially supported by Saudi oil money .
Peace to all

It is a nice article .
I have undergone the same experience in my life also .
I am Tamil speaking Indian born in a Muslim family completed 60 now .
I read Quron both in Tamil and English number of times during my boyhood .
I was shocked to know the contents of that book when I was in College .
After that I continued to read it with an open mind .
I used to compare both Tamil and English versions to confirm the contents .
Both the versions were telling the same hatred and violence .
I came across so many foolish and hateful verses in that book .
But I was not able to discuss this with anybody .
My muslim friends were fanatics .
I underwent number of stages in my journey towards enlightenment .
Now I am comfortable with the sites like IW , FFI , etc .
But still I am unable to meet a man who speaks out his mind openly .
People are afraid of coming out with an open mind .
Fortunately my wife understands me and that evil ideology also .
I brought up my children without giving them any religious exposure and identity .
They are now highly educated and settled in USA .
Congrats Mumin Salih !
It is really thrilling to read an article written by an Arab speaking Man which is supposed to be the first hand information .
Let the first victims of Islam , namely Muslims understand the truth and come out of this evil ideology to lead a peaseful life .
READ QURON WITH AN OPENMIND .
That will solve the problem .
Peace be upon them !

Holy Muslims think they are too smart , so they do n't believe in law of Karma , " What ’s goes around , comes around " .
Earth is round and Snake of Islam have completed the full cycle .
Finally when it reaches to destroy the people , who are holding its tail from opposite end :
They do nothing much , they just put his tail in its mouth and vanish , now more Muslims tries to spread Islam , more they will kill it by themselves .
With Internet age people got access to better thoughts and views and they can compare by themselves what Islam stands for .
As holy Muslims have said , " they only love Koran in this world and nothing else " , so soon people tired with their rants , will start to steal and destroy Koran in order to piss them off .
If they attack or scare people in a heavily Muslim area , for stealing and destroying the Koran , they will lose further support for them .
If stealing and destruction of Koran happens in many places , then these religious zealots will keep on running from place to place in order to defend the Koran and try to find the traitors and soon there Jihad will go in defensive mode , finally killing itself off .
So if people have concluded 100 % that Koran is a hate book then throw it away in a gutter and make holy Muslims burn themselves in hate and anger .

Islam and the Quran have answered every question with most eloquent .
There are logical answers to everything in the Quran and the Hadeeth .
Maybe you ought to come out and ask the questions you think Islam have not answered and let those Muslims answer you .
If they can not then you made your point .

People hiding behind websites are less coward then people hiding behind women and children and intentionally getting them killed or kill them , in order to get some sympathy for a demon called Allah .
Hey why your crap Allah cannot stop infidels from taking birth and needs pigs like you to stop the infidels .
If you talk about who can take birth , infidels are better than your Allah they have developed contraceptives and thus can control who can take birth .
So start worshiping the infidels , or we will give you a contraceptive treatment and control Muslim population .

Trying to prove that islam is the ' truth ' by showing how much science is in the koran just makes you look even more stupid .
Science has discovered a million more things than that which may be in the koran , but why do muslims need allah to tell them all these things in the koran , and everyone else can figure it out for themselves ?
why do muslims need god to tell them how to treat their women , when other women can get these rights off their own back ?
these things only make islam look even more stupid !
and also , what has islam done with all this science which is in the koran ?
nothing , and has just become more and more backwards as time has gone along .
science brings people and society forward , but the koran just takes people backwards , as has happened in every single muslim community on the planet .

Once a Moslem used his logic , pretty sure he will begin asking the truth about Islam .
After he find it , he will leave Islam as well .
Conclusion ?
Islam is polished in many ways .
It is a polished religion , ha ha ha .....

it 's always kind of a shocker when a devout one figures out that there is no god .
i imagine it would hurt very deeply , the loss of purpose and all .
i wish greatly there was a heaven , where my dead parents and pets would go , and i could meet them later .
but ... now is all that there is .
this is it .
oblivian is just like the time before you were born , except the last few steps getting there may be quite sucky .
once one grasps the value of life , they do n;t waste it on worship .. of anything .
muslim , xtians , commies , nazies , maoists .. all worshipers , and all doers of not very nice things .
worship is bad in most any form , and always a waste .

You are so right !
There is no science at all in the quran and even if there any , there would be no merit .
It is too cheap to claim to have a holy book written by god with all knowledge .
Knowledge does not mean to say that there are black holes ; we need scientists who know what black hole really are and how to describe them .
In other words : we need to show the evidence behind all the phenomenoms around us and the way how we can make use of it .
Thus , science is not a gift from god by holy revealation .
Science is something we have to work for !
This is what muslims don´t like to understand !
They believe that they have got anything for free .
They are so lazy !

Muslims are suddenly discovering the scientific verses in the Quran .
New interpretations are being given to the verses to show that islam is compatible with science .
The earth has become round all of a sudden , and is revolving around the sun .
Muslims are working overtime to explain the big bang theory and evolution .
Microchips and computers will come next -- all predicted and explained in the quran .
I came across a brilliant essay by Sujit Das in Islam Watch .
It is titled A Tribute To A Muslim Genius .
If you have not read it , please do so .
It is a must read .

As i was reading about the scientific evidence in the koran concerning the embryo , i remembered an experience my french brother in law had in algeria .
He was about 10 at the time , he is now 56 , he saw his parents being murdered by muslims in his appartment block and also saw a pregnant women get killed and the muslims cut her stomach open and with knife pinned the foetus on the wall .
Sorry to give such a disturbing story to you , but could it be that mohummad and his merry men did similar and it was plain old observation , not divine information from allah ?

9/11 is on its way " , " Execute those who insult islam " , " Be Prepared for the real holocost " , " 9/11 was only a warning .
" 3 ) Putting human crap in people 's food - even a little girl 's birthday cake .
4 ) Mullahs around the world ( even across US and Britain ) are calling for the " destruction of the infidel .
" 5 ) A muslim cleric defends the gang - rapes of non-muslim women by muslim men in Sweden and Norway saying it 's " the fault of the women for not wearing the burka .
" 6 )
In all muslim lands churches are destroyed , Christian fathers are killed and Christian daughters are kidnapped .
7 ) Attacks even in the Philippines and South America by islamists .
8 ) Over 10,000 terrorist attacks since 9/11 by muslims .
AND THEY STILL HAVE THE AUDACITY TO SAY THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE BEING VICTIMIZED ?

1 ) There are no concentration camps in the " occupied territory .

3 ) Israel has given up a lot of land and still they are attacked by suicide bombers .
4 ) Al- qeida is doing most of the killing to fellow muslims in Iraq .
5 ) Not only did al - qeida take responsibility for the 9/11 attacks ( which , millions of muslims rejoiced all over the world ) they produce a video each year on the anniversary of 9/11 telling of their current agenda : this year it is to increase attacks in Afganistan - a muslim country .
6 ) Israel is not out to dominate the world - that is a ploy to try in vain to draw up sympathy .
They are a tiny country about the size of California just trying to survive .
7 ) Islamic websites propagate islamic terrorism .
8 ) Curfews in Paletine do not justify the 10,000 plus acts of violence around the world since 9/11 .
9 ) Islamists HAVE attacked places in South America and Philippines which have nothing to do with palestinian refugees .
10 ) Attacks in Afganistan proposed by the Taliban to mostly fellow muslims is NOT self - defense .
11 ) The attack today on the hotel in Pakistan killing mostly muslims cannot be labeled " self - defence . "
12 ) If anyone is trying to " rule the world " it is the islamists !
13 ) " Honor killings " , putting crap in food have nothing to do with serving palestinian refugees .
14 ) Israel became a nation in 1948 : you can't tell us that these " refugees " you speak of have been refugees since 1948 .
15 ) Also , refugees in Iraq have flooded into other countries such as Sweden , Norway and the US .

Ladies and Gentlemen , I present to you Osama Bin Ladin 's third lieutenant Mr.Mumin Salih .
What ?
How can this guy be supporting terrorism when he is clearly opposing Islam ?
It is clear that this article demonstrates and obvious intolerant xenophobic perspective of Islam .
It lists so many problems with the Quran and the Islamic faith .
Yet this article obfuscates multiple facts to achieve its perspective of downing and decorating the belief system of 1 billion plus people of the world 's population .
Not a single statement from the Quran and it's counter proof .
All personal accounts of of a very bitter individual .
Mixing Saudi culture with Islamic principles .
I have lived in that country .
The author has conveniently failed to mention was the state of the kingdom before Islam .
Banu Qurayza back stabbed by opening the rear flank of Madinah that was entrusted to them .
The Muslims of the time declared war on them .
This were traitors that happened to be Jews .
As a Muslim I accept and welcome any constructive criticism of my faith .
However , that which I will not allow is it to be a battle ground of fundamentalist ideologies .
On one side war leaning extremists the likes of bin Ladin and on the other side anti-Muslims that search for any excuse to incite hate .
I will also not accept this nonsensical notion of a civilization clash to set the tone of relations between Islam and the rest of the world .
This idea was presented by proponents of capitalist ideologies to preserve a unity that had long been diminishing after the collapse of communism .
Do n't forget that it was the Golden Age of Islam that laid the foundations for the scientific revolution .
Providing the world a scientific basis and a frame work to reconcile religion and science in the form of theology .
I admit that since then the Islamic world has fallen into a progressive slumber .
That is our problem to fix .
If you want to help then open constructive dialog .
If you want to take the approach of hostility , then there are extremists we would like to get rid off .
Please feel free to have a go at them .
The writer of this article is an ex-Muslim extremist and a xenophobe .

There are a number of " sacred hadiths " that tell us the world is flat .
As for " extremists " the leader of Kuwait said there are no extremists .
Muslim leaders will say what they know we want to hear and then incite bloodshed against the " infidel " when they get back to their countries .
Mullahs all across the West are inciting their followers to " holy war " against the " infidels . "
To print a cartoon in Denmark against Mohammed millions of muslims called for his head so unfortunately , Denmark backed down .
Every time a quranic passage incites hatred there oftentimes is a " special circumstance " inserted into it .
If you are to do that then you have to do that with all quranic passages that say something that is embarrasing .
84,000 Canadian muslims alone believe in suicide bombings .
Look at any muslim " peace protest " and you will see banners saying things such as , " Europe you will pay .
9/11 is on its way .
ALSO , ISLAMIC WEBSITES ARE A CATALYST FOR ISLAMIC ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROMOTE THE DEATH OF THE " INFIDELS . "
I am thankful for a few websites like this one which dares to tell the truth about mohammed the pedophile .
In muslim countries these people would be dead by now !

Islam does not accept the existence of anybody else , its exclusively declared by Allah / Mohammad and declared everyday by Imams through loudspeakers in Mosques .
So its clear to everybody else that Muslims are coexisting until they get an upper hand , does n't matter whatever they claim there intentions are , there Allah himself have preached them to deceive everybody .

Oil will always last as the Zionist will never allow alternate fuel .
Although Arab countrys have oil , the Zionist are citizens all over the world they monopolise all the oil .
Why did you think oil rose up tp $ 135 and now selling at around $ 88 .
The zionist are the cause of the Financila crisis and are the cause of WW ! and WW2 .

By the way why dont you allow us to use Nuclear power ?

It is the Koran that corrupted the Biblical stories !!!
The Bible was written by 40 different authors in different times in a span of 15 centuries .
Yet it delivers a unifying message : God 's love .
While the Koran was written in a span of 22 years coming from a man named Mohammad who was a pedophile , rapist , mass murderer , plunderer , butcher .
It 's unifying message is murder , rape and pillage !!!
It is you Muslims that will face HELLFIRE for following false prophet and anti-Christ !!!

How does the bible treat people who are pedophile , rapist , mass murderer and butchers etc ...?
Does the bible welcome them with open arms and if they refuse to repent still let the world be ruled by these devils ?
If you are attacked , dont you have the right to defend your self and kill the offenders ?
What does the bible say about George bush and Tony Blair who responcible for the Mess in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Were the muslims responcible for Telling the romans that Jesus who was a Just Prophet , to be killed because he preached what his creator wanted him to .

It was your prophet muhamed who was a thief ( he robbed meccan caravans ) , murderer ( he murdered all his rivals ) , and enslaver , and child rapist .
( he married a 6 year old child ) .
You muslims have been doing that for more than a thousand years .
The US will not grab iraq and force them to convert to christianity by the sword as you muslims have done for centuries .
They will leave Iraq soon after the government is stable .
Afghanistan will never be allowed to become a haven for terrorist again .
It is a good thing that the US has taken over afghanistan and is helping it to become a good member of the international community .
Muslim countries should never be allowed to use nuclear technolgy or become good at it because you will use it to murder non muslims as it has been taught in the quran .
One does not give a knife or gun to a murderer .
One keeps such things away from murderers .
To make a nuclear bomb is very easy after learning how to generate nuclear power .
So no muslim country should be allowed to use nuclear power of their own .
The world will regret that Pakistan has a nuclear weapon .
I predict that a nuclear weapon from pakistan will be used by muslim fundamentalists in europe or the US .
By the way why dont you allow us to use Nuclear power ?
If the world are ruled by countries just rulers without the criminal like Zionist and freethinkers , the world would have been better off .

When you are aware that there is a god who created you and who created the worlds including Heaven and Hell , do you think Muslims should open places of worship to worship false gods or to worship the The god of the worlds ?
Try use your brain , the muslims want you to worship the Creator not creations .
The choice is yours you decide , but the muslims will never force you unlike the zionist .
They worship power and wain glory stuff !

Regardless of what Harun Yahya says I know what the quran says .
It asks muslims to murder and use violence against non muslims to convert them to islam .
Here is the proof .
Sura ( 9:5 ) - " So when the sacred months have passed away , then slay the idolaters wherever you find them , and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush , then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor - rate , leave their way free to them . "
Sura ( 8:12 ) - " I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve .
Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them " Bukhari ( 8:387 ) - Allah 's Apostle said , " I have been ordered to fight the people till they say : ' None has the right to be worshipped but Allah .
Bukhari ( 52:220 ) - Allah 's Apostle said ... ' I have been made victorious with terror '

Now i understand many many of my own doubts
The tools to create life , once largely proprietary , are now the domain of every Tom , Dick , And Harry .
We do n’t have the full product , so our palette was wide but not nearly infinite .
Leveraging the true mechanism , one can generate a ( among other things ) a thoroughly terrifying Deep Crow .
It ’s a cool toy , and we endorse it .
If you really want to see the joy such a tool can produce , though - joy in abundance - you should try the Spore Creature Creator with your child .
I recognize that setting up this scenario may be time consuming : courtship , gestation , and whatnot .
But Will Wright is , among other things , a dad - and when Gabriel the Younger was in the office for lunch yesterday , I got the unmistakable sense that we were experiencing something very near the product ’s intended purpose .
I ’ve finally discovered the appeal of Metal Gear Solid 4 , which it does everything it can to obscure for many hours .
There are times when it moves directly from cutscene into player control that are frankly unprecedented .
When you start pushing through radical shifts in gameplay and aesthetics , and you ca n’t tell if one informed the other or if a single lozenge of design , story , and context leapt like Athena from a man ’s mind , you can find it in yourself to be impressed .
MGS4 is alternately the salvation of the Playstation 3 , an argument for games as art , or the culmination of a storied franchise .
Maybe it succeeds at these epic things to varying degrees , but as a piece of entertainment software it has significant problems - and these problems do n’t evaporate because the product acquits itself well elsewhere .
I actually like the story of Metal Gear , but it ’s not told well .
I do n’t care if a cutscene is long provided that it ’s well paced , but these cutscenes are n’t simply long , they ’re eternal - and they feel even longer than they are because they ’re pure overreach .
The script is insipid , didactic , and its insights are trite .
The humor does n’t work , period , and it works even less against the backdrop of perpetual war .
I ’m the story guy around here .
I make up a story if a game does n’t have one .
Here , I was so starved to express any kind of volition whatsoever during these interminable slideshows that eventually I discovered a way .
I only started to enjoy Metal Gear Solid once I began skipping the cutscenes .
On the whole , I think we ’re probably done talking about Metal Gear .
It ’s clear by now that the community dialogue is mostly metatextual , having nothing to do with the game as delivered .
The product is little more than icon at this point , a vessel for people ’s fond wishes , and there ’s no profit in discussing it .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- New York City 's rate of HIV infection is about three times the national rate , according to estimates released Wednesday by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene .
Rapid HIV test swabs incubate at the Iris House in New York in 2007 .
The agency estimates that 72 of every 100,000 New Yorkers -- a total of 4,800 individuals -- contracted HIV in 2006 , more than triple the national rate of 23 per 100,000 .
The findings are based on new lab technology and a newly derived statistical model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The lab technology enables health officials to determine whether HIV - positive individuals contracted the virus within the past five months , and the statistical model allows researchers to then make projections about a population 's infection rate .
HIV , or the human immunodeficiency virus , is the virus that causes AIDS .
The Health Department points to the city 's demographics .
" The populations that bear the greatest burden nationally -- blacks , for example , and men who have sex with men -- are highly represented in New York City , " Health Commissioner Thomas Freidan said in a written statement .
" Because HIV is more prevalent within those groups , the risk of HIV infection per sexual contact is higher . "
In June , the city launched a three - year initiative to administer HIV tests to the 250,000 Bronx adults who have never been tested .
The program was announced just days after release of a study finding a high rate of " unsafe sexual behavior " in the city .
Freidan said the study showed that 36 percent of gay and bisexual New York men who had five or more partners in the previous year did not use condoms consistently .
" This is a core group which is at high risk for getting and spreading HIV , " Freidan said .
In July , a study of 452 men interviewed anonymously at gay bars and clubs found 39 percent of those having sex with other men had not revealed their sexual orientation to their doctors , significantly diminishing their likelihood of being tested for HIV .

The Politics of Extinction
Remain a parasite OR become an Earth Warrior .
By Captain Paul Watson
We are at the present time living in an age of mass extinction .
Each year , more than 20,000 unique species disappear from this planet forever .
This represents more that two species per hour .
Species extinction is the fuel that supports the ever increasing progress of the machinery of civilization .
Individual humans are for the most part insulated from the reality of species loss .
Alienated from the natural world , guided by anthropocentric attitudes , the average human being is unaware and non-caring about the biological holocaust that is transpiring each and every day .
The facts are clear .
More plant and animal species will go through extinction within our generation than have been lost thorough natural causes over the past two hundred million years .
Our single human generation , that is , all people born between 1930 and 2010 will witness the complete obliteration of one third to one half of all the Earth 's life forms , each and every one of them the product of more than two billion years of evolution .
This is biological meltdown , and what this really means is the end to vertebrate evolution on planet Earth .
Nature is under siege on a global scale .
Biotopes , i.e. , environmentally distinct regions , from tropical and temperate rainforests to coral reefs and coastal estuaries , are disintegrating in the wake of human onslaught .
The destruction of forests and the proliferation of human activity will remove more than 20 percent of all terrestrial plant species over the next fifty years .
Because plants form the foundation for entire biotic communities , their demise will carry with it the extinction of an exponentially greater number of animal species -- perhaps ten times as many faunal species for each type of plant eliminated .
Sixty - five million years ago , a natural cataclysmic event resulted in extinction of the dinosaurs .
Even with a plant foundation intact , it took more than 100,000 years for faunal biological diversity to re-establish itself .
More importantly , the resurrection of biological diversity assumes an intact zone of tropical forests to provide for new speciation after extinction .
Today , the tropical rain forests are disappearing more rapidly than any other bio-region , ensuring that after the age of humans , the Earth will remain a biological , if not a literal desert for eons to come .
The present course of civilization points to ecocide -- the death of nature .
Like a run-a - way train , civilization is speeding along tracks of our own manufacture towards the stone wall of extinction .
The human passengers sitting comfortably in their seats , laughing , partying , and choosing to not look out the window .
Environmentalists are those perceptive few who have their faces pressed against the glass , watching the hurling bodies of plants and animals go screaming by .
Environmental activists are those even fewer people who are trying desperately to break into the fortified engine of greed that propels this destructive specicidal juggernaut .
Others are desperately throwing out anchors in an attempt to slow the monster down while all the while , the authorities , blind to their own impending destruction , are clubbing , shooting and jailing those who would save us all .
SHORT MEMORIES
Civilized humans have for ten thousand years been marching across the face of the Earth leaving deserts in their footprints .
Because we have such short memories , we forgot the wonder and splendor of a virgin nature .
We revise history and make it fit into our present perceptions .
For instance , are you aware that only two thousand years ago , the coast of North Africa was a mighty forest ?
The Phoenicians and the Carthaginians built powerful ships from the strong timbers of the region .
Rome was a major exporter of timber to Europe .
The temple of Jerusalem was built with titanic cedar logs , one image of which adorns the flag of Lebanon today .
Jesus Christ did not live in a desert , he was a man of the forest .
The Sumerians were renowned for clearing the forests of Mesopotamia for agriculture .
But the destruction of the coastal swath of the North African forest stopped the rain from advancing into the interior .
Without the rain , the trees died and thus was born the mighty Sahara , sired by man and continued to grow southward at a rate of ten miles per year , advancing down the length of the continent of Africa .
And so will go Brazil .
The precipitation off the Atlantic strikes the coastal rain forest and is absorbed and sent skyward again by the trees , falling further into the interior .
Twelve times the moisture falls and twelve times it is returned to the sky -- all the way to the Andes mountains .
Destroy the coastal swath and desertify Amazonia -- it is as simple as that .
Create a swath anywhere between the coast and the mountains and the rains will be stopped .
We did it before while relatively primitive .
We learned nothing .
We forgot .
So too , have we forgotten that walrus once mated and bred along the coast of Nova Scotia , that sixty million bison once roamed the North American plains .
One hundred years ago , the white bear once roamed the forests of New England and the Canadian Maritime provinces .
Now it is called the polar bear because that is where it now makes its last stand .
EXTINCTION IS DIFFICULT TO APPRECIATE
Gone forever are the European elephant , lion and tiger .
The Labrador duck , giant auk , Carolina parakeet will never again grace this planet of ours .
Lost for all time are the Atlantic grey whales , the Biscayan right whales and the Stellar sea cow .
Our children will never look upon the California condor in the wild or watch the Palos Verde blue butterfly dart from flower to flower .
Extinction is a difficult concept to fully appreciate .
What has been is no more and never shall be again .
It would take another creation and billions of years to recreate the passenger pigeon .
It is the loss of billions of years of evolutionary programming .
It is the destruction of beauty , the obliteration of truth , the removal of uniqueness , the scarring of the sacred web of life
To be responsible for an extinction is to commit blasphemy against the divine .
It is the greatest of all possible crimes , more evil than murder , more appalling than genocide , more monstrous than even the apparent unlimited perversities of the human mind .
To be responsible for the complete and utter destruction of a unique and sacred life form is arrogance that seethes with evil , for the very opposite of evil is live .
It is no accident that these two words spell out each other in reverse .
And yet , a reporter in California recently told me that " all the redwoods in California are not worth the life on one human being . "
What incredible arrogance .
The rights a species , any species , must take precedence over the life of an individual or another species .
This is a basic ecological law .
It is not to be tampered with by primates who have molded themselves into divine legends in their own mind .
For each and every one of the thirty million plus species that grace this beautiful planet are essential for the continued well - being of which we are all a part , the planet Earth -- the divine entity which brought us forth from the fertility of her sacred womb .
As a sea -captain I like to compare the structural integrity of the biosphere to that of a ship 's hull .
Each species is a rivet that keeps the hull intact .
If I were to go into my engine room and find my engineers busily popping rivets from the hull , I would be upset and naturally I would ask them what they were doing .
If they told me that they discovered that they could make a dollar each from the rivets , I could do one of three things .
I could ignore them .
I could ask them to cut me in for a share of the profits , or I could kick their asses out of the engine room and off my ship .
If I was a responsible captain , I would do the latter .
If I did not , I would soon find the ocean pouring through the holes left by the stolen rivets and very shortly after , my ship , my crew and myself would disappear beneath the waves .
And that is the state of the world today .
The political leaders , i.e. , the captains at the helms of their nation states , are ignoring the rivet poppers or they are cutting themselves in for the profits .
There are very few asses being kicked out of the engine room of spaceship Earth .
With the rivet poppers in command , it will not be long until the biospheric integrity of the Earth collapses under the weight of ecological strain and tides of death come pouring in .
And that will be the price of progress -- ecological collapse , the death of nature , and with it the horrendous and mind numbing specter of massive human destruction .
And where does that leave us , dear reader ?
Do you intend to remain in your seat , oblivious to the impending destruction ?
Have you got you face pressed up against the window , watching the grim reapings of progress ?
Or are you engaged in throwing out anchors , sacrificing the materialistic pleasures of civilization and risking your all , that your planet and your children may live ?
The choice is unique to this generation .
Future generations will not have the chance and those that came before us did not have the vision nor theknowledge .
It is up to us -- you and I .
Remain a parasite OR become an Earth Warrior .
Serve your Mother and prosper OR serve civilization and besmear yourself with the filth and guilt of ecocide .

The " New " New Deal
I am having a hard time keeping up with all of the bailouts and special facilities created for dealing with this crisis .
Am I missing any ?
- Bear Stearns
- Economic Stimulus progam
- Housing Bailout Program
- Fannie & Freddie
- AIG
- No Short selling rules
- Fed liquidity programs ( Term Lending facility , Term Auction facility )
- Money Market fund insurance program
- Special Loans for GM & Ford
- New RTC type program
If you are a fan of irony , consider this :
The conservative movement has utterly hated FDR , and his New Deal programs like Medicaid , Social Security , FDIC , Fannie Mae ( 1938 ) , and the SEC for nearly 80 years .
And for the past 8 years , a conservative was in the White House , with a very conservative agenda .
For something like 16 of the past 18 years , the conservative dominated GOP has controlled Congress .
Those are the facts .
We now see that the grand experiment of deregulation has ended , and ended badly .
The deregulation movement is now an historical footnote , just another interest group , and once in power they turned into socialists .
Indeed , judging by the actions of the conservatives in power , and not the empty rhetoric that comes out of think tanks , the conservative movement has effectively turned the United States into a massive Socialist state , an appendage of Communist Russia , China and Venezuela .
To paraphrase Floyd Norris , we have become Marxists , but of the Groucho , not Karl , variety . . .

Not to worry , cognitive dissonance among the conservative crowd will find a way to blame all of this on Clinton .
Posted by : Nobody | Sep 19 , 2008 10:07:52 AM
WASHINGTON  Senior officials from the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve on Friday called in top executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the mortgage finance giants , and told them that the government was preparing to place the two companies under federal control , officials and company executives briefed on the discussions said .
The plan , which would place the companies into a conservatorship , was outlined in separate meetings with the chief executives at the office of the companies ’ new regulator .
The executives were told that , under the plan , they and their boards would be replaced and shareholders would be virtually wiped out , but that the companies would be able to continue functioning with the government generally standing behind their debt , people briefed on the discussions said .
It is not possible to calculate the cost of any government bailout , but the huge potential liabilities of the companies could cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars and make any rescue among the largest in the nation ’s history .
The drastic effort follows the bailout this year of Bear Stearns , the investment bank , as government officials continue to grapple with how to stem the credit crisis and housing crisis that have hobbled the economy .
With Bear Stearns , the government provided guarantees , and the bulk of its assets were transferred to JPMorgan Chase , leaving shareholders with a nominal amount .

According to the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) , methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , colloquially known as MRSA or  the superbug ,  is now responsible for more annual US deaths than AIDS .
Yet despite this sobering statistic , its unlikely that either JAMA or anyone in the mainstream US media will report on the findings of a forthcoming Italian study — you didnt actually think I was going to say that this took place in America did you ?
— demonstrating that compounds in cannabis possess exceptional antibacterial activity  against multi-drug resistant pathogens , including MRSA .
 Although the use of cannabinoids as systemic antibacterial agents awaits rigorous clinical trials , their topical application to reduce skin colonization by MRSA seems promising ,  the studys authors write .
 Cannabis sativa represents an interesting source of antibacterial agents to address the problem of multidrug resistance in MRSA and other pathogenic bacteria . 
( You can read the full text ahead of publication here . )
Ironically , the study notes that preparations from cannabis were investigated extensively in the 1950s as highly active topical antiseptic agents . 
Predictably — in yet another victory  for prohibition — authors declare that little , if any , research into this potential clinical application has taken place since .
Several years ago , when I first began writing the booklet Emerging Clinical Applications for Cannabis and Cannabinoids , I mused about what sort of advancements in the treatment of disease may have been achieved over the past 70 + years had U.S. government chosen to advance — rather than stifle — clinical research into the therapeutic effects of cannabis .
Now , more than ever , this is a question that our elected officials must be forced to answer .

Comedian Ron White Busted for Drugs
Blue Collar Comedy
Tour comedianhas once again found himself in a little bit of trouble .
The funny man was arrested yesterday in Vergo Beach , FL for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia .
White was released from the slammer after posting $ 1,000 bail .
The amount of pot that he had on him was less than 20 grams so it is likely that he will pay a fine and get a slap on the hand .
It just so happens that I was at Ron 's show at Treasure Island Resort and Casino in Red Wing , Minnesota on September 5th .
Granted he was funny and put on a good show , but his real show was after he got off the stage .
White cruised the casino all night on a scooter stopping for photos with his fans .
Running into an occasional wall while female fans hopped on the scooter for a little ride .

Salsa dancing , moonlit walks , fireside chats and human leukocyte antigen : Welcome to the genetically romantic age .
Swiss startup company GenePartner is offering to evaluate singles and couples according to the potential union of their HLA genes , which help regulate immune response .
People may naturally be attracted to mates with HLA profiles different from their own , ostensibly guaranteeing the hybrid vigor of their offspring 's immune systems – and also providing a spark that will last through good times and bad .
" Proper age , similar life goals and ideas , education levels – all of these things have to fit .
And on top of that , you need to be biologically compatible , " said Tamara Brown , managing director of GenePartner .
But not everyone is convinced that scientists can read the genome of love .
" These kinds of ideas are not as crazy as they often sound , but before you start trying to sell this kind of thing , we 'd like to have solid evidence , " said Dustin Penn , a behavioral biologist at the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Ethology .
" There 's some supporting evidence , but it 's mixed . "
The science of HLA love started with Swiss biologist Claus Wedekind , who in 1995 found that women preferred the smell of T - shirts worn by men with HLA profiles dissimilar to their own .
The findings were replicated , and a later study showed that couples with similar profiles were less likely to have children and more likely to cheat on each other .
GenePartner claims to have pushed that research forward .
" Is there a specific pattern ?
That 's what we found .
That 's the main strength of the algorithm , " Brown said .
Singles who take the test receive a rating that can be integrated with online dating profiles , while couples can test their long - term compatibility – even more important , said Brown , in light of research on the interference of birth control pills with natural HLA preference .
Penn did n't comment on GenePartner 's research , which has yet to be published .
" I 'd be interested to see what their claims are , " he said .
" The idea that HLA plays a role in attraction , the jury is still out . "
Asked about the earlier studies , Penn said , " This is a problem of science : You get selective citations . "
Studies that do n't support earlier findings tend to be overlooked , and do n't appear in prominent journals or atop database rankings .
" There 's a handful of positive studies , but there 's a lot of negative , " he said .
Of scientific doubts and Gattaca - inspired fears , Brown replied , " They can make use of it now , or they can wait until it gets established .
They just have to keep in mind it might mean they 'll have to wait longer until they 've found the person to share their life with . "
Brown herself was married before the algorithm was finalized .
" Of course I did the test , and it came out good .
As we expected it would , " she said .

Once a sleepy smelter town on the Mexico border , Douglas is one of several cities in southern Arizona that are being transformed into urban battlefields as warring street gangs muscle in from southern California , police say .
A sun-baked backwater of broad streets and bungalows set in vast , high desert ranchland , Douglas is now a patchwork of territories held by the East Side Torrance and the South Side Harbor City , both Los Angeles - area street gangs , as well as lesser home - grown gangs .
A few miles up the road in nearby Sierra Vista , a boomtown in the shadow of the looming Huachuca Mountains , police say various factions of the Crips , also from Los Angeles , are warring for control of new streets , malls and subdivisions with the Bloodlines , a local gang .
The newcomers , many tattooed and wearing colors , are part of a scramble by street gangs to make money from tons of illegal drugs pouring over the border to Arizona from Mexico each month , along with tens of thousands of fee - paying illegal immigrants .
“ For the gangs , it ’s always about the money , ” said Detective Tony Morales of the Arizona Department of Public Safety ’s State Gang Task Force , whose members patrol the streets of Douglas , population 17,000 , in flak jackets .
“ Who has money ?
The people that move drugs have money , and the people that move illegal aliens have the money , and they end up in our corridor here . ”
SMUGGLING PROFITS
Smuggling is big business in southern Arizona , where last year the Border Patrol seized 440 tons of marijuana in a furiously trafficked corridor south of Tucson and arrested more than 370,000 illegal immigrants .
Police say the gangs , which offer easy money and a sense of belonging to youngsters , are recruiting teens and sometimes children as young as eight , as foot soldiers in the trade worth billions of dollars a year .
Gang members steal vehicles stateside and drive to Mexico where they collect marijuana loads and groups of fee- paying illegal immigrants from Mexican smugglers , as well as consignments of prescription drugs .
Crossing back north over remote stretches of the desert border , they spirit their loads up to the Interstate 10 freeway and on to Tucson , Phoenix and the gang wracked sprawl of southern California several hours drive to the west .
In fast growing Sierra Vista , population 42,000 , police say the gangs are also carving up the city ’s neighborhoods among themselves , and peddling drugs including crack cocaine and methamphetamine to the new residents .
The gangs there include the Maryvale Crips -- a Phoenix affiliate of the notorious Los Angeles street gang -- and the so - called 520 Crips , who take their name from the area code for Tucson and southern Arizona .
“ The amount of money being made is unlimited , ” said Arturo Acosta , a Border Patrol agent assigned to a multi-agency gang taskforce that has been meeting since January to tackle the problem .
“ Right now there is no end in sight , they ’ll just keep on coming . ”
DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS
The gangsters ’ arrival has been accompanied by increasingly brazen shootings and aggravated assaults as the proliferating street gangs scrabble for territory .
In Sierra Vista , it began with a drive by attack on a home last year , and spiraled to a spate of revenge shootings , resulting in one death and several woundings .
as the violence gathered pace .
“ It ’s getting worse , it ’s getting more public .
It ’s not one - on - one anymore ... it ’s more in your face , ” said Lori Burdick , a detective with the Cochise County Sheriff ’s Office , who tracks the gangs .
To add to the misery , police say more California gangsters are pouring into the corridor each month , many fleeing the “ three strike ” law that puts repeat offenders behind bars for life on a third conviction .
Police have spotted members of the Fresno Bulldogs , from Fresno , California , in Sierra Vista , and affiliates of the Mara Salvatrucha , a Salvadoran gang originally out of Los Angeles , in Elfrida , a remote farming town nearby .
Then two weeks ago , graffiti for the Rollin 30 ’s Crips , a gang from South Central Los Angeles , tagged a cinder - block wall in the city .
For worried city authorities in the corner of Arizona better known for its county fairs and rodeos , the spiraling problem marks a shocking loss of innocence .
“ When I was young , the worst trouble we ever got into was for serenading our girlfriends late at night , ” said Douglas mayor Michael Gomez , a retired dentist who took office last month .
The Recording Industry Association of America is declaring attorney - blogger Ray Beckerman a " vexatious " litigator .
The association is seeking unspecified monetary sanctions to punish him in his defense of a New York woman accused of making copyrighted music available on the Kazaa file sharing system .
The RIAA said Beckerman , one of the nation 's few attorneys who defends accused file sharers , " has maintained an anti-recording industry blog during the course of this case and has consistently posted virtually every one of his baseless motions on his blog seeking to bolster his public relations campaign and embarrass plaintiffs , " the RIAA wrote ( . pdf ) in court briefs .
" Such vexatious conduct demeans the integrity of these judicial proceedings and warrants this imposition of sanctions . "
Lory Lybeck , a Washington state defense attorney leading a proposed class - action lawsuit accusing the RIAA of allegedly engaging in " sham " litigation tactics , said the RIAA 's motion comes from the same organization that has sued about 30,000 people over the last five years for file sharing , some of them falsely .
It 's the same organization , he said , that has sued dead people , the elderly and even children – all while using unlicensed investigators .
" This is like irony and irony and irony , " Lybeck said in a telephone interview .
" That 's what vexatious litigation is . "
Beckerman , whose blog is Recording Industry vs The People , said in an interview the allegations were " frivolous and irresponsible . "
Attorney Ray Beckerman denies RIAA charges that he 's a " vexatious " litigator .
Lybeck represented an Oregon woman , Tanya Andersen , and got the case dismissed last year .
The RIAA fought paying his legal fees because it claimed she was still an infringer .
He countersued .
The case seeks to represent what he says are " thousands of people falsely sued " by the RIAA .
The case is pending .
" Irony is too tame of a word to describe the motion against Ray , " Lybeck said .
" Their whole 30,000 - lawsuit scheme is founded on the purpose to run a PR campaign based on a fundamental starting place of an illegal investigation by unlicensed investigators and then a threatening letter , " Lybeck said .
" Ray is duty bound and ethically bound to zealously defend his client . "
In federal court documents filed in the Eastern District of New York , the RIAA accused Beckerman , in defending a 2004 case against a New York woman , " for providing false and misleading information and for unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying and prolonging this litigation . "
The RIAA is also seeking sanctions against the defendant , Marie Lindor , because it accuses her of destroying evidence to prevent it from proving the allegations .
" Here , sanctions are appropriate because defendant , her family , and her counsel engaged in a deliberate pattern of misconduct by providing false , misleading , and incomplete information as to the status of defendant ’s Internet service in August 2004 , who resided in defendant ’s home during that time , the identity and location of witnesses with information about the case , and the existence and owner of the computer connected to defendant ’s Internet account at the time of infringement .
… Defendant ’s misrepresentations caused plaintiffs and the court to waste substantial resources chasing empty leads and ultimately led to the destruction of critical evidence in this case .
The actions of defendant and her counsel have caused Plaintiffs to engage in additional discovery at great time and expense , prolonged this litigation unnecessarily , and resulted in the destruction of critical computer evidence severely and irreparably prejudicing plaintiffs ’ ability to prove their case . "
Readers should note the cover sheet ( .pdf ) of the court filing lists Richard Gabriel as the RIAA 's lead counsel .
Gabriel was named a Colorado judge in May and no longer works on behalf of the RIAA .

The seal of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the Department of Homeland Security was wrong in using the online encyclopedia Wikipedia as a reference when deciding whether to allow asylum seekers to stay in the United States .
The department used the Wikipedia article named laissez - passer to decide whether the document was a valid form of identification .
This is despite the fact that the article had a large orange notice at the top of the article saying that " this article does not cite any references or sources . "

The Board of Immigration Appeals has stated that it does n't " encourage the use of resources such as Wikipedia.com [ sic ] in reaching pivotal decisions in immigration proceedings . "
They said that they allowed the decision to stand due to the fact that the information seemed accurate .
The appeals court noted when making the decision that Wikipedia admits that articles will stay inaccurate and unbalanced for long periods of time .
Below is the extract from the court documents that makes this point :
... The site acknowledges [ that articles ] , “ may become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint and can take some time – months perhaps – to regain a better - balanced consensus . ”

As a consequence , Wikipedia observes , the website ’s “ radical openness means that any given article may be , at any given moment , in a bad state : for example , it could be in the middle of a large edit or it could have been recently vandalized . ”

A new Russian law could make being an emo kid illegal in the eastern European country .
Legislation is currenting being formulated in Russia to heavily regulate emo websites and ban emo and goth dress style in schools and government buildings .
The new laws are apparently being driven by fears that these “ dangerous teen trends ” encourage depression and suicide .

The legislation was presented last month at a hearing held by the State Durma , where critics claimed that the “ negative ” emo culture encourages anti-social behaviour and glorifies suicide .
Emo kids were described as teenagers who wear black , have facial piercings and black hair with fringes that “ cover half the face ” , reports The Guardian
The weekend saw mass protests by Russian emo kids .
In Krasnoyarsk , Siberia , where laws are already being implemented , protestors in a march held signs saying “ A Totalitarian State Encourages Stupidity ” .
Dmitry Gilevich of Russian emo band MAIO stepped in backing the protests , saying : “ Expressing psychological emotions is not forbidden by law . ”
However , emo critics remain unconvinced .

Alexander Grishunin , an adviser to bill sponsor Yevgeny Yuryev , described a ban as necessary , stating : “ This is the first step in the public discourse . ”
The moves in Russia follow criticism of the genre in the UK earlier this year , which saw My Chemical Romance fans protesting at the offices of British newspaper The Daily Mail over their coverage which linked emo with suicide .

As we take stock of our economy , the outlook is dire .
Rather than the mortgage crisis being almost played - out , the long term effects are now being felt by some of America ’s most legendary and prestigious financial institutions .
The consensus from the White House seems to be slanted and we ’re protecting the huge bloc of high - profile investors and CEO ’s rather than the people - and loss is being transferred to the public sector , interesting when you understand that when these entities were highly profitable , none of their profits found their way into the public domain .
Now , we are to believe it is the taxpayer who should foot the bill of bad decisions and almost a total lack of Federal Oversight - which is the culprit for our current economic crisis , among several other of their ( Bush administration ) equally bad financial decisions throughout our economic landscape .
Alan Greenspan , pulling no punches , stated :
Greenspan : Economy in ‘ once- in-a- century ’ crisis
In an interview Sunday , the former Federal Reserve chairman said that more financial firms will fail and that housing wo n’t stabilize until 2009 .
September 14 , 2008 : 1:08 PM EDT WASHINGTON ( CNN ) —
The U.S. credit squeeze has brought on a “ once- in - a- century ” financial crisis that is likely to claim more big firms before it eases , former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan said Sunday .
Greenspan told ABC ’s “ This Week ” that the situation “ is in the process of outstripping anything I ’ve seen , and it still is not resolved and it still has a way to go . ”
“ Indeed , it will continue to be a corrosive force until the price of homes in the United States stabilizes , ” Greenspan said .
He predicted that would not happen until early 2009 , and said the odds of U.S. recession have gone up in recent months .
Much More
Whereas Alan Greenspan “ said the odds of U.S. recession have gone up in recent months . ”
I disagree and believe that we ’re firmly in a recession right now which could turn into a Depression - of a severity and duration that could equal or surpass that of the Great Depression that began with the stock market crash on October 29 , 1929 .
One of the differences I see between now and the Great Depression is that during the times the stock market crashed in 1929 , so did some of Wall Street ’s executives , right through their windows to the pavement below !
In today ’s crisis , those CEO ’s whom have fleeced America are gliding to comfort via their “ Golden Parachutes ” which in Bush ’s fascist state , those who have mislead and cost American consumers billions of dollars are rewarded for their behavior rather than being shunned and penalized for their performance that helped no one except themselves and the other super rich stockholders and executive management that helped to push through and implement transactions that were at times illegal and bordered on fraud and misrepresentation .
Consider this ; if Russia and China were seeking to dismantle an / or destroy the United States , it ’s doubtful they would have succeeded .
When Bush and Cheney stole the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections , they assumed control of a robust economy with a surplus of billions of dollars .
It has been greed , cronyism , and an unabashed failure of our current administration to halt and regulate the illegal and highly suspect practices that Wall Street has been engaged in these past seven - plus years that led to the financial collapse of the United States - almost all of which has been engineered by GOP operatives .
Bush and Cheney have looked the other way as the wealthy and connected have raped and plundered our economy with nothing more than a “ wink ” and a callous disregard for the average American who is suffering the most because of our financial insolvency .
Today , President Bush stated that :
“ he shared the American people ’s concerns about the economy and his administration was ready to act to prevent severe market disruptions .
Bush said recent actions by the government to take over the huge insurance company AIG on Tuesday as well as mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were necessary to prevent a “ severe disruption ” in financial markets .
“ These actions are necessary and important , and the markets are adjusting to them , ” Bush said .
Despite the government ’s takeover of AIG , the Dow Industrials fell 449 points Wednesday in its second worst session of the year .

As we watch our country ’s economy disintegrating right before our eyes - we are witnessing what a “ C Average ” President who has failed in almost all of his personal financial endeavors and a criminal Vice - President have methodically engineered - the collapse of our economy to transfer our wealth to the top one to five percent of the wealthiest of individuals and corporations .
Unfortunately , the financial bleeding is far from over as Michael Bloomberg forecast today :

Robert Samuelson in Newsweek :
The real lessons of the housing crisis have gotten lost .
It 's portrayed as the financial system run amok ; the housing market became a casino .
The remedy is to enact rules that prevent a repetition .
All this is partly true .
But it ignores a larger and more important truth : our infatuation with homeownership , embedded in dozens of government policies , has turned housing — once a justifiable symbol of the American Dream — into something of a National Nightmare .
As a society , we 're overinvesting in
real estate
.
We build ( and buy ) too many extra -large homes .
McMansions , if you will .
They use too much energy , and their carrying costs , including mortgage payments , absorb too much of Americans ' incomes , limiting the ability to save for retirement and other needs .
We think everyone should become a homeowner , when many families can't or should n't .
The result is to encourage lending to weak borrowers who are likely to default .
The avid pursuit of a few more percentage points on the homeownership rate ( it rose from 64 % of households in 1994 to 69 % in 2005 , see chart above ) has condoned enormously damaging policies .
SAN FRANCISCO  California , known for its far - ranging suburbs and jam - packed traffic , is close to adopting a law intended to slow the increase in emissions of heat - trapping gases by encouraging housing close to job sites , rail lines and bus stops to shorten the time people spend in their cars .
The measure , which the State Assembly passed on Monday and awaits final approval by the Senate , would be the nation ’s most comprehensive effort to reduce sprawl .
It would loosely tie tens of billions of dollars in state and federal transportation subsidies to cities ’ and counties ’ compliance with efforts to slow the inexorable increase in driving .
The goal is to encourage housing near current development and to reduce commutes to work .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , has not said whether he will sign the bill .
The number of miles driven in California has increased at a rate 50 percent faster than the rate of population growth for the past two decades .
Passenger vehicles , which produce about 30 percent of the state ’s heat - trapping gases , are the single greatest source of such emissions .
The fragile coalition behind the measure includes some longtime antagonists , in particular homebuilders and leading environmental groups in California .
Both called the measure historic .

Fox : Carter ' outing ' of Israeli nukes helps Iran David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday May 27 , 2008

Print This Email This Former President Jimmy Carter aroused concerns when he referred at a news conference on Sunday to Israel 's possession of " 150 or more " nuclear weapons .
Although Israel 's nuclear program has long been an open secret , with most estimates of the total Israeli nuclear arsenal running between 100 and 250 warheads , the United States has generally respected Israel 's demands for a policy of " ambiguity " on the matter .
However , the hosts of Fox & Friends were determined to find some way in which Carter had directly abetted US enemies .
" Carter Outs Israel , " proclaimed their banner .
" Confirms country 's nuke secrets . "
" It appears that he 's giving out secret information about Israel and how many nuclear weapons they may have , " said host Gretchen Carlson .
" According to most people , this information has never been made public before . "
Brian Kilmeade added , " No one 's done it ... so why not leave it to a former president , a one - term president like Jimmy Carter ? ...
He said , ' Well , Israel 's got an arsenel , about 150 . '
Excuse me ?
We never heard that confirmed before .
We 've heard rumors about that . "
" The extraordinary thing is a lot of people throughout the Mideast have assumed for a very long time that Israel had [ nuclear weapons ] , " concluded Steve Doocy .
" But nobody has ever said officially that they had it .
So , here you have got this guy who was once upon a time the president of the United States doing just that .
...
He has just helped Iran . "
Despite Doocy 's assertions , Carter is not the first high US official to ' out ' Israel .
When Secretary of Defense Robert Gates cited Israel as a nuclear power during his 2006 confirmation hearings , the Associated Press wrote , " Experts played down the importance of Gates ' ' outing ' of the Israeli nuclear weapons program .
Defense analyst Shlomo Brom , a retired Israel Defense Forces general who was once in charge of strategic planning for the military , said similar statements came out of Washington during the first Gulf War in 1991 and did not lead to a change in Israeli policy . "

McCain ’s Pro-Vet Image Clashes With Record

John McCain ( Photo by : Lauren Victoria Burke )
PHOENIX — Sen. John McCain , the Republican presidential nominee , continues to hold a substantial lead over his Democratic opponent , Sen. Barack Obama , among military veterans — despite the fact that Obama has consistently voted for higher increases in veterans ’ health - care spending and advocated sweeping reforms at the Depart. of Veteran Affairs .
The most recent Gallup poll of registered voters , conducted in mid-August shortly before the Republican National Convention , showed that among those who had served in the military , 56 percent backed McCain , compared to 34 percent for Obama .
Among all registered voters , Obama led McCain 46 percent to 43 percent .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
The poll found that veterans favored McCain not because he is considered a war hero after his almost six years as a POW in North Vietnam .
Rather , Gallup emphasized that because most veterans tend to be Republican – 47 percent said they were Republican or leaned toward being so– they were simply backing their party ’s presidential nominee .
Obama has certainly worked hard for veterans issues .
As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee , the Illinois senator has pushed to end benefit disparities between veterans with combat and noncombat experience ; get homeless vets off the streets ; improve their mental health - care benefits ; increase Depart . of Veteran Affairs funding and overhaul the administration of all vet benefits .
But Obama never served in the military .
For some veterans , like many who attended the American Legion ’s annual convention last month in Phoenix , that is what counts , not their allegiance to the GOP .
One was Vietnam veteran Bernard Randall , 63 .
He told me that he supports McCain because “ he ’s a veteran ” with “ more experience than Obama . ”
Randall , an Apache who served in the Marines in 1967 - 68 , said health care is his top issue , and that McCain is more likely to do something about it .
Randall ’s views were echoed by a dozen other conventioneers , even after they watched a video of Obama addressing the gathering .
But is Randall ’s and the other vets ’ faith in McCain justified ?
Not according to several veterans ’ organizations that have given McCain low marks for his overall voting record on vet issues .
Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , a non-partisan advocacy group , gave McCain a “ D ” in 2006 , while Obama earned a “ B+. ” The Vietnam Veterans of America reported that on 31 “ key votes ” between 2001 and 2008 on issues including veterans ’ health - care funding and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , McCain opposed its positions 15 times , while supporting it eight times .
In contrast , Obama , since elected to the Senate in 2004 , backed the group ’s stands 12 out of 13 times .
The Disabled Veterans of America said McCain supported its positions 20 percent of the time in 2006 , compared to Obama ’s 80 percent .
There are several examples of the conflicting McCain and Obama votes , including McCain ’s opposition to five bills that would increase funding for veteran healthcare programs and related facilities .
A full list of those bills is available here .
Before Obama came to the Senate , McCain also cast votes against obtaining better equipment for troops .
In 2003 , for example , he voted to table an amendment that called for an additional $ 322 million for safety equipment for military forces in Iraq .
The measure would have reduced reconstruction funds for Iraq by the same amount .
In April 2003 , he voted to table an amendment , that passed 52 - 47 , to provide more than $ 1 billion in equipment for the National Guard and reserves to reduce a shortage of helmets , bullet - proof armor and other gear
McCain said that while the National Guard spending amendment included items “ nice to have , ” he condemned it because it was presented as an emergency measure and had not gone through the normal process with open debate .
“ This is neither the appropriate nor , I believe , fiscially the responsible thing to do at this time , ” McCain said , “ I urge a ‘ no ’ vote . ”
Whether McCain ’s relatively low rankings by veterans ’ groups will drive a substantial number of vets to vote for Obama remains to be seen .
For now , McCain enjoys strong support from veterans who hold his military service and experience as a POW in high regard .
“ He gets a lot of veteran support because most veterans have extreme respect for what he went through in the military , ” retired Navy Capt .
Mike Lumpkin , a Democrat who is running for a congressional seat in eastern San Diego County , told me .
Lumpkin is a member of Obama ’s veterans advisory group , Next Generation Veterans for Obama , and appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention in Denver .
Lumpkin , who served 21 years as a Navy SEAL , said that he knows how powerful a record of military service can be in attracting voters .
He told me he ’s attracting strong crossover support from Republicans with military backgrounds in his congressional race .
“ There is an inherent bond and respect , especially for a career military officer , ” he said .
In fact , McCain is also attracting significant cross -over support among veterans who are or lean Democrat — about 17 percent , according to the Gallup poll .
Overall , McCain is the choice of 89 percent of vets who say they are Republican , while Obama wins 75 percent of veterans who say they are Democratic .
McCain ’s support among veterans is comparable to that of President George W. Bush in 2004 , who drew the support of 55 percent of veterans , against Sen .
John Kerry ’s 39 percent , in the last Gallup poll before the presidential election .
Bush served stateside in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War , while Kerry saw action in Vietnam and was wounded .
Vets ’ strong support for Bush , despite Kerry ’s military record , is an another indication of their affinity for the Republican Party , according to Gallup .
Other polls echo Gallup ’s August findings that McCain enjoys an advantage among veterans .
Rasmussen Reports ’ national telephone survey , conducted July 21 - 22 , of 3,000 likely voters , which included 588 respondents who served in the military , found that veterans supported the GOP presidential nominee over Obama , 56 percent to 37 percent .
By contrast , non-military respondents favored Obama 50 percent to 43 percent .
Yet , despite McCain ’s support among veterans , he cannot take their backing for granted .
One reason is Obama ’s strong legislative record of supporting veterans now .
The other is McCain ’s checkered legislative record on vet issues .
The challenge for Obama is whether he can convince millions of veterans who historically vote for the Republican presidential nominee that he has their back covered far more than the former Navy POW .
Just when you thought that Big Oil dictated the energy policy of the United States through political contributions , Wired.com has learned that a substantial contributor to the Obama campaign has influenced that candidate 's ideas on energy .
On June 16 , 2008 , John Zimmerman , chief financial officer of Tomkins , gave nearly $ 7,000 in campaign contributions to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Lo and behold , nary two months later Obama 's in Springfield , Missouri , suggesting drivers inflate their tires to save gas ( and , by the way , curb CO2 emissions ) .
Coincidence ?
We think not .
Does it come as any surprise that Tomkins owns the Syracuse Gauge Company , which bills itself as manufacturing the " largest selection and variety of tools in the United States for filling tires [ and ] checking tire pressure " ?
Of course the mainstream media ignored this development , leaving it to the blogosphere to bring the big money and big pressure of the PSI
lobby to light .
Clearly , Mr. Zimmerman 's contributions influenced the Obama campaign to encourage Americans to purchase tire gauges , though most of the lowly devices have already been snapped up by the McCain campaign .
Perhaps the most - shocking part of Inflategate is the politicization of a suggestion so simple as following the instructions found in your car 's owners manual .
It 's also something of a tempest in a teapot , seeing how all new cars must have tire - pressure monitors .
Offshore drilling deserves debate , as do biofuels and other alternatives to petroleum .
While nobody can blame the McCain campaign for using tire - gauge jokes to prompt some real discussion on energy policy , the fact some Americans became incensed over a call to pump up the PSI simply speaks to the immaturity of the electorate .
It also suggests that the slightest bit of sacrifice is too much for some Americans – the Dennis Leary " I 'm An A - hole " vote , perhaps – a fact which some campaigns have not yet learned .
While keeping tires properly inflated is of some measurable benefit , and certainly less sacrifice ( and sometimes more cost - effective ) than trading in your SUV for a gas - sipper , it 's disappointing that some Americans choose to cling to inefficiency as a badge of honor .

2006 Perseid Meteor Shower : Jim Gamble photographed this " nice , bright and long magnitude - 8.6 Perseid " using an all - sky camera at the El Paso Station of the Sandia All Sky Camera Network .
The annual Perseid meteor shower is expected to put on a good display of shooting stars in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday .
The best views will be from rural locations away from light pollution , where up to 60 meteors per hour could be seen , weather permitting .
Urban and suburban skywatchers can expect far fewer .
The Perseids are bits of debris left by comet Swift - Tuttle .
The debris is like a river of small particles in space , and each year , Earth passes through it .
As the bits zoom through our atmosphere at 37 miles per second ( 60 kps ) they vaporize , creating the brilliant streaks of light .
Most of the meteors are no larger than a grain of sand .
The shower is typically best between midnight and dawn , when the side of Earth you are standing on is plowing into the stream as our planet plunges through space in its orbit around the sun .
It 's similar to how bugs hit the windshield of a moving car but rarely smack into the rear bumper .
The annual shower begins as a trickle in mid-July and will continue to spark a handful of shooting stars for several nights to come .
But Earth passes through the densest part of the stream Aug. 12 at around 7 a.m. ET ( 1100 GMT ) .
The moon will set around 1:30 a.m. local time ( regardless of your location ) , leaving the sky dark for a few hours of optimal meteor watching across much of North America .
" There should be plenty of meteors -- perhaps one or two every minute , " said Bill Cooke of NASA 's Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center .
Cooke said the brightest Perseids can be seen from a city , but the majority are too faint and are visible only from rural locations .
Meteor watching is easy .
Find the darkest location you can , away from porch lights and other lighting .
Use a blanket or lounge chair to lie back and scan as much of the sky as possible .
Allow 15 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the darkness .
Binoculars and telescopes are of no use , as the meteors move too swiftly .
Expect the shooting stars to arrive in groups .
While scientists forecast 1 per minute during peak hours , the pace in fact tends to be higher for brief periods with relative droughts in between .
Patience is truly a virtue .
The best time to watch , regardless of your location , is from 2 a .m. to dawn local time , but the best seats will be in the western half of North America where dark skies coincide with the peak activity .
The Perseids get their name from the constellation Perseus , from which they tend to emanate like spokes from the hub of a wheel .
The meteors can make their appearance anywhere in the sky , however .
Perseus rises in the northeast around 9 a.m. local time .
So Monday evening , avid skywatchers will head out after 9 p.m. in search of early Perseids that tend to fly along the horizon .
These earthgrazers , as they are called , are rare but rewarding sights .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Get ready to pour your milk out of a square jug .
Sam's Club , a unit of Wal - Mart Stores ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , sells gallons of milks in square containers in some stores .
They come that way so shippers can stack more gallons into a truck , saving money , fuel and greenhouse gases .
It turns out that the square milk jugs are easier and quicker to ship , therefore fresher when they hit the shelf .
And so - like concentrated laundry detergent , environmentally - friendly cleaning products and compact fluorescent light bulbs , all of which are being pushed by Wal - Mart - square milk jugs are likely to find their way into tens of millions of American homes .
" We 're looking everywhere we can to save energy and eliminate waste , " says Matt Kistler , the giant retailer 's senior vice president for sustainability .
I interviewed Kistler last week at a conference called Greener By Design , about making and selling green products .
He is 42 , and a native of East Lansing , Michigan , with an MBA from the Kellogg business school at Northwestern .
A former marketing guy , Kistler has led Wal - Mart 's sustainability effort since last fall .
That job puts him at the nerve center of an ambitious drive to reduce the environmental impact of the consumer products industry .
Some of the push comes from the outside .
Companies with " green " products to sell , such as Clorox Co. ( CLX , Fortune 500 ) with its ' Green Works ' line of cleaning products , bring them to Wal - Mart .
( Kistler says they are selling well . )
Other efforts begin inside Wal - Mart , which has learned that by eliminating packaging and waste , it can sell products at even lower prices to its customers .
Kistler told me that the current economic slump will not get in the way of Wal - Mart 's sustainability initiative , which has been underway since the fall of 2005 .
( See The Green Machine at fortune.com . )
It has been gathering steam ever since ; the company 's 1.9 million employees have been encouraged to embrace their own personal sustainability projects , or PSPs , which can include carpooling , recycling , getting more exercise or eating less meat .
" If anything , " Kistler said , " I wish we 'd started all out efforts years earlier because then we'd be further ahead . "
Consider , as an example , a product called Majestic Rubber Mulch that Wal - Mart began selling in March .
It 's a mulch made from recycled tires - tires from its auto and lube shop that , in the past , would have been be carted away .
Now Wal - Mart has eliminated that cost , and turned it into a revenue center by selling the old tires to a company that turns them into what Wal - Mart says is a non -toxic , latex - free mulch that can be used for playgrounds , pools , pond areas or gardens .
The mulch nuggets sell from $ 5.47 for a 20 - lb bag .
" We collect a lot of old tires , " Kistler said .
" We had to find an outlet for them .
We are seeing ways to make money from waste . "
Packaging has been another key focus .
Smaller containers of concentrated laundry detergent save plastic ( which comes from oil ) , water , fuel , shipping cost and shelf space .
What 's not to like ?
Those once - familiar oversized jugs of Tide and All are no longer sold at Wal - Mart .
Wal - Mart now asks vendors to rate themselves on a " packaging scorecard " that measures such factors as the ratio of package size to product , whether the package uses recycled material and whether the package can be recycled or otherwise reused .
The company is looking at a variety of packaging innovations , ranging from DVD cases made of potatoes to eliminating oversized packages for small , expensive items ( like flash drives or print cartridges ) by having them dispensed from kiosks or at the checkout counter .
Wal - Mart has learned that consumers are enthusiastic about so - called green products , so long as they do n't cost more that conventional alternatives .
The company has sold nearly 200 million CFL bulbs , organic cotton has been a hit and buyers in the produce departments are finding ways to buy from nearby farmers if possible .
Buying locally - produced food saves the company shipping costs and reduces its carbon footprint .
" The consumer gets a better tasting , fresher item , " Kistler says .
" It 's a win - win - win across the board . "
Kistler joined Wal - Mart in 2003 , after working at General Foods , Oscar Mayer and Kraft , marketing coffee , meats and cheese .
He was asked in 2005 to lead Wal - Mart 's packaging network , where he worked with suppliers and nonprofits to come up with a system to reduce and improve packaging .
Last fall , he left his job as a marketing executive at Sam's Club to work full - time on sustainability .
He told me that his introduction to the world of green business came in 1999 when , as a marketer of coffee for Kraft , he got a call from the food services company that supplied the dining halls at Yale University .
Students there wanted coffee that was certified as fair - trade and environmentally friendly , so Kistler was able to get a Kraft product approved by a nonprofit called the Rainforest Alliance .
" My introduction was about fixing a business problem - we had an unhappy customer , " he remembered .
Becoming more sustainable was good for the business , he said , and the same is true at Wal - Mart .
It 's become a way to cut costs , save customers money and sell products that are better for them and for the environment .
The other day I came across a really nice hurricane tracking site called Stormpulse .
I used it to track Hurricane Hanna as she skimmed past the coast of Florida , and have been using it to keep an eye on Ike as well .
Today I was checking Ike ’s progress through the Caribbean when I noticed something in the upper right corner of the site .
The site was requesting tips .
At first , I thought it was requesting feedback on ways to improve the site , but they were actually soliciting for currency .
I found it to be a rather interesting ( and direct ) way to monetize a website .
It kind of reminded me of an article in which J.D. at Get Rich Slowly remarks that ads are NOT the new online tip jar .
I agree wholeheartedly with what J.D. says , and tipjoy takes an interesting approach in providing web publishers with a tip jar .
With tipjoy , users can directly tip web publishers instead of the roundabout ( and detrimental ) method of clicking ads .
It is very quick and easy to leave tips with tipjoy and you can tip as little as 5 cents at a time .
I took at look at the tipjoy stats for Stormpulse , and so far the site has earned nearly $ 4,800 in tips !
Not too shabby , considering that people generally are n’t very charitable .
Although I hardly expect to ever get that kind of traffic , I thought I ’d take a crack at adding tipjoy to my site as well .
If you have a high - traffic website , you may want to try appealing to the better nature of some of your loyal visitors and see what happens when you ask for tips .
EA and Maxis released Spore to the world last week , and while we still do n't have sales information for the title , the big news was n't the game play .
In fact , we found the game itself rather lackluster in most ways .
The issue that set the Internet on fire was the DRM , and gamers quickly let the world know of their anger .
As Ars digs deeper into how EA actually handles the DRM , we have to wonder : was the controversy worth it ?
Masses of gamers bombed Amazon with one - star reviews for the title , protesting the three - install limit the game claimed to enforce .
For a short time it looked like Amazon had pulled the reviews , but then the online retailer put them back up when the outcry became even louder .
EA also came under fire when the company announced it was making the DRM for Red Alert 3 more " lenient " by upping the install - limit to five instead of three .
To a populace already upset at the very idea of an install limit , this did n't seem to be much of an improvement .
Dealing with the EA DRM juggernaut
With all the sound and the fury , we wondered if anyone had even yet dealt with this install limit ?
Mark DeSanto , who reviewed the game , installed his review copy of Spore on his main gaming PC twice , once on his laptop , and then again on the gaming PC .
Four installs , across two systems .
The fourth installation received an authentication error when he tried to log into the game .
A quick call to EA 's customer support brought an oddly - happy voice on the line , and once informed of the issue , he quickly determined that there was a network issue on their side ; Spore 's authentication servers were down .
So it was DRM in general that was causing the problem , not an issue specific to EA or Spore .
We hung up the phone and waited roughly fifteen minutes to call EA tech support once more ; we were hoping to get someone else to get a different opinion , as we were sure we had used up all our installation attempts .
Calling back , another happy voice — female this time — checked into the account and determined that we had only registered the game twice — not four times .
Spore was only registering installs on new machines .
The game booted with no issue soon after ; it seems to have truly been a network issue .
With installing the game four times between two machines , and still no issues , we decided to remove the game and installed it a fifth time on the gaming PC , and still had no issues with playing the game .
Next we decided to move over to a completely different , so far unused , machine , installing it on an antiquated test system ... no issues .
Finally , the game was installed onto a Mac Pro , and we struck gold with the pictured error message .
A call to EA brought us to the same help person as the first call .
We informed him of the error message and gave him his Spore account information as well as the product key .
A few minutes later the rep determined that we had , in fact , used up all our " key activations . "
As friendly as can be , our EA employee inferred that it was probably some kind of printing error on the manual .
Here 's the catch : we decided to tell him that we had rented the game .
He assured us he could resolve the situation and did — issuing me another CD key for the game .
We wanted to make it clear we understood the DRM restrictions and asked about the install limitations and he informed me that " you could install the game all day long on the same machine — it was limited to installations on three separate machines . "
The only catch : the game had to be reinstalled after the new key was issued .
While the issue of the install limit is a touchy one , it does n't look like a normal install will do much to use up your limit , and in fact we surpassed the install limit by a few times before running into an issue .
Even after being told that we were " renting " the game , EA was happy to give us a new key to run the game .
In this case , customer service wins , and we left wondering if the DRM controversy might be more philosophical in nature than rooted in any real - world inconveniences .
Each Monday , this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries , events and people that continue to affect the history being made today .
Long before the Internet made viral marketing a cinch , one long - nosed little character named Kilroy made his way around the world the old - fashioned way , becoming a legend among the millions of military men and women who served during World War II .
The rudimentary doodle , which featured a balding head peering over a wall along with the tag " Kilroy Was Here , " popped up in unexpected places across all of the theaters of war visited by American troops .
While competitions to inscribe the graffiti in obscure locations kept the battle - weary soldiers busy and its appearances kept them inspired , the mysterious Kilroy character had Japanese intelligence officers and even Hitler himself worried over the seemingly ubiquitous guy .
Reportedly spurred by an American dockworker , the " Kilroy Was Here " fad was an iconic part of World War II and 1940s lore .
The riveter that launched a thousand ships
The origins of " Kilroy Was Here " remain murky and clouded by urban legend , but the most credible source of the saying comes from a shipyard in Quincy , Massachusetts , most historians agree .
On top of their military contribution overseas during World War II , the United States was heavily involved in the war effort producing ships , tanks , planes and weapons for the Allied Forces at plants across the country .
At one of the country 's most prolific shipyards in Quincy worked James J. Kilroy — a rivet inspector who , like everyone in his trade , was paid by the number of rivets he checked and recorded his day's work on the machinery itself with a chalk mark .
To avoid having his marks erased and moved by unscrupulous workers continuing his line of rivets , Kilroy began inscribing " Kilroy Was Here " on the machinery , historians say .
The dire need for ships overseas meant that most were launched into action before the workers ' marks , including Kilroy 's , were painted over or covered up .
American
GIs began noticing the puzzling phrase scrawled on outgoing ships almost immediately , often tucked into hard - to - reach spots .
At first , sailors treated an appearance of " Kilroy Was Here " like a kind of talisman , certifying that their ship had been properly checked and would be protected against the enemy .
GIs later adopted Kilroy 's standard and began tagging the places they 'd visited across Europe , Asia and Africa .
The Kilroy character — just eyes and fingers visible from behind a wall or fence — was attached to the saying sometime early in the war .
Kilroy on the Moon ?
By the end of World War II , " Kilroy Was Here " had achieved cult - like status , springing up in the unlikeliest of places — probably as a result of some friendly competition among GIs , historians believe — including some top - secret military installations .
Latrines in France , beaches in the Pacific and walls in Germany were covered with the tag and , as the war progressed , it became a rally cry of the mounting Allied successes .
While Americans shared a few good - hearted laughs over the mysterious Kilroy , who somehow managed to arrive at every destination first , the slogan was a more serious matter for the opposition .
Japanese troops were so mystified by a " Kilroy Was Here " painted on a bombed out tank on the Pacific island of Guadalcanal that they reported the find to their senior intelligence officers , according to a U.S. Marine interviewed by World War II author Timothy Benford .
Hitler supposed that Kilroy was some kind of " Super - GI " or spy , other unconfirmed reports have stated , and ordered a contingent of men to track down the sneaky American .
He would never be found .
The identity of the real Kilroy was n't revealed until 1946 , when a national radio contest searching for the original " artist " uncovered and authenticated the story of James Kilroy in Quincy , which still celebrates its hometown celebrity with Pin - the - Nose - on - Kilroy competitions .
The legend continues …
Despite a few unique appearances reported recently in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Kilroy fad largely faded from memory after a small resurgence in popularity during the Korean War in the 1950s .
Or did it ?
A bit of a personal side - note — my grandfather , a British World War II veteran whose initials are W.W. , often signed his cards and letters with the same little bulbous - nosed character peeking over a wall , his fingers scrawled in the shape of two Ws .
Who knows where else Kilroy remains alive and well ?!
These are a few other places where " Kilroy " is rumored to have showed up over the years :
The Arc de Triomphe in Paris
Mount Everest
The Statue of Liberty
The surface of the Moon
The Great Wall of China

One of the most controversial parts of modern physics is what it tells us about philosophy .
Both quantum mechanics and special relativity have much to say on the limits of what can be casually related , the degree to which reality is deterministic , how local ( or non-local ) the universe is , and even whether some forms of realism are scientifically valid .
Many people find the conclusions of quantum mechanics unpalatable and have proposed alternatives , such as Bohm 's pilot wave quantum mechanics , to match their personal preference for reality .
However , most of these proposals require that there is some privileged view of the universe that keeps both special relativity and their particular ideas in agreement .
Researchers have now tested the mechanism that would have to be behind this agreement , and found it to be extremely unlikely .
If you are experiencing déjà vu about now , you are not alone — we have been here before .
In the late 19th and early 20th century , there was considerable debate about the speed of light .
Maxwell 's then - new theory of electromagnetism had predicted the speed of light .
However , speed is always measured between two objects , so the natural question was what the predicted speed of light measured relative to ?
The question seemed to imply that there was some absolute reference from which everything could be measured .
Experiments showed that this frame of reference was extremely unlikely , and it took Einstein to suggest that perhaps our ideas about relativity should be re-thought .
Now , here we are just over 100 years later , and the same question has returned , albeit in a slightly different form .
Quantum mechanics has a property called entanglement that tells us that the states of two particles can be correlated .
Furthermore , if we separate the correlated particles by an arbitrary distance and then do something to one particle , our actions will be instantaneously reflected in changes to the measured properties of the other particle .
Although this sounds like it can be used for information transfer , it cannot , so special relativity is safe .
If , like Bohm , you happen to dislike the nondeterminism inherent in quantum mechanics , this is a problem because the two particles must communicate .
He rewrote quantum mechanics so that a pilot wave kept the two particles entangled and everything remained deterministic .
However , to do this and not violate special relativity , a privileged way to observe the universe , called a frame , is required .
These frames should always be detectable , because the Earth is in motion .
Unless the special frame is both centered on , and rotating with , the Earth , the frame could always be detected by determining how the movement of the Earth changes experimental results .
This is exactly what a group of Swiss scientists have now done .
From their Geneva location , they created entangled pairs of photons .
These photons were sent down optical fibers to two villages separated by 18 km in an approximately east - west direction .
At each end , the single photon was offered two choices — a long path and a short path to a photodetector .
If both photons took the same choice , then the detectors in each village would click at the same time .
To observe the entangled nature of the photons , the lengths of the paths in one village were changed slightly over time , so the timing of photon arrivals fluctuated periodically as the path lengths oscillated back and forth , creating interference fringes .
The key to the experiment was measuring how deep the fringes are .
If the correlations are not due to entanglement , there will be no , or very shallow , fringes .
Fringes deeper than a certain threshold can only be due to entanglement .
The researchers reasoned that if there is a special frame through which the entangled particles keep track of each other , then at certain times of the day the fringes will vanish .
This will occur when the surface of the Earth is at right angles to the special frame .
So , they looked for periodic changes to the fringe visibility , but found that the fringe visibility is independent of the Earth 's rotation .
No matter what time of the day , the fringes were always too deep to be due to anything but entanglement .
One can always explain away these results by postulating that the speed of the proposed pilot wave is faster than light .
Well , the researchers considered that as well .
Their analysis shows that the pilot wave must travel at least 10,000 times faster than the speed of light to explain their results , a possibility they consider extremely unlikely .
It seems that there are always people who will argue for specialness .
First there was the luminiferous aether , then the anthropic principle , and now an entanglement frame .
With the possible exception of the anthropic principle ( and I would n't put money on that surviving the next 50 years ) , none of these ideas survive for very long .

In the muddled arena where public officials and journalists co-exist , there ’s a dirty little secret that ’s mostly kept from the public :
Too many of the public officials who conduct the public ’s business choose to keep our records out of reach .
They know it .
We journalists know it .
But the public rarely has an inkling .
It ’s time for a change .
At a time when the federal government has put a “ secret ” stamp on far too much government information , it ’s difficult to overstate our public access challenges .
It ’s easy to assign blame when journalists or public advocacy groups are denied access to records that , by law , ought to be public .
Among ourselves , we point the finger at elected and appointed officials who hoard public information as if it were their own .
But the fault lies just as much with those who want the information as those who block our access to it .
In too many cases , barriers to open government persist because we seldom raise our voices in unison .
Give any good editor a tip that some poor sap has been run over by the government , and the story ’s as good as greased for page one .
But when a government agency puts public information off - limits , the victims are countless .
And how do we react ?
Squeamishly .
Most of the time , we do n’t consider it news .
Or if we do , we ’re inclined to assign someone to write a brief that only our most astute readers can find .
To be sure , most of the time , most of us – public - spirited citizens or journalists – ask for public records and receive them without incident .
Most often , public bodies conduct the public ’s business out in the open .
But the exceptions are numerous and worrisome — and from my experience , they are on the rise .
Those of us whose news interests are primarily local glance up every now and then and are frightened at what we see happening in Washington :
The federal government has an enormous capacity and appetite to know everything about us – even when the law prohibits it .
Yet it is increasingly difficult for us to find out anything about them — even when the law requires them to disclose it .
I mean to use the terms “ us ” and “ them ” with emphasis .
Because I believe , as do many Americans , that some of those in power – in both parties – understand that an ill - informed public is easier to manipulate .
No wonder so many Americans feel alienated from government , and threatened by it .
In one poll , 75 percent of Americans described the federal government as secretive .
And 40 percent say the same about local government .
Which brings me back home .
You may recall reading that in Massachusetts that the Executive Branch of government has been considering tightening our access to criminal history information — as if we had much to start with .
Four years ago , the Boston Globe Spotlight Team asked the state for the identifying information for several thousand fugitives who are charged with violent crimes : murder , rape , armed robbery and the like .
We did n’t want their medical records – just their names , last known addresses and dates of birth .
It almost does n’t matter why we wanted the information , though you can probably guess that the Globe was interested in finding some of the fugitives .
What matters here is the state ’s response .
We were turned down .
The Criminal History Systems Board determined that , under the law , dangerous people charged with the most heinous crimes are entitled to the law ’s privacy protections .
If you think that was an aberrant decision , please know that it was upheld by a Superior Court judge .
Then the dispute became Kafkaesque : The Board decided that there was a way we could obtain the identifying information we needed .
If we wanted the identifying information for a fugitive from a murder charge – by definition someone who could not be located – we could have it if we got the fugitive to write a letter giving the state permission to release the information .
Even when the law is on our side , it is often used against us .
In 1999 , the Globe Spotlight Team published a months - long series on municipal corruption .
One story was about how an affordable housing lottery in the town of Easton was manipulated so the son of a town official could win .
After the article ran , the phone rang , with a tip that the same thing had happened in the white glove town of Westwood .
We checked property sales , and got an apparent confirmation .
We asked town officials for the lottery records .
They dithered and dallied , and then turned us down .
I called the town administrator , who told me , in so many words , “ Sue us . ”
Our choice :
Fight a prolonged and expensive battle for the records in court , or move on .
We chose the latter course .
The town ’s lawyer no doubt knew that in Massachusetts , among too many other states , there is no sanction in the Public Records law for public agencies that deny access to public records .
Ponder this too :
Not too long ago , a Globe reporter went online and easily discovered a website where golfers ’ scores – and handicaps – are posted .
They included House Speaker Sal DiMasi , who in his first months as Speaker spent many weekdays playing golf – and playing it well ; he has a single - digit handicap .
So his golf scores are public .
But no one among us is legally permitted to attend the deliberations of legislative conference committees that decide how billions of our tax dollars will be spent .
When we are entitled to public records , it can be costly even when we get them .
This has long been a problem for private citizens who want public documents .
In addition to copying charges , many public agencies nowadays charge search fees that can exceed $ 50 an hour – for documents that are routinely posted online in many states .
In 2007 , when the Globe asked the city of Boston for health inspection reports for 50 high - end restaurants , the Inspectional Services Department was happy to comply – for $ 2,039 , which included 78 hours of search time to find the records .
We paid the money .
But when I reminded the commissioner that Mayor Thomas M. Menino had promised several years earlier to put those inspection reports into a searchable online database , the price started dropping quickly , like in those Wal - Mart ads .
The final cost was about $ 600 .
It should not go unsaid that The Globe is one of the very few news organizations left that can afford $ 2,039 for important public records .
And that was last year .
When it comes to public records , I am delighted when I ’m looking into someone who has roots in the Sunbelt .
That ’s because so many public records are online in those states .
In quaint New England , with its mid-20th century public records laws , we ’re not so lucky .
In Massachusetts , for instance , fewer than 20 percent of communities put their assessing records online .
In some jurisdictions , access to public records is so difficult that when we score , we sometimes feel we ’ve been handed something we ’re not really entitled to .
I do n’t know about you , but I ’m given to profusely thanking those who are merely complying with the law .
But that ’s the wrong attitude to have .
And we can do a lot to change the belief held by some public officials that they can get away with saying no .
One surefire way :
All of us , public interest groups and news organizations , must become more insistent that public records be public — and to recognize that it is newsworthy when they are not .
For public officials to change their habits , public attitudes must change .
We can make that happen .
For public access laws to change to reflect 21st century technology , public education is critical .
We can make that happen .
The New England First Amendment Coalition , and its partner , the New England First Amendment Center at Northeastern , are committed to pushing for that change – across New England .
We have different laws , but access problems that are all too common .
Problems that , together , we can surmount .
There is strength in numbers .
And by shining a light on this impediment to democracy , we are not acting out of self - interest .
We are acting in the public interest .

Microsoft has been struggling to stir up demand for its Xbox 360 in Japan .
Microsoft will lower the price of the Xbox 360 Arcade model by 8,000 yen ( $ 73.92 ) to 19,800 yen , the Nikkei said .
The Arcade does not come equipped with a hard drive and is the least expensive of the three Xbox 360 models , the Nikkei said .
The new price will make that model cheaper than Nintendo ’s Wii , which sells for about 25,000 yen , and the PlayStation 3 , which sells for 39,800 yen .
The company will also reduce the price of two higher models with hard drives by 5,000 - 8,000 yen , the paper said .
Microsoft Xbox spokeswoman Kazumi Ishiyama in Japan declined to comment on the Nikkei report .
The company is scheduled to hold a briefing on the Xbox 360 in the Japanese market at 3:00 p.m. ( 2:00 a.m. EDT ) on Monday .
The Xbox 360 has lagged its Japanese rivals on their home turf , with 684,695 units sold so far in Japan against Wii ’s 6.67 million and PS3 ’s 2.32 million , according to game magazine publisher Enterbrain .
The Xbox 360 , however , beat the PS3 in Japan weekly sales for the first time in the week ended August 10 , on robust demand for Namco Bandai Holdings ' 7832 .

Microsoft recently cut the price of its best - selling Xbox 360 Pro model game console with a 20 gigabyte hard drive to $ 299 from $ 349 in the United States .
Strong global sales of Wii led Nintendo to revise up its earnings forecasts for the six months to September and full year to March 2009 on Friday .

Poor Al Gore truly stepped in it eight years ago when he described his involvement in government internet incentives as taking " the initiative in creating " the Web .
Republicans gleefully inflated and mocked his apparent egocentrism , and Gore barely recovered before the election .
Now John McCain 's chief economic adviser may just have done the same thing .
McCain claimed on TV this morning that his chairmanship of the Senate commerce committee during the 1990s helped educate him on the financial markets - an assertion that prompted reporters to ask economic adviser Doug Holtz - Eakin for some examples .
Holtz - Eakin responded , incredibly , by holding up a BlackBerry .
" He did this , " the McCain adviser said .
Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years , comes right through the Commerce committee so you 're looking at the miracle John McCain helped create and that 's what he did .
According to that logic , McCain must have been at least partially responsible for other technological innovations that emerged while he sat on the Commerce committee .
Senator , thanks for the iPod and " a Google " !
( But wait :
This also means Obama was responsible for the lack of homeland - security breaches in the US since 2004 , right ?
Because he 's been on the Senate homeland security committee ... )
UPDATE : Thanks to commenter USA4Obama for pointing out McCain 's responses to the policy site sciencedebate2008.com , in which he claims to -- wait for it -- have helped create wi-fi .
Seriously .
Under my guiding hand , Congress developed a wireless spectrum policy that spurred the rapid rise of mobile phones and Wi-Fi technology that enables Americans to surf the web while sitting at a coffee shop , airport lounge , or public park .
Now , McCain has a point : he is a chief sponsor of a congressional plan to encourage rural communities to develop faster broadband networks .
But does he really want to remind folks of Global Crossing , the telecom company that went bankrupt on dreams of expanding the wireless spectrum ?
McCain chaired the commerce committee during Global Crossing 's heyday , before it had to work out a controversial government settlement to unload its wireless rights , and the senator was among the bigger recipients of the company 's political donations .
That in itself would n't be notable - except , as the Wall Street Journal ( link only available with Factiva or Nexis service ) reported in 2002 , McCain got $ 30,000 from Global Crossing executives in a single day after sending regulators a favourable letter about the company .
I guess you could call that a " guiding hand " ...
Obama : McCain wants to ' gamble ' away US pensions Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday September 20 , 2008
Print This Email This DAYTONA BEACH , Florida ( AFP )  Democrat Barack Obama accused his White House foe John McCain Saturday of wanting to " gamble " away Americans ' life savings by privatizing Social Security at a time of crisis on the markets .
Neither of the campaigns had any immediate response to news reports that the US government wants permission from Congress to buy 700 billion dollars in troubled mortgages , according to a draft rescue plan for Wall Street .
But Obama renewed his demand that any government bailout must protect ordinary Americans on " Main Street , " as well as the busted financiers of New York , through another round of stimulus spending .
McCain meanwhile pursued a new line of attack in blaming the financial hurricane on fraud at US mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which are among the tottering companies now taken over by the government .
By extension , according to McCain , Obama is to blame as he was a leading recipient in Congress of campaign donations from the two companies and " did nothing " to sound the alarm about their " festering problems . "
" While Fannie and Freddie were working to keep Congress away from their house of cards , Senator Obama was taking their money , " the Arizona senator said in his weekly radio address .
" The crisis on Wall Street started in the Washington culture of lobbying and influence - peddling , and he was square in the middle of it , " he said .
But at a rally here in the retirement haven of Florida , a battleground state that decided the 2000 election , Obama noted McCain 's life - long belief in market deregulation before the Republican switched tack this week .
He observed that in the current issue of " Contingencies , " the journal of the American Academy of Actuaries , McCain touts his plan to fix the US health care crisis by injecting a dose of Wall Street competition into insurance .
" Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition , as we have done over the last decade in banking , would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state - based regulation , " McCain wrote .
Obama said : " So let me get this straight -- he wants to run health care like they 've been running Wall Street .
Well , senator , I know some folks on Main Street who are n't going to think that 's such a good idea .
" There 's only one candidate whose campaign is being run by seven of Washington 's most powerful lobbyists .
And folks , it is n't me , " he added .
" And I 'll protect Social Security , while John McCain wants to privatize it , " he said at the rally , which was devoted to issues of particular concern to women as Obama pushes back against McCain 's running mate Sarah Palin .
" Without Social Security half of elderly women would be living in poverty -- half .
But if my opponent had his way , the millions of Floridians who rely on it would 've had their Social Security tied up in the stock market this week .
" Millions would 've watched as the market tumbled and their nest egg disappeared before their eyes , " Obama said .
" So I know Senator McCain is talking about a ' casino culture ' on Wall Street -- but the fact is , he 's the one who wants to gamble with your life savings .
And that is not going to happen when I 'm president of the United States . "
The McCain campaign denies the Republican would " privatize " America 's Great Depression - era retirement benefits .
But McCain agrees with President George W. Bush 's argument that the system is going broke , and would permit citizens to have the choice of investing their pensions in " safe " vehicles such as bonds .
" John McCain is 100 - percent committed to preserving Social Security benefits for seniors , and Barack Obama knows it , " McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement .
" This is a desperate attempt to gain political advantage using scare tactics and deceit ...
Barack Obama has proven he will say and do anything to put his superficial ambitions over the real challenges Americans are facing , " he said .
Bush has already failed in his bid to enact private Social Security accounts owing to widespread opposition -- not least in balmy Florida , which has roughly 4.5 million people aged 60 and over .
An interesting man said an interesting thing the other day .
Unfair , you say ?
Voters should n’t judge a candidate by his skin color .
Maybe , but is it any more unfair than , for example , saying that because McCain and President Bush are both Republicans that a McCain administration would produce a third Bush term ?
No , it is n’t .
Ummm … you ’re kidding , right ?
I mean , surely this taken out of context or something .
Surely .
Well , read the whole thing and judge for yourself .
It seems , at a glance , like Rothenberg is attempting to make a fairly valid point about how blind , uncritical preconceptions still exert a powerful influence on how people vote .
So far , so good .
But whatever valuable insight he was attempting to convey apparently got hijacked , drug off into the weeds and nard - stomped by a phalanx of Rovian Klan bikers .
If you ’re missing the nuance , let me see can I clarificate for you : “ Negro ” is an ideology .
I know , I know .
Up until now you always thought it was simply a genetic defect .
And you naïvely thought that political beliefs had something to do with a more or less cognitive process .
That is , one was how you were born and the other was a way you decided to think .
But the course of intellectual perfection is ever - ascending , and maybe Rothenberg is onto something .
Recent studies have indicated that we may be born with certain political tendencies – that is , there may be a genetic predisposition toward being Republican .
And thanks to Rothenberg , we now know that race is a political marker .
I ’m not sure how we ’ll graphically represent the new partisan order , but maybe it goes something like this : I ’m open to revisions , of course .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Is it even harder now for businesses to get credit from banks ?
No question .
Does that mean that the American economy will crumble within weeks if the government 's $ 700 billion bailout of Wall Street does n't pass ?
No telling .
In the wake of last week 's demise of Lehman Brothers and last - minute government bailout of American International Group , the credit markets have all but frozen .
What this means for businesses is that they are having a tougher time just getting funding even for their day - to - day operations , never mind securing loans for expansion projects .
While the credit crunch is more than a year old already , two things have changed in recent weeks .
First , investors have cut off a major financing source of large corporations by shying away from buying their commercial paper , or ultra short - term debt .
Also , since banks are now holding onto their money even more , they are either not extending lines of credit to companies or are instituting more onerous terms .
Businesses of all sizes depend on this funding to buy supplies and inventory , make payroll and extend credit to customers while waiting for payments to come in .
Most businesses do n't keep much cash on hand .
They rely on banks ' lines of credit to cover them until they get paid by their customers .
What does that mean for companies and their employees ?
Economists are divided , with some predicting dire consequences and others saying most can weather the financial storm for now .
Ca n't live without credit
If businesses can't access funding on reasonable terms , they will likely either raise prices or curtail their operations or both , said Ken Goldstein , economist with The Conference Board , a business research organization .
This could send the economy into a tailspin as everyone from the corner bagel shop to the local hospital to the largest manufacturer suffers .
" If they 're lucky they get the money , but at a much higher price , which they then pass on to you and me , " said Goldstein , adding the economy could start crumbling within weeks under that scenario .
" If they do n't get the money , they might have to close their doors . "
For each business that can't get funding , the impact is felt by many , experts said .
The company may curtail credit to its customers , forcing them to pay more cash up front .
It wo n't buy as much from suppliers or invest in upgrading its operations .
And it may have to cut its workforce , or at least postpone expanding it .
Both struggling and growing companies feel the squeeze .
" Bank capital is the lubricant that allow them to run their operations , " said Amiyatosh Purnanandam , assistant professor of finance at the University of Michigan .
" Even a profitable company can't undertake projects because it has no money . "
Demise not imminent
Other experts , however , say that most companies can get by for the time being .
Credit lines , they point out , usually last for at least a year so banks can't start pulling them willy - nilly unless the terms are broken .
And business can better survive a credit squeeze than a major downturn in consumer spending , which has yet to materialize .
" It 's not the disaster they are making it out to be , " said Amir Sufi , assistant professor of finance at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business .
Some companies , meanwhile , are coming up with inventive ways to circumvent the funding freeze .
Take Drew Greenblatt , president of Marlin Steel Wire Products in Baltimore .
He recently asked his bank to add $ 175,000 to his line of credit so he could purchase steel for two large customer orders .
The bank said he could get the funding , but only if he first put $ 175,000 into a certificate of deposit .
" We can get the money but the terms are so silly it just does n't make sense , " he said .
" It 's very frustrating . "
So instead , Greenblatt is demanding more cash from customers in advance .
Those clients with average credit ratings now have to put down a 50 % deposit on their orders , whereas two months ago they did n't have to pay anything upfront .
" We 're trying to make sure what 's happening in the credit markets does n't impact us , " Greenblatt said .
" We will be able to ratchet up sales and not have to deal with the bank . "
Two soldiers serving as security guards at a facility used by the Navy 's elite commando unit were indicted on Thursday on charges of racially - motivated aggravated assault .
The two are accused of attacking a group of Israeli Druze youths at an Atlit beachfront two weeks ago .
According to the indictment , one of the soldiers called out : " They are Arabs , they must die " during the attack .
Two other soldiers from their unit , who also took part in the attack , were indicted on charges of aggravated assault .
The altercation occurred on July 19th .
According to the indictment filed by the Military Prosecution , two of the soldiers left their base while drunk , with the intent of seeking out Arab visitors at the beachfront neighboring the base .
Several Israelis of Druze descent were at the beach at the time , one of them a Border Guard officer .
The soldiers approached one of the civilians and asked if he and his friends were Arabs .
Upon receiving a negative answer , the soldiers suddenly yelled out " There are Arabs here . "
They then attacked the Border Guard officer , who tried to flee towards the base .
At this point two of the soldiers ' friends stepped out and also began beating the officer , using sticks and , at one point , the butt of their M16 assault rifles .
Even after the incident was over , the defendants said " all Arabs should be killed . "
As a result of the grievous assault , the Border Guard officer required medical attention and a week 's time
to recuperate .
The indictment filed to the Haifa military court also includes charges of the illegal use of a weapon , as two of the defendants used their personal rifles to beat the victim .
One of the defendants is also accused of hurling rocks towards one of the Druze women who was at the beach along with her daughter while screaming " Arabs , Arabs . "
The Military Prosecution has requested to extend the arrest of all four defendants until the end of all legal proceedings against them .

September 17 , 2008 : Bullfrog vs Sparrow
Either the sparrow does n't know the frog is there , or does n't know the danger .
The bird seems very much unconcerned .
Or maybe it figures things out at the last moment ...
... and moves to a higher perch , but it 's not far enough away .
The frog leaps ,
And faster than a photographer , he has the bird and drags it to its death .
Do n't chew with your mouth open !
It 's rude .
Burrrp oh pardon me .
What ?
Am I the only one that had no idea things like this EVER happened ?
That is crazy and scary .
I wonder if sparrow feathers do to frogs what corn does to me ?
Amazing sequence .
Nom nom nom ...

I have n't seen that happen , but I did see a snapping turtle grab a pretty large duck and pull it under the water once .
That was cool .
Is it only me that finds it a leetle scary that ' Toad posted this series of pics ?
fish will eat bugs that sit on the surface of the water .
Sharks eat birds that are floating around in the water .
That frog was hungry !
Its things like this that make me glad humans have opposable thumbs and can use tools .
Like BBQ grilles .

Eeeeeuw
That 's like a pelican eating pigeons .
I heard somewhere that if frogs were the size if cows humans would 've never walked the earth .
Yeah ... they would have been running .
Err , ok , I may be weird , but its soooooo cute how he is using his little hands to stuff the birdie in his mouth
Quote : dar512 Originally Posted by Must have been tasty .

Who would figure , right ?
However , I 'm not surprised .
Almost in the same vein as a snake eating an egg .
Looks a bit like that .
" Pirates of the Amphibian - The End of Jack Sparrow "
Um , hello ?
Gross ?
I HATE these creepy - crawly , slimey , jumping things !
( no offense , O Great ' Toad )
It distresses me to see a cute , fluffy animal get eaten by a horrid , slimey , reptilian one .
It does n't seem fair , somehow .
In an evolutionary sort of way , the cute should survive and the yucky be damned .
Also --- if you do eat frogs ' legs , are n't you obliged to fit said frog up with a mini wheelchair ?
Seems like a lot to go thru just to eat some gross shite .

Hey !
Anyone else see the bait scattered around on those leaves to sucker that poor bird in ?
Good observation !
Looks like cornbread .
Where does a toad get cornbread ?
He pulled it off the table when he took his damn legs back ...
GO FROG !!!
wow , I had no idea frogs ate birds .
cool
hi all ,
im sure the only person who knows 100 % for sure how this photo series came about is the photographer , but i have noticed this :
1. i agree that there seems to be bird - bait of some kind present in the first image .
2. the ( unposted , but still present on the server ) image frogsparrow3.jpg ( http://cellar.org/2008/frogsparrow3.jpg) seems to show a sparrow in flight away from the toad ( or frog , im not sure ) .
draw your own conclusions , but it seems odd to me .
misfire , different bird , happened before " lunch " , bird enroute to landing ....
good catch boli , welcome to the cellar .

TPM Reader JM not happy with McCain ’s sleazy campaign …
The sex ed ad is literally worse than the Willie Horton ad , because at least the Horton story was true .
But the bill Obama supported actually did the reverse of what McCain claims – it did n’t mandate more sex ed for anybody , it tried to toughen up existing classes by teaching the risks of STDs .
The bill did n’t glorify sex , it highlighted the dangers of sex .
It ’s the most old fashioned sex ed there is : scaring kids straight .
So now even THAT is anti-family ?
Calling this “ perverse ” is a good first step , but the lie here deserves much , much more .
It ’s the disgusting act of a candidate who cares more about scaring people with lies than warning kids about the dangers of early sexual activity .
Anyone who would oppose such
warnings is an objective supporter of unprotected , unsafe underage sex .
So throw back the slime with a truthful attack :
It ’s McCain who wants more unsafe teenage sex , McCain who wants more kids to get STDs , McCain who wants more young people to get HIV .
McCain would rather win a political campaign than protect children from sexual diseases .
That ’s worse than shameful , worse than unpatriotic .
That ’s evil .
TPM Reader WS has some more to add …
Is everyone looking close enough at the McCain ad ?
I just watched the ad again .
There is one picture of children , all of them white ( I think – can you tell ? )
And the next image is of Obama , looking down and over his shoulder , with a smile on his face .
But since when do campaign ads show your opponent smiling ?
It ’s always a frown or a grimace , right ?
Not this time .
What ’s he smiling about ?
It ’s not subtle .
And it ’s not an ad about sex education .
A black man , sex , and children .
I think this ad is more odious than is being acknowledged .
Take another look at it !
Could n’t agree more .
But let ’s not be surprised .
McCain is pure sleaze .
Sound harsh ?
Sure .
But any other interpretation of the man at this point amounts to willful obliviousness or an embrace of the fantasy that he somehow does n’t know what his campaign is doing in his name .
This is the race he ’s decided to run .
Now what do you do about it ?
Pioneer recently announced a prototype set - top box that supports BitTorrent streaming .
The device already caught the attention of the BBC , as it opens up the possibility for TV - networks to offer their content via the Internet without having to spend millions of dollars on bandwidth bills .
The new device from Pioneer R&D is still in the prototype phase , but it has the potential to change the future of TV .
It is developed within the P2P - Next project , which is sponsored by the European Union , and includes partners such as the BBC and other TV - broadcasters .
The P2P technology inside the box is Open Source software , and allows the user to stream live content via BitTorrent ( picture here , via NTV ) .
Broadcasters will be able to stream to thousands of people , using around the same amount of bandwidth they would use to stream to one or two people .
Recent tests have shown that it ’s possible to offer high quality video via BitTorrent , which might change how on - demand TV is broadcast .
During a tutorial session at the P2P 2008 conference , Mark from Pioneer presented the new device , and said : “ By leveraging the next generation of P2P networking technology , Pioneer is taking steps to bring scalable TV broadcasting and vast on - demand media collections into the Living room . ”
The device is 4th generation P2P , which means that it does n’t use central servers to distribute or moderate the content .
Pioneer , nevertheless , made it clear that it will only be possible to access legitimate content with their box “ Access to a vast range of on - demand content and broadcast TV in High Definition over the Open Internet is becoming more believable with the integration of 4G P2P technologies into consumer devices , ” Mark said .
Worth mentioning , is that the box runs on a 266MHz processor with just 128 MByte of RAM .
By doing so , Pioneer has set a new standard for what a low - cost processor can deliver using BitTorrent .
Several European TV broadcasters are watching the project closely , and we expect to see some consumer trials with this new BitTorrent box in the future .
Rick over at the Silicon Florist Blog reports that OSCON wo n't be back in Portland next summer .
So ends a six - year run for the state 's only really major high - tech conference , which will be held in the Silicon Valley in July '09 .
It 's a big blow to Portland 's rep as an open source capital .
I asked O'Reilly Media , which puts on the event , what happened .
Here 's what Gina Blaber replied :
OSCON drew about 2,000 attendees annually , which made it among the biggest -- if not the biggest -- national conferences held annually in Portland .
" They needed a change in scenery to boost their attendance and get people excited , " said Deborah Wakefield , spokeswoman for Travel Portland .
" They 'll definitely be back .
They really like Portland , and they think Portland 's a mecca for open source . "
Well , sort of .
Portland 's still got Linus , open source heavyweights IBM and Intel , along with a cluster of startups that rely on open source technology .
But Oregon has lost both OSDL and , now , OSCON .
So we 're definitely closer to the fringe than we have been in a long time .
Spain ( TGW ) – Researchers in Spain have developed a new material that can absorb infrared light , in contrast to today ’s solar cells which only absorb visible light .
Because infrared light makes up half of the sun ’s output that reaches the Earth , current solar cells that can only absorb visible light have a theoretical absorption limit of 40 % , and only 30 % in practice .
The new material , because it can capture both types of light , has a theoretical limit of 63 % .
Researchers led by Perla Wahnon added titanium and vanadium into a conventional semiconductor , giving the material its special properties .

On Saturday , September 13 , 2008 , single payer advocates from across New York will meet in Albany to form a new statewide organization .
Our aim : to build an unbeatable movement for a single payer public system that would fully fund comprehensive health care , including prescription drugs , for all .
We invite all single - payer supporters to join us !
Private insurance has no legitimate role to play in the care of patients .
We believe it must be replaced by a public program of health financing .
Under a single - payer healthcare system , we 'll spend our healthcare dollars on care , not on bureaucratic waste , profit - making and corporate gain .
Our grassroots movement has gained momentum in 2008 .
Healthcare - NOW and other groups organized a nationwide protest on June 19 in support of single - payer healthcare .
The U.S. Conference of Mayors , the New York State Assembly , and a growing number of unions and central labor bodies have all endorsed HR 676 , the National Health Insurance Act .
New studies found that a majority of physicians support national health insurance .
And there is renewed support for single - payer among important groups like the League of Women Voters , the Unitarian Universalist Association and the Presbyterian Church USA .
Looking ahead , healthcare will continue to be a central issue in the presidential election .
And New York State , with a new governor and a changing Senate , has initiated an official evaluation and discussion of proposals for universal healthcare .
Now is the time to strengthen grassroots activism in support of a single national , publicly - financed healthcare plan .
Already a wide diversity of groups and individuals across New York are working for HR 676 , and also for a New York state - based single payer system .
We have worked together spontaneously , organically , and successfully .
We also work with many other groups that promote " universal healthcare " or " affordable healthcare , " but not necessarily single payer .
We are appreciative of their efforts .
But the evidence is convincing that single payer reform is crucial for our state and our nation .
A formal statewide grassroots coalition will allow us to share resources , local news , publications , speakers and more .
We have much to learn from one another - and from other successful state - based single payer organizations .
Together we can build a vigorous single payer voice in every county in New York State — and , ultimately , a new healthcare system .
Please join us !

An early invention by Albert Einstein has been rebuilt by scientists at Oxford University who are trying to develop an environmentally friendly refrigerator that runs without electricity .
Modern fridges are notoriously damaging to the environment .
They work by compressing and expanding man-made greenhouse gases called freons - far more damaging that carbon dioxide - and are being manufactured in increasing numbers .
Sales of fridges around the world are rising as demand increases in developing countries .
Now Malcolm McCulloch , an electrical engineer at Oxford who works on green technologies , is leading a three - year project to develop more robust appliances that can be used in places without electricity .
Einstein refrigerator
His team has completed a prototype of a type of fridge patented in 1930 by Einstein and his colleague , the Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard .
It had no moving parts and used only pressurised gases to keep things cold .
The design was partly used in the first domestic refrigerators , but the technology was abandoned when more efficient compressors became popular in the 1950s .
That meant a switch to using freons .
Einstein and Szilard 's idea avoids the need for freons .
It uses ammonia , butane and water and takes advantage of the fact that liquids boil at lower temperatures when the air pressure around them is lower .
' If you go to the top of Mount Everest , water boils at a much lower temperature than it does when you 're at sea level and that 's because the pressure is much lower up there , ' said McCulloch .
At one side is the evaporator , a flask that contains butane .
' If you introduce a new vapour above the butane , the liquid boiling temperature decreases and , as it boils off , it takes energy from the surroundings to do so , ' says McCulloch .
' That 's what makes it cold . '
Pressurised gas fridges based around Einstein 's design were replaced by freon - compressor fridges partly because Einstein and Szilard 's design was not very efficient .
But McCulloch thinks that by tweaking the design and replacing the types of gases used it will be possible to quadruple the efficiency .
He also wants to take the idea further .
The only energy input needed into the fridge is to heat a pump , and McCulloch has been working on powering this with solar energy .
' No moving parts is a real benefit because it can carry on going without maintenance .
This could have real applications in rural areas , ' he said .
McCulloch's is not the only technology to improve the environmental credentials of fridges .
Engineers working at a Cambridge - based start - up company , Camfridge , are using magnetic fields to cool things .
' Our fridge works , from a conceptual point of view , in a similar way [ to gas compressor fridges ] but instead of using a gas we use a magnetic field and a special metal alloy , ' said managing director Neil Wilson .
' When the magnetic field is next to the alloy , it 's like compressing the gas , and when the magnetic field leaves , it 's like expanding the gas . '
He added : ' This effect can be seen in rubber bands - when you stretch the band it gets hot , and when you let the band contract it gets cold . '
Doug Parr , chief scientist at Greenpeace UK , said creating greener fridges was hugely important .
' If you look at developing countries , if they 're aspiring to the lifestyles that we lead , they 're going to require more cooling - whether that 's air conditioning , food cooling or freezing .
Putting in place the technologies that are both low greenhouse - gas refrigerants and low energy use is critical .'
McCulloch 's fridge is still in its early stages .
' It 's very much a prototype ; this is nowhere near commercialised , ' he said .
' Give us another month and we 'll have it working . '
The slide in house prices will continue for at least three years and crush the value of a home by almost 50 % in real terms , according to a key index of property price futures .
Indications from futures trading on long term property prices shows that the average UK home will recover its current value only in 2017 .
By the end of this year prices will be down by 10 % and by a further 10.5 % in 2009 , according to the index .
Prices will keep dropping through 2010 and cut values by 23.5 % when they hit rock bottom in 2011 .
House prices will then begin a slow climb back to current market values over a period of about six years .
If an average retail price inflation rate of 4 % is included in the calculation and in addition the 8 % drop in prices over the last eight months already registered by the Halifax index , the fall in values over almost four years will reach 47.5 % in real terms .
The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , Lord Oakeshott , said the figures revealed that property investors had little confidence in the market and were predicting steep and prolonged falls in prices .
" This government says this housing depression will be different from the early 1990s .
Yes , that 's right .
It will be worse . "
When not attacking government policy in the Lords , Oakeshott invests in property on behalf of pension funds through his investment vehicle Olim .
He says he has watched the index steadily fall over recent weeks .
On Friday it " fell off a cliff " after the Halifax published its latest house price survey .
Halifax said the value of a home fell by 2.4 % in May , the seventh month in the past eight when prices have fallen .
The May figure spooked investors , who said prices were now falling more rapidly than at any time since the early 90s property crash .
House buyers benefited from low prices until 1995 when values began to pick up .
Last week an economic consultancy , the Centre for Economics and Business Research , predicted that in 2008 almost 15,000 estate agents would lose their jobs .
It said real estate output will also decline during the year by 3 % in real terms , as the drop in mortgage approvals and housing transactions take its toll .
The slide is also hitting mortgage brokers , illustrated by John Charcol , which last week announced job cuts and made Katie Tucker , product specialist and one of the public faces of the broker , redundant .
The firm 's chief executive , Ian Kennedy , is also reported to be in discussion with chairman John Garfield - one of the founders of the business - about his future .
In January , the broker announced it was putting itself up for sale .
But no buyer turned up and instead its founders were expected to inject more funds into the business .
The residential property futures market is based on the Halifax monthly house price index , published by the bank .
It is an - over - the - counter market designed for banks , pension funds , insurance companies and housebuilders to trade on the future values of property .
Tradition Property , a City - based property broker , operates a derivatives futures index based on the Halifax figures .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Jim Manzi over at National Review ‘s The Corner calls the House Republicans ’ actions today “ Irresponsible Folly ” and writes :
Well , apparently the House Republicans have decided to run a neat little experiment to test the actual odds of the current financial crisis turning into another Depression in the absence of a bailout plan .
Kathryn Jean Lopez – also at The Corner – tries to spin this as proof of the Democrats ’ lack of unity and suggests this would n’t happen under a Republican Congress .
Other Republicans are apparently attempting to blame their votes against the only plan to stave off another Great Depression on a few comments made by Speaker Nancy Pelosi in her speech to introduce the bill .
Marc Ambinder asks : “ Where were you when the world economy collapsed ? ”
That might be overdoing it a little .
But not by much – seeing as the Dow is down over 5 % as we speak and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down almost 7 % each .
Regardless – it seems certain that McCain failed in this – and deserves a good deal of blame for this failure .
The Democrats gave up a lot in order to win over some Republicans – but now it looks as if they ’ll have to ditch them and pass a much more left - friendly bill .
That leaves them without political cover on an issue that is n’t politically popular .
But it is the only responsible thing to do , which is why I have confidence the Democrats will pass something .
The Republicans today have proved that they will place ideology above their country .
They have proved that they will place politics above their country .
Whether they voted against the bill because of their fundamentalist belief in the power of markets or because they wanted to be on the short - term popular side of a major issue is unclear .
Presumably , it is a combination of both .
But they have proved that they are not willing to be grown - ups and accept the pragmatic best alternative when there are no good options .
They do not take responsibility for any portion of the chaos which deregulation has contributed to here .
They have not proposed some better , other plan – they have instead just been oppositional – representing the final deathblow to conservatism as a governing ideology .
This is the latest in a series of events – where conservatives have placed ideology above country , and ignored the pragmatic solutions to hard reality .
From Iraq – where ideological certainty led to insanely rosy projections of the post - war period ; to Iran – where diplomacy was rejected out - of - hand , and Iran ’s offer to cut back on their nuclear program as part of a comprehensive discussion of US - Iran issues in 2003 was ignored ; to the constant prescription of tax cuts in the face of mounting deficits ; to the opposition to any pragmatic solution to the immigration problem .
It ’s not that there were n’t good reasons to oppose this bill .
It ’s that the Republicans were unwilling to take the basic responsibility needed to govern .
Barack Obama meanwhile , says the bailout will go through .
Not because he likes it – but because , as distasteful as it is , it ’s necessary .
As Obama said , speaking in the midst of a storm yesterday , “ The skies look cloudy and it ’s dark .
And you think the rains will never pass .
But these too will pass : a brighter day will come . ”
It ’s not the rhetoric that matters as much as the tone .
Obama ’s calm , measured , steady public presence , even in the midst of a storm , contrasts with McCain ’s hysteric , dramatic , volatile one .

Researchers have discovered new strains of Pseudomonasbacteria that feed on the PET plastic used in drink bottles , and turn it into a more valuable , biodegradable form of plastic .
The discovery suggests a way to keep billions of pounds of discarded plastic out of landfills ; a 2006 study [ pdf ] found that less than 25 percent of PET plastic is currently recycled because the industry does n't have enough use for the end product .
Getting high - quality material — such as plastics suitable for packaging food or beverages —- back out of recycled plastic is more expensive than making virgin PET , so most plastic bottles are recycled into lower - grade , and less valuable , plastic .
But there ’s only so much demand for lower - grade plastics , says microbiologist and coauthor Kevin O’ Connor ....
“ The problem is that the market [ for recycled PET ] is saturated ” [ Science News ] .
The researchers knew that heating PET plastic in the absence of oxygen produces a substance called terephthalic acid , which some bacteria feed on .
They also know that other bacteria produce a high quality plastic called PHA that could have numerous applications in medicine -- because PHA plastic is biodegradable , it 's ideally suited for sutures , wound dressings , and various implants .
The researchers hoped to find a bacteria that fed on terephthalic acid and produced PHA plastic , so they collected soil bacteria from a bottle processing plant .
As reported in their paper , published in Environmental Science and Technology [ subscription required ] , after
48 hours they screened each culture for PHA .
Three cultures , all similar to known strains of Pseudomonas , accumulated detectable quantities of the valuable plastic .
The next step is to improve the efficiency of the process , says O'Connor .

Kucinich proposes ' Truth and Reconciliation Commission ' to assess Bush admin RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 10 , 2008
Print This Email This UPDATE : Kucinich tells RAW : Seek truth , not ' fake political unity ' Rep. Dennis Kucinich , whose move to impeach President Bush is destined to remain in stasis until the president leaves office , is shifting his attention beyond his specific allegations against Bush towards goals to repair the damage done once a new administration is in the White House .
" Before the Congress adjourns , I will bring forth a new proposal for the establishment of a National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation , which will have the power to compel testimony and gather official documents to reveal to the American people not only the underlying deception which has divided us , but in that process of truth - seeking set our nation on a path of reconciliation , " Kucinich said in prepared remarks to be delivered during a Capitol Hill press conference Wednesday .
Kucinich , the Ohio Democrat and onetime presidential candidate , has been among Bush 's harshest and most consistent critics .
His repeated calls to impeach the president and Vice President Dick Cheney led the House Judiciary Committee to hold a Friday morning hearing on Bush 's abuses of power earlier this summer .
Dozens of witnesses , including Kucinich , testified , but the hearings seemed to be more about giving Kucinich a forum than actually building a case around his impeachment resolution .
On Wednesday , Kucinich also was expected to announce that 2 million people had signed petitions supporting his impeachment drive .
RAW STORY will attend Kucinich 's press conference on his Truth and Reconciliation proposal at 1 p.m. Wednesday .
This story will be updated following the conference .
This is a guest post by John Simonetta , owner of ProformaGreen , an eco-friendly promotional items consultancy .
John ’s blogs are designed to keep us up to date on the “ greening ” of his industry .
There has been a growing conversation in the promotional items market about items made from corn plastic .
For us this conversation normally comes up when clients debate the pros and cons of corn plastic mugs like those offered by the manufacturer QuickPoint .
The argument normally goes like this .
Pro : Corn plastic mugs are safe and sturdy .
They cost less than mugs of similar weight made from petroleum plastic .
The QuickPoint products and others are union - made in the U.S.A from U.S. corn , therefore they are not shipped from overseas , which reduces their footprint , and are made by workers making U.S. wages .
They are biodegradable .
Con : Using corn for plastic is believed to reduce the amount of corn in the global food chain .
Contributing to a variety of social ills including food shortages and when combined with the increasing use of corn for ethanol , driving up the price of all sorts of goods .
of
So like any other promotional items , think about your audience before recommending these products .
What side of the argument are they on ?
It would be great if people that know more about this subject could comment to this blog !
I like the mugs , most of our clients like them and the fact they are microwave safe and can take up to 160 degrees .
Here is Q&A QuickPoint released about the issue .
Q : How is corn converted to plastic ?
A : Corn kernels are removed from the cob and soaked in a combination of sulfur dioxide and water .
Corn swells and softens with the mild acidity loosening the gluten bonds of corn to release starch .
The corn is ground and starch is separated and processed into sugar .
This is fermented to create lactic acid into small pellets of PLA , the basic building block for plastic .
Q : What other products use corn plastic in their manufacturing ?
A : Everything from plastic eating utensils to T - shirts .
Common uses are deli food packaging , plastic wrap , and clothing fiber .
Q : Are corn plastics ecology friendly ?
A : Certainly .
While coming from an easily renewable source , corn plastics also can be composted .
A plastic bag made from corn could decompose in about a month .
A similar oil based bag could take centuries to decompose .
Q : Are corn plastics competitive in price with petroleum - based plastics ?
A : Extremely , Corn plastics can remain competitive with oil prices in the mid $ 20 ’s per barrel .
Q : Is there enough corn grown in the U.S. to handle potential demand ?
A : Certainly .
In fact U.S. corn yields are increasing by 5 billion pounds a year .
Q : Have there been large users of corn plastic items ?
A : Yes , Coca - Cola used 500,000 thin walled disposable cups at the Salt Lake City Olympics .
Instead of a large trash problem , used cups were simply composted .
( see my post on GreenWare cups ) Q : How does Quickpoint ’s Corn Plastic Mugs compare to their standard petroleum based plastic mugs ?
A : Quick Point ’s Corn Mugs are slightly heavier in weight about 16 % more than their standard counterparts .
Corn mugs cannot be molded in clear or translucent colors .
Both mugs have excellent thermal qualities because of their thick walled construction .
Corn mugs are priced about 7 % to 10 % LESS than standard mugs .
For more details on the mugs from Quickpoint take a look at their website .

The WSJ this morning put up an article about corporate death benefits .
It turns out that the grossly overcompensated American CEO still lingers in our midst , despite the challenges that have destroyed quite a few of his kin .
The article reports that some executives , when they sign their hiring contracts , acquire fat severance packages , vested shares , a continuation of salaries , bonuses , and even “ supercharged pensions ” –after they die .
According to Reuters , “ Compensation critics call the practice the ultimate in pay that is not based on performance . ”
No kidding .
Here are a couple of postmortem benefits signed on by C - level executives :
Eugene Isenberg , CEO of Nabors Industries , gets a post - croak severance payment of more than $ 260 million .
.
The CEO of Shaw Group , whom the article did n’t mention by name , will rake in more than $ 17 million with his cold , dead hands in exchange for not competing with the company after he dies .
But–how can he compete after he ’s dead ?
Companies defend themselves by saying the pay will be going to the executives ’ ( very wealthy ) families in case of an unexpected death .
These additional benefits are just part of a sophisticated pay package intended to cover all possibilities .
In many cases , compensation attorneys tell the Journal , death benefits are really a form of deferred compensation , structured partly for estate - planning or tax reasons , and that the packages help to keep executives from leaving .
Sounds like companies are stuffing money into every imaginable crevasse in order to retain talent .
It just so happens that one of those money stashes is located in the afterlife .
“ If the executive is dead , you ’re certainly not retaining them , ” Steven Hall , an executive - pay consultant in New York , tells the Journal .
Nope , but you are buying off their families .
The next time I write a business contract , I ’d like to include a pre-mortem clause of $ 17 million .
And a lavish burial in case I do die , with Prada funeral favors for my friends and family .
On the serious side–does anyone know if this is actually ethical ?

PS to Everyone : I would love comments on this subjects .
About 3 years ago , I chanced upon a growing interest in the year “ 2012 ” .
Back then , it was rather small and confined , but for some reason seem to elicit many a number of responses from spiritualist on the internet .
The idea was , should I say is , founded on the premise that the ancient Mayan civilization calendar which is thousands of years old and is supposed to be one of the most accurate in our present day world is coming to an end .
A no brainer as that ’s part of the function of calendars .
Only this calendar came with a caveat – When the calendar ends , so will our world .
Now , this was 3 years ago in 2005 .
Today in 2008 , I have watched this movement steadily and exponentially gain strength .
As you read this , its no longer confined to spiritual spheres ; I ’m seeing it being written in non-spiritual blogs .
It ’s caught on like some new fancy fangled religion spreading from some hole , and now , there are people actually worried about the end of the world .
I kid you not .
Google 2012 and just watch “ Doomsday ” , “ Mayan ” , “ End of world ” drop that it has birthed , believe this , Books , Seminars , Talks and heck , even websites on how “ To Survive 2012 ” .
Normally , I would n’t bother a secondd of my life with this .
But with the momentum this is gaining , I now wonder seriously , are we deluding ourselves ?
I have reservations about all this if for anything , it just sounds like another marketing hullabaloo .
Oh yes , there are spiritual fads ( to any non-spiritual reader ) and in these days , there ’s a ready stream of neophytes who will believe it .
This could just be another one of them .
Here ’s my contentions :1) Interpretations : This thousand year old ( century maybe ) is being interpreted 21st century style .
This alone is a big chunk of my disagreement .
We ’re looking at what the Mayans did in say 51 bc and judging from our POV of today .
How are we so sure the mayans did n’t consider each calendar as a world with certain characteristics , and when this calendar comes to an end , so will this world ?
And a new one world will start the next day ?
Thing is , there are no ancient Mayans to ask ; so we ’re banging it as we go .2 ) What ’s going to happen
No one can give a definitive answer .
Or even for that matter , a same one .
One says the Earth will end .
Another , natural disaster .
Yet another says its not physical but Universal energies will change still another , Energetic changes where those not of higher consciousness will be left behind .
Not withstanding another …
… See where this is going ?
3 ) Another Y2K .
Remember the Y2K ?
Remember how doomsayers were going around spouting how computer time misalignment was going to plunge the world into chaos ?
To cause banking systems to lose our money ?
To return us to the stone age ?
To stock up on food n ration ?
Remember how we fell for it ?
Nothing happened and when Monday morning came , we all went about our business like …. well … any other day .
With the amount of Lectures , Seminars , Books , Talks , yada yada that ’s coming out about the 2012 end of world , it just has all the markings of another overblown inconsequential issue .
If there is one in the first place .
Now I ’m not telling you not to believe it ; that ’s your prerogative .
But if you look at closely , something smells .

" If nuclear power is the answer , it must have been a pretty stupid question , " went an oft - cited slogan of the 1970s environmental movement .
But the question was not stupid , and it is even less so today when the challenge is even blunter : how are we going to provide for our energy needs in a way that does not destroy , via global warming , the capacity of our planet to support life ?
The hard truth is that if nuclear power is not at least part of the answer , then answering that challenge is going to be very difficult indeed .
Unfortunately , just by writing the sentence above , I will already have prompted many readers to switch off .
Being anti-nuclear is an article of faith ( and I use that word intentionally ) for many people in today 's environmental movement and beyond , just as it was during the 1970s .
That the Green Party , Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace have held the same position on the subject for 30 years could show admirable consistency - but it could also be evidence of dogmatic closed - mindedness .
When I first broached the issue in these pages three years ago , the reaction was extraordinary .
A close acquaintance sent me a tearful email saying that I had " destroyed " her motivation for environmental campaigning .
Other friends here in Oxford accused me - jokingly , of course - of having formed a romantic liaison with BNFL 's spokeswoman .
Just last week , after tackling the subject once again , I received a one - line email from a well - known environmentalist accusing me of having " done a considerable disservice to the cause of combating climate change " .
So why does the nuclear issue evoke such strong reactions ?
For answers , I think we need to look to nuclear 's past , when today 's entrenched positions were first formed .
Civil nuclear power began life as a heavily state - subsidised industry largely designed to produce plutonium for bombs .
Civil nuclear power was part of the military - industrial complex and shrouded in secrecy .
An association with the mushroom cloud has tainted the nuclear industry ever since - and clearly continues to be an issue in countries such as Iran , North Korea and Pakistan .
Then there is radiation .
Most people are terrified of radiation precisely because it is invisible , making it all the more threatening , and because of its potential to cause cancer and genetic deformities .
( Many other cancer - causing agents such as food or smoke seem innocuous by comparison . )
Nuclear accidents and near - meltdowns - such as Three Mile Island in 1979 - provoke scary headlines throughout the media , as did popular treatments such as the film The China Syndrome ( released , by an extraordinary stroke of luck for the film - makers , just 12 days before Three Mile Island ) , in which a sinister nuclear cabal covers up evidence of an accident .
It is undeniable that nuclear fission generates radioactive by - products , some of which will inevitably enter the environment .
It is also undeniable that exposure to radiation increases the risk of cancer ( though radiation can also be employed to treat cancers ) .
But it is the level of risk that counts , and here the story is less fearsome than many would have us believe .
Take Three Mile Island , which exposed local populations to one millirem of radiation on average .
This equates to roughly what we all receive from natural sources ( cosmic rays and naturally occurring radioactive elements in the ground ) every four days .
The number of deaths from Three Mile Island - the worst civil nuclear accident ever in a western country , and one that ended the US nuclear programme ( not a single reactor has been built since ) - is therefore officially estimated to be zero .
Even Chernobyl , surely the worst - imaginable case for a nuclear disaster , was far less deadly than most people think .
In the immediate aftermath of the explosion , 28 people died due to acute radiation sickness - all firemen and power plant workers , some of whom had been exposed to radiation doses as high as one million millirems .
By comparison , 167 men were killed during the Piper Alpha disaster on a North Sea oil rig in 1988 .
But it is the long - term effects from Chernobyl that tend to scare people most .
In a 2006 report , Greenpeace claimed that " 60,000 people have additionally died in Russia because of the Chernobyl accident , and estimates of the total death toll for the Ukraine and Belarus could reach another 140,000 " .
These figures , if correct , would make Chernobyl one of the worst single man-made disasters of the last century .
But are they correct ?
The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation reports 4,000 cases of thyroid cancer in children and young people in Belarus , Russia and Ukraine , but very few deaths ( thyroid cancer is mostly treatable ) .
Indeed , it concludes , " There is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure 20 years after the accident " , and no evidence of any increase in cancer or leukaemia among exposed populations .
The World Health Organisation concludes that while a few thousand deaths may be caused over the next 70 years by Chernobyl 's radioactive release , this number " will be indiscernible from the background of overall deaths in the large population group " .
Without wishing to downplay the tragedy for the victims - especially the 300,000 people who were evacuated permanently - the explosion has even been good for wildlife , which has thrived in the 30 km exclusion zone .
A plentiful supply of free fuel
One way of statistically assessing the safety of nuclear power versus other technologies is to use the measure of deaths per gigawatt - year .
This technique is cited by Cambridge University 's Professor David MacKay in his book Sustainable Energy - Without the Hot Air ( available free on the web ) , and shows that in Europe , nuclear and wind power are the safest technologies ( about 0.1 death per GWy ) , while oil , coal and biomass the most dangerous ( above 1 per GWy ) .
A focus on statistics is also useful when assessing the financial costs of nuclear power .
The high price for nuclear waste disposal and decommissioning - with a hefty chunk always payable from public funds - is surely one of the environmental lobby 's strongest arguments , particularly if any subsidy from taxpayers means taking money away from investment in renewables .
Helen Caldicott 's book Nuclear Power is
Not the Answer discusses the finances of nuclear under a chapter subheaded " Socialised Electricity " , quoting figures for nuclear 's subsidy in the US over recent decades of $ 70 bn .
To make a direct cost comparison , the International Energy Agency in a 2005 study looked at life - cycle costs for all power sources - including construction costs , operations , fuel and decommissioning - and concluded that nuclear was the cheapest option , followed by coal , wind and gas .
But how about nuclear power 's potential contribution to mitigating global warming ?
One persistent myth is that once construction and uranium mining are taken into account , nuclear is no better than fossil fuels .
However , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , total life - cycle greenhouse - gas emission per unit of electricity is about 40g CO2 - equivalent per kilowatt - hour , " similar to those for renewable energy sources " .
But why not ditch nuclear and focus only on renewables , as the greens suggest ?
MacKay calculates that even if we covered the windiest 10 per cent of the UK with wind turbines , put solar panels on all south - facing roofs , implemented strong energy efficiency measures across the economy , built offshore wind turbines across an area of sea two - thirds the size of Wales , and fully exploited every other conceivable source of renewables ( including wave and tidal power ) , energy production would still not match current consumption .
This is rather different to Britain being the " Saudi Arabia of wind power " as many in the environmental movement are fond of asserting .
Indeed , MacKay concludes that we will need to import renewable electricity from other countries - primarily from solar farms in the North African desert - or choose nuclear , or both .
Indeed , it is vital to stress the neither I nor MacKay nor any credible expert suggests a choice between renewables and nuclear : the sensible conclusion is that we need both , soon , and on a large scale if we are to phase out coal and other fossil fuels as rapidly as the climate needs .
As MacKay told me : " We need to get building . "
The UK's Sustainable Development Commission , in its 2006 report on nuclear power , argued that new plants should be ruled out until the existing waste problem could be solved .
But what if a new generation of nuclear plants could be designed that , instead of producing more waste to leave as a toxic legacy for our grandchildren , actually generated energy by burning up existing waste stockpiles ?
This is the solution proposed by Tom Blees , a US - based writer , in his upcoming book Prescription for the Planet .
Blees focuses particularly on so - called fourth - generation nuclear technology - better known as fast - breeder reactors .
While conventional thermal reactors use less than 1 per cent of the potential energy in their uranium fuel , fast - breeders are 60 times more efficient , and can burn virtually all of the energy available in the uranium ore .
This gives these fourth - generation reactors a big advantage .
As Blees puts it : " Thus we have a prodigious supply of free fuel that is actually even better than free , for it is material that we are quite desperate to get rid of . "
Moreover , fast - breeder reactors can also run on the " depleted " uranium left behind by conventional reactors , and help reduce the proliferation threat by burning up plutonium stockpiles left over from decommissioned nuclear weapons .
Blees estimates that supplies of nuclear waste and depleted uranium are sufficient to " provide all the power needs of the entire planet for hundreds of years before we need to mine any more uranium " .
Although these reactors produce plutonium - which might be used for nuclear weapons , and could therefore pose a proliferation threat - weapons - grade material is never isolated in the fuel - cycle process , making fast - breeders less dangerous to international stability than conventional reactors , and relatively simple to inspect .
But what about the waste these reactors themselves produce ?
Since the by - products of fast - breeder reactors are highly radioactive , they have much shorter half - lives - rendering them inert in a couple of centuries , instead of the longer time over which conventional nuclear waste remains dangerous .
( Once again there is a powerful myth here - that high - level waste from reactors remains dangerous for enormous lengths of time .
Greenpeace states that " waste will remain dangerous for up to a million years " .
In fact , almost all waste will have decayed back to a level of radio activity less than the original uranium ore in less than a thousand years . )
Fourth - generation nu clear technology is also inherently safer than earlier designs .
The Integral Fast Reactor ( IFR ) , discussed at length by Blees , operates at atmospheric pressure , reducing the possibility of leaks and loss - of - coolant accidents .
It is also designed to be " walk - away safe " , meaning that if all operators stood up and left , the reactor would shut itself down automatically rather than overheat and suffer a meltdown .
So why , given the purported advantages in safety and fuel use , have fast - breeders not been developed commercially ?
The US Integral Fast Reactor programme was shut down in 1994 , possibly - Blees suggests - because of political pressure levied on the Clinton administration by anti-nuclear campaigners .
( Even so , fourth - generation nuclear power plants are being built in India , Russia , Japan and China . )
Ironically , the Clinton administration may have inadvertently killed off one of the most promising solutions to global warming in an attempt to please environmentalists .
Even if the decision were to be reversed immediately , 20 years has been lost .
It is worth remembering the contribution that nuclear power has already made to offsetting global warming : the world 's 442 operating nuclear reactors , which produce 16 per cent of global electricity , save 2.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year compared to coal , according to the IPCC .
Blees agrees that " the most pressing issue is to shut down all coal - fired power plants " and urges a " Manhattan Project - like " effort to convert the world 's non-renewable power to IFRs by the thousand .
This sounds daunting but it is not unprecedented :
France converted its power supply to 80 per cent nuclear in the space of just 25 years by building about six reactors a year .
An anti-nuclear report published by the Oxford Research Group in 2007 concluded that an additional 2,500 reactors would need to be built by 2075 to significantly mitigate global warming .
The report 's authors suggested that this was a " pipe - dream " .
But it sounds eminently achievable to me , given that it is only a five - times increase from today .
The question is this : are those who care about global warming prepared to reconsider their opposition to nuclear power in this new era ?
We are no longer living in the 1970s .
Today , the world is more threatened even than it was during the Cold War .
Only this time nuclear power - instead of being part of the problem - can be part of the solution .
A growing number of Republicans who rejected the president 's $ 700 billion bank bailout have a morning - after message for the White House : Go away until after Election Day .
That 's right , some of those who junked the plan to rescue bankers who went to the edge and further to dole out loans say there 's nothing that will make them switch their vote just a month before the election .
" The guys who voted ' no ' are happy today , " a key source tells me .
" They are happy they fulfilled their voters ' desire against a federal bailout . "
And those who had a green light before their names in the House chamber ?
" They are continuing to get pounded . "
So what is the nay - voters ' suggestion to the GOP leadership , already under attack by conservative members for forcing the vote ?
Put it off .
" A few are now thinking that no legislation may pass prior to the election , " says my insider .
" Let the markets fumble along .
We cannot see at this moment any movement by voters that they would tell their members who voted ' no ' to change their vote to ' yes . ' "
As Senator Biden prepares to face off against Governor Palin on Thursday night in the campaign 's lone vice presidential debate , Democratic strategists have a few words of advice for the lawmaker of Delaware : Ignore the Alaskan .

The Democratic vice - presidential nominee , Senator Biden , speaks at a rally September 28 .
Mr. Biden's 35 years in the Senate dwarf Ms. Palin 's single month of experience on the national stage , but Democrats are worried that his penchant for verbal missteps and his occasionally aggressive style could be a liability as he faces only the second woman to serve as a major party nominee for the vice presidency .
" His goal is to ignore Palin and focus on connecting with voters sitting in their living rooms by making clear he is indeed one of them  an uncommon , common man , " a Democratic strategist who served as an aide to Vice President Gore during the 2000 campaign , Christopher Lehane , said .
The two running mates will meet in St. Louis this week for what is perhaps the most eagerly anticipated vice presidential match - up in recent memory , and the debate is fraught with risk for both candidates .
After winning rave reviews for her debut speech at the Republican National Convention early in the month , Ms. Palin has struggled as she has come under increased scrutiny from the press .
Polls have shown voter concerns about her readiness for the job , and she has been widely derided in recent days for the nearly incomprehensible response she offered when CBS 's Katie Couric asked her to explain her claim that Alaska 's proximity to Russia and Canada gave her foreign policy experience .
Those stumbles have raised the stakes for Thursday 's debate , but Democrats are offering another reason why Mr. Biden should avoid trying to exploit Ms. Palin 's lack of experience  he may not need to .
" Let the facts , the records , and the ideas speak for themselves , and more than likely Governor Palin will expose herself as unqualified for the job , " a Democratic consultant , Daniel Gerstein , said .
" If he has the right tone , there 's no way he can lose this debate . "
Mr. Biden needs only to look to Senator Clinton 's Senate race in 2000 against Rick Lazio to see the perils of a male appearing overly confrontational with a female candidate .
During their debate , Mr. Lazio walked over to Mrs. Clinton 's podium to ask her to a sign a pledge against accepting so - called soft money campaign contributions .
The move backfired , as the Republican congressman looked as if he were physically intimidating the then - first lady .
" Debating with a woman is entirely different than anything you will ever do , " a Democratic consultant who worked for President Clinton 's re-election bid in 1996 , Hank Sheinkopf , said .
He said Mr. Biden needed to avoid doing anything that would appear " glowering " or " menacing " and would engender sympathy for Ms. Palin .
In a television interview yesterday , President Clinton also advised Mr. Biden against going after Ms. Palin directly .
Doing so , he said , would likely appeal only to voters already supporting Senator Obama .
" I do n't think he has to whack her , or should , " Mr. Clinton said on NBC 's " Meet the Press . "
" Everybody that really is upset about Sarah Palin because she 's too conservative or too Alaska or too this , that , or the other thing , they 're already for the Obama - Biden ticket . "
Both parties have already begun the traditional pre-debate efforts to lower expectations for their candidates and raise the bar for their opponents .
Mr. Obama 's campaign manager , David Plouffe , told reporters on a conference call Saturday that Ms. Palin was " a terrific debater , " judging from tapes of her performances during campaigns in Alaska .
" She has performed very , very well , " Mr. Plouffe said .
" She 's obviously a skilled speaker , so you know we 'll expect that she 'll give a great performance next Thursday . "
Republicans have highlighted Mr. Biden 's frequent gaffes , but have also touted his years in Washington as preparation for the debate .
One GOP aide said Mr. Biden has " spent his entire career debating in the Senate and building a reputation as one of the best . "
A close friend and adviser to Mr. McCain , Senator Graham of South Carolina , said criticism of Ms. Palin in the last week had been exaggerated , but he acknowledged that she had work to do on Thursday .
" She 's going to have to show she 's a valuable part of this team , that she 's capable of the job , that she shares John 's philosophy , " he said on " Fox News Sunday . "
Act of Free Choice ( directed by Mark Worth )
The so - called ``Act of Free Choice ' ' was a sham referendum held in 1969 to decide whether Indonesia should govern West Papua .
The small sample of indigenous West Papuans selected to vote were threatened with physical voilence if they voted against the Indonesian regime .
Of course , they ``voted '' to remain part of Indonesia .
To this day , on the basis of this UN - sanctioned farce , Indonesia holds West Papua .
This short film by the late Mark Worth ( 1958 - 2004 ) was a precursor to his outstanding documentary Land of the Morning Star and succinctly outlines the political history of West Papua .
Act of Free Choice is the title of David Bridie 's debut solo album and although the song " Act of Free Choice " was played live at Bridie 's shows , it was omitted from the album for " textural " reasons ( in other words , it did n't fit with the other tracks ) .
It later appeared on the five - track Act of Free Choice EP .

Raising West Papua ( 2003 )
This film begins where Act of Free Choice left off , then adds more detail of the struggle .
A video that gives a background to the situation in West Papua , reminding the viewer that despite human rights abuses by the Indonesian Government , the Papuan people continue to struggle for independence .
This video was produced in 2003 to raise awareness about the condition in West Papua .
It uses interviews from people based in Melbourne , combined with archival footage from a variety of sources to tell the story .
When this film was made , Australia was still ruled by the conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard and foreign minister Alexander Downer .
Howard 's government was defeated by the Australian Labor Party led by Kevin Rudd in late 2007 .
It remains to be seen if the new government alters support for Indonesian occupation of West Papua .
` West Papua ' -- George Telek
Telek is a legendary singer in Papua New Guinea .
" West Papua " expresses a yearning of people on both sides of the Papua New Guinea border for the West Papuan people to be free from Indonesian rule .
This recording was produced by David Bridie .
Footage is taken from Land of the Morning Star , made by Mark Worth .
This video ( plus others ) appears on the CD / DVD re-release of Tabaran by Not Drowning , Waving .

Australia is among the wealthiest countries in the world , and it ’s the sixth largest country by land size .
Do n’t be fooled by the size though , as interior is sparsely populated and most of the life is lived along the eastern and southern rim of the continent .
That means when you ’re planning a trip to Australia , you might need to cover a lot of space to see the wonders of Australia .
And boy are there wonders !
Australia is a country bursting with incredible wonders of the world : areas filled with one - of - a- kind biodiversity , scenic drives bursting with natural beauty , man made wonders soaring into the sky .
As the latest in our series of the Wonders of the World , we ’ll dive deep into seven unmissable spots in the Seven Wonders of Australia .
Kakadu National Park
Kakadu is the premier national park in Australia and offers some of the most stunning displays of wildlife you can find on the continent .
You can find a number of incredible animals , marsupials , and reptiles all over the park .
Plan on spotting saltwater crocodiles , kangaroos and wallabies , flying foxes , flatback turtles , river sharks , termites ( which are supremely cool in person ! ) , and any number of the parks 280 bird species .
Now let ’s talk about the natural beauty in Australia ’s Kakadu National Park .
All of this wildlife abundance has to life somewhere , and that ’s in large floodplains , estuaries and tidal flats , stone country , and so much more .
To top it all off , in addition to stunning rock outcrops and wildlife , Kakadu has some of the oldest aboriginal artwork in Australia .
Many of the rock drawings date back over 20,000 years .
Bonus : Kakadu was the location for many of the scenes from the movie Crocodile Dundee .
Uluru - Kata Tjuta National Park
Uluru ( Ayers Rock ) is probably the best known natural icon in Australia , and no list of the Seven Wonders of Australia could be complete without it .
Why does this incredible rock have that magnificent color ?
The iron content in the rock makes its colors change through the course of a day from bright to dark red .
Sacred to the local aboriginal Pitjantjatjara people , Uluru is of great cultural significance , as well as natural significance .
Often overlooked , nearby Kata Tjuta is a natural wonder with visiting as well .
It ’s actually higher than Uluru , but has been eroded into several pieces .
Sydney Harbor
What says “ Australia ” more than Sydney Harbor ?
Maybe a kangaroo holding a boomerang and beer in the outback , but that ’s about it .
The center of Australia ’s largest city , Sydney Harbor , is home to the Sydney Opera House and the Harbor Bridge .
You can take a ferry across the harbor , walk across the top of the Harbor Bridge , have tea in the Opera House , and take a stroll in the nearby Royal Botanical Gardens .
Each of these activities will give you interesting vantages on the stunning architectural feat of those iconic sails gleaming on the Opera House .
Bungle Bungles / Purnululu National Park
Had this Seven Wonders list been created 30 years ago , the Bungle Bungles might not have been listed .
Having come to the world ’s attention only in the mid-1980s , the beehive domes of the Bungles make Purnululu National Park the premier attraction in the Kimberley region of Western Australia .
It ’s difficult to actually get to the Bungles , but the unique erosional features here make the Bungles fascinating — it ’s unlike anything else in the world and thus safely has a spot on our list of true Aussie wonders .
Great Barrier Reef
The Great Barrier Reef is so big that the scope of it can really only be appreciated from the air — or even better , from orbit .
By far the largest coral reef system in the world , Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef extends over 2,600 km ( 1,600 miles ) — almost the entire length of the coast of Queensland .
It ’s usually on any shortlist of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World , let alone the ones in Australia .
There are plenty of places from which you can experience the reef , the most common of which are Cairns and the Whitsunday Islands .
Giant Eucalyptus Trees of Tasmania
Tasmania holds the most unspoiled wilderness in Australia .
In addition to its pristine beauty , it ’s home to many unique species of plant and animal , including the endangered Tasmanian Devil .
The most dramatic of all the things in Tasmania is the Eucalyptus Regnans , the giant eucalyptus tree .
Also known as the Swamp Gum , Mountain Ash or Tasmanian Oak , it is the largest flowering plant and hardwood tree in the world , and is second only to the redwood tree in height .
I ’m not the only one impressed with the Tasmanian Wilderness — this natural attraction is so important it was named one of Australia ’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites .
The Great Ocean Road
One of the greatest drives in the world is the Great Ocean Road on the southern coast of Victoria .
Carved by thousands of years of battering by the Great Southern Ocean , the sandstone formations of the Great Ocean Road are truly stunning .
The Twelve Apostles , London Bridge , and Loch Ard Gorge are just some of the significant erosional features near the town of Port Campbell , which you can witness no matter how you plan your drive of the Great Ocean Road .
7 Wonders Honorable Mentions :
It ’s impossible for any list to contain all that makes Australia unique and beautiful .
From natural wonders to symbols of the continent ’s long history , these honorable mentions are truly special and deserve a spot on your bucket list as well .

The drug that helps people with erectile dysfunction , Viagra , proved to be effective in curing sexual dysfunction in women suffering from depression , study says .
It is worth mentioning that sexual dysfunction is usually provoked by antidepressants , which is why a lot of people stop taking them .
According to the authors of the study women are prescribed twice as many antidepressants as men , but it is not approved for women to take the drugs that can help deal with sexual dysfunctions in men .
Viagra was tested on 98 women who had their depression in reduction , but who were still suffering from sexual dysfunction including lack of arousal and / or pain during intercourse .
The participants were told to take a Viagra pill one to two hours prior to intercourse during a period of 8 weeks .
Half of all women who participated in the study were given placebos pills , which did not have any pharmacological effects .
The results showed that73 percent of women who took placebos pill reported no improvement .
However , only 28 percent of women who took Viagra reported no progress in their issue .
The study and its results were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
A number of women had such side effects as headaches , flushing and indigestion , but none withdrew from the research .
" By treating this bothersome treatment - associated adverse effect in patients who have been effectively treated for depression , but need to continue on their medication to avoid relapse or recurrence , patients can remain antidepressant - adherent , reduce the current high rates of premature medication discontinuation , and improve depression disease management outcomes , " wrote George Nurnberg , the lead researcher of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine .

コンピュータサイエンス研究科で並列コンピューティングのセミナーがあるというので聞きに行く（ほとんど現実逃避）。印象に残った話をメモ。
自分の書くプログラムが2008年以降高速にならなくても良いという人を除き、全ての人は並列化プログラムを書く必要がある。
1980 年代以降、 RAM のアクセス速度は毎年 9 % しか向上していない 。このため CPU の処理速度との乖離が加速度的に増加している（いた）。これによる不具合を軽減するための仕組みとしてキャッシュメモリがあり、プログラムの実行速度はキャッシュのヒット率に大きく依存する。
アルゴリズムやデータサイズによってキャッシュのヒット率は異なる。更に最近の
CPU はそれぞれ容量・速度の異なるキャッシュを多段に装備している。このため、どのアルゴリズムがどういうサイズの計算をするときに最適なのかは
もはや誰にも予測できない。
並列化なんてしたら更に訳がわからなくなる。
仕方がないので実際に計算をやらせてみてパフォーマンスを評価する必要が出てくる。これを自動化するための研究が進んでいる。intel では 性能予測に 機械学習 アルゴリズム を使用す る
より高速な処理を目指すため、現在の CPU はハードウェア的に様々な形での予測を行っている。そのうち入力より先に出力を出すようになる（というのは冗談）。
（わかります。常に予測を行っていて、活発に活動するのは予測が外れたときだけになるのですね。それなんて脳み（以下略））。
一般企業での並列化は遅々として進んでいない。某
Ad○be 社に並列化コンサルティングに行ったところ、 「 ○○処理の部分はプログラマがだいぶ前に死んだのでそれ以降誰も触っていない・触れない 」 「 え、リコンパイル？ そんなことしたらもう動かなくなったりしないかなあ」などと言われた。
（だからあの会社の製品はあんなに重いのだろうか？）
過去のしがらみの少ない自然科学分野の方が並列化は先行するのではないか。
（でもラボ内ソフトのコアな部分は立ち上げ期の人が作っていて、その人が抜けた後は誰も触れないという状況は自然科学の研究室でもわりとあるような気がする。）
ところで、ベクトル化の何たるかを最もよく判っている集団は matlab ユーザーなんではないだろうか。ベクトル化が前提になっているというか、ベクトル化しないと罰ゲームみたいに遅くなる。ちゃんとベクトル化すれば
C で漫然と書くよりも速い（こともある）。
MPI のレベルまで降りていくのはさすがに神経科学者のやることではないと思うので、matlab が並列化したり GPGPU が使えるようになったらもう個人的には満足だと思った。
I 'm posting this because none of the direct , indisputably proven , factual untruths that Palin has uttered has yet to be retracted by this candidate or her running mate .
When you have a leading politician running on a record of outright lies , and those lies are deemed irrelevant , you have a problem .
Each one has been fact - checked to near - death .
They are not the usual political lie - hyperbole , parsing , exaggeration , spin .
They are factual , checkable , indisputable untruths .
Palin could not have asked her girls for permission to accept McCain 's veep offer if she also says she accepted the offer unblinkingly and right away .
Palin did fire a police chief even as she insisted to a reporter she had n't .
She did violate the confidential medical records of Mike Wooten .
She has n't met with any trade missions from Russia .
She does not have any gay friends that anyone can find .
She did not oppose the Bridge to Nowhere .
She did not sell that plane on eBay .
Her Teleprompter did not fail in her convention speech .
Alaska 's state scientists did not conclude that polar bears were in no danger .
She did deny publicly that humans had anything to do with climate change .
Alaska does not provide " nearly 20 percent of the U.S. domestic supply of energy , " as she claimed .
The gas pipeline she touts as her major " mission accomplished " has not broken ground and may never do so .
She did not take a pay - cut as mayor of Wasilla .
And on and on .
Anyone with Google can check all of these out .
Including reporters .
These are all documented , bald - faced factually irrefutable lies .
More to the point : she refuses to cop to them or be held accountable for them or take questions about them .
Until she does , we can rightly infer there is no reason to believe anything she says , and that includes her recent medical history .
A liar like this can not be taken on trust .
We have to verify it all .
Release the medical records and tax returns now .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

“ In cosmology there ’s this quantum effect , ” Ralf Schützhold tells PhysOrg.com .
“ In the universe , there is a ground state , where it is empty .
But if the universe starts to expand or contract , the vacuum is distorted , no longer empty .
Particles are created . ”
The quantum effects described by Schützhold , a theorist at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the Dresden University of Technology , in Germany , are small right now .
“ This effect right now is probably very tiny , ” he says .
“ But during the formation of the universe , quantum effects probably played a big role . ”
Schützhold and his colleagues , Michael Uhlmann at the Institute in Dresden , and experimental scientists Lutz Petersen , Hector Schmitz , Axel Friedenauer and Tobias Schätz at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching , Germany , hope to model quantum particle creation using an analog of phonons in an ion trap .
Their work is discussed in an article titled “ Analogue of Cosmological Particle Creation in an Ion Trap , ” and published in Physical Review Letters .
“ In this analog , we expect to see the same effect of quantum particle creation that happened in the universe .
But instead of electrons and photons , as are present in the universe , we use phonons in an ion trap , ” Schützhold explains .
He points out that through such an analog , it would be possible to “ see cosmological effects and do experiments . ”
“ One of the basic indications we propose to use , ” Schützhold says , “ is pairs .
Particles created by these quantum effects always come in pairs .
In the ion trap , it would be the same thing .
If there is a quantum effect , the phonons would come in pairs .
If we find that we have two particles instead of one , there is a strong indication of quantum effects . ”
Such detection in the ion trap would help rule out effects leading to particle creation due to such classical physics effects as heating .
Schützhold points out that understanding the quantum effects that lead to particle creation would not directly point to how the universe was formed .
“ This is a way to help understand possible quantum effects in the early universe , but it is not a direct test of cosmological particle creation . ”
He pauses before continuing .
“ In the long run , this could help us understand issues of theory better . ”
One of the attractive qualities of the ion trap analog proposed by the scientists in Germany is that it is possible to see results using current technology .
According to Schützhold , Schätz , head of the experimental group in Garching , says that they have already done a preliminary experiment where they cooled the ions close to the ground state and achieved optical pumping at 99 percent accuracy .
“ It ’s not fully ready , yet , ” he concedes , “ but it should be ready maybe by the end of this year or the beginning of next year . ”
This experiment , Schützhold explains , is a way to probe the quantum effects behind particle creation and work toward understanding fundamental questions of quantum physics .
“ This quantum effect was just calculated in theory , ” he says .
“ Of course now we want to see it in an experiment …
It has n’t been seen practically yet . ”
And while the technology to directly measure quantum effects in particle creation may be years down the road , Schützhold and his colleagues may have found a way to understand these effects now by using an experimental analog that might possibly model the same effects .

For those of you who have been anticipating the so - called Google Phone as if it were the next iPhone , the wait is almost over .
T- Mobile USA said today that it would unveil the much - anticipated mobile phone loaded with Google 's Android software next Tuesday at a press conference in New York .
The " G1 , " which is being manufactured by HTC , wo n't go on sale until October .
But expect T - Mobile to finally divulge some key details such as pricing .
T- Mobile is just the first carrier to market the phone .
Other cellphone manufacturers and carriers are expected to dial for dollars using the Google brand as bait , but they apparently have hit some snags .
The Android phone is being positioned as a rival to Apple 's iPhone and Research in Motion 's BlackBerry .
For Google , this seems like a no-lose proposition .
The Internet search giant wants to make sure that all of its services , including its lucrative advertising , are available on all cellphones .
So it created software for mobile phones that does that .
Pundits have been saying for years that the mobile Web will dwarf the non-mobile Web once enough people have access to so - called smartphones and all of the bells and whistles that come with them .
Already Google is readying a store for downloadable mobile software similar to the one that has proven so successful for the iPhone .
Google showed off the handset at a developer conference in London this morning .
Next week , Google and T - Mobile should start to reveal whether Android will live up to the hype .

Why is the American press silent on the report of 655,000 Iraqi deaths ?
By Joe Kay and Barry Grey

The US media is virtually silent on a new scientific study that estimates the Iraqi death toll from the US war at 655,000 .
The study , conducted by Johns Hopkins University ’s Bloomberg School of Public Health and funded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , was posted Wednesday on the web site of the British medical journal , the Lancet .
The study is the only systematic estimate of the number of Iraqi civilians and military personnel to have died as a result of the US invasion and occupation to be brought to the attention of the American and international public .
Unlike previous estimates , which were based on reviews of media reports or tallies made by the US - backed Iraqi government , the Johns Hopkins study was carried out by Iraqi physicians who interviewed — often at great personal risk — nearly 2,000 families spread across the country , utilizing standard and widely used statistical methods to arrive at an objective estimate of the death toll from the war and occupation .
The vast majority of the reported deaths were substantiated by death certificates .
The study concluded with a 95 percent degree of certainty that the number of “ excess deaths ” in Iraq since the invasion — the number of people who have died in excess of the number that would be expected on the basis of pre-invasion mortality rates — is between 393,000 and 943,000 .
The figure of 655,000 is given as the most likely number .
This represents an astonishing 2.5 percent of the entire Iraqi population .
The researchers further estimated that about 600,000 of the deaths were due to violence in some form , including gunshots , air strikes and bombings .
They concluded that US and allied military forces directly caused at least 31 percent — or 186,000 — of the violent deaths .
Some 336,000 people , or 56 percent of those killed in violent actions since the invasion , died from gunshot wounds .
The study also found that the number of violent deaths in Iraq has steadily increased every year since the invasion .
In the period from June 2005 to June 2006 , the researchers found a nearly four - fold increase in the mortality rate relative to pre-invasion levels .
There can be no legitimate doubts about the credibility of the study .
Lancet is one of the oldest and most prestigious peer - reviewed medical publications in the world .
The Johns Hopkins public health school is the largest in the world , and regularly ranks as the top public health school in the United States .
The journal article was reviewed and approved for publication by four independent scientific experts in the area .
It is difficult to overestimate the significance of the report , even if one assumes its low - end estimate of 393,000 Iraqi deaths to be correct .
It demonstrates that the American intervention in Iraq has produced a social and humanitarian catastrophe of historical dimensions , with vast political implications not only in the Middle East , but throughout the world and , above all , in the United States itself .
By any objective standard , the report merits front - page coverage in every major newspaper in the country and extensive discussion and reporting on television news broadcasts .
Yet the response of the US press has been to virtually ignore the report and limit its coverage to news accounts on inside pages which report , uncritically , unsubstantiated statements by government and military officials dismissing the report as “ not credible . ”
In burying the story , the New York Times and Washington Post have played a particularly significant role .
The original articles published by these newspapers on Wednesday were relegated to the inside pages : in the Times on page 8 , in the Post on page 12 .
The Post decided to bury the story in its back pages despite the fact that the article it published vouched for the scientific validity the Johns Hopkins study , noting that it , and an earlier report on Iraqi deaths published by the same team , “ are the only ones to estimate mortality in Iraq using scientific methods . ”
The “ cluster sampling ” technique used by the scientists , the newspaper wrote , “ is used to estimate mortality in famines and after natural disasters . ”
Minimal coverage in the press continued on Thursday , despite the fact that the issue was raised by a reporter at a White House press conference on Wednesday .
President Bush contemptuously dismissed the report , stating that it was not credible .
He was not challenged and the question was not followed up by any of the other reporters at the news conference .
Bush ’s remarks were followed by statements from various supporters and architects of the war similarly dismissing the Johns Hopkins study ’s casualty figures .
General George Casey , the commander of US forces in Iraq , admitted that he had not bothered to read the report , but nevertheless concluded that it did not have “ much credibility at all . ”
A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that the figure of 655,000 killed is “ not one we believe to be anywhere near accurate . ”
Iraqi government officials likewise declared that the figure was “ exaggerated . ”
On Thursday , neither the Times nor the Post published an editorial on the Johns Hopkins report , or even a follow - up article on the report and the response of the Bush administration .
There was not one challenge in the establishment media to the official attempts to disparage the report .
Instead , the minimal coverage on Thursday was largely devoted to reporting the statements by Bush , Casey , Blair and the Iraqi stooge regime .
The Los Angeles Times , for example , published a story on its inside pages , “ Iraq Disputes Claim of 600,000 War Dead , ” reporting the statements by the Iraqi government .
The newspaper added its voice to the chorus by remarking that it had conducted its own survey and reached a figure of 50,000 killed .
The attempts to discredit the report are not backed up by any factual or methodological arguments .
The administration and its supporters assume , correctly , that they can simply make unsubstantiated claims and the media will not challenge them .
Lee Roberts , a co-author of the study , noted in an interview with the radio program Democracy Now ! on Thursday that the cluster survey approach the researchers used “ is the standard way of measuring mortality in very poor countries where the government is n’t very functional or in times of war . ”
He pointed out that both the United Nations and the US government have used the method in determining mortality , including after the Kosovo and Afghan wars .
“ Most ironically , ” he said , “ the US government has been spending millions of dollars per year ... to train NGOs and UN workers to do cluster surveys to measure mortality in times of wars and disasters . ”
With its silence , the media is once again taking its cue from the government .
It does not challenge Bush ’s ignorant and cold - blooded dismissal of the Johns Hopkins report , just as it did not challenge Bush ’s offhand remark at a December , 2005 press conference that 30,000 Iraqis , “ more or less , ” had been killed since the March , 2003 US invasion — an absurdly low estimate .
The corporate - owned - and - controlled media have buried this story because they do not want the American people to know the truth of what is happening in Iraq .
They want to conceal this truth — as they have done consistently since the war began — because they are complicit in a massive war crime in Iraq , and continue to support the bloodletting by the US military .
The Johns Hopkins report , by revealing the colossal dimensions of the death and destruction wreaked by the United States in Iraq , shatters the edifice of lies that has been erected in an attempt to deceive the people and justify the war — from the phony claims of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq - Al Qaeda ties , to the current claims of a war for “ freedom and democracy ” and the overarching deception of the “ war on terrorism . ”
The report inevitably highlights the culpability of the media itself , which has combined an acceptance of unprecedented censorship by the military with self - censorship and deliberate misinformation in order to whitewash an imperialist war for oil and geo-strategic domination of the Middle East .
The scale of mass killing revealed in the Johns Hopkins study published by the Lancet stands as an indictment of the entire American ruling elite , both of its political parties —
Democratic no less than Republican — and all of its official institutions , among which the media has played a particularly sordid role .
What the corporate , political and media establishment fear are the explosive social and political implications of growing popular revulsion over the crimes of US imperialism in Iraq and around the world , combined with mounting anger over relentless attacks on working people ’s social conditions and democratic rights .
The entire political system is being exposed and discredited before the eyes of the people .
Such a process inevitably brings with it revolutionary consequences .
Who killed Britain ?
A new book reveals that the land Queen Elizabeth II once ruled no longer exists
She succeeded her father , George VI , on February 6 , 1952 , and may ultimately rival Queen Victoria - our monarch for 63 years - in longevity .
Already , however , the reign of Elizabeth II has encompassed so much change that the Queen seems almost like a time - traveller , spanning not just the decades since she came to the throne but whole centuries .
The Britain of the early 1950s is so utterly different from the Britain of 2008 that it is bizarre to think that we have the same Head of State we did when rationing was still in force and Winston Churchill was Prime Minister .
Queen Elizabeth II 's 63 - year reign has encompassed massive change
But was this Queen 's reign , like that of Victoria , a time of British success , or of failure ?
Will this , the second Elizabethan age , compare favourably with her great - great grandmother 's or not ?
The Age of Victoria was one in which Britain became the greatest world power , unrivalled in invention and industrial productivity .
For half a century , no country on earth could match its wealth - producing capacity .
At the same time , thanks to a combination of commercial enterprise , and a genuine desire to help the peoples of Asia and Africa , the British Empire came into being .
Nearly all these riches and political power had evaporated by the time Elizabeth II was crowned .
The war against Hitler had ruined Britain financially .
We were falling catastrophically behind our international competitors , thanks to the nationalisation of the coal and steel industries by the post - war Labour government .
There were fuel shortages and a housing crisis - with many people living in slums , and others housed in ' prefabs ' that look to the eyes of hindsight like huts in Toy Town .
A quarter of British homes had inadequate sanitary arrangements , outdoor lavatories and bathrooms shared with neighbours .
Britain in 1952 was not a very happy place .
Indeed , it is doubtful whether even the most conservative of today 's inhabitants would truly rejoice if transported back there .
The standard of living of the average family would seem harsh today even to Romanians or the poorest of the East Germans .
Few families could afford to drink alcohol except on special occasions .
Wine was unheard of , except on Christmas Day , and was so bad it turned your teeth black .
The food on offer in restaurants and hotels - assuming you could afford it - was unpalatable , and olive oil was sold in tiny phials at the chemist .
Foreign holidays were for the few , and even they were restricted by the amount of money that could be taken out of the country , so that it was all but impossible to travel abroad for more than ten days without running out of cash .
Over half the adult population over the age of 30 had false teeth - it was received wisdom among dentists that it was better for your health to have dentures .
The unhappily married stayed unhappy unless they wished to go through the considerable expense and humiliation of a divorce , in which there always had to be a guilty party , and farcical scenes had to be enacted in hotel rooms with retired prostitutes , witnessed by private detectives , in order to provide the evidence of adultery .
Homosexuals were treated as diseased beings , and two men over the age of 21 were in breach of the law if they shared a bed in complete privacy .
The Brixton Riots in July 1981
The Lord Chamberlain still exercised censorship over the stage , and , until the Lady Chatterley ruling of 1960 , no legal distinction was made between literature and pornography .
It was perfectly permissible for employers to pay women markedly less for doing the same jobs as men , and there were many jobs to which only very privileged women could aspire .
Before the advent of the Pill , many women felt enslaved by marriage and family life .
When we look back at such things , it would be perverse not to celebrate that times have changed .
And though our overburdened health service is badly run , and there are newspaper stories every week of dirty , inefficient hospitals , this should not blind us to the extraordinary advances in medical science and standards of medical care .
Many cancer patients can now be cured .
Life - saving heart surgery is offered that was undreamt of in the Fifties .
The ageing population is fitted with replacement hips and knee joints at the taxpayers ' expense .
The second Elizabethan Age is a period in which the majority of the British have basked in comfort and security .
And if , from time to time , security is threatened - by IRA bombs , by the Brixton riots or by Islamist terror - what is this compared with the wars which previous generations endured , with the British cities being nightly bombarded in the Blitz ?
The dome of St Paul 's Cathedral has been dwarfed by American - style blocks
All in all , when one compares the cold , the poverty , the sheer misery of 1952 Britain with the Britain of today , the improvement is as amazing as anything the Victorians achieved .
And yet , it would be a bold person who stood up and said that the past half - century had been Britain 's most glorious period .
For the reign of Elizabeth is the one in which Britain effectively stopped being British .
The chief reason for this is mass immigration on a scale that has utterly transformed our nation .
Governments needed cheap labour , and the first immigrants from the West Indies helped the expanding health service , the improved transport system and burgeoning industry .
Not everyone was welcoming .
At the end of 1952 , shortly after he was re-elected as Prime Minister , the old war hero Winston Churchill wanted to know the number of coloured people - as they were called in those days - who had entered Britain and where they lived .
In Cabinet he asked whether the Post Office was employing any , pointing out that ' there was some risk that difficult social problems would be created ' if this was so .
Then he set up an inquiry to see how further immigration could be prevented and ' coloured ' people kept out of the Civil Service .
The generation of old men who had grown up with a British Empire , and who were still occupying senior office until the Seventies , saw the question of immigration entirely in terms of colour .
Horrified by this , the next generation built up a race relations industry in which discrimination on grounds of skin pigmentation became illegal .
Meanwhile , for fear of being thought racist , successive governments allowed in thousands more immigrants and their innumerable dependants , most of whom , far from bringing necessary skills , were a drain on the welfare system or took jobs that could have been done by those already living here .
Though some of these newcomers undoubtedly helped Britain prosper , it is equally inescapable that they have changed the character and composition of whole areas of Britain - and not always for the better .
Eager to be tolerant , governments did not insist that they learn the language or integrate properly .
Because many primary schools were Church of England , it seemed only fair - did n't it ?
- to have Muslim schools , too .
This folly ignored the fact that Church of England did not mean narrowly Christian but schools - for - all that historically just happened to be run by the church .
By creating Muslim schools , however , governments have allowed the growth of a disaffected , ' radicalised ' young Islamist population , many of whom are intent on destroying Britain itself .
When terrorists strike from this quarter , the indigenous population can feel justifiable anger at a political class that allowed the situation to come about in which such suicide - bombing fanatics could exist .
In the past decade , immigration has been on a scale unprecedented in our nation 's history .
The Labour Government 's figure of new settlers is 1.1 million ; other estimates are half a million higher .
But we just do n't know .
For all its love of statistics and minding the business of the law - abiding and tax - paying population , the Government could not keep tabs on the migrants it let in .
And no wonder , since , quite apart from asylum seekers and immigrants from the rest of the world , Britain signed up to the enlargement of the European Union .
All the biggest countries in Europe - France , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Spain - saw the dangers of allowing unlimited movement of workers from Eastern Europe , the chaos it would create in the labour market and the intolerable burden it would put on hospitals , public transport and housing .
In a move that was little short of insanity , Britain allowed open entry .
Around 420,000 Eastern Europeans piled in here , many willing to work for less than their British equivalents .
Strange as it was for a Labour Party - even a New Labour one - to be so blatant about importing cheap labour , it was also embarrassing to see how much harder working and more skilful were the workers trained under communist regimes than under 50 years of ' consensus ' politics .
Polish plumbers and Czech bricklayers with their willingness to work 50 - hour weeks mending the lavatories and building the kitchens of the British middle classes , made the indigenous poor of this country seem all the more pathetic .
But it is not just immigration that has changed Britain .
Its very essence and nature have been radically undermined in many other ways .
National sovereignty has been sacrificed to Europe .
The constitution has been tinkered with by the mutilation of the House of Lords .
The Church of England nears dissolution .
All these things are symptoms of a simple , palpable fact : that the Britain of February 6 , 1952 , is not merely different from the Britain of today .
It has ceased to exist .
Above all , we have lost any sense of what it means to be together as a nation .
Once , a shared sense of identity and purpose united us .
It was part of the national myth that during the heroic summer of 1940 Britain stood alone against the rest of the world .
But it was a myth that happened to be true .
At the time , Britain had an Empire , a vast industrial base at home , an unwrecked landscape , unspoilt townscapes , a rail network , a national Church , a class system .
But within a decade of the end of the war , almost all of these faded or were forcibly removed .
Social experiments proved disastrous and divisive .
Comprehensive education was meant to destroy the class system ; instead it deepened class division by making anyone who could afford to - and many who could not - educate their children privately .
The fact that so many parents choose to subsidise state schools through tax and then spend a large amount of their taxed income on private education is an indictment of the gross incompetence of generations of politicians .
In 1944 , when drafting his Education Act for post - war Britain , the reforming Conservative minister , R.A. Butler , recognised that there was a strong case for abolishing private education .
Had he done so , then it might have resulted in a more cohesive society .
Some old optimists still think this can happen , that the iniquity of division can be abolished .
The playwright Alan Bennett recently called for private schools to be brought to an end .
' It is the fact that you can buy advantages for your children over and above their abilities that seems to me to be wrong , ' he wrote .
' It 's a fissure that runs right through English society .
If the state schools were the best , if you had to compete to get into them and their education was better than what was on offer privately , then the whole nature of education would be transformed . '
Such a viewpoint pre-supposes that the same educational values exist in 2008 as when Bennett enjoyed the benefits of an old - fashioned grammar school education in the 1940s .
But when Antony Crosland , Education Secretary in Harold Wilson 's Labour Government , expressed the wish to abolish ' every f*** ing grammar school in England ' , he ushered in a mob of theorists who questioned the very standards of excellence that enabled schoolchildren , regardless of income bracket , to prosper .
Bennett 's notion of clever children < cite > competing with one another to get into the ' best ' schools was anathema to the egalitarians of the Seventies .
Had Crosland and his successor , Shirley Williams , made the state schools better than the private sector then there would have been no problem .
Today , the good intentions of the educational theorists have ended in disaster , with a higher proportion than ever of privately educated children being admitted to the better universities , and landing the better jobs .
Meanwhile , the children born into the underclass - the lumpenproletariat , as Karl Marx called it - stand less chance than their British working - class equivalents in 1952 of rising through education and shaking off the constraints of their upbringing .
Constant television , computer games and overcrowded inner-city schools are unlikely to train them in the gifts of concentration that would make such a life change possible .
The Britain of Elizabeth II 's accession , then , and the Britain that will see her funeral are in reality two different , equally awful , places .
We have gained much in terms of physical well - being , of medical care , of opportunities for travel and cultural enrichment .
But at some stage along the journey we ceased to be a society .
Much of our common culture has been destroyed .
Take the so - called Big Bang , which in 1986 opened up the financial markets of the City of London to traders from all over the world .
Almost overnight , an institution that had been central to Britain as a nation since the 17th century was no longer in British hands .
Electronic dealing ended the arcane rituals of the stock market floor , men in top hats , bells ringing and so on .
The old Forsyte Saga - style banking and stockbroking families retreated before the invasion of American and European firms .
In their place appeared a class of super - rich City slickers , yuppies , Porsche drivers , second and third home - owners , crankers - up of the housing market , draughtsmen and women of a new social map in which previous levels of income and standards of living seemed puny .
Geographically , the Square Mile was still in the same place .
The Thames still ran softly , but the song was no longer sung in English .
The dome of St Paul's , that great emblem of national solidity in the face of destructive threats from outside , as it had been in 1940 when it survived the Blitz , was soon dwarfed by huge American - style blocks and slabs that soared above the City 's skyline .
Within its walls , the cathedral church of London had become the chief meeting place of a sect rather than the seat of a national Church .
The liturgy of 1662 , part of the inner music of English heads and English ears for three centuries , was discarded in the late Sixties , as was any claim by the Church to utter the Common Prayer of the nation .
No longer answerable to Parliament , the Church had an assembly of its own , the General Synod , in which it conducts divisive discussions from which there appears to be no retreat .
Gay bishops ?
Women priests ?
In these Lilliputian squabbles the Church has never looked more like breaking up .
Disestablishment seems inevitable .
And with that will come a further weakening of any bond that might hold the nation in an imaginative and cultural knot .
The union between Scotland and England is under threat , too .
It had been the beginning of the story of British Imperial greatness .
Despite occasional dramatic spats , the two nations achieved remarkable feats of statecraft , of philosophy , of engineering , of empire - building .
But , like a married pair who wonder whether they ever liked each other , they have drifted almost heedlessly towards separation , via a series of devolutionary measures few of the electorate actually asked for , and probably even fewer actively desire .
The result of all these changes , in so many different areas of our national life , is plain .
Britain is less British today than it was half a century ago .
During World War II , and in the times of economic austerity immediately after , we were - yes , it made sense to use the first person plural - we were an entity .
Young men , of whatever social class , did National Service together .
Rich and poor received identical rations and , for the first time since the Industrial Revolution , Britain had a fair distribution of food .
The middle classes howled about powdered eggs , but the working classes had the new experience of protein and vitamins in their diet .
With the coming of prosperity - which almost everyone must surely have welcomed - the problems began .
The inhabitants of the British archipelago became a collection of classes and races and individuals , living side by side and for the most part trying to ignore one another .
For a while , we had the optimistic idea of multi-culturalism .
In the wake of massive immigration , governments woke up to the realisation that behind the statistics were human beings with religious beliefs and political attitudes that might not sit easily with modern British secularism .
Multi-culturalism , it was argued , would enable everyone to feel at home in their own language , religion , dress codes and eating habits .
This idea is in the process of being abandoned because it is now seen to ' encourage separateness between communities ' , as Trevor Phillips , chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality , has put it .
On a day when British Muslims were burning the Union flag outside Regent 's Park mosque in London , Phillips said : ' What we should be talking about is how we reach an integrated society in which people are equal under the law and where there are some common values . '
Against the ' extremist ' ideas of radical Islamists , he proposed an urgent need to ' assert a core of Britishness ' by which everyone , including Muslims , ' work by the rules of British people - and that excludes terrorism ' .
But how do you impose ' a core of Britishness ' upon people who are only British in the sense of possessing a passport , and who perhaps do not want someone else 's so - called values thrust upon them ?
Britishness , anyway , is apparently not so desirable a quality that all Britons want to share in it , as the numbers of Scots pressing to leave the Union are witness to .
What are these values , in any case ?
' Democracy and the rule of law ' , is the answer some would give .
Yes , but the history of the past 200 years shows Britain was only ever a partial democracy .
A general election is an opportunity for the electorate to express preferences , and to change the make - up of Parliament , but only established or ' acceptable ' political viewpoints are offered at the ballot box .
Those who wish to be governed by greens , by communists , by fascists , by Islamic fundamentalists or others - and this represents a substantial part of the electorate if added together - have no chance whatsoever of seeing a candidate with their viewpoint elected to Parliament .
And anyway an election leaves the civil service , the police and the judiciary untouched .
Britain has remained a country governed by those who think they knew best .
In the 19th century this was a coalition of aristocrats and the professional classes .
In our times , the aristocracy was slowly replaced by a different Establishment , of university graduates and career politicians , who were no less adamant that they did not need advice from the headstrong populace .
The populace might think it wanted capital punishment , for example , or an escape from the bureaucracy of Europe , but the governing classes always knew better .
This New Establishment , confronted with the spectre of Irish terrorism , contorted itself into any number of positions until Tony Blair played the brilliant trick of giving the ' extremists ' in Northern Ireland what they actually claimed to want : namely , power .
He made them share it , a Dantean joke that worked .
It would be less easy to do the same with Islamic terrorists , since it is not in the power of the New Establishment to reinvent the Caliphate , even if it wanted to .
Which is why it has resorted to this rather lame belief that it must assert Britishness - at the very period in history when it is harder than ever to define what so vague a concept might mean .
Gordon Brown has spoken with eloquent lack of meaning or substance about ' Britishness ' and ' core vahlews ' , but what he actually thinks about Britain was revealed in a symbolic action he performed before he became prime minister .
As Chancellor of the Exchequer , he approved a new set of British coins .
For the first time since the reign of Charles II , the figure of Britannia had been removed from them .
As our common culture disappears , the only thing , in fact , that the indigenous population still has in common with all their fellow aliens on this strange little archipelago in the North Sea is the Queen herself .
And one suspects , as she continues to go about the land meeting her subjects and shaking their hands , that she has come to feel a stranger here , too .

On Monday : Enter Maggie , the punk princess of politics
Advertisements
Barack Obama spoke in Green Bay , WI this afternoon .
He suggested that the collapse on Wall Street is part of a larger government problem and serves as evidence that things must change .
Obama also hit his opponent John McCain and his phony change message hard .
“ We must reform our lobbyist - driven politics .
We must reform the waste and abuse in our government .
We must reform the rules of the road that let Wall Street run wild and stuck Main Street with the bill .
We must change Washington now .
This has been our message from the day we began this campaign .
Our opponent , on the other hand , has spent much of the last nineteen months arguing that what qualifies him to be President are the decades he ’s spent in Washington , ” Obama said .
Obama addressed McCain ’s change of heart towards regulation , “ But with forty - two days left , he ’s had a sudden change of heart .
An election - time conversion .
After twenty - six years in Washington – years where he voted for the same trickle - down , on - your - own policies that got us into this mess – he now claims that he ’s the one who can clean it up . ”

He then spoke about McCain ’s record , “ Well let ’s be clear .
When it comes to regulatory reform , Senator McCain has fought time and time again against the common - sense rules of the road that could ’ve prevented this crisis .
His economic plan was written by Phil Gramm , the architect in the US Senate of the de-regulatory steps that helped cause this mess .
Even knowing what we know now , Senator McCain said in an interview just last night that de-regulation actually helped grow our economy .
Well that might be true for the profits of a few CEOs , but it ’s certainly not true for America ’s prosperity . ”
“ When it comes to taking on the special interests , my opponent sounds like Fighting Bob Lafollette .
But he acts like a guy who ’s spent three decades of his life in Washington .
He ’s put seven of the biggest corporate lobbyists in charge of his campaign – lobbyists for the insurance industry and the oil industry ; for foreign governments and Freddie and Fannie Mac , who paid his campaign manager nearly $ 2 million to defend them against stricter regulations .
I guess they got their money ’s worth .
And rest assured , those lobbyists who are working day and night to elect my opponent are n’t doing it to put themselves out of business , ” Obama continued .
The Democrat took on McCain on earmarks , “ When it comes to reforming government waste and spending , Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks .
And while he deserves credit for not requesting many of those earmarks during his time in Congress , what he never mentions is that he voted for 144 billion dollars worth in just six years ; or that he voted for four out of the five Bush budgets that have been filled with special interests giveaways and left us with the largest deficit in history . ”
Obama accused McCain of pretending that cutting earmarks will solve our budget problems , “ But let ’s not pretend , as John McCain does , that proposing the elimination of 18 billion dollars of earmarks will make up for the more than 300 billion additional dollars he wants to spend on tax breaks for big corporations and multi-millionaires that do n’t need them and were n’t asking for them – more than 300 billion dollars at a time when taxpayers are being asked to help finance two wars and a historic financial bailout .
That ’s some pretty creative math , but it does n’t add up to is change .
And change in Washington is what we need right now . ”
Obama ’s plan for government reform is pretty much the same one that he unveiled in the primaries .
For the details , you can read about it here .
Obama is now in his element .
He is at his best once he is able to become the candidate of change against an opponent who is an insider .
McCain ’s recent stumbles have allowed Obama to return to his strengths .
What is new about Obama ’s message is that change has now been expanded to include the economy , jobs , and kitchen table politics .
This is what was missing all through the primary campaign .
Obama is transitioning from talking about the general concept of change , to discussing how change will help you .
As long as Obama can keep the focus on the economy and change , his momentum will continue to build .
We have seen this scenario before with Obama .
Once he got Hillary Clinton defined as the insider , he was able to his change message to build momentum which carried him to a string of wins that ultimately won him the nomination .
Clinton was able to counter Obama by talking about issues and the economy .
Unless the McCain campaign changes their strategy , to mirror Clinton ’s , they are probably going to suffer the same fate that she did .
Of course NVIDIA would wait until I physically left NVISION 08 to actually make an interesting announcement , but there ’s no bitterness , I swear :)
The big , no , huge news from today ?
NVIDIA is enabling native support for 2 and 3 - way SLI on Intel X58 based motherboards ... without the use of any nForce 200 chips .
It ’s not as simple as simply enabling SLI support on X58 , NVIDIA wanted to both ensure compatibility and additional revenue , so there ’s a certification program .
Any X58 motherboard maker can submit their board for certification , which will be done by NVIDIA .
If the board passes , and the motherboard manufacturer agrees to pay a certification fee ( NVIDIA would not reveal how much ) , then the board is certified and NVIDIA provides the board manufacturer with a key to place in its BIOS .
When you install the NVIDIA drivers , they check for the presence of this key in the BIOS - if it ’s found , then you get the ability to enable SLI , natively , on X58 .
Note that this wo n’t work on any other Intel chipsets , just X58 for Nehalem owners this fall .
This is absolutely huge because it does mean that with the right motherboard you can now have both Cross Fire and SLI support , without resorting to an OEM system or something more exotic like Skulltrail .
Below are the supported configurations :
You can run X58 / SLI with either two or three cards ( a pair of GX2s will work but you ca n’t use four individual cards in SLI ) .
3 - way SLI + 1 card PhysX acceleration is supported as well .
If you absolutely want the highest bandwidth possible , 3 PCIe x16 slots are only supported using nForce 200 chips , otherwise you ’re stuck with two x16s or one x16 and two x8s .
The nForce 200 route seems quite silly due to the added cost and power consumption but the option is still on the table .

[ digg- reddit-me ] McCain ’s new ad :
Edit : McCain took down the ad from his YouTube page , but it is now posted on some others , so I have replaced the link to the ad in McCain ’s YouTube with this copy of it .
The comments it is based on :
In Obama ’s acceptance speech in Denver , he predicted this type of attack :
If you do n’t have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from .
You make a big election about small things .
The question is : Are the American people dumb enough to fall for it ?
And it ’s far from the first time he has .

After dueling for days with Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , over whether to allow offshore oil drilling and how much to inflate tires , Sen. John McCain today turned the discussion nuclear .
The Arizona Republican toured the 20 - year - old Enrico Fermi Nuclear Plant near Detroit today in a campaign effort to portray himself as an energy problem solver .
McCain used the visit to the plant to highlight his call to build dozens of new atomic power plants in the United States and to distinguish himself from his likely Democratic opponent .
" I proposed a plan to build 45 new nuclear plants before the year 2030 .
And that would provide 700,000 jobs for American workers , " McCain told the crowd of reporters that gathered at the plant .
McCain said he believes nuclear power is a viable way to produce electricity and decrease America 's reliance on foreign oil .
Some experts agree .
" The 40 or so power plants are consistent with some of our analysis and what would be required to the next 20 to 30 years to provide electricity at a reasonable cost , " said Chris Larsen of the Electric Power Research Institute .
McCain accused Obama of opposing expanding the use of nuclear power .
" Sen . Obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants ' does n't make sense for America , ' " McCain said .
" He also says no to nuclear storage and no to reprocessing .
I could not disagree more . "
However , Obama does not completely oppose more nuclear power plants .
Instead , he favors going forward only at a time when it 's proven that it can be done safely .
McCain said that the time is now .
" My experience with nuclear power goes back many years to being stationed on the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier [ the USS Enterprise ] , " McCain said .
" I knew it was safe then and I know it 's safe now . "
The accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in 1979 , the last serious accident at a U.S. facility , occurred after McCain was no longer stationed on the Enterprise .
Regulators say the accident improved oversight and safety at nuclear plants .
The McCain campaign believes it is scoring points with voters by hitting Obama hard on the issue of energy .
McCain strategists have tried to brand Obama as entirely opposed to nuclear power and offshore oil drilling .
This week , McCain ridiculed Obama for his comments that , by inflating your tires , Americans can improve gas mileage .
" Instead of calling on his party 's leadership to return to Congress and carve out an ' all of the above ' approach to America 's energy crisis , Barack Obama would rather tell commuters to inflate their car tires , " McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said .
" Barack Obama does not have the judgment or experience to understand that Americans are n't choosing between offshore drilling and inflating their car tires -- they 're demanding action now . "
Obama fired back at a campaign stop in Berea , Ohio , defending the accuracy and efficiency of his energy program .
" They know they 're lying about what my energy plan is .
They 're making fun of steps that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent , " Obama said .
" It 's like these guys take pride in being ignorant . "
He also tried to link McCain 's energy policy to that of Vice President Cheney , claiming that McCain would be " four more years of the same . "
The Sierra Club released a video today in which the environmental group claimed that McCain prohibited nuclear waste to pass through his home state of Arizona .
But the clip of McCain the group used to back up the claim stopped short , before McCain added the comment , " I think it can be made safe . "

As the economic debacle facing Americans continues to materialize , those responsible are running for cover with ten Republican senators refusing to attend their own national convention .
Four years ago we observed that the so - called " Republican philosophy " of small government , sound money , and balanced budgets was illusory in terms of the history and then - current policies of the Republican Party .
[ 1 ]
However , even we would never have guessed how awful the Republican Party economic policy would become .
From mere mercantilism , the Republican Party is now flirting with comprehensive socialist economic policy and another Great Depression .
The Republican Party was founded on big government and economic intervention with roots in the economic platforms of Federalist icon Alexander Hamilton and Whig leader Henry Clay .
Indeed , the term " New Deal " was coined in 1865 to characterize Lincoln and his Republican Party economic platform .
Republicans became the " mercantile " party of big business , big government , external protection , centralized monetary control , strong restrictions on immigration , and aggressive foreign policy .
From FDR 's New Deal to LBJ 's Great Society , Democratic policies forced many free - market activists into the Republican fold .
People like Robert Taft , Barry Goldwater , Ronald Reagan , and of course Ron Paul , represent this free - market faction in the Republican Party .
For example , free markets , deregulation , and balanced budgets became the Republican mantra ( if not reality ) during the Reagan administration .
The orchestrated marginalization of Ron Paul is just one indicator that the free - market faction has been routed and that the mercantilists are firmly in control .
In fact , as we endure the current economic malaise , we can note that the Republican - dominated Congress ( 1994–2006 ) and the administrations of George W. Bush have morphed Republican - style mercantilism into corporate socialism .
Harmful military spending , unbalanced budgets , fiscal irresponsibility , protectionist and monopoly handouts to friends is the old style Republican playbook .
The new style is audacious , unprecedented , and truly awful for the economy .
It begins with the Republican - controlled Federal Reserve , which , under Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke , has flooded the economy with money and credit and bailed out every economic crisis since 1987 .
Greenspan 's admonitions against " irrational exuberance " apparently were not intended to restrain the Federal Reserve 's irresponsible monetary policy .
Who in their right mind could honestly say that the Fed had nothing to do with the housing bubble after driving the nominal interest rate to 1 % and proclaiming that the mortgage market was well regulated ?
But an insidious form of " market - based policy " is also a real culprit in the current mess .
In 1999 a bill was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton that rescinded the Depression era 's divorce of commercial banking activities from investment banking , called the Glass - Stegall Act of 1933 .
That opened a floodgate of " creative " financial instruments backed by notes and other commercial paper .
Much of the banking regulation of the Roosevelt administration — including abandonment of the gold standard — made absolutely no sense , but markets can fail with dire short - run consequences under a fiat monetary system .
With Glass - Stegall , Congress put its finger on and mitigated the tendency and temptations of banks to create massive costly externalities to society , in this case , by holding bundled mortgage - backed securities which were deemed safe by rating agencies but which ultimately failed the market test .
The Financial Services Modernization
Act of 1999 would make perfect sense in a world regulated by a gold standard , 100 % reserve banking , and no FDIC deposit insurance ; but in the world as it is , this " deregulation " amounts to corporate welfare for financial institutions and a moral hazard that will make taxpayers pay dearly .
Such government privileges are nothing new to Republicans — consider the effective subsidies to the pharmaceutical , sugar , and steel industries — but this particular gift to financial institutions is what allowed the credit bubble to expand to such absurd proportions , because it allowed banks of all types to engage in increasingly risky transactions and to greatly expand the leverage of their balance sheets .
As the crisis unfolds , credit continues to contract , the risk of bank failures increases , and the possibility of far more serious economic consequences become more apparent .
The S&L crisis cost the taxpayers a few hundred billion , but this crisis has the potential of saddling the taxpayer with several trillion in bailouts .
So far , the Republican solution has been to bail out lenders — wealthy financial - industry professionals for the most part — who made unwise market decisions with subsidies and election - year subventions .
With Hank Paulson , the former CEO of Goldman Sachs , as Secretary of the Treasury and the big banks on the Board of Directors of the New York Fed , it should not be too surprising that the Fed has been listening only to Wall Street while ignoring Main Street .
But the real problem is that their policies will lead to the nationalization of much of the mortgage - real - estate market .
On July 30 , 2008 , President George Bush signed a bill into law that bails out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the tune of an estimated $ 25 billion dollars in taxpayer losses , according to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) .
The bailout is intended to stabilize the short - term economy , but this ill - conceived nod to socialism will have disastrous long - term effects .
First , according to most economic estimates , the bill that taxpayers would have to eat is many times larger than the laughably small CBO estimate .
Economist Don A. Rich has calculated the possible losses at as low as $ 1.3 to $ 1.6 trillion given likely housing price declines and as high as $ 2.5 trillion ( if the housing price fall mimics that of the Great Depression ) .
[ 2 ]
The fallout from either of these scenarios would be catastrophic as the Federal Reserve accommodated ( within the fiat money system ) the taxpayer - backed debt .
The real debt would be inflated away and America 's real income could be reduced by as much as twenty percent .
The expansion of Federal Reserve authority is almost as alarming as nationalizing the mortgage industry .
While the bailout includes the typical reductions in the Federal Funds Rate and the Discount Rate , it also includes the unprecedented moves to auction off discount rate loans , accept mortgage - backed securities in exchange for the Fed 's Treasury Notes and the financing of J.P. Morgan 's takeover of Bear Sterns .
In May , the Fed began to allow investment firms to draw emergency loans directly from the central bank , and in July , it began to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to do the same even though such lending privileges had traditionally been restricted to commercial banks that have been subject to stricter regulatory supervision .
All of this is predictable given the repeal of Glass - Stegall , which expanded the bad business practices that now " require " an expansion of the bailout .
But we see an even more insidious long - term economic problem , if that is imaginable .
Moral hazard is endemic to this Bush - backed scheme to " relieve " an election - year economy .
While the bill passed in late July does include some tighter regulation for the mortgage companies , it undeniably increases incentives for market participants — buyers and sellers — to engage in risky behavior .
That is one of the products of financial socialism under a fiat monetary system — a system that mainly benefits wealthy lenders .
Heads you win , tails you do not lose .
Further , every incentive by profit - seeking lenders and asset - poor buyers will be in place for a continuing or recurrent mortgage debacle .
Financial institutions will not only have mercantile " protection " from the federal government in terms of regulations ; they will become social arms of that government .
While Democrats certainly facilitated these economic actions as fellow travelers , Republicans , most especially George W. Bush , acquiesced .
( His only objection was a $ 4 billion grant to states and cities to " refurbish " foreclosed homes ) .
The economic choice is clear : either maintain a fiat - money - creation system and reinstate the asset proscriptions of the Glass - Stegall Act or abandon or modify the existing system of money and banking altogether , possibly including elements of a gold standard .
Without some basic alteration in rules , the entire economic system will continue to be at risk , as will America 's predominance in the world of finance .
POSTVILLE , Iowa 
When federal immigration agents raided the kosher meatpacking plant here in May and rounded up 389 illegal immigrants , they found more than 20 under - age workers , some as young as 13 .
Now those young immigrants have begun to tell investigators about their jobs .
Some said they worked shifts of 12 hours or more , wielding razor - edged knives and saws to slice freshly killed beef .
Some worked through the night , sometimes six nights a week .
One , a Guatemalan named Elmer L. who said he was 16 when he started working on the plant ’s killing floors , said he worked 17 - hour shifts , six days a week .
In an affidavit , he said he was constantly tired and did not have time to do anything but work and sleep .
“ I was very sad , ” he said , “ and I felt like I was a slave . ”
At first , labor officials said the raid had disrupted federal and state investigations already under way at Agriprocessors Inc. , the nation ’s largest kosher plant .
The raid has drawn criticism for what some see as harsh tactics against the immigrants , with little action taken against their employers .
Opinion
Democratic platform promises lots of goodies
Democrats used to love to bash President Bush for sending America to war without asking Americans to sacrifice .
Now that it is an election year , you wo n't hear the s- word coming out of their lips .
The Democratic National Committee draft platform is all goodies .
The draft , " Renewing America 's Promise , " says the party will heed the American desire to " abandon the politics of partisan division " - and they are eager to do so , as soon as they are done blaming Republicans for high gasoline prices , the mortgage meltdown and an " unnecessary war . "
( You would never guess that half of this year 's Democratic presidential candidates voted to authorize that war . )
And : " The American people do not want government to solve all our problems . "
But the Dems still promise to " provide immediate relief to working people who have lost their jobs , families who have lost their homes and people who have lost their way . "
( Read : everyone . )
Pay attention , grasshopper .
The DNC wants an America in which " every American is empowered to be a watchdog and a whistle - blower . "
Other language is easier to understand .
Just think dollar signs .
Lots of dollar signs .
There 's the " immediate energy rebate " - Sen. Barack Obama has proposed a rebate sequel that would send $ 1,000 to families to make up for high fuel prices .
It 's part of a plan to spend $ 50 billion to jump - start the economy .
Seniors win , too .
Renewing America 's Promise calls for eliminating income taxes for seniors who make less than $ 50,000 a year - because " every senior deserves to live out their life with dignity and respect . "
( Now they think it 's not dignified to pay taxes ? )
The draft platform promises to provide every American access to " affordable , comprehensive health care , " and to achieve " long - overdue mental health and addiction treatment parity . "
That 's right :
The Dems will expand the number of people who receive subsidized health care , provide better benefits , and you apparently do n't have to worry about costs going up .
Because the Dems are going to eliminate waste in the medical system , they " will save the typical family up to $ 2,500 per year . "
Also , under Plan DNC , " All Americans should be empowered to promote wellness . "
Tax cuts for most families .
No taxes at all for millions of seniors .
A boost in the earned income tax credit .
Plus health care for all - that saves families money .
Sound too good to be true ?
But what if you do n't have a job ?
No problem .
The platform promises to " develop innovative transitional job programs that place unemployed people into temporary jobs and train them for permanent ones . "
This draft does not reflect Obama 's and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's newfound ( if overdue ) openness to offshore oil drilling .
Ergo : " We know we can't drill our way to energy independence . "
There are the usual salutes to biofuels and plug - in hybrid cars , which should " help free us from the tyranny of oil . "
The draft platform says the Democrats can " solve the problem of $ 4 a gallon gas " - one hopes not with $ 5 a gallon gas .
And the draft pledges to make America 50 percent more energy efficient by 2030 , to make 25 percent of electricity come from renewable sources by 2025 , and they 'll double fuel efficiency standards - no date on that .
The Democratic platform would raise the child care tax credit , " provide every child access to quality , affordable early childhood education , " and double funding for after - school and summer learning programs .
Then there 's the commitment to special education and " transitional bilingual education . "
A " new American Opportunity Tax Credit " would cover the first $ 4,000 of a college education for most Americans - in exchange for which students will perform community service .
It 's a great way to create Democrats - by putting practically every college kid on the government payroll .
How to pay for all these bright packages ?
Chances are that you wo n't have to give , but only will get , get , get .
" We wo n't increase taxes on any family earning under $ 250,000 and we will offer additional tax cuts for middle - class families , " the Dems promise .
Those making more than $ 250,000 will be " asked " - " asked " ( it 's almost European ) - " to pay a bit more . "
The energy mandates will be funded " by dedicating a portion of the revenues generated by an economy - wide cap - and - trade program " on greenhouse gases .
It 's barely worthy of mention .
Then the platform promises a return to fiscal responsibility .
Really .

Israeli Roots of Hamas Are Being Exposed
by Dean Andromidas
[ PDF version of this article ]
Speaking in Jerusalem Dec. 20 , U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer made the connection between the growth of the Islamic fundamentalist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad , and Israel 's promotion of the Islamic movement as a counter to the Palestinian nationalist movement .
Kurtzer 's comments come very close to EIR 's own presentation of the evidence of Israel 's instrumental role in establishing Hamas , and its ongoing control of that organization .
Kurtzer said that the growth of the Islamic movement in the Palestinian territories in recent decades — " with the tacit support of Israel " — was " not totally unrelated " to the emergence of Hamas and Islamic Jihad and their terrorist attacks against Israel .
Kurtzer explained that during the 1980s , when the Islamic movement began to flourish in the West Bank and Gaza , " Israel perceived it to be better to have people turning toward religion rather than toward a nationalistic cause [ the Palestinian Liberation Organization —ed . ] . "
It therefore did little to stop the flow of money to mosques and other religious institutions , rather than to schools .
According to the Dec. 21 Israeli daily Ha'aretz , Kurtzer made these extraordinary statements at a seminar on religion and politics sponsored by Oz V'Shalom - Netivot Shalom , a largely Anglo - American organization that promotes peace between Israelis and Palestinians .
Rabbi Dr. Aharon Lichtenstein , the head of Har Etzion Yeshiva in Alon Shvut , who is an active advocate of a just regional peace , also spoke .
Kurtzer said that as a result of the growth of Islam at the expense of education , there are now Palestinians who are " determined terrorists that use religious beliefs in a perverted way to appeal to the masses . "
Kurtzer said that cultural and religious interaction is potentially a way to " build bridges . "
But instead , " the perverted use of religion in the region is today becoming one of the great challenges for the years ahead . "
He said that there is no " inherent component " in Islam that advocates violence .
But one of the five principles of Islam , jihad — resistance — " in classic religious associations connotes religious belief and fervor , not violence . "
But extremists have distorted the meaning of jihad , so it now has a connotation of violence in the service of a religious purpose .
The Enemy of My Enemy Is My Friend
This statement is extraordinary given the fact that Kurtzer is a very senior diplomat , having held the post of Ambassador to Egypt just prior to going on to Tel Aviv .
He is also an Orthodox Jew who is not shy of criticizing the extreme anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic views held by certain Arab circles .
But Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon rarely grants the United States ' highest representative in Israel an official audience .
The ambassador 's comments are an acknowledgment of what any serious Middle East observers knows : Hamas has always been seen as a tool by which Israel could undermine the nationalist movement led by Palestinian Authority President and Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) Chairman Yasser Arafat .
Similar statements by Arafat have been dismissed by Israel as " cranky " propaganda .
In an interview with the Dec. 11 Italian daily Corriere della Sera , Arafat said , " We are doing everything to stop the violence .
But Hamas is a creature of Israel which at the time of Prime Minister [ Yitzhak ]
Shamir [ the late 1980s , when Hamas arose ] , gave them money and more than 700 institutions , among them schools , universities and mosques .
Even [ former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak ]
Rabin ended up admitting it , when I charged him with it , in the presence of [ Egpytian President Hosni ] Mubarak . "
To the Italian daily L'Espresso , Arafat laid out the reasons for this support .
" Hamas was constituted with the support of Israel .
The aim was to create an organization antagonistic to the PLO .
They received financing and training from Israel .
They have continued to benefit from permits and authorizations , while we have been limited , even to build a tomato factory .
Rabin himself defined it as a fatal error .
Some collaborationists of Israel are involved in these [ terror ] attacks , " he said .
" We have proof , and we are placing it at the disposal of the Italian government . "
On one level the support for Hamas is simply the application of the old saying , " The enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
Indeed , in the minds of crude Israeli ultra-nationalists and fascists such as Sharon and his faction , this is indeed the case .
Sharon is not interested in peace and therefore is not concerned that the violence and needless deaths of Israelis and Palestinians continue .
In the Jan. 3 Ha'aretz , Yossi Sarid , chairman of the Meretz party , wrote , " What does frighten Sharon ... is any prospect or sign of calm or moderation .
If the situation were to calm down and stabilize , Sharon would have to return to the negotiating table and , in the wake of pressure from within and without , he would have to raise serious proposals for an agreement .
This moment terrifies Sharon and he wants to put it off for as long as he possibly can . "
In contrast , Sarid said that Sharon understands " that the terrorists and those who give them asylum are not the real enemies .
Instead , the real enemies are the moderates ....
You fight terrorists — a pretty simple operation — but you must talk with moderates , and this is a very tricky , if not dangerous , business . "
More important for the survival of not only the Palestinian people , but especially Israel itself , is the dangerous role of the puppetmasters outside the region , who are manipulating both sides of this deadly game as part of their own demonic plans to spread the policy of a " clash of civilizations . "
In this regard , Sharon , and his " Greater Israel " policy , is just as much a puppet as the Palestinian , strapped with explosives , who blows himself up at an Israeli bus station .
Two Decades of Undermining Arafat
Given the level of control that the Israeli intelligence services such as the Shin Bet and Mossad have been able to exert over the Palestinian territories during the last 35 years of Israeli occupation , the capability to manipulate militant and violent organizations , such as those associated with Hamas , should not surprise anyone familiar with intelligence and even routine police operations .
This should be obvious , considering that Israel has routinely recruited thousands of collaborators and provocateurs among the tens of thousands of Palestinians who have passed through Israeli prisons in over 35 years of its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Most convincing is a comparison of the development of Hamas , Islamic Jihad and their antecedents , and the growing national and international legitimacy of the PLO and its undisputed leader , Arafat .
Hamas is an acronym for Harafat al - Muqawama Al - Islamiyya , or Islamic Resistance Movement .
Its spiritual leader is Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , who , despite his fiery anti-Israeli sermons , has had an unusual relationship with the Israeli authorities .
In 1973 , Yassin established the Islamic Association — at a time when it was Israeli policy to promote what Ambassador Kurtzer refers to as the " Islamic movement . "
One might ask :
Why should Israel promote an Islamic movement which later turns around and attacks it ?
How could the Israeli secret services be taken in by a Yassin ?
They were n't .
The simple fact is , that the stated policy of Hamas is simply the flip side of Sharon 's " Greater Israel " policy that refuses to seek a territorial compromise .
The Hamas charter in 1988 stated , " The land of Palestine has been an Islamic Waqf throughout the generations , and until the Day of Resurrection , no one can renounce it or part of it , or abandon it or part of it ....
Peace initiatives , the so - called peace initiatives , are all contraray to the beliefs of Hamas , for renouncing any part of Palestine means renouncing part of the religion . "
In this rhetoric there is no room for a state of Israel — as there is none for a state of Palestine in Sharon 's " Greater Israel . "
Israel 's Hamas relations intensified after the Arab League , in 1974 , decided to recognize Arafat and the PLO as the representatives of the Palestinian people — in effect , a government in exile .
By 1979 , top Yassin acquired an official permit from the Israeli government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin .
This coincided with the signing of the Camp David peace treaty between Israel and Egypt .
That treaty embodied detailed clauses calling for the establishment of a Palestinian Authority in the Occupied Territories , which would be the precursor for the Israeli withdrawal and the establishment of a Palestinian state .
Gen .
Ariel Sharon has been the chief proponent since this treaty was signed , of the policy of ensuring that these clauses would never be implemented .
His chosen alternatives were war in Lebanon and the expansion of the Jewish settlements in the Occupied Territories .
Sharon was helped by the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat by Anglo - American - controlled , Egypt - based Islamic terrorists .
` Policy of Strengthening Islamic Bodies '
Israeli toleration , if not initial sponsorship of the Islamic movement , has been acknowledged and well documented in Israeli sources .
In 1997 , the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies , at Tel Aviv University , published a study , " Hamas : Radical Islam In A National Struggle , " authored by Anat Kurz and Nahman Tal .
It stated that the Islamic Association , " the platform of which contained no nationalist clauses , obtained a permit from the Israeli Civil Administration in 1979 to conduct its activities .
The permit was apparently consistent with the Israeli policy of strengthening Islamic bodies as a counterweight to Palestinian nationalist groups . "
The rapid expansion of the Islamic Association led to clashes on the Palestinian University campuses in the Occupied Territories in the 1980s , betwen PLO - affiliated students and those associated with the Islamists .
This expansion was aided by the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon , where Sharon hoped to solve the " Palestinian problem " by militarily crushing the PLO — which was then based in Lebanon — and by carrying out genocide against the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living in impoverished refugee camps in Lebanon .
Despite his orchestration of the massacre of thousands of Palestinians , including women and children , at the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps , Sharon failed to eliminate Arafat .
Nonetheless , Arafat and the PLO were exiled to Tunisia , their influence severely weakened .
Sheikh Yassin , along with other Hamas leaders , was arrested in 1984 , after it was discovered that the Islamic Association had maintained arms caches .
But the organization was not banned .
In fact , Yassin was soon released as part of an unprecedented prisoner exchange between Israel and Ahmed Jabril 's PFLP - General Command .
This deal , made with one of the most violent of all anti-PLO Palestinian groups at the time , was made in a period when the Mossad was busy assassinating the most moderate of PLO leaders .
Then , in 1988 , the Islamic Association created Hamas as a direct alternative to the PLO , which had launched the first Intifada the year before .
1988 was also important because the PLO , at the 19th Conference of the Palestinian National Council in Algeria in 1988 , accepted the United Nations Security Council resolution of 1947 calling for two states in Palestine .
They also called for convening an international peace conference based on UN Resolutions 242 and 338 , which established the land - for - peace concept .
This was a de facto recognition of Israel by the PLO and Arafat .
By the end of 1988 , the Reagan Administration extended official recognition to the PLO as the official representative of the Palestinian people .
When Palestinian leader Abu Jihad began negotiating with Hamas , in an attempt to win its mass base over to the new policy , he was promptly assassinated by the Mossad .
Yassin , as all senior leaders of Hamas , is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , the far - flung international Islamic organization with operations throughout the Islamic world .
In the past , Anglo - American factions have not hesitated to manipulate the Brotherhood 's various factions to destabilize secular Arab regimes .
When Zbigniew Brzezinski launched the Afghan war against Russia in the 1980s , many of the Arab mujahideen fighters were recruited through Muslim Brotherhood - linked networks .
The Muslim Brotherhood story fills volumes ; the crucial point here is that Hamas , one of its branches , has traditionally stood in opposition to the secular nationalism of Arafat , the PLO , and its supporting governments .
Hamas has a peculiar organizational structure which contrasts sharply with that of the PLO .
While within the West Bank and Gaza , Hamas exists as a broad political movement , its militant wings , the Izza - Din Al Qassam and Islamic Jihad , split - offs from the organization , are administered totally separately .
These latter organizations , which are responsible for the attacks , are under the control of leaders who operate from abroad .
Their offices are in London , where the group 's magazine , Falatin Al Muslimah , is based ; Jordan ; Syria ; and the United States , particularly in Virginia and Texas .
Although Arafat has periodically tried to bring the popular base of Hamas into the Palestinian fold , the foreign - based military leadership has always opposed him .
This bifurcation dovetails with Sharon 's strategy of launching brutal attacks against Hamas targets , in order to elicit the equally brutal response from Islamic Jihad and the Izza - Din Al Qassam .
Thus Arafat , and diplomatic goals , are undermined , and the fires of civil war within the Occupied Territories are stoked .
The Anti-Oslo Terror Campaign Begins
The Oslo Accords marked the first glimmer of hope for a resolution of the Middle East conflict .
And , the first suicide terrorist attack aimed at destroying it was not launched by Hamas or Islamic Jihad or another Palestinian faction .
The first suicide attack was launched on Feb. 25 , 1994 , by Israeli terrorist Baruch Goldstein , when he entered the Mosque of Hebron and killed 50 Muslim worshippers as well as himself .
Goldstein was a member of Kach , the terrorist organization founded by the late Meir Kahane , who also founded the Jewish Defense League in the 1960s in the United States .
Kach , which is well connected to Sharon , is on the official U.S. State Department list of terrorist organizations .
The unprecedented massacre was calculated to set the stage for a suicide bombing campaign by Hamas and its split - off , Islamic Jihad , over the next year .
In fact , it set into motion the " cycle of violence " that has yet to end .
The Goldstein attack came at precisely the point when Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and Arafat began the formal implementation of the Oslo agreement which envisioned the establishment of a Palestinian state by 1998 .
The first Hamas - linked suicide attacks did not start until two months later , in April 1994 , when Rabin and Arafat signed the agreement for the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority .
The agreement called for the conduct of free elections throughout the territories — which would eventually establish the international legitimacy of the Arafat - led government .
But despite this terror campaign , which lasted for months under a massive crackdown by Arafat 's security forces , the Rabin - Arafat alliance , although seriously weakened , was not broken .
This alliance was finally broken with Rabin 's assassination by an Israeli , on Nov. 5 , 1995 .
The next phase of attacks followed the " targetted assassination " of Hamas bomb - maker Yahya Ayyash on Jan. 5 , 1996 .
Although said to be " revenge attacks , " they were in fact part of Hamas ' campaign to get Benjamin Netanyahu elected Israeli prime minister .
This was admitted by Ibraham Ghawshah , Hamas ' official spokesman resident in Amman , Jordan .
He said that it was part of their strategy to influence Israeli public opinon to bring down the entire Oslo process .
The election of Netanyahu indeed fulfilled all their hopes , especially after he launched his own provocations , which not only brought about the pre-calculated Hamas response , but also brought the region several times to the brink of war .
This tit - for - tat campaign reached the height of insanity when Netanyahu , under the direction of Sharon , who was a member of his government at the time , launched a Mossad assassination attempt in 1997 against the Jordan - based Hamas official Khalid Mishaal .
Not only did the attempt fail , but it led to Israel agreeing to release Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Yassin from an Israeli jail , where he had been under arrest since 1989 .
Yassin was allowed to return to Gaza to rally Hamas against the Oslo process in general , and Arafat in particular .
This pattern has continued to this very day .
Netanyahu 's downfall in 1999 led to the short - lived government of Ehud Barak , who despite much talking and negotiating , furthered the Oslo process not one iota .
By the end of the Summer of 2000 , the stage was set for Sharon 's ultimate provocation , his Sept. 28 march on to the Islamic holy site Al - Haram Al - Sharif / Temple Mount .
Since coming to power , Sharon has done everything to ensure the collapse of Arafat and the Palestinian Authority .
If successful , it would either bring Hamas to power or lead to political chaos within the terrorities .
No one can dispute that oil companies are doing really well .
And certainly no one can dispute that gas prices are high .
But is the connection as straightforward as the article suggests ?
If the oil companies were less greedy , would we see lower prices as the pump ?
But instead of sharing the pain , they appear to be moving to squeeze every cent they can out of the crisis .
Make no mistake :
These corporations should be able to absorb a hit .
Over the past year and a half , the four largest oil companies — ExxonMobil , ChevronTexaco , Royal Dutch / Shell Group and BP Group PLC — have pocketed close to $ 100 billion in profits .
During the first quarter of 2005 alone , those firms pulled in a cool $ 23 billion .
There 's been some grumbling in the media about how Big Oil is gouging the public by charging record prices for gas while they reap record profits .
For example , this article from The Nation says
Oil companies sell to refineries
Not all oil companies own refining companies .
In fact , a very few actually own their refineries .
They just find , drill and produce crude which they sell on the NYMEX or other markets , to refiners .
A refiner can take crude from anybody — Exxon from Shell , Chevron from BP , etc .
Refineries sell to distributors
This means that an Exxon refinery can sell gasoline to a Shell distributor .
The distributor chooses where to buy his products from .
Naturally , Shell Oil Refining would offer a Shell Distributor a pretty discounted price , but not necessarily the lowest he might find .
Thus distributors can buy from anybody and sell to anybody , regardless of their " affiliation " with a given oil company .
A distributor may be an " Authorized Chevron Distributor " , and thus he can sell Techron type gasoline .
But that does n't mean he is restricted to just selling Chevron products .
Independent distributors ( more of them than any other type ) are listed in the Yellow Pages under Fuel Companies or Fuel Distributors .
These are the middlemen .
Distributors sell to retailers
These independents actually buy gas from whoever they get the best deal from , then sell it to their customers .
If you have ever wondered why there is an Exxon tanker filling up a Fina gas station tank , it is because the distributor is an Exxon affiliate , but the Fina station owner got a better deal from Exxon than from Fina .
This happens all the time .
Distributors also sell grease and transmission fluid and hydraulic fluid and motor oil to industry .
You can often see distributors trucks servicing construction sites or businesses operating a fleet of vehicles .
Retailers can buy whatever they want from whoever they can get the best price !
These corporations are usually very divorced from the nuts and bolts of oil companies , that focus on retailing gasoline and convenience store operation .
The retail chain may be a Shell - owned convenience store , supplied by a Shell affiliated distributor , but he ( distributor ) may buy his oil from Murphy Oil Refining .
So while the buyer thinks he is getting Shell gasoline , what he is getting is gasoline from a Shell Distributor , but produced by Murphy Oil Refining .
I have loosely used Big Oil Company names here to make a point .
However , many of the big guys keep a close reign on their distributors .
But that does not preclude them selling whatever they want to independent retailers , like Samir 's Quicky Mart .
Thus unless a gasoline has a patented ingredient ( like Techron ) or other additive , it will not necessarily wind up being sold by the affiliate retailer .
And we have n't even gotten to supply contracts yet , which further complicate things .
At every level of these distribution chains , people are trying to buy low and sell high .
This is extremely confusing for everybody , but it is the way it works .
But if you keep this in mind — oil companies sell to refiners — you can quickly see why oil companies get pissed when the finger pointing starts .
My opinion is that the gouging , if any , is going on at a very local level , no higher up than the local gasoline distributors .
The most opportunistic way to maximize your cash would be to buy this week 's gasoline for $ 2.50 a gallon , and then if something ( like high oil prices ) allows you to , mark this shipment of $ 2.50 gas up to $ 3.00 .
[ Keep in mind that some states regulate the maximum profit on a gallon of gas . ]
Normally gas markup is about a nickel a gallon or such .
The convenience store makes much more on food — the gasoline is the draw to get them into the store to buy cigarettes or candy or a coke , which have much higher profit margins .
The people who control the final price at the pump are the retailing companies or independent store owners .
And these guys are more than happy to put it off on the oil companies , as they are very removed from them !
I know — as clear as mud .
But it is the " free economy " at work ...
Because the wells they are producing from today were drilled in past years , where they used $ 15 - 25 per barrel as their estimated selling price for the oil .
Thus when the market got tight , they have cheap oil going at a higher price .
Why ?
Simple — demand is high .
Now this higher priced oil is filtering back to them in the form of higher priced goods , so the profits decline slowly over time as higher priced energy enters the economic mill .
But right now , they are making a lot of money .
No .
Oil companies are not setting the retail price except via the NYMEX , where they sell to refiners .
When the traders run the price up , oil companies naturally win .
But the crude price is set by market demand i.e. , what will they pay today ?
Now , rather than actually figure this out for ourselves , the TOD editors conducted a brief email interview with a TOD reader that works in the oil industry .
He explained that in order to answer these questions , you have to understand the path that oil takes from the ground to your gas tank .
" Oil companies sell to refiners .
Refiners sell to distributors .
Distributors sell to retailers . "
Whoa .
That 's a lot of steps .
Let 's break it down .
Summing up ... So , if there is gouging , where is it happening ?
Why are oil companies making record profits ?
So , it is not the case that oil companies are incurring high exploration costs and passing these costs onto the consumer ?
So , let 's say , very hypothetically , that Exxon Mobil wanted to make a gesture of good faith .
Could they sell the crude for cheaper in hopes of lower prices at the pump , or does the nature of the futures market and all of the middlemen make that impossible ?
